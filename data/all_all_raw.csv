Across this week's broader architecture news landscape, a central theme emerges around the advancement of civic architecture conceived as open, publicly engaged infrastructure, with cultural and institutional projects increasingly designed to strengthen their relationship with the city and everyday urban life. At the same time, renewed global attention turns toward Africa, where large-scale transport infrastructure and the conservation of modernist landmarks reflect interests in the region and the reassessment of the continent's architectural heritage. Complementing these narratives, this week's highlights also include a new model for car-free urban districts, co-designed public landscapes grounded in indigenous knowledge, and a residential development responding to regional context, reflecting how architecture is negotiating public space, civic responsibility, and territorial identity across diverse geographies.</p>",

<h4>Why government keeps forcing uncertainty through systems designed for stability — and what an alternative might look like</h4><p>In a previous article, I argued that<a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/p/unfit-for-uncertainty-rethinking""> the UK government is structurally unfit for uncertainty</a> — taking 21st-century challenges, evaluating them with 20th-century tools, and responding within 19th-century institutions — built for a different time, and for different kinds of problems. And, if Labour’s<a href=""https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/""> mission-driven government</a> is to mean anything in reality, the civil service needs a new grammar of everyday decision-making: one that treats uncertainty as navigable, frames choices in terms of <em>risk and opportunity</em> rather than cost and control, and builds learning into how problems are defined and acted upon.</p><p>This piece starts where that argument ends, asking what a <em>different architecture for decision-making</em> might look like when uncertainty is high — and stability still matters. To answer it, this article explores why existing innovation efforts repeatedly collapse back into business-as-usual routines, before setting out an alternative, <em>overlaying</em> architecture for decision-making under uncertainty: one built on the premise of strength without weight and dynamic learning at its core.</p><h3>Beyond the waterfall state</h3><p>To be clear, the answer is not to burn everything down and start again. It points in a very different direction from the chainsaw, scorched-earth approach of the Elon Musks of the world. As<a href=""https://apolitical.co/communities/reimagining-public-institutions/8d06fbe0-ceab-11f0-8080-8001537bea73#1cf87f8c-d7ad-408c-a626-0640c5768499""> Andy Knight reminded me</a>, most of what government does is stewardship — and that function is indispensable. It depends on stable, convergent, waterfall prediction policymaking. It is what keeps the lights on. Literally.</p><p>But the architecture that underpins stability is not the architecture that enables transformative change. Keeping the lights on today matters — but so does ensuring they stay on in the future. Missions, systems change, and early-stage sense-making require something different: space for divergent creativity, structured exploration, and collective judgement. This is the foundation for a state that is able to work with uncertainty rather than suppress it — what Kattel, Drechsler, and Karo describe as<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/final_innovation_bureaucracies_20_dec.pdf""> agile stability</a>: the capacity to generate new directions while maintaining long-term institutional coherence.</p><p>The problem is that we continue to run all forms of decision-making — certain <em>and</em> uncertain — through the same architecture inherited from a New Public Management era, an architecture built on the assumption that if you press a button, you know something will happen — as if governing were<a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/""> a computational task with bounded rationality</a> rather than a socio-technical one. While this logic may work tolerably well for stewarding stable systems, organisations — and the world around them — are not computers. When uncertainty is high and judgement, learning, and creativity matter most, this type of computational “bounded rationality” repeatedly fails (See:<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2024/may/mission-critical-statecraft-21st-century""> Statecraft for the 21st Century</a>) leaving us with a hollowed-out version of what Charles Lindblom once described as<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/policyandsociety/article/30/1/1/6422222""> “muddling through”</a>: not pragmatic adaptation, but institutional drift in the face of uncertainty.</p><p>James Plunkett has suggested that this<a href=""https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/what-if-government-is-stuck-in-a-local-maximum-b54ad3f9dd0d""> traps government in a kind of “local maximum</a>” able to improve what it can already see, but unable to perceive or reach a wider landscape of possibility. Sophia Parker<a href=""https://sophiaparker-241.medium.com/a-larger-reality-how-governments-can-escape-the-local-maximum-d62018ec3949""> extends this argument</a>, noting that when institutions are caught “between worlds,” the familiar tools of optimisation cannot open up a larger reality — they only make us better at navigating the status quo.</p><blockquote><em>“A local maximum is a place where everything you try seems to make things a bit better, but nothing you try can make things fundamentally different” — James Plunkett</em></blockquote><p>This is precisely why the re-emergence of mission-oriented and responsible approaches to policymaking — used here as an umbrella for systems thinking, futures thinking, user-centred design, agile methods and other exploratory practices — has put the limits of the administrative system in the spotlight. Instead of becoming a routinised way of organising systemic change, missions — and the transformative methods attached to them — repeatedly collapse back into incrementalism and business-as-usual routines when they are forced through an architecture built for stability.</p><blockquote>See<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/mission_oriented_innovation_policies_in_europe_from_normative_to_epistemic_turn.pdf""> Kattel &amp; Mazzucato</a> on why missions struggle to make an epistemic turn within existing bureaucratic logics, Demos Helsinki’s “<a href=""https://demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missions-for-Governance-Demos-Helsinki.pdf"">Missions for Governance</a>” on how missions constrained by current mechanisms tend to produce only incremental improvements.</blockquote><p>So, if the architecture is the limit, the question becomes not how to replace the existing system (we rely on its stability more than we admit), but how to create an overlaying architecture that can be activated when uncertainty is high and when public value depends on exploration. Geoff Mulgan refers to this type of bureaucracy as having “<a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-158372382"">strength without weight</a>,” the ability to use institutional power without the bureaucratic drag that stifles learning — enabling decision-making supported by intelligence, curiosity and adaptability, rather than the machinery of implementation and control.</p><h3>The capabilities the state needs to work under uncertainty</h3><p>Any discussion of a second, more agile organisational architecture for navigating uncertainty and producing public value must begin with capability. Not whether an organisation has the <em>right structures</em> on paper, but whether it can learn, coordinate, and adjust as conditions change. Working under uncertainty — and delivering any form of transformative, systemic change — requires a different way of thinking about both public value and the organisational capabilities that sustain it.</p><p>First, public value cannot be treated only as an outcome delivered at the end of a policy process, or as a means-to-an-end justified through appraisal. As<a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government""> Mark Moore argues</a>, it is both an outcome and something produced through the policy process itself. Under conditions of uncertainty, the quality of these processes is not incidental;<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-public-design-evidence-review/public-design-evidence-review-literature-review-paper-2-public-value-html#how-to-define-public-value""> it is constitutive of public value</a>, shaped across an organisation’s mission, sources of legitimacy and operational capacity. Treating value as both an outcome and a process provides a practical way to judge whether particular actions are improving a situation and are worth their costs.</p><p>This shifts attention to the dynamic capabilities embedded within public organisations: the capacities that allow institutions to sense change, coordinate across boundaries and deliberately reshape resources and priorities as the environment shifts. These are not specialist innovation skills or isolated tools, but foundational capabilities <a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government"">— central to public value management</a> — that determine whether an alternative decision-making architecture can function at all.</p><p>This aligns closely with work on<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/""> <em>Human Learning Systems</em></a>, which frames outcomes as emergent properties of complex systems and treats learning, adaptation and relationship-building not as phases of reform, but as the core work of public management under complexity.</p><p>This is where the Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose’s<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2022/mar/dynamic-capabilities-public-sector-towards-new-synthesis""> work on dynamic capabilities</a> is particularly useful. For this discussion, it helps clarify both what decision-making under uncertainty requires and why so many innovation efforts struggle to influence practice. Three dynamic capabilities are especially relevant here:</p><ul><li><strong>Sense-making:</strong> the ability to scan an environment, surface weak signals, and develop shared interpretations of what is happening and why. This is not about better forecasting or more data, but about collective orientation when evidence is partial, contested, or evolving.</li><li><strong>Connecting:</strong> the capacity to coordinate across organisational, disciplinary, and sectoral boundaries. Under uncertainty, no single team or function holds the full picture. Effective decision-making depends on integrating different forms of knowledge and negotiating trade-offs across silos that were never designed to meet.</li><li><strong>Shaping:</strong> the ability to reconfigure priorities, resources, and routines in response to what is being learned. Without this capability, insight accumulates but decisions remain locked in — learning exists, but it has no leverage.</li></ul><p>Taken together, these capabilities frame public value as something produced <em>through</em> decision-making itself (or<a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government""> “strategic management”</a> if you would rather). How problems are framed, whose knowledge is included, when commitments are made, and whether learning is allowed to alter direction all shape whether public value is created — or quietly eroded.</p><h3>Why innovation efforts collapse back into business as usual</h3><p>The difficulty is not a lack of innovation activity, it’s where that activity sits relative to how decisions are actually made. Uncertainty demands dynamic capabilities such as sense-making, connecting, and shaping. Yet, most public-sector decision-making architectures are designed to steward stable systems, not to navigate contested, evolving or genuinely new ones. This creates a structural mismatch where even when teams attempt to work differently — through experimentation, design or mission-led approaches — the surrounding architecture pulls decision-making back towards certainty.</p><p>Public Digital’s<a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how""> The Radical How</a> illustrates this issue. In the dominant waterfall model of policymaking, the most consequential decisions are made upfront — precisely when uncertainty is highest — while learning arrives later, once direction has already been fixed. The process follows a familiar pattern: <strong><em>Write policy → guess requirements → procure IT systems → Inflict on users at scale → operate indefinitely.</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eFXc3Zpnftr_W-NR.png"" /><figcaption>Waterfall-style programmes start with many risky assumptions (<a href=""https://d1rnadml6vbx0i.cloudfront.net/Public-Digital_The-Radical-How.pdf"">The Radical How</a>, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Seen through this lens, learning is systematically pushed downstream, when its capacity to shape outcomes is weakest. Innovation efforts are not failing because they lack ambition or quality, but because they are layered <em>onto</em> an architecture that is structurally hostile to uncertainty.</p><p>This pattern repeats across governments. New methods are introduced, capabilities are developed, and insights are generated — but only <em>after</em> the moments when direction is set, resources committed, and alternatives foreclosed. The result is activity without leverage: innovation that is visible and energetic, but ultimately powerless.</p><p>Three examples help bring this structural mismatch to life.</p><ol><li><strong>Policy Labs</strong></li></ol><p>Policy labs are among the most significant attempts to embed learning into policymaking through user-centred and systems perspectives. They are designed to intercept policy ideas early and improve decision quality (see<a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2021.1883834""> Anna Whicher</a> on the evolution of Policy Labs in the UK). In capability terms, labs are particularly strong at sensemaking in many ways. A large part of my own work is surfacing lived experiences, identifying risks and challenging the assumptions of policy teams while at the same time bringing together multidisciplinary actors who would not normally work together and creating relational infrastructure across policy and delivery siloes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n1BImJe4q3SJUECH.png"" /><figcaption>Policy Labs embed agile learning after decisions have been made</figcaption></figure><p>The problem, however, is not <em>what</em> labs do, but <em>when</em> they are able to do it. Within the existing decision-making architecture, the moments when assumptions can genuinely be challenged are tightly constrained. Policy labs rarely control the decision gates where commitments are made, budgets locked in or political capital spent. Their insights enter policy processes already moving toward closure. Learning exists, but it arrives downstream of power.</p><p>As a result, insight is absorbed rather than acted upon — often filed away in the proverbial “policy drawer” while assumptions remain untested. Labs generate understanding, but without authority to reopen decisions, that understanding struggles to shape outcomes.</p><p><strong>2. Technology-centric or challenge-driven funding</strong></p><p>Technology programmes and challenge-driven funds apply shaping pressure differently. They create momentum around emerging technologies and capabilities, directing attention, investment, and experimentation towards what <em>might</em> be possible. In doing so, they generate valuable insight into technical feasibility and future options — often through pilots, prototypes, and partnerships that test new approaches in practice.</p><p>This activity frequently supports sense-making as well — imagining new uses of AI, automation, or data at scale, and expanding the perceived solution space.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KvUr5gH0dFZJEfMh.png"" /><figcaption>Technology and challenge-driven funds struggle to diffuse into the decision-making system</figcaption></figure><p>The problem is not the quality of this learning, but its <strong>position</strong> in the decision-making system and who it involves. Insights generated through challenge funds rarely travel upstream into everyday policy work. Policy teams struggle to access or apply what has been learned — not through resistance or lack of interest, but because there are few institutional pathways for the diffusion of knowledge.</p><p>As a result, innovation happens <em>around</em> the policy system rather than <em>within</em> it — shaping the environment without reshaping the decisions that govern it. Insight accumulates, but without leverage where it matters most (see my note on the frustration of AI pilots<a href=""https://substack.com/@jackstrachan/note/c-164601193""> here</a>).</p><p><strong>3. Generalist training, hackathons and experimentation initiatives</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most compressed illustration of the problem comes from generalist training programmes, hackathons, and short-term experimentation initiatives. These are designed to introduce brief moments of learning and collaboration — short bursts of sense-making and connecting — often framed as ways of normalising experimental decision-making.</p><p>Yet, in practice, they frequently do the opposite. Because these initiatives are time-bound, performative and disconnected from approval, commissioning and resource-allocation processes, their outputs struggle to survive contact with existing governance routines. What is learned rarely reshapes decisions; instead, participants return to an architecture that rewards certainty, compliance, and delivery over adaptation. It is often theatre over substance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zYFSfCbZgnPcu8j5.png"" /><figcaption>Generalist training, hackathons and sandboxes are often isolated occasions of theatre</figcaption></figure><p>Viewed in isolation, these initiatives can appear valuable. Participants report insight, energy, and motivation. But because they sit outside the moments where commitments are made, they offer no sustained pathway for learning to translate into public value.</p><p>This is not a failure of individuals or intent. It reflects a deeper structural issue. When learning is experienced as an exception rather than a condition of everyday decision-making, it is easily dismissed as “interesting but unrealistic.” Without repeated, consequential exposure to uncertainty — where learning genuinely alters direction — counter-intuitive ways of working struggle to stick.</p><p><strong>Across each of these examples, the same pattern repeats.</strong></p><p>Learning happens, but too late. Insight accumulates, but without leverage. Innovation is active, but powerless.</p><p>Seen through the waterfall architecture, this is not surprising. These mechanisms are attempting to introduce uncertainty, exploration, and adaptation into a system designed to eliminate them as early as possible. This is why mission-oriented approaches, design methods, and experimental practices so often collapse back into incrementalism: they are forced to operate <em>after</em> direction is set, resources committed, and alternatives foreclosed.</p><p>This is not a capability problem. It is an architectural one. Until the conditions exist for sense-making, connecting, and shaping to influence decisions <em>when they matter most</em>, innovation efforts will remain episodic and low-impact. Which leads to the next question: what would an alternative — <em>complementary — </em>decision-making architecture need to look like?</p><h3>An alternative (mission-driven) decision-making architecture</h3><p>Rather than replacing existing policymaking systems, this section sets out an overlaying decision-making architecture designed for moments of uncertainty. Drawing on Vinnova’s<a href=""https://www.vinnova.se/en/publications/mission-oriented-innovation---a-handbook-from-vinnova/""> mission-design framework</a> — and learning from the UK Government Digital Service’s<a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/01/a-year-in-the-making-the-digital-by-default-service-standard/""> agile delivery model for digital services</a> — the model below translates these insights into a participatory decision-making architecture for moments of uncertainty. Its purpose is not to generate <em>better</em> analysis, but to change how <em>direction, commitment, and resourcing decisions are formed</em> by deliberately activating the dynamic capabilities discussed earlier: sense-making, connecting, and shaping.</p><p>Put simply, this architecture embeds learning <em>throughout</em> the policy design and delivery process, rather than treating it as something that arrives after key decisions have already been made.</p><p>This architecture rests on four principles.</p><ol><li><strong>Conditional, not universal: </strong>It is activated only where uncertainty is high and stakes are systemic — not as a default mode of governance.</li><li><strong>Triggered by uncertainty, not default:</strong> It complements, rather than competes with, existing stewardship systems.</li><li><strong>Relational and procedural, not structural:</strong> it works through roles, practices and decision rights, not new hierarchies. This means a focus on making stakeholders active participants of the design process.</li><li><strong>Time-bound and reversible:</strong> Its purpose is to resolve uncertainty, not institutionalise exploration indefinitely. Results matter.</li></ol><p>Critically, it also depends on what Dan Hill describes as<a href=""https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57a""> <em>“soft eyes”</em></a>: the capacity to observe and work with the dark matter of bureaucracy — the informal relationships, tacit norms and interdependencies that sit between teams, directorates and policy domains. Without this, attempts to engage uncertainty are either blocked by premature certainty or absorbed back into business-as-usual routines before they can influence decisions.</p><p>This is not an abstract sensibility either. Variants of this capability have been articulated over the past decade through relational practices such as<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-do-we-mean-relational-services-dennis-vergne-fq9he/?trackingId=ovP%2BQ3INid7UUUDxmYDavQ%3D%3D""> Relational Service Design</a>,<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/""> Human Learning Systems</a>, Dark Matter Lab’s<a href=""https://freight.cargo.site/m/Q2581255008246565147592803666662/Governing-Together-MASTER-DECK-September-2025-v6.pdf""> Governing Together</a>, and the<a href=""https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344""> TEAL movement</a>, which foreground trust, continuity, and institutional relationships as core operating conditions rather than delivery-side effects. The challenge is not their absence, but their marginal position relative to where decisions are actually made.</p><p>What follows sets out how this overlaying architecture works in practice: the stages it moves through, the capabilities it embeds, and how it interfaces with the state’s existing delivery and stewardship machinery.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LSRj1lPPAt4Y84RE.png"" /><figcaption>An overlaying decision-making architecture</figcaption></figure><p>At a high level, the architecture is organised around four overlapping learning loops. These are not phases or stage gates. They are modes of work that structure how learning, judgement, and commitment evolve under uncertainty. What distinguishes this model from familiar innovation or design frameworks is not the loops themselves, but where decision authority and resource commitment sit within them.</p><p>The flow follows Vinnova’s mission-design framework, moving from <strong>Angles → Missions → Prototypes → Demonstrators</strong>, progressively reducing uncertainty while keeping direction open for as long as possible.</p><h3>A. Angles: orienting the system</h3><p>The Angles loop focuses on collectively developing an initial view of the system: identifying where uncertainty lies, what matters, and where intervention might be possible.</p><p>Rather than jumping to solutions, this loop brings a core group together to surface <em>different ways of seeing the problem space</em>. It deliberately draws together a trans-disciplinary team of policy, operational, user, technical, and political perspectives to build a shared orientation to the system as it is experienced, not just described.</p><p>The emphasis here is on sense-making and connecting. The output is not a strategy or recommendation, but a set of <em>plausible directions</em> — angles of intervention worth exploring further.</p><h3>B. Missions: committing to direction</h3><p>The Missions loop translates the most promising angles into statements of intent and design principles. These articulate <em>what kind of change is being pursued and why</em>, without prematurely specifying how it will be delivered. Design principles matter because they act as decision constraints under uncertainty — a function<a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/12/10/designing-public-services-that-work-for-everyone/""> GDS has long used to align teams</a> without over-specifying solutions.</p><p>At this point, connecting remains central — aligning actors around a shared purpose — while shaping begins to matter more. Missions create directionality by setting boundaries, clarifying intent, and establishing criteria for learning in the next stages.</p><p>Crucially, missions are treated as provisional commitments. They are strong enough to mobilise action, but flexible enough to adapt as learning accumulates. Their role is not to close down debate, but to focus it — similar to<a href=""https://futurestatedesign.co/futurestate-design""> futurestate strategy</a> or<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/stakeholder_engagement_for_policy_design_planning.pdf""> strategic foresight practices</a>.</p><h3>C. Prototypes: learning through tangible commitments</h3><p>The Prototypes loop explores missions through a portfolio of concrete experiments — policy, service, regulatory, or organisational — designed to test assumptions and surface consequences.</p><p>Prototypes are decision-shaping commitments: deliberately designed to inform judgement about whether, how, and where to scale. Multiple prototypes ask different questions, reducing uncertainty through comparison rather than consensus. Vinnova’s<a href=""https://arkdes.se/en/projects/street-moves/""> <em>Street Moves</em></a> programme is a good example: place-based experiments used not as pilots, but as learning devices.</p><p>Here, connecting and shaping are tightly coupled. Prototypes act as boundary objects, aligning actors, mobilising resources and enabling learning through doing. The emphasis is not speed for its own sake, but efficiency: learning as much as possible for the least irreversible cost. Or, in Public Digital’s “<a href=""https://d1rnadml6vbx0i.cloudfront.net/Public-Digital_The-Radical-How.pdf"">The Radical How”</a> terms: doing whatever it takes to speed up the loop of testing the things that matter the most and learning from the results.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/966/0*pj4BbouEHOw6rmkz.png"" /><figcaption>Agile learning. The Radical How, 2024.</figcaption></figure><h3>D. Demonstrators: integrating learning at scale</h3><p>The Demonstrators loop brings together insights from multiple prototypes into large-scale system demonstrations. These are not end states; they are decision-shaping devices. Their purpose is to determine whether uncertainty has been reduced <em>enough</em> to re-enter the state’s core delivery and stewardship architecture.</p><p>Here, sense-making resurfaces, alongside continued connecting and shaping, as priorities and resources are adjusted in response to what has been learned. Demonstrators help decision-makers see how interventions interact at scale before irreversible commitments are made. At this point, work can deliberately transition from exploratory modes into more stable delivery pathways — moving from adaptive learning to reliable execution.</p><h3>Switching modes</h3><p>At this point, I want to stress that this proposed second architecture is conditional, not universal. It is activated only when uncertainty is high — when outcomes cannot be reliably predicted, causal pathways are contested, and early lock-in would be costly or irreversible. It’s about introducing a dynamic learning process so that the state can <em>return</em> to its stable delivery architecture once uncertainty has been reduced.</p><p>When activated, several conditions matter:</p><ul><li>decision authority must sit close to the work</li><li>learning must have formal routes into commitment and resourcing</li><li>participation must include those affected, not only those accountable</li><li>exit conditions must be explicit</li></ul><p>The intent is not to weaken the state’s capacity for delivery, but to protect it by ensuring that stability is not achieved at the cost of learning, and that exploration does not become detached from power. In other words, this is not about replacing the machinery that keeps the lights on. It is about creating the conditions under which the state can <em>decide differently when it needs to</em> — and then return, deliberately, to what it already does well.</p><h3>Preparing the ground: agile team models when working under uncertainty</h3><p>Transformative change starts by <em>preparing the ground</em>: creating the conditions for a small, multidisciplinary team to work differently, with political cover, protected space, and the authority to bypass routine constraints long enough to prove what is possible. This was true of the early Government Digital Service in 2011, and it remains true of any attempt to change how the state decides under uncertainty.</p><p>Fundamentally, if we expect teams to sense, connect, and shape under uncertainty, we cannot treat them as interchangeable delivery units. Different phases of decision-making require different, malleable team purposes and archetypes that evolve as uncertainty reduces.</p><p>Kate Tarling’s work on<a href=""https://www.theserviceorg.com/""> service organisations</a> is useful here. Rather than assuming static “agile teams,” she shows how teams shift over time: from exploratory, functional groupings with hand-offs, towards whole teams responsible for delivering and improving joined-up services. She stresses that hand-offs are not inherently problematic but they are often necessary early on — with problems arising when teams are <em>locked</em> into a structure that no longer matches the nature of the work and are forced into incompatible handovers.</p><p>It is therefore more helpful to think in terms of complementary team types, rather than a single ideal form. Drawing loosely on team typologies developed by<a href=""https://teamtopologies.com/book""> Skelton and Pais</a> (and Tarling), a mission-driven architecture typically relies on a portfolio of teams with distinct roles:</p><ul><li><strong>Service teams</strong> are responsible for delivering and improving outcomes for users and operations.</li><li><strong>Depth teams</strong>, which explore complex issues, generate insight and reduce uncertainty on behalf of others.</li><li><strong>Common-capability teams</strong>, which build shared tools, platforms, and processes that make learning and delivery easier.</li><li><strong>Enabling teams</strong>, which unblock, coach, and support other teams to adopt new ways of working.</li><li><strong>Coordinating teams</strong>, which align activity across services or missions when interdependencies are high.</li><li><strong>Operational teams</strong>, which steward stable systems and deliver continuity over time.</li></ul><p>Crucially, these teams do not all operate in the same way, nor at the same time. Early in the lifecycle of a mission — when uncertainty is highest — depth, enabling, and coordinating teams play a larger role in sense-making and connecting. As direction stabilises and uncertainty reduces, service and operational teams take on greater responsibility for shaping and delivery.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mue1QZS_TrhSJKpp.png"" /><figcaption>Different types of decision-making demand different types of teams</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*12rV9jFOQ7-1YVOL.png"" /><figcaption>Team types, roles and sizes are malleable to the context of the decision</figcaption></figure><p>Seen this way, team models are not an implementation detail, but a core part of the decision-making architecture. Without the right mix of teams — and the ability for them to change as conditions change — even well-designed missions will struggle to move from exploration to impact.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The world is not a machine where, if you pull a policy lever, something will happen. Reconnecting policymaking with this reality means moving beyond top-down, disconnected approaches and towards a decision-making architecture that treats uncertainty as something to be worked with, not engineered away. One that embeds learning, judgement, and adaptation into how direction is set — without sacrificing the stability the state depends on. What’s required is <em>strength without weight.</em> The ability to do the hard things well, while remaining flexible enough to change when conditions demand it.</p><p>I want to be clear about what this piece is — and is not. It’s not a story of pessimism, nor a claim that the government lacks innovation or intent. Quite the opposite. There is a great deal of thoughtful, committed work happening across UK government and beyond (See:<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/77/4/837/7729221?login=false""> The state of British policymaking: How can UK government become more effective</a>). This is an attempt to frame those efforts — through theory and lived experience — in a way that surfaces a deeper constraint: not ambition or capability, but the architectures through which decisions are made.</p><p>This article is not <em>the</em> answer either. The critique, and the model that follows it, could easily be read as two-dimensional: one person diagnosing a system and proposing a cleaner alternative. That reading misses the point. The issue is not a shortage of models for change. It’s that institutions <a href=""https://demos.co.uk/research/the-human-handbrake-how-whitehall-culture-holds-back-public-service-reform/"">— Whitehall included</a> — often convince themselves they are uniquely resistant to new ways of doing, while continuing to route uncertainty through systems designed to suppress it.</p><p>This is as much a cultural challenge as a structural one. Work on systems change reminds us that transformation rarely follows linear cause-and-effect pathways. It emerges through overlapping activity, partial learning and shifting coalitions over time. For those of us working inside the government, that means holding multiple perspectives at once: staying curious, working across boundaries, and treating thinking itself as a form of action — something that shapes what becomes possible next.</p><p>Much of what I’ve drawn on here builds on existing ground: the early work of Government Digital Service, mission-oriented innovation frameworks, action-based approaches to social change, and emerging practices around Human Learning Systems and other relational practices. The open questions, for me, are less about invention than application. How do these principles actually reshape decision-making at scale? What role does digital play — not as infrastructure alone, but as an enabler of learning, coordination and judgement? Have we laid the horizontal foundations for a third era of digital governance, or are we still struggling to move beyond enterprise-era assumptions?</p><p>Those are questions for another time.</p><h3>Next steps…</h3><p>As with most of my writing on substack, this is thinking-as-writing rather than a finished argument. It’s an attempt to synthesise lived experience wrestle with the ideas and practices I’ve been immersed in over the past few years, to see whether they hold together. It’s written as self-provocations, loose ends, tensions and partial conclusions — that’s part of the point for me.</p><p>For now though, this thinking is feeding directly into my own work at HM Revenue &amp; Customs where I’m currently leading a review of our internal <em>Budget Policy Starter</em> technology-impacting process by working with policymakers, solution architects, cost engineers and user-centred designers to better bridge stable and agile ways of working — and, in doing so, improve how policy decisions are shaped upstream so they serve citizens more effectively downstream.</p><p><em>This post is part of </em><a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/""><em>CIVICWORKS</em></a><em>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d81fadb93106"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/beyond-the-waterfall-state-why-missions-need-a-different-decision-making-architecture-d81fadb93106"">Beyond the waterfall state: why missions need a different decision-making architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Discuss children’s preference on avatar design</h4><figure><img alt=""a white board with three quick sketches on it: doll, human face, and giraffe"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3UX4wIsuV9HFPyR68K1AnA.png"" /><figcaption>Image created by AI tool ElevenLabs</figcaption></figure><p>As a developer in a children’s hospital, I’ve designed some playful VR simulations for young patients. We try to avoid serious medical settings because there are still concerns about using VR in serious clinical contexts. Instead, we use VR in two main ways: making tedious treatments more engaging through gamification, and providing distraction during painful moments. It’s become pretty common, and it’s effective.</p><p>But when these simulations need avatars, there’s always that one question: <strong>What should they look like? </strong>An animal character? A cartoon character? Another human?</p><p>This matters more than you’d think. In VR, kids’ emotions intensify. They’re still figuring out what’s real and what’s not, so getting the details wrong can cause real confusion and discomfort.</p><p>Here’s what I learned from the research:</p><h3>Not too real, not too fake</h3><p><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3544548.3581501"">Research </a>tested three VR avatars with kids: a human, a giraffe, and a Muppet. I thought the Muppet would win because it’s cute (well, I think so) and familiar to kids.</p><p>The giraffe won.</p><figure><img alt=""sad Elmo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/753/1*fSqwbDbYH8_Mi8K7xic8Bg.png"" /><figcaption>Sad Elmo (<a href=""https://tenor.com/view/fairysoobs-elmo-sad-elmo-sad-stare-gif-26846922"">image source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Researchers think <strong>social realism</strong> is one reason. Social realism means how closely something matches what kids experience in real life. A human has high social realism (kids see humans daily). A giraffe has moderate social realism (it exists, but kids don’t encounter one up close). A Muppet has low social realism (it’s a fantastical TV character, not a living being).</p><figure><img alt=""Three different social realism"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*aUetvXe6GSzGacdC2MWPfQ.png"" /><figcaption>Three different social realism</figcaption></figure><p>The giraffe hit the sweet spot: real enough to be believable, special enough to be exciting. As one kid said, “I have never seen one so it’s really cool.”</p><p>The human character’s high social realism created its own problem. Because humans’ brains are so good at identifying faces, kids noticed and commented on every imperfection: “weird hair,” “big head.” They also found the eye movements unsettling.</p><p>Kids found the Muppet “weird” and “creepy” because “it’s not a real thing.” When children are still learning to separate fantasy from reality, encountering something contradictory can be unsettling. However, kids who recognized the Muppet from Sesame Street actually responded positively, which means prior exposure might help.</p><p>Still, it’s hard to predict each child’s experience with specific characters. A safe design principle is to choose something with moderate social realism. It’s clearly non-human, clearly plausible, and doesn’t trigger that uncomfortable “this shouldn’t exist” or “something’s off” feeling.</p><h3>Getting the proportions right</h3><p>Okay, so let’s say we pick a character with moderate social realism, like a fox. How should we design its appearance? Most designers are aware of uncanny valley effects and avoid hyper-realistic designs. So what if we make it cute and cartoon-like with bigger eyes and head?</p><p>Well, it turns out that kids aren’t fans of exaggerated proportions either. <a href=""https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000449027600041"">Feng’s research</a> showed that children’s preference declined as eye size enlarged. The reason is likely the same: <strong>exaggerated proportions conflict with kids’ understanding of the world.</strong> <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2042753021994337"">Research</a> with young adults showed that a 25% eye size increase can be optimal, suggesting small tweaks might help. However, more research is needed to determine if this applies to children as well.</p><p>When designing the appearance, consistency is crucial. If you choose a cartoon style, commit fully across the entire body, not just the face. Mixing realistic bodies with cartoonish features creates the kind of mismatch that makes kids uncomfortable.</p><h3>Movement matters</h3><p>Besides appearance, many kids commented on avatars’ behaviors. Interestingly, they mentioned movement first and appearance second, showing the importance of behavioral realism.</p><p>Kids made comments about all kinds of movements, including head movements and facial expressions. But among all their observations, eyes were the most critical feature.<strong> They assessed realism mainly through eye behavior.</strong> For instance, they found avatars creepy because of “unsettling eye movement,” staring, or unnatural blinking speed. They also wanted avatars to “acknowledge their existence by making eye contact.”</p><p>However, realism alone isn’t enough. Consistency matters. A cartoon fox with hyper-realistic blinking will still feel off. Behavioral realism needs to match visual realism. Designers need to find the balance between all elements.</p><h3>Keep distance in mind</h3><p>Compared to adults, kids showed more attempts to interact with avatars. They wanted to play with them and touch them. Some expressed disappointment that avatars felt “fake” because they couldn’t physically interact with them.</p><p>Not all applications need direct avatar interaction. For experiences where interaction isn’t intended, distance design can help. Well-designed distance can improve both visual and behavioral realism. It not only prevents unwanted interactions but also keeps certain imperfect features from being too noticeable.</p><p>Distance design is relatively new compared to traditional media. On flat screens, characters maintain a certain distance from users. However, in VR, characters share the same space as kids.</p><p>In real life, people naturally keep some distance from one another. Hall’s proxemics theory (1966) explains this: people maintain different zones of personal space depending on their relationship and social context. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-025-01127-y"">Studies </a>show people maintain similar distance zones in VR. When approaching others, they typically stay within social space range (1.22–3.65m), which is consistent with Hall’s theory. (1 unity unit in VR = 1 meter)</p><figure><img alt=""Hall’s proxemics theory"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dPODKM01alTqpWRGVKxvcw.png"" /><figcaption>Hall’s proxemics theory</figcaption></figure><p>However, some <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-024-00982-5"">studies</a> find people keep much larger distances in VR than in real life, which is around 160% farther. This might be because distance perception works differently in virtual environments.</p><p>These differences are normal. They can stem from environmental settings, age range, or users’ prior VR experience.<strong> The safest design principle is to position avatars slightly farther away and allow kids to close the gap if they want.</strong></p><p>In VR, kids’ emotions intensify because characters share the same space, making everything feel more real. This makes designing avatars trickier than it looks.</p><p>It’s not just about making something cute. We need to understand how children process reality and what triggers their “something’s wrong” feeling. Kids are still in their developmental phase, learning what’s real and what’s not. Being cautious helps us avoid triggering discomfort and confusion.</p><p>And remember: consistency is key. Pick your level of realism and stick to it across appearance, movement, and distance. Otherwise, your design is just “creepy” and “weird”.</p><h4>Reference:</h4><ul><li>Segaran, K., Ali, A. Z. M., &amp; Hoe, T. W.

But we’ve also lived with it long enough for misconceptions to emerge — before best practices have really had a chance to settle.</p><p>The pace of disruption remains wild. However, <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-of-ux-2026/"">2026 is already being described as the year of AI fatigue</a>.</p><p>For product leaders, this creates a new challenge: we need to define ways to approach UX for AI without making AI-powered products exhausting, inconvenient, risky, and unsustainable.</p><p>This article focuses on one of the widespread misconceptions that could send the future of UX along a very wrong trajectory. I call it <em>chatbot-first thinking</em>: the assumption that conversational interfaces can — or should — replace most existing UI patterns completely.</p><h3><strong>The Promise of Zero UI</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with the most obvious question on the surface:</p><p><strong>Is the future of user experience purely conversational?</strong></p><p>For many, it’s tempting to dream about it. Especially if you’re a frequent user of large LLM interfaces today. Especially if you follow <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/"">announcements like OpenAI’s recent promise of a screen-free, pocketable product</a> that hints at a life increasingly driven by AI orchestration. And especially if your mental model of AI experience is based on the early ChatGPT experience, which was entirely conversational, with no UI snippets and micro-apps within the chat dialogue.</p><p>It’s also easy to fall into this line of thinking after watching the rise of ChatGPT apps — pulling familiar services, like OpenTable, directly into the chat dialogue (spoiler alert: you still need to visit OpenTable’s website to complete your user journey, as is the case with almost every app in the ChatGPT app directory). The idea that everything could eventually live inside a single conversational interface starts to feel not just plausible, but inevitable.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/c1daf7b9a5b088348fa7d2943f70612d/href"">https://medium.com/media/c1daf7b9a5b088348fa7d2943f70612d/href</a><p>In my personal life, as an enthusiast of AI tools, I increasingly try to experiment and outsource tasks to LLMs via text or voice. Agents from tools like ChatGPT or Claude — despite being clumsy, slow, and often struggling with all the still-non-AI-first websites — can handle a variety of scenarios, all of which I can trigger via a voice command in the chat.</p><p>But there’s only so much I can do via text, let alone voice.</p><h3>Can we always use conversational UX?</h3><p>The reality is much more complex. Many of the tasks we deal with in our personal life and at work require <strong>rich, multi-modal interaction patterns that conversational interfaces simply cannot support</strong>.</p><p>If you’re a product leader evaluating whether UX of your AI functionality should become purely conversational, I recommend thinking twice whether it will become an accelerator or a blocker for your product.</p><p>One of the good starting points is <a href=""https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/is-conversation-the-right-fit#is-conversation-the-right-fit"">Google’s checklist</a> for the conversational approach fit:</p><figure><img alt=""“Is conversation the right fit?” from Google’s Assistant / Conversation Design Guidance"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*adb9a_2AQYvfkCIsl69UtA.png"" /><figcaption>“Is conversation the right fit?” from <a href=""https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/is-conversation-the-right-fit#is-conversation-the-right-fit"">Google’s Assistant / Conversation Design Guidance</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>When working with clients, we take this evaluation to the next level by guiding them to the interaction pattern choice via a series of validating questions, and essentially checking — does the conversational approach check all the boxes?</blockquote><h4>Question 1: Is it accessible?</h4><p>Chat-based interfaces require users to describe their problems in written text. <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/ideuspiaac/"">Recent literacy research</a> shows that nearly half of the population in wealthy countries struggles with complex texts and won’t get good results from chatbots. <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-articulation-barrier"">Jacob Nielsen called it a fundamental usability problem</a>, because it forces users to become prompt engineers just to reach the same basic level of user experience that visual interfaces previously provided.</p><figure><img alt=""Data collected by the OECD.

Could they still use a conversational approach for virtually everything?</p><p>Consider food ordering as an example. Major players in the AI industry like to paint a future where ordering a lunch delivery is as simple as issuing a voice command. But what if you don’t know what you want to order at all and would prefer to see the menu first? Listening to a menu, when it could be presented via graphical interface, violates one of the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#:~:text=6%3A%20Recognition%20Rather%20than%20Recall"">core usability principles, <em>“recognition rather than recall”</em></a> which advises <strong>minimising memory load by keeping interfaces self-evident.</strong></p><blockquote>Unlike a screen, spoken commands and outputs vanish instantly, giving users nothing to refer back to. It’s <em>“much easier to pick out the desired item from a list when the list is displayed on a monitor than when it’s read aloud,”</em> <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/voice-interfaces-assessing-the-potential/#:~:text=,feedback%20%20on%20its%20actions"">as Jacob Nielsen explains</a>.</blockquote><p>Back to our example with food ordering: how often do you actually spell out the names of your favourite food items in your head when you’re hungry? Maybe you just don’t remember the quirky name of that rice bowl you always order. Which leads us to the next issue with conversational interfaces.</p><p>Everything we put in a chat prompt is a piece of context, and the result of our collaboration with a chatbot can be only as good as the precision and relevance of our input.<strong> Therefore, prompt-based products work best for the users who already know how to ask the right question.</strong></p><p>In a purely conversational system, users often don’t know what features or commands exist, unless they actively ask or the system hints at them. Moreover, when they do discover the product capabilities and get their job done successfully via chat, how can they be sure they can still get the exact same result next time? Generative AI is probabilistic by nature, and the results may differ slightly each time. Of course, building a knowledge graph, templates, or guardrails can reduce this variation — but it can never remove it entirely. Conversational interfaces are a poor fit for high-precision tasks — unless they are heavily supported by non-conversational structure.</p><h4>Question 4: Is it reliable?</h4><p>Imagine a business user using a purely conversational assistant to update a contract term: “Change the renewal period to one year and apply the standard discount.”</p><p>That sounds clear to a human, but in practice it leaves room for interpretation. Which contract version? Which definition of “standard”? Does the discount apply immediately or at renewal? Is it one year from today or from the original start date? Small variations in phrasing — or in how the model interprets context — can lead to different outcomes each time.</p><p>In high-precision scenarios like this, users need to see exact fields, values, and constraints, review changes side by side, and explicitly confirm what will be saved. A conversational interface can help guide the process, but relying on chat alone makes the experience fragile.</p><h4>Question 5: Is it necessary?</h4><p>Just because a task <em>can</em> be done via chat, should it be done via chat?</p><p>Let’s take an example of an atomic, well-defined task that looks like a textbook success case for an AI agent: I recently needed a transcript for a YouTube video and decided to outsource the task to the ChatGPT agent.</p><p>The old way of doing it:</p><ol><li>Search for an online transcription service</li><li>Copy and paste the YouTube link</li><li>Click a call-to-action button</li><li>Download the transcript</li></ol><p>The new, agentic way of doing it (as of January 2026):</p><ol><li>Prompt ChatGPT: Get me the transcript of this YouTube video (link included)</li><li>(Optional) Observe how the agent navigates across multiple third-party transcription services, struggles with permissions, cookies, paywalls, or rate limits, retries failed requests, reformats output several times, takes minutes to complete the task but finally provides the transcript</li><li>Download the transcript</li></ol><p>If I need the transcript now, the experience quickly becomes frustrating. But it’s not just that.</p><h4>Question 6: Is it sustainable?</h4><p>The described experience raises another debate. When an LLM agent spends five minutes crawling the web, calling tools, retrying failures, reasoning through intermediate steps, it is running on energy-intensive infrastructure, contributing to real data-center load, energy usage, and CO₂ emissions. For a task that could be solved with less energy by a specialised service, this is computational overkill.</p><p>From a systems perspective, this isn’t just inefficient UX — it’s inefficient infrastructure usage. <strong>The question becomes: was AI the right tool for this task at all?</strong></p><h3>But what about agentic experiences? Won’t they remove the need for UI (and UX)?</h3><p>First, let’s explore what an AI agent is.</p><blockquote><a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-are-ai-agents"">An AI agent is a software system that autonomously pursues goals and completes tasks on behalf of a user by reasoning, planning, and acting across tools and environments with minimal human input.</a></blockquote><p>The agent’s role is to support human workflows: making information visible or drawing attention to what matters, handling parts of the workflow, exploring alternative scenarios, suggesting a best-guess next step, translating intent into actions by interfacing with APIs, coordinating signals across systems, or executing commands. <strong>The human remains the primary problem solver, with the agent augmenting and supporting — not replacing them.</strong></p><p>In line with service design thinking, agents need humans to support them across several stages of the agentic lifecycle: 1) <strong>Set up</strong> → 2) <strong>Delegate</strong> → 3) <strong>Execute</strong> → 4) <strong>Observe</strong> → 5) <strong>Intervene</strong> → 6) <strong>Confirm</strong> → 7) <strong>Complete</strong> → 8) <strong>Learn and Disengage. </strong>This system layer is called <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop (HITL)</a> and is intended to ensure accuracy, safety, accountability or ethical decision-making of AI workflows.</p><blockquote>Agentic experiences require a service design approach to mapping and designing of these novel, dual experiences where agents and humans collaborate to achieve results we earlier could only dream of.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Service blueprint for human-agentic experiences"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O6-4hKkZyanuzI-4UN1zTw.png"" /><figcaption>Service blueprint for human-agentic experiences</figcaption></figure><p>All of the described stages and touchpoints require choosing from a variety of interface approaches, beyond just the conversational one <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">(canvas UI, contextual UI, modular UI, simulation environment, and other types)</a>. But this is a topic for a different article.</p><figure><img alt=""Various UX layouts for generative AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h3gLQka9I-VzYo2rKBLe3g.png"" /><figcaption>Various <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">UX layouts for generative AI</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The price of (not) doing UX for AI the right way</h3><p>Customer fatigue with AI slop is growing across all industries, with business initiatives like <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-ad/"">AI-generated ad campaigns triggering massive online backlash</a>.</p><p>In 2024 LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91196335/linkedin-ai-powered-prompt-questions-under-posts-feeds-premium-removed"">silently removed the shallow and unhelpful AI prompt suggestions</a> in the feed which were spotted frequently by Premium users. Meta was also <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/meta-putting-ai-front-center-apps-users-are-annoyed-rcna148857"">criticised for rolling out Meta AI as a default part of the interface in their major apps</a>, such as in the search bar or with prominent icons users can’t easily remove. Despite the user backlash, Meta is continuing to push AI features and earning the reputation of a company that is leading with AI for AI’s sake and hurting user experience rather than helping it.</p><p>On the other hand, companies that apply user-centered approach to the design of AI-powered products are enjoying success as pioneers setting new mental models.</p><p>For example, <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/en-hk/2024/11/20/ignite-2024-why-nearly-70-of-the-fortune-500-now-use-microsoft-365-copilot/"">Microsoft 365 Copilot’s success with 70% of Fortune 500</a> companies is partially explained by their<strong><em> </em></strong>inline-style interaction pattern which has become the baseline of intuitive AI UX — the one that enhances existing workflows, not replaces them with inferior interaction patterns.</p><p>Notion AI has been one of the first companies which enabled the interaction pattern of AI suggesting contextual preset actions. This is just one example of how thoughtful selection of a UX pattern can remove the cognitive load of wondering what the AI can actually do with the text and what the best way to prompt it is.</p><figure><img alt=""Notion AI providing contextual actions to guide the user"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/580/1*XVYmQSKVS2aJfaKlYxfleg.png"" /><figcaption>Notion AI providing contextual actions to guide the user</figcaption></figure><blockquote>The future of UX for AI will not be a single interface or interaction pattern — it will be layered ecosystems of tools, touchpoints, and safeguards. As these ecosystems become more agentic, the need for thoughtful UX design only increases.</blockquote><p>This is where user-centered design and service design become essential — not as supporting roles, but as foundational disciplines. UX and service designers are uniquely equipped to map end-to-end journeys, identify moments where human judgment must remain in the loop, and design systems that clearly communicate intent, limits, confidence, and accountability. They help answer the hard questions that AI alone cannot (at least not in its pre-AGI era): <em>When should the system act? When should it pause? When should it explain itself? And when should it step aside entirely?</em></p><p>If there is one lesson we should take from the last decade of digital product design, it’s that technology rarely fails because it isn’t powerful enough. It fails because it isn’t shaped around real human needs and contexts. AI is no exception — and the cost of getting it wrong is significantly higher.</p><h4>Recommended further reading</h4><p><a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/designing-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces/""><em>When Words Cannot Describe: Designing For AI Beyond Conversational Interfaces</em></a> by Maximillian Piras</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-changing-search-behaviors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>State of UX 2026: Design Deeper to Differentiate</em></a><em> </em>by Nielsen Norman Group</p><p><a href=""https://lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?2107""><em>Common AI Product Issues</em></a><em> </em>by Luke Wroblewski</p><p><a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-articulation-barrier""><em>The Articulation Barrier: Prompt-Driven AI UX Hurts Usability</em></a><em> </em>by Jakob Nielsen</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/#:~:text=I%20doubt%20that%20the%20current,coughs%20up%20the%20right%20results""><em>AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years</em></a> by Jakob Nielsen</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1""><em>Survey of User Interface Design and Interaction Techniques in Generative AI Applications</em></a> by Reuben Luera</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/e3Pj7W0xl_c?si=vVhKSHDnyrbfezkp""><em>The Hidden Cost of Instant Answers</em></a> by Saleh Kayyali</p><p><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22370v1"">Survey of User Interface Design and Interaction Techniques in Generative AI Applications</a> by Reuben Luera</p><p><a href=""https://zapier.com/blog/human-in-the-loop/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>Human-in-the-loop in AI workflows: HITL meaning, benefits, and practical patterns</em></a> by Juliet John</p><p><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395298892_How_AI_Agents_Are_Reshaping_the_Internet_from_Human-Centered_to_Machine-Mediated_Commerce""><em>How AI Agents Are Reshaping the Internet from Human-Centered to Machine-Mediated Commerce</em></a> by A.

<h4><em>Vibe coding is the buzzword of the moment, and for good reason , AI tools have given product designers a massive new superpower. They have turned us all into “makers.” </em>In this article, I’ll show how I vibe coded two different projects: a floating UI cooking app and an XR basketball game.</h4><figure><img alt=""A photo of a street with a 3D hood in the middle. Two arms are in front as if were to throw a ball"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TOwitEhHrw2eRiVNjXkF2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>While Figma put vibe coding on the map for designers, this approach goes far beyond just one tool. There is an army of incredible tools serving different purposes: design-focused tools like <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Stitch</a>; prototyping engines like <a href=""https://vercel.com/"">Vercel</a>, <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://aistudio.google.com/"">Google AI Studio</a>, and production-ready environments like <a href=""https://antigravity.google/"">Antigravity </a>or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>. It’s worth mentioning that even the ones I categorize as prototyping can send its code to GitHub which add a new step towards production-ready code.</p><p>After “vibe coding” mobile and web app prototypes for a while, I realized these tools should be able to handle XR 3D canvases as well. This led to a thought… can they also prototype XR experiences?</p><p>The technology is certainly there. <a href=""https://immersiveweb.dev/"">WebXR </a>is the standard API for immersive experiences on the web, and frameworks like <a href=""https://aframe.io/"">A-Frame</a> provide ready-to-use XR components, covering inputs, primitives, teleportation, gestures and so on. Since AI coding tools can already interact with external libraries, I realized I only needed to provide the intent and guide the AI toward the spatial outcome I wanted.</p><p>So, that’s exactly what I did. And it worked. Suddenly, I could tell the AI what I wanted, and it created a 3D canvas with a head-tracked camera, hand controllers, and functional interactions. This is the beginning of spatial vibe coding!</p><h3>My approach to Spatial Vibe Coding</h3><p>In practice, vibe coding for immersive experiences is similar to vibe coding for mobile or desktop, but with an added dimension.</p><p>While you don’t need to be a developer to make functional prototypes, the more you know about the tech stack, the more control you have. Pure vibe coding , focusing solely on intent without thinking about the “how” , is valid and often the best way to avoid biasing the AI. If you give the agent freedom, it often finds the most efficient path. Conversely, if you try to micromanage it, you end up with “two brains” working against each other on the same task.</p><p>However, understanding the tools allows you to speak the same language as the AI, increasing speed and precision. For example, A-Frame has a specific component called <a href=""https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/components/hand-tracking-controls.html"">hand-tracking-controls</a>. If you tell the AI to use this specific component, it generates a standardized, ready-to-use solution that creates fewer problems than a custom solution.</p><p>My recommendation? Focus on intent, but establish “rules” based on the components you know work best.</p><h3>The prompting strategy: Freedom vs Bias</h3><p>When it comes to technically complex projects, I prefer to let the main AI agent figure out the solution rather than asking a <em>second</em> AI to polish or “engineer” my prompt.</p><p>In my experience, when another AI takes my rough prompt and “polishes” it, it introduces a biases. It often guides the final coding agent in a direction it wouldn’t have naturally taken, leading to worse results. I get better outcomes when I either tell the AI to refine the prompt without dictating <em>how</em> to solve it, or simply go with my original, intent-based prompt.</p><h4>The “intent-based” prompt (successful in this example)</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of Figma Make environment with the preview of the UI panel"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NGyz2eAkBtUfFHL_cXmvTg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Figma Make environment</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the original prompt I created. It focused on the <em>what</em>, not the minute details of the <em>how</em>:</p><blockquote>“I want you to create an MR cooking app. The app should provide a passthrough experience with a UI panel rendered inside it. When the app is published and the URL is opened in a VR headset such as Meta Quest 2 or 3, the user should see the standard Open in VR button in the browser. After clicking it, the user can enter the experience.</blockquote><blockquote>Use WebXR and A-Frame. I will be referencing A-Frame components and primitives frequently, so make sure to use native A-Frame primitives where possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Ensure that the UI is rendered within the MR experience. Place the UI panel to the left of the user and slightly tilted toward the user’s camera. For now, include placeholder elements in the panel: a title, an image, and some text.</blockquote><blockquote>The input system should be hand tracking, using the A-Frame raycaster component. Prepare a structure to group all UI elements, as the app will include multiple screens and navigation. Build the UI using A-Frame primitives.”</blockquote><p><strong>The Result:</strong> I got a functional 3D canvas, an input system, passthrough, and a UI in place. It wasn’t polished, but it was a solid baseline for iteration.</p><h4>The “over-engineered” prompt (failed in this example)</h4><p>I then tried using an AI to “professionalize” the prompt. This version was too prescriptive:</p><blockquote>“Create a functional WebXR prototype for a Mixed Reality (MR) cooking app using the A-Frame framework.</blockquote><blockquote>1. Scene &amp; Environment Setup:<br />Initialize an &lt;a-scene&gt; configured for AR/MR passthrough. Ensure the background is transparent (&lt;a-sky&gt; removed or transparent) so the user sees the real world. Ensure the WebXR button is enabled by default so the user can click “Enter VR/AR” on Meta Quest 2/3 browsers.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Camera &amp; Input:<br />Set up a camera rig with a position of 0 1.6 0. Implement Hand Tracking controls. Add &lt;a-entity&gt; components for both left and right hands using the hand-tracking-controls component. Attach a raycaster to the hands (configured to interact with UI objects) so the user can point and pinch/select elements.</blockquote><blockquote>3. UI Architecture:<br />Create a parent &lt;a-entity&gt; to act as a “Screen Container” to group all UI elements. This will allow for easy visibility toggling for future navigation. Placement: Position this UI group to the left of the user (approx x: -1, z: -1.5) and rotate it on the Y-axis (approx rotation=”0 45 0&quot;) so it is tilted to face the user’s camera.</blockquote><blockquote>4. UI Design (A-Frame Primitives):<br />Inside the UI group, build a panel using an &lt;a-plane&gt; as the background (dark color, slight opacity). Add an &lt;a-image&gt; placeholder for a recipe title image. Add &lt;a-text&gt; for the recipe title and instruction placeholders. Ensure all UI elements are children of the parent group and are rendered properly in the MR view.”</blockquote><p><strong>The Result:</strong> This prompt guided the AI agent too much. It ended up strictly following instructions rather than finding a cohesive solution, which led to broken code. It’s like micromanaging a graphic designer, if you tell them exactly where to put every pixel, you won’t get their best work.</p><h3>Iterating on the design</h3><p>Once the foundations were defined, I decided to push the fidelity. I noticed some errors in my initial brief, specifically, trying to build complex UI with primitives. I realized it was better to design a high-fidelity UI in Figma, export it as a PNG, and import it into the experience. While tools like Figma Make struggled slightly with the point-and-pinch input system, it was enough to visualize what the production version could look like.</p><figure><img alt=""A UI panel floating in an actual kitchen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LnDX2_CS64n6-AlK2Lyi_Q.gif"" /><figcaption>Cooking up testing in XR</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hight fidelity UI of the cooking app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qYhj6cwODYlhoYoUv8_ZVQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Cooking app UI in Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>Going further: complex interactions with Gemini 3 Pro</h3><figure><img alt=""An animated gif of a player throwing a ball into the hoop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g4w0VTg3NNNF5M30CvYWDA.gif"" /><figcaption>Testing the game in VR</figcaption></figure><p>To push beyond UI panels, I went with Gemini Pro in Google AI Studio.</p><p>This demonstrated that a 15-minute prompting session can result in a fully functional WebXR prototype featuring physics, grabbing mechanics, and game logic.

Welcome to the era of infinite content and finite attention, where our brains are working overtime just to keep up with the deluge.</p><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: our ability to focus is dwindling at a startling rate. <strong>According to </strong><a href=""https://gloriamark.com/attention-span/""><strong>Gloria Mark</strong></a><strong>, a professor of informatics at the University of California, the average attention span on any screen has plummeted from around two and a half minutes in 2004 to just 47 seconds in recent years.</strong> That’s not a typo. Forty-seven seconds. The median is even lower at 40 seconds, which means half of the time we’re switching our focus faster than it takes to microwave popcorn.</p><p>And in case you were wondering whether AI is helping or hindering the situation, well, the plot thickens.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart or timeline graphic illustrating the decline in average human attention span on screens over two decades.

Before ChatGPT launched in late 2022, that figure was hovering around 5%. Talk about an explosion.</p><p><a href=""https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-percentage-of-new-content-is-ai-generated/""><strong>A separate study from Ahrefs</strong></a><strong> painted an even more dramatic picture, finding that a staggering 74% of newly created web pages in April 2025 contained AI-generated content. </strong>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08755"">research published on arXiv</a> suggested that roughly a third to almost half of the text on active web pages now originates from AI sources. Suffice to say, we’re swimming in machine-made material, and our cognitive lifeboats are getting cramped.</p><p>The trouble is, more content doesn’t necessarily mean better content. In fact, the sheer volume creates what researchers call “attention fragmentation,” a relentless toggling between tasks, tabs, and tools that leaves us perpetually half-focused. Gloria Mark describes this phenomenon as “kinetic attention,” where our mental state becomes dynamic and restless, flitting from screen to screen like a caffeinated hummingbird.</p><h3><strong>The dopamine machine</strong></h3><p>It would be somewhat unfair to pin all of this on AI alone. Short-form video platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts have been doing a phenomenal job of hijacking our neural reward systems well before the generative AI boom. But here’s where things get interesting: AI is now supercharging these platforms’ ability to serve up hyper-personalised content at unprecedented scale.</p><p>Dr John Hutton, a pediatric neuropsychologist and director of the Reading &amp; Literacy Discovery Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, has <a href=""https://theweek.com/health-and-wellness/1025836/tiktok-brain-and-attention-spans"">described TikTok as a “dopamine machine.”</a> The platform delivers quick hits of novelty and pleasure with every swipe, reinforcing cravings in much the same way a tasty meal or, less pleasantly, an addictive substance might. <strong>Each scroll triggers a little burst of feel-good neurochemistry, and our brains quickly learn to want more.</strong></p><p>The neurological evidence behind this is pretty eye-opening. In 2025, <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381192500031X"">researchers at Tianjin Normal University</a> in China scanned the brains of more than 100 university students and found that those most hooked on short-form videos had noticeable differences in their brain structure. Specifically, they had more grey matter in the orbitofrontal cortex, the part of your brain that processes rewards and pleasure. The researchers suspect these students are simply more sensitive to the dopamine hits these platforms are designed to deliver, meaning they’re getting a stronger buzz from every personalised video that lands on their feed.</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic titled “Social Media’s Toll on the Mind” showing TikTok and Instagram Reels icons pointing down to a colourful brain illustration. Labels around the brain identify effects: poorer cognitive and mental health (with anxiety and depression), addiction symptoms, decreased attention (with puzzle piece icons), and decreased activity in self-reflection and risk evaluation areas. A red warning banner at the bottom reads “More prone to impulsive, short-term thinking.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*t7d4dJA0JxVsNSOCjsiyhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Meanwhile, </strong><a href=""https://www.psypost.org/large-meta-analysis-links-tiktok-and-instagram-reels-to-poorer-cognitive-and-mental-health/""><strong>a large meta-analysis</strong></a><strong> linked heavy use of TikTok and Instagram Reels to poorer cognitive and mental health outcomes, including higher levels of anxiety, depression, and, crucially, attention difficulties. </strong>Users with addiction symptoms showed decreased activity in brain regions responsible for self-reflection and risk evaluation, making them more prone to impulsive, short-term thinking.</p><h3><strong>When the brain goes on autopilot</strong></h3><p>So what exactly happens when we marinate our minds in bite-sized, algorithmically-curated content day after day? According to emerging research, the prefrontal cortex starts to feel the strain. This is our brain’s control centre for executive function, impulse restraint, and focused attention.</p><p>A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1383913/full"">2024 study by Yan and colleagues</a> found that individuals with high short-video use tendencies showed weaker executive function and poorer self-control. <strong>It’s a bit like training for a marathon by exclusively doing 10-second sprints: the sustained-focus muscle simply doesn’t get the workout it needs.</strong></p><p>But how does this translate in real life? When young people’s brains grow accustomed to the constant environmental changes delivered by an infinite scroll of 15-second clips, they may struggle to adapt to activities that don’t move quite as fast.</p><p><strong>The term “TikTok brain” has emerged to describe this pattern: impulsivity, preference for novelty, low tolerance for delayed gratification, and difficulty maintaining attention.</strong> It’s not exactly the cognitive toolkit you’d want for, say, reading a novel, sitting through a lecture, or tackling complex problems at work.</p><h3><strong>The AI amplifier effect</strong></h3><p>Here’s where AI-generated content adds a particularly spicy ingredient to this already potent cocktail. Traditional content creation had natural bottlenecks: someone had to actually write, film, or design things, which took time and effort. AI has essentially removed those constraints, enabling content to be produced at a scale and speed that would make any human creator’s head spin.</p><p>The result? <strong>An endless buffet of highly engaging, hyper-personalised material designed to capture and hold our attention. </strong>AI algorithms analyse vast amounts of user data, from search history and social media behaviour to physiological signals, crafting recommendations so compelling that stepping away feels almost painful. <a href=""https://sqmagazine.co.uk/social-media-attention-span-statistics/"">TikTok’s algorithm alone tracks over 300 data points per user </a>to tailor content within the first hour of usage, making recommendations increasingly irresistible.</p><p><strong>And here’s the kicker: some research suggests that even AI itself isn’t immune to the effects of junk content.</strong> A <a href=""https://fortune.com/2025/10/22/ai-brain-rot-junk-social-media-viral-addicting-content-tech/"">pre-print study from researchers at Texas A&amp;M, the University of Texas at Austin, and Purdue University</a> found that when large language models were trained on short, viral social media posts, they exhibited lasting cognitive decline, including increased “thought-skipping” and reduced reasoning abilities. If the machines are getting “brain rot” from low-quality content, what does that say about us?</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic titled “The 25-Minute Problem: The Cost of Cognitive Switching&quot; on a steel blue background. Three white cards show: “The Interruption” (stopwatch and brain with lightning bolts — attention switches every 47 seconds), “The Daunting Recovery” (orange header, stopwatch displaying 25 minutes to refocus, figure climbing an arrow), and “Perpetual Loop” (circular diagram of brains and stopwatches showing the endless cycle: distraction → 25 min → new distraction)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oYMDR7MT6pwL5K7RPJFPKg.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>The 25-minute problem</strong></h3><p>Perhaps the most concerning finding from Gloria Mark’s research is what happens after we get distracted. <a href=""https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/cant-pay-attention-youre-not-alone""><strong>On average, it takes about 25 minutes</strong></a><strong> to fully refocus on the original task after an interruption.</strong> Given that we’re switching our attention every 47 seconds or so, the maths becomes rather grim. We’re essentially living in a perpetual state of cognitive switching, never quite present, never quite focused.</p><p>The consequences ripple outward. Laboratory studies consistently show that people make more errors when they switch their attention frequently. Performance suffers: tasks take longer to complete, and the quality of work declines. Medical professionals, pilots, and other high-stakes workers have long known this; now the rest of us are discovering it in our daily digital lives.</p><p><strong>A </strong><a href=""https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250718/Social-media-use-linked-to-declining-focus-and-emotional-strain-in-youth.aspx""><strong>2025 NTU Singapore study</strong></a><strong> found that over two-thirds of young people reported difficulty focusing, with many struggling to engage with content lasting more than a minute.</strong> Heavy users (those clocking five or more hours daily) were significantly more likely to experience what researchers call “attention fragmentation symptoms,” alongside weaker working memory. These aren’t just numbers; they represent real-world impacts on how we think, learn, and work.</p><h3><strong>Can we reclaim our focus?</strong></h3><p>Before you throw your phone into the nearest body of water, there is some cause for optimism. Gloria Mark emphasises that our ability to focus isn’t lost; it’s just changing. <strong>The key, she argues, is developing what she calls </strong><a href=""https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/gloria-mark-how-to-get-your-attention-span-back""><strong>“meta-awareness”</strong></a><strong>: </strong>the skill of catching yourself mid-drift, mid-scroll, or mid-sentence, and consciously deciding whether to follow that impulse or pull your attention back.</p><p>In one study, participants were asked to estimate how often they switched tasks. They guessed around 15 times per hour. The actual number? Over 30. Simply becoming aware of how fragmented our attention really is can be a powerful first step toward change.</p><p>She also champions the value of what she calls “rote activity,” meaning simple, mindless tasks like playing a quick game or doing something repetitive. These give our overtaxed minds a genuine break. Think of it as cognitive snacking: strategic mental downtime that can actually help replenish our attentional resources rather than deplete them further.</p><figure><img alt=""Infographic comparing “Traditional Content” versus ‘Microlearning.” Left side shows an overwhelmed person surrounded by chaotic app icons and notifications with a stopwatch indicating 8 seconds, leading to a confused head silhouette with a question mark. Right side shows a calm person with organised content cards (videos, tips, concepts) and a stopwatch showing 2 minutes, leading to an illuminated brain icon. Bottom text highlights “15-fold improvement” with the tagline “Intention &gt; Engagement.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IvpJqk7aTD7RgRlyLa10lQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>There’s also </strong><a href=""https://www.amraandelma.com/user-attention-span-statistics/""><strong>evidence that microlearning</strong></a><strong> can actually stretch attention spans from 8 seconds to 2 minutes.</strong> This type of short, focused video content is designed with intention rather than just engagement, and the results speak for themselves: a 15-fold improvement simply by changing how content is delivered. The difference between content designed to capture attention and content designed to build it may well be the cognitive battleground of the coming years.</p><h3><strong>The bottom line</strong></h3><p>We are, in many ways, living through an unprecedented experiment in human attention. AI-generated content is flooding the internet, algorithms are becoming ever more sophisticated at predicting and exploiting our psychological vulnerabilities, and <strong>our brains, evolved for a very different information environment, are scrambling to adapt.</strong></p><p>The research shows it’s not a simple story. Yes, our attention spans are shrinking, and yes, the combination of short-form video platforms and AI-generated content appears to be accelerating this trend. The neurological evidence suggests real changes in how our brains process information, particularly among younger users whose prefrontal cortices are still developing.</p><p><strong>But humans have always been remarkably adaptable creatures.</strong> The challenge now is to become intentional about our relationship with technology: to recognise when we’re being pulled into patterns that don’t serve us, and to actively cultivate the focused attention that deeper thinking requires.</p><p>After all, the irony would be too rich if we couldn’t even pay attention long enough to notice we’d lost it.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3><strong>References &amp; Credits</strong></h3><ul><li>Mark, G.

<p>Fashion is starting to undergo a major shift. In 2026, as with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2026-innovator-awards"">beauty</a> moving away from the pared-down “clean girl” makeup trend, fashion is moving away from the mainstream minimalism of recent years. In its place is a moodier and maximal sensibility. What does this mean for jeans? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2025"">Denim trends</a> are going to inspire you to have way <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">more fun as you get dressed</a> in the months ahead.<br /><br />One theme in particular is ruling over all popular 2026 denim: exaggeration. Prepare to take up space in baggy, inflated silhouettes with playful proportions. “Comfort is a huge factor, but there’s also something about the relaxed look that just feels more modern right now,” <a href=""https://www.pistoladenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pistola Denim</a> founder Grace Na tells Refinery29.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10820638/are-skinny-jeans-in-style-2022"">Skinny jeans</a> aren’t completely out of the picture — don’t let us stop you if they’re your favorites — but tight, figure-hugging styles certainly won’t be dominating the conversation this year. Ultimately: “Jeans should flex with how you feel, where you’re going, and who you want to be that day or even that moment of your day,” <a href=""https://lagence.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Agence</a> fashion director Tara Rudes Dann says. <br /><br />Ahead, meet the top 2026 denim trends to welcome into your wardrobe, as well as some useful shopping picks. But this isn’t an experiment you have to test alone: We spoke to the forces behind some of our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">favorite brands</a> to break down the looks, why they’re popular, and how to style them.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Barrel Jeans, With A Twist</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957183.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-barrel-leg-jeans"">Barrel-leg jeans</a> came into the zeitgeist just a few years ago as a funky denim trend with questionable longevity. Yet naysayers should take heed that this silhouette is very much here to stay. This fashion-forward style features a very noticeable curve from the hip to the ankle, and that distinct shape is only going to keep getting more visible in the months ahead.<br /><br />It’s worth noting that barrel jeans are also sometimes called a horseshoe or balloon jean, though the latter is a more exaggerated version of the look. “It plays with volume in a really fresh way and adds a bit of fashion energy without feeling too intimidating,” Pistola’s Na says of the barrel-adjacent balloon.<br /><br />Rather than intimidate you, you might find that barrel jeans are incredibly versatile when it comes to styling. Pair them with a blazer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-polo-shirts"">polo shirt,</a> and heels for an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">office-ready look</a>, or try them with a cool-girl leather jacket and sneakers for brunch with friends.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Wide-Leg Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957184.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>We’ve been seeing lots of volume in pants and jeans from plenty of brands, so it’s no surprise that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wide-leg-jeans-women"">wide-leg denim</a> will be all over your social feeds and in your favorite stores in 2026. This comfortable cut was, after all, the viral opening look in <a href=""https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/collection/metiers-art-2026/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel’s Métiers d’art 2026 show</a> — you know, the one held in a New York City subway station. Rather than hugging the body anywhere, this year’s class of wide-leg jeans shoot out from the waistband. These baggier silhouettes look great on everyone, and especially for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">petite wearers</a>, a higher-sitting waist can help elongate the legs.<br /><br />“The baggy jean can be styled with a heel for a tailored look or worn with a sneaker for a weekend-ready look,” <a href=""https://paige.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paige</a> co-founder and creative director Paige Adams-Geller says. The degree of baggy? Well, that’s buyer’s choice, and there’s a range of what’s available.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Straight-Leg &amp; Cigarette Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957185.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Skinny jeans may not be as ubiquitous as they were during the hipster heyday of the 2010s, but skinny-ish silhouettes are still in vogue. Straight-leg and cigarette jeans (darlings of the ‘80s and ‘90s) are the top nominees here. Though these two silhouettes are very similar, thanks to their slim fit that goes straight down the leg, they differ in one key spot: cigarette jeans taper at the ankle.<br /><br />The range of trends in the denim space are also a net positive for both your closet and a denim brand’s creativity. “It is exciting for us as designers but also for women because they can wear whatever suits them,” Tim Kaeding, co-founder of <a href=""https://www.motherdenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mother Denim</a>, tells Refinery29. “It isn’t like previous decades where one fit is dominating everything. It really is a cross-section between skinny and baggy.”<br /><br />Straight-leg and cigarette jeans work best in outfits that are all about clean lines — for one such example, look to <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/valentino-spring-2026-ready-to-wear-collection-1238281150/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valentino’s Spring/Summer 2026 collection</a>. Try adding a structured blazer or, for balance, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">soft cardigan</a>. If you’re on the shorter side, it can be extra helpful to have these jeans tailored at the hem to ensure there’s no pooling at your feet. In a pinch, wearing heels or using some iron-on hemming tape can also help.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Maxing Out</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957186.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mirroring the longer and looser denim styles ruling the year, skirts are going midi and maxi. (If you love your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-denim-skirts"">denim mini skirt</a>, simply stash it in storage — we’re sure it’ll come back in a few years.) The coolest denim skirts feature unique details like cool-enhancing asymmetric hems. Gravitating toward a more classic shape? Try a new-to-your-closet denim wash to mix things up.<br /><br />There are endless ways to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-skirts-over-jeans"">style these skirts</a>, whether girly, sporty, or something else. We like pairing ours with a moto jacket and combat boots for some edge. A button-up, on the other hand, projects a more polished vibe.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Contemporary Bootcut Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957187.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Raise your hand if you got  rid of any <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bootcut-jeans-women"">bootcut jeans</a> you had left over from the early aughts. (We did too.) Yet, while the style is one of the major denim trends to watch in 2026, the new class of bootcut styles is far more modern than the jeans of yore. Instead of a distinct slim-to-flare cut, the refreshed bootcut is more subtle. Best of all, comfortable high-waisted styles are as easy to source as low-rise inseams that all but scream “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/addison-rae-style-summer-outfits"">Y2K</a>.” <br /><br />“She’s confident, sexy and incredibly flattering,” L’Agence’s Rudes Dann says of the style. After all: “women want jeans that celebrate curves and command attention.”<br /><br />Making bootcut jeans feel current is also about how you style them — and no, you aren’t expected to only wear them with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">boots</a>. Rock these jeans with loafers or pointed-toe heels for an elevated silhouette. For a more casual outfit, pair them with a white T-shirt, cool jacket, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">skinny-soled sneakers</a>.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Think Beyond Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957188.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Your legs aren’t the only place where denim can make a maximum impact. Expect to see designers use the material for shirts, dresses, and accessories in 2026. <br /><br />Want to rock a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-festival-outfit-ideas"">Canadian tuxedo</a> or channel Britney Spears’ iconic <a href=""https://people.com/style/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-matching-denim-moment-20th-anniversary/"">denim-princess ballgown</a>? That’ll be easier than ever as brands continue to crank out shoes, bags, and outerwear all made with denim. Denim cowboy boots? Yes, (and thank you, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-outfits"">Beyoncé</a>). A crossbody bag made from the same material? Never no.<br /><br />“Denim jackets are showing up in sharper shapes in addition to the classic jean jacket,” Rudes Dann says of the all-denim everything trend of 2026. “Think bomber silhouettes and tailored blazers that feel structured but still easy and chic.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Jorts</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957191.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Think of today’s most popular <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anthropologie-pilcro-denim-jorts-review"">jorts</a> — a portmanteau for jean shorts — as wide-leg denim… for warmer weather. This style, which usually fits loose and hits below the knee if not right above it, is a seasonal interpretation of this year’s theme of comfort and ease. Style these with a snug shirt for proportional balance, or wear them with an oversized graphic tee to go full Adam Sandler. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Decorations &amp; Details</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957189.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Understated and unembellished jeans won’t ever lose their luster, but denim with an extra bit of flair is quickly becoming a favorite for the style-obsessed. Utility-inspired styles, like carpenter jeans, are staying mainstream, as are spunky styles that are decked out in embellishments. Pair these with a basic tee, jacket, and kicks to really let the jeans shine.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennettemccurdy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jennette McCurdy</a>’s memoir <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/relieved-dad-died-grief-after-emotional-abuse"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> left me in tears. So, when I heard that the actress turned author was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_dgS5rHts0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">releasing a new book</a>, her first novel, I was excited. <em><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366244-i-m-glad-my-mom-died"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> is brutally honest and refreshingly straightforward and I knew McCurdy’s first foray into fiction would bring the same energy. </p>



<p>The book, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">called </a><em><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half His Age</a></em>, follows Waldo, a 17-year-old who has a relationship with a teacher 23 years her senior. The book deals with the nuances and power imbalance of an age-gap affair and was partly inspired by a relationship McCurdy had herself. But at its core, the novel is about Waldo and her need for love, validation, acceptance, and how she fights for her own sense of power. </p>

<p><strong>Refinery29: Jennette, after writing your amazing memoir, <em>I’m Glad My Mom Died,</em></strong><strong> how did you decide that this was the next step in your journey as a writer?  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jennette McCurdy:</strong> Oh boy. I have a very writerly answer to this. I used to not understand when authors talked this way, but now I completely understand. It was a thing that demanded to be written. You know, I was actually writing another thing, and <em>Half His Age</em> was kind of like pushing itself up on me, and I couldn’t stop thinking about Waldo. I said, “You know, I’ll give it a week.” I’ll let it run its course. I’ll probably grow tired of it, and then I’ll just go back to this other thing. And then, 30 days later, I had a first draft, and I immediately went into a second draft, then a third, and fourth, until it was just finished. There was no choice. And I think that’s always a good sign, right? For me, that’s always an experience with creativity. The one that’s pushing itself up on me, it’s the one that gets done. That’s just how it goes. </p>



<p><strong>How much does Waldo believe that she has this relationship with her teacher under </strong><strong><em>her</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>control? And why is it important for you to show that nuance even tho</strong><strong>ugh </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>he’s</strong><strong> clearly not in </strong><strong>control because she’s a minor?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I really tried to avoid being moralistic in the writing itself and to be more subtle than that. Okay, this isn’t very subtle, but I’ll say it. Waldo is very aggressive and is very forward and is, at times, you know, throwing herself at this man. He is still a 40-year-old man who should know better. I never stated in the book, but I’ll state it here now. I really wanted to show this young woman who really believes she is in control and is really fighting to be in control and clawing for some form of power. She’s still so vulnerable. She’s still at an age that is so vulnerable. And yet at that age, you’re not necessarily aware of your limitations, of the places where you’re particularly naive or susceptible to outside influences. You don’t know those things. I really think it was so important to me to show it through her eyes completely because. Most of us reading it are going to be a bit older, and we know what it’s like to be 17. We know what it’s like not to be in that naive position, and to be that susceptible to influence. We have all been there. It was so important to me to do it completely through her eyes.   </p>



<p><strong>Yes. We also know what it’s like to think we know everything when we really know nothing. You’ve said that one of the main themes of this book is female rage. What do you mean when you say female rage? And why do you feel it’s important to explore that theme?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Thank you for this question. I would love to hear what female rage is to you. Female rage to me is having your boundaries violated over and over and over and over and over again, and not having access to the language, the tools to advocate for yourself. Being afraid to advocate for yourself. Told not to advocate for yourself, to be polite, to be nice, to make things easy, to not be difficult. So, you continue doing that and playing that role over and over again. Then your boundaries are still violated over and over and over again, and it compounds for years until, inevitably, the rage starts to crop up and come out in unexpected ways. There’s no choice but to start confronting it and understanding not only its roots, but also how to ideally channel it properly moving forward. This was such an important theme for me to explore. I think we all have a lot of female rage. You tell me if you disagree. Do you have it? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957143.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>I </strong><strong>do not disagree</strong><strong>.</strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM: </strong>It’s something we all know so well, and yet I haven’t really felt the social conversation go there the way I wish it would. I think there’s so much value in our rage if we can access it, if we’re not hiding it and doing the thing where we’re suppressing and being polite and pretty and nice and whatever. If we’re able to go, I’<em>m fucking angry, and here’s what  I’m angry about.</em> Oh my God, that’s when it moves through you. That’s when it leads to decisions you can make that are actually helpful for your life. And Waldo is not there yet. She’s not at the place where she can make those helpful decisions. She is 17. She’s in the throes of it, and she doesn’t even realize the extent of it. And it is fueling her decisions so much without her even realizing it. Her drive for sex. Her need for Korgy. Her need for things. For clothing. All of it is so charged by rage and shame. I really hope it will open up a broader conversation about what we can do with our rage and how we can find empowering ways of utilizing it.  </p>



<p><strong>Yes, I think that is something we should talk more about. We should be allowed to feel pure anger. There are so many things set up to make us angry, and I should be allowed to curse somebody out.  </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> There are some lovely men. All gays are great. There are some straights who are lovely. <em>[laughs]</em> I’m with an amazing one.  But I think a lot of times, their fear of our emotions can really cause us to sort of suppress and wanna be polite and keep going in that inauthentic way. Who can hold our rage? A) Ourselves and B) Other women. I have never felt more at ease and safe in my rage than when I explore it with other women and talk about it. Having those deep, thoughtful conversations about what it is we’re so angry about, what the root of it is, what it might be actively that’s in our life that’s causing it to resurface, and how we can move forward in a way that is productive and healthy. </p>

<p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat is the best way for us to express our female rage? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I think it can be different for everybody. Something that might be somewhat universal, I’d say, is having a creative outlet. For me, it’s writing. I think I write really effectively from a place of anger. It’s when I do the most charged writing that I think connects the most. It can be a variety of things, but I think creativity is one place. A genuine conversation is another place for it. Surprise!<em> [laughs]</em> That shouldn’t be shocking. Just talking it out and not pretending to be <em>happy, happy, happy</em> and <em>grateful, grateful, grateful</em> all the time. That is crazy making. </p>



<p><strong>It is, as they call it, toxic positivity</strong><strong>.  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Yes.   </p>



<p><strong>If you could explain</strong><em><strong> Half His Age</strong></em><strong> using the five senses, what would they be? For example, it sounds like this, it feels like this.   </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Ooh, okay. It feels like skin. Sweaty skin, particularly sweaty, hairy skin. It sounds like a train, like the force of a train. Potentially about to crash. We see a train coming the opposite way. The two trains are coming at the same time. That’s what it sounds like.  </p>



<p><strong>If train A sta</strong><strong>rts </strong><strong>here and train B starts there, when will they collide</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>JM:</strong> Exactly. What does it smell like? My mind went to sweat again, but I’ll say it smells like… I can’t say where my mind was <em>[laughs].</em> I’ll say it: it smells like a certain bodily fluid. It tastes like sour patch kids. And it looks like desolate landscapes of Alaska, and then I’m thinking extreme close-ups of sex. It’s not like we’re seeing a romanticized shot where it’s hot and steamy. It’s like we’re seeing a close-up of an arm. We’re seeing that gut. We’re just seeing the body hanging by itself. We’re seeing cellulite, we’re seeing makeup-less faces, we’re seeing lips, and we’re seeing drool. Just kind of the visceral, disgusting elements of sex.   </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957147.jpg?width=779&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=779%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>What is it like to be so vulnerable publicly and share so much of yourself? Does it make it easier or harder that you’ve been in the spotlight for so long?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I’m really glad that I had years where I was not in the spotlight. No social media app was on my phone. I was in a cave writing for quite a few years. Not even considering the public eye in any way, shape, or form. And then being back into it as an adult has been really interesting, fun, and at times complicated, but I do lead with vulnerability. Honesty is an important value of mine. Authenticity. It’s just who I am. It would feel so bad to show up here, sit opposite you, to be somebody who I’m not. Be some performative thing that I’m not. And then after the fact, you know, closing the Zoom and shutting the laptop and then being a completely different person. It wouldn’t work for me, to be honest. I certainly have things for myself and things I keep to myself, but I do believe vulnerability is useful to others and an important value of mine.   </p>



<p><strong>Since this book is inspired by a real-life experience </strong><strong>you’ve</strong><strong> had, where does Jennette start, and where does Waldo stop? </strong><strong>How are you similar to each other</strong><strong> and h</strong><strong>ow are you different from each other</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I was in a significant age-gap relationship. When I was 18, I had my first foray into the world of relationships. On a personal level, that influenced some aspects of Waldo’s relationship with Korgy and a lot of my unprocessed anger from that relationship. Waldo is entirely her own character. This story is entirely its own. And there’s something really  freeing and really fun about it that I loved. I certainly want to write more fiction. I’m sure people will project me onto it in certain ways, and that’s fine if people do, but I really hope that if they can, they read it entirely as its own piece of work in its own world. It’s own set of characters. I think it would be a misread to put too much of me on it, to be honest.   </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I hope [<em>Half His Age]</em> makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable… I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p><cite>jennette mccurdy</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I think </strong><strong>it’s</strong><strong> great that you </strong><strong>can</strong><strong> tell people, “No,</strong><strong> Waldo is a character. This is fiction.” Who would you say this book is not for, and who is it for?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM: </strong>I wanna say it’s not for somebody who’s suppressing a lot and has sort of muted emotions. I don’t think it would work for them. I think it’s certainly for people with big emotions. For anybody who’s ever embarrassed themselves or humiliated themselves in a relationship to try to have their needs met, to try to win the affection of somebody who didn’t love them back the way that they needed or so craved. It’s for anybody who’s ever felt deeply lonely. I think there’s so much loneliness that comes through in this. You know, we mentioned rage. Anybody with unprocessed or processed rage. All rage is welcome here. </p>



<p><strong>What do you want people to take away from this book after they put it down? </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> closing it. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> done. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> crying. What am I taking away? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> A theme of this conversation has been rage, and I don’t want to harp on it too much. But I do hope it helps people process some of that, and that it leads to conversations about rage. It’s a hope of mine that anything I write will help people find closure, maybe in places where there wasn’t any, and in their own experiences. I hope it’s a source of connection, and I hope it’s a place to process uncomfortable feelings. I hope it makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable and so much to glean from that. So, I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p>



<p><strong>You have to sit in the uncomfortable to find the comfortable. Can’t just have one without the other. I think that’s what people forget. </strong> </p>



<p><strong>Your TV adaptation of <em>I’m</em></strong><strong><em> Gl</em></strong><strong><em>ad </em></strong><strong><em>My Mom Died</em></strong><strong> is in the works. Congratulations! How is that process going? Are there any secrets you can tell me?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I don’t think I can share any secrets. Top-level, locked-in-a-box stuff <em>[laughs]. </em>It’s been really interesting. I can say I have a really clear vision for what the show is. I have had this vision for years. It’s not only my life story; it’s inspired by the memoir, and knowing that the memoir has touched so many people in such a significant and profound way is so important to me to get the adaptation right. To me, that means making sure every member of that team fully understands that vision and that we’re all on the same page. And I’m not in any rush. It doesn’t matter to me how long it takes. It’s gotta be done right.   </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957041.jpg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m not <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-marriage-proposal-celebration-anxiety"">engaged</a>. And yet, somehow, I took my boyfriend to what might be our future wedding destination. I had started wedding planning without meaning to.</p>



<p>When the invitation to visit <a href=""https://ranchosantana.com/""><strong>Rancho Santana</strong></a> landed in my inbox, the subject line stopped me in my tracks: <em>Nicaragua</em>. It wasn’t a place I had ever imagined myself visiting let alone falling in love with, but I’m always down for the ride. So I said yes, packed my bags, and invited my boyfriend along to help photograph the trip.</p>



<p>From the moment we landed, the experience felt elevated. A private car service picked us up and drove us two hours through the countryside of Nicaragua, eventually arriving at a secluded paradise I didn’t even know existed. At Rancho Santana, we were greeted with welcome drinks, cool towels, and the kind of hospitality that instantly makes you exhale. The entrance alone felt cinematic: a hacienda-style courtyard opening up to sweeping ocean views. That was my first thought: <em>This place feels heaven-sent.</em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957061.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>What I didn’t realize and what my boyfriend found out shortly after we arrived was that the rest of our group consisted entirely of wedding planners and wedding photographers. The side-eye was immediate. I promised him it wasn’t a setup, but once you experience Rancho Santana, the confusion makes sense. This is the wedding venue of your dreams. Whether you’re envisioning a beach ceremony, an intimate chapel moment, or vows exchanged at golden hour, the resort offers every version of romance that is thoughtfully designed and effortlessly executed. Our group included some of California’s most talented wedding and event planners, including <a href=""https://www.rheefined.com/"">Jason Rhee</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charleybluebell/?hl=en"">Charley King</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artandsoulevents/"">Jessica Carrillo</a>, <a href=""https://thomasbuilifestyle.com/"">Thomas Bui,</a> and <a href=""https://nahidglobal.com/services-2/"">Nahid Farhoud</a>, along with photographers <a href=""https://emilywren.com/"">Emily Wren</a> and <a href=""https://clanegessel.com/"">The Clane Gessel Studio</a>. As the only journalist on the trip, I felt incredibly honored to be with such great talent.</p>



<p>And then there was the itinerary… which did <em>not</em> help my case.</p>



<p>Our room had a private terrace (by the way, every room does), mornings started with oceanfront breakfasts while surfers rode the waves below, and evenings were filled with sunset cocktail hours followed by candlelit dinners with gorgeous table decor. Night one felt less like a welcome dinner and more like an engagement dinner, for guests we hadn’t invited.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957134.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The next day, we toured the full property, and that’s when everything clicked. In addition to resort rooms, Rancho Santana offers over 20 private residences that can accommodate anywhere from six to eighty guests. It’s an ideal option for weddings or milestone celebrations that feel both intimate and expansive. Guests still receive full access to the resort’s amenities, including butler service, three restaurants, a café, a pool bar with cabanas, and a local market.</p>



<p>One night, we attended an all-white themed dinner at one of the restaurants. Between the unreal sunset backdrop and the stunning decor by local designers, you couldn’t convince me it wasn’t a rehearsal dinner. At one point, we were on the dance floor and the entire group cheered us on as the “newlyweds for the night.” I was nervous about how my boyfriend would react,  until I looked over and saw that he was having just as much fun as I was.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957075.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The running joke throughout the trip was that he might as well just marry me right then and there. The planners were ready. The photographers were on site. The venue was flawless. Low-key, I was like, “yesss, let the inspiration marinate!” And while I was joking, I was also quietly taking notes.</p>



<p>Beyond the romance, the resort delivers unforgettable experiences like horseback riding along the beach, bird and monkey nature tours, surf lessons, sandboarding, and a hands-on ceramics class. Each day somehow outdid the last.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957077.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our final day, they staged a full wedding — complete with a bride, a chapel ceremony, a saxophone player, cocktail hour, and a reception dinner inside one of the eight-bedroom homes. There was a live band. a private chef, and a level of detail that felt impossible to top.</p>



<p>By the end of the trip, we were both joking (but lowkey serious) about living there someday. I’ve always known I wanted a destination wedding. I just didn’t know where. Without realizing it, I spent five days experiencing exactly what that dream could look like, in a country I had never considered visiting. Nicaragua <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/singapore-vacation-travel-experience-black-woman"">surprised me</a> in the best way. Between the people, the culture, and the undeniable magic of Rancho Santana, I’d recommend it for a wedding, a milestone birthday, or simply a luxurious reset. As for my boyfriend? Let’s just say manifestation is real. Now the only thing left to figure out is how I accidentally plan my way onto a private jet next.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor, it’s my job to test beauty treatments, but there are only a handful that I’m really obsessed with. Sure, there are tons of interesting options out there, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED facials</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skinvive-injectable-moisturizer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">injectable moisturizer</a>, but few are genuinely innovative and game-changing (in my opinion, the single most overused phrase in the beauty industry).  </p>



<p>Without a doubt, one of those innovations and my can’t-live-without product is builder in a bottle, which you may also know as BIAB nails. I’ll even bet money on you trying it and loving it. Here’s everything you need to know about the new nail treatment sweeping salons everywhere. </p>



<h2>What are BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>BIAB (also known as builder gel) was developed by the brand <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Gel Bottle</a>. Creative nail expert and content creator, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/SadieJNails/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sadie Jordan,</a> always uses BIAB on her clients: “It’s a [curable] gel nail enhancement designed to add strength and structure to your natural nails, helping them to grow out without breaking as easily,” says Jordan. She adds that BIAB is more viscous than gel polish. “It allows you to build an apex — the highest part of a nail enhancement, most visible from the side angle — which is what makes your nail more durable.”  </p>



<p>BIAB is layered on top of your natural nail (whatever the length) to lend strength and prevent breakage. BIAB comes in a range of different colors, but the most popular tends to be clear or neutral pink. It can be used as a base coat (with gel polish layered over the top, including nail art) or applied on its own.  </p>

<h2>What are the benefits of BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>The main benefit of BIAB is the ability to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">grow your natural nails</a> underneath. Even long-term nail-biters, or those whose nails are prone to breakage, tend to have success with growth. What’s more, countless BIAB nail looks can be achieved without glue or plastic tips, says Jordan. This means you can have long-lasting manicures with a similar removal process to regular gel by simply filing away the top layer and soaking off the product with acetone. </p>



<p>Another benefit of BIAB is that it can be used alongside <a href=""https://www.thegelbottle.com/shop/37364-pro-nail-forms.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">nail forms</a> (a paper or foil tip) to repair chipped corners. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between BIAB nails, traditional gel, Gel-X nails, and acrylics?  </h2>



<p>It can be hard to tell, but there are differences between BIAB, traditional gel, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/apres-gel-x-nail-extensions"">Gel-X</a>, and acrylics. </p>



<p>Gel nail polish was <a href=""https://www.cnd.com/"">developed by CND</a> under the brand name Shellac and is a liquid polish that is cured and hardened under a UV lamp. Curing makes gel polish chip-resistant and gives it a longer wear.  </p>



<p>BIAB is a form of gel polish that has a stronger base — this is why it assists growth. An upside of BIAB is that it can be soaked off just like gel polish. Both gel polish and BIAB give that incredible, long-lasting shine that regular nail polish can’t achieve. </p>



<p>Gel-X is a gel nail extension system developed by Aprés Nails, where full-cover tips are bonded to the natural nail with gel and cured under a UV lamp, then shaped to your preference. BIAB doesn’t require tips. Instead, it’s applied onto the natural nail.  </p>



<p>Acrylics are created using liquid monomer and powder polymer, which should be mixed carefully by your nail tech. Acrylics don’t need curing under a lamp and harden within a few minutes. If you’re someone who loves really long nails, acrylics tend to be a sturdier option. One similarity between BIAB and acrylics is that once the nail starts to grow out, you can get an infill (where product is applied to the nail growth area).  </p>



<p>So what’s the best technique? It all depends on your budget, what your nail tech offers, the outcome and length you’re looking for, as well as your activity level, or how much you use your hands. </p>

<h2>How long do BIAB nails last? </h2>



<p>Luxury nail artist and beauty professional <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charlotteemilybeauty_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Emily</a> explains that most of her clients come in every three weeks to maintain their BIAB nails. But she notes that if there’s proper nail prep, a BIAB set can last for much longer. That said, keeping BIAB nails on for longer than four weeks isn’t recommended, as lifting can allow water to get trapped beneath the gel and encourage bacterial growth. After three or four weeks, BIAB nails can either be infilled or soaked off.  </p>



<h2>Is there anyone who shouldn’t have BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>Both Emily and Jordan note that those with extremely damaged nails (for example, very thin, extremely brittle, and lifting away from the nail bed) shouldn’t get BIAB nails. In some cases, those with conditions like psoriasis may also want to avoid BIAB nails. “Applying BIAB directly to a severely damaged nail bed can cause heat spikes — a stinging sensation on the nail bed — and the product should not come into contact with skin,” says Jordan.  </p>



<p>A qualified nail tech will let you know whether you’re a suitable candidate for BIAB and can create a treatment plan that’s best suited to your nails. Happily, Emily said she’s never had to turn anyone away from BIAB nails.  </p>

<h2>Are there any downsides to BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>“BIAB does take a little longer to soak off compared to gel polish,” says Jordan, but as long as the top coat is filed and broken down, this isn’t a major issue. “It can also make your nails grow out very fast,” she adds, “so you may need to have manicures more frequently if you don’t like the look of regrowth.”  </p>



<p>At present, BIAB has no downsides for Emily. “My clients and I are happy with the results, and it has created a low-maintenance manicure which is great for a busy lifestyle,” she says.   </p>

<h2>Where can you get BIAB nails, and how much do BIAB nails cost?  </h2>



<p>Today, BIAB is just as widely available as gel polish — if you’re unsure, simply call your local nail salon and ask specifically for the treatment.  </p>



<p>The cost of nails always depends on where you live, with cities being the most expensive. In New York and LA, for example, a typical price range for basic BIAB is between $40 to $80. </p>

<p>Something’s been amiss when I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wash my hair</a>. Instead of the odd few strands escaping — totally normal, by the way — my hands have been filled with near-chunks of hair. It’s a conundrum I can’t crack, because at a glance my hair still looks <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">long and healthy</a>; it just seems that I’m losing more of it. And I’m not the only one. Countless friends have texted me in a panic, convinced their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/female-pattern-hair-loss-baldness-experience"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair is coming out</a> more than usual. Interestingly, TikTok’s hair experts appear to have diagnosed it. Apparently, we’re all experiencing the big <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@abbeyyung/video/7546699386563120414"">winter hair shed</a>. </p>



<p>If I weren’t going through it myself, I’d have assumed winter hair shedding was a myth. I mean, how many more things — besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dry hands</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cracked lips</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dull-skin-causes-dermatologist-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dull skin</a> — can we take? But reaching out to my little black book of experts has proven otherwise. On the plus side, there’s usually nothing to worry about, but here’s everything I’ve learned from the pros about managing it.  </p>



<h2>Firstly, what is hair shedding — and is it normal? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dermatologist_adel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Aamna Adel</a>, consultant dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooOoT-AkJdIvdreb1LWiY2WzlEBHvpTercvOTYFAfbdSZM0Rq0Q"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute hair</a>, says that hair shedding is a normal part of the growth cycle: “Each hair on your scalp goes through phases of growth (otherwise known as anagen), transition (catagen), and rest (telogen).” Dr. Adel adds, “At the end of the cycle, the hair sheds to make room for a new one to grow in. So yes, some shedding is completely normal and happens continuously.” </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/afopeatoyebi/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</a>, a certified trichologist, cosmetic chemist, and head of product at <a href=""https://rukahair.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ruka Hair</a>, adds that on a healthy scalp, anything between 10 to 15% of total hairs are in the telogen or exogen phase at any given point in time, which means that some hair shedding is natural all year round. “It’s normal to shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day,” says Atoyebi, but she adds that this shouldn’t be confused with hair fall from breakage. “This is where the hair shaft fractures, as opposed to falls, from the root,” she explains. You can usually tell the difference because broken hairs are shorter, while hairs that have been shed naturally tend to have a white bulb at the end. </p>



<p>While some shedding is natural, Atoyebi says how much you lose can be influenced by things like stress, illness, nutritional deficiencies — including low protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B12 — as well as hormonal changes, such as pregnancy or certain forms of hormonal contraception. Dr. Adel says that if your hair is thicker or longer, or if you skip hair washing, shedding might appear more obvious. </p>



<p>Some evidence suggests telogen — the resting phase — varies slightly across ethnicities, says Atoyebi. But there’s no data showing that shedding changes with hair type. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but the increased shedding people might notice could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors like stress and nutritional deficiencies.</p><cite>certified trichologist Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Is winter hair shedding real? How can you manage it? </h2>



<p>Dr. Adel notes that many people notice increased shedding in winter, and that there could be a handful of reasons why. First, what she calls seasonal hair cycling: “Some studies suggest more hairs enter the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320509854_Seasonality_of_hair_loss_a_time_series_analysis_of_Google_Trends_data_2004_to_2016"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">shedding phase in autumn</a> and early winter, possibly as a delayed response to summer UV exposure,” says Dr. Adel.  </p>



<p>Second, a dry scalp and hair: “Cold air outside and central heating indoors strip moisture from the scalp, which can disrupt the scalp barrier,” explains Dr. Adel. Last, lifestyle changes: “Reduced sunlight (and therefore vitamin D), higher stress levels, and nutritional changes during winter can all play a role,” says Dr. Adel. She emphasizes that winter shedding is usually temporary, not true hair loss. </p>



<p>Atoyebi says that winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but she echoes that the increased shedding lots of people might notice in winter could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors: “Think stress, illness, and hormonal and nutritional imbalances that commonly accompany the season,” says Atoyebi. Depending on where you live, a lack of sunlight might also be a factor. Reduced sunlight can impact your body’s circadian rhythm — basically, your internal body clock. This could then reduce your quality of sleep. “All of which can impair the immune resilience your body needs to ward off and recover from said triggers,” says Atoyebi.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, you can support your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. </p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>How can you prevent winter hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, Atoyebi suggests supporting your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. “This includes prioritizing a nutrient-dense diet and correcting common deficiencies associated with hair shedding, particularly iron (ferritin), vitamin D, zinc, B12 or folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and ensuring adequate protein intake,” she says. </p>



<p>While I’m not deficient in iron myself, a blood test showed that I needed to increase my vitamin D and folate intake. I also take omega-3, 6, and 9 daily — and I’m noticing a positive difference in my hair shedding.</p>



<p>Besides addressing deficiencies, Dr. Adel suggests prioritizing scalp care, since a healthy scalp supports better hair growth. She recommends using scalp-focused treatments and conditioners to lock in moisture, while avoiding over-scrubbing or harsh exfoliation. I love the ritual of applying <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/products/serum?srsltid=AfmBOopKhDFqOD3FYXENxfKnMQEtdQkxG2VScpENuPF5ZdcdWbFx-5Om"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute’s Density &amp; Repair Scalp Serum</a>, which moisturizes, exfoliates, and soothes the scalp with panthenol, salicylic acid, and niacinamide. Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopbtKLBw_Cnqztua7eIW4TNy2aF4O66SWfl-xcaHqGHwN4WyAbH"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum</a>, with baicapil, an ingredient proven to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">strengthen hair follicles</a>. </p>





<p>Dr. Adel continues, “Don’t avoid washing your hair out of fear of shedding, as this can actually make things worse. Instead, use gentle shampoos, focus on the scalp [when washing], and try not to use overly hot water.” Since I’ve started washing my hair more regularly — every two to three days, and focusing more on the scalp than the lengths — I’ve noticed far less hair shedding each time.</p>



<p>Dr. Adel adds that aggressive towel-drying, tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and even friction from tight scarves and hats can all encourage breakage, so it’s important to be mindful. I swear by a gentle <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmicrofiber-hair-towel-P507559"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">microfiber towel.</a></p>





<h2>When should you see a doctor about hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Atoyebi shares a note of encouragement to those experiencing winter shedding: “Although it can be very unsettling, diffuse shedding [where hair sheds evenly across the scalp] does not lead to baldness,” she says. “Provided that the underlying trigger is addressed, this kind of shedding is completely reversible, with regrowth starting as soon as three months after addressing the trigger.” </p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re worried about the rate at which your hair is shedding, Atoyebi recommends seeing your doctor or a certified trichologist for a blood test: “This can help identify emerging deficiencies or hormonal imbalances, allowing for appropriate, clinician-guided supplementation,” she says.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956916.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>A new year means a new set of trending colors for the style set to swoon over. Last year was all about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellow</a>; before that, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie pink</a> and a highlighter shade of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">Brat green</a> <em>were</em> the moment. But fashion experts predict that something a little less definitive will infiltrate the market in 2026. Enter specific hues and color combinations that are as vibrant as they are complimentary to each other. “Most of us aren’t living in just one mood or style; instead we’re balancing calm with chaos, and seriousness with play,” says Xanthe Wells, VP of Global Creative at <a href=""https://newsroom.pinterest.com/news/from-cool-blue-to-persimmon-meet-the-2026-pinterest-palette/"">Pinterest</a>. The colors of 2026, she adds: “really capture how layered life feels right now.” <br /><br />More than a handful of bright colors have already popped up on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">runways</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">red carpets</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2026-street-style"">street-style</a> looks for 2026, proving that the muted neutrals that defined “quiet luxury” are on the decline and something more effervescent is blooming in its place. From traditional primary pigments — red, blue, and yellow — to unexpected pairings like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pantone-color-of-the-year-2025-mocha-mousse"">chocolate brown</a> and frost blue, this more dynamic approach is a great opportunity to let your mood shine. “Color has become a language people use to express who they are and intentionally shape how they want to feel,” Wells says. Not yet convinced? Continue ahead for more about the colors that will reign supreme in 2026 fashion.</p>

<h2>Jade Green</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956899.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the latest collection from designers such as <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-menswear/amiri/slideshow/collection#26"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Acne Studios</a>, then you know that the color jade is already one of the hues of the season. According to Wells, this shade of green should feel more grounded than the playful mint color that might already be in your closet, allowing it to double as a neutral all year long. <br /><br />“The color blends serenity with sophisticated elegance, yet still makes a statement,” Wells says. Those looking for a bolder take on jade should consider investing in a pair of  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">sneakers</a> so punchy, they go with nearly anything and everything.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Primary Palettes</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956902.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Some of the best color combinations are the ones that may seem a little too on the nose. For proof, look to the number of designers who harnessed a primary color palette –– yellow, blue, and red –– in recent collections. At <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loewe</a>, this manifested in tulip-shaped leather jackets and strategically-layered basics, whereas <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection#7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DSquared2</a> took a more eclectic approach reminiscent of streetwear in the ‘90s. Colorblocked prints and stripes are a great way to embrace the trend, while styling individually-hued pieces together makes a Crayola-level impact.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Plum Noir</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956903.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>A stark contrast to many of the bright, playful colors on trend for 2026, dark plum noir is moody yet striking, making it a great alternative for those who tend to wear all black. Between the rich suede outerwear from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/tom-ford/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford</a> and the romantic goth aesthetic of Rabanne’s pleated babydoll dresses, the deep berry hue has the power to work as both a staple and an accent in your wardrobe. Plus, it pairs well with other standout shades of the season, including electric wasabi and soft persimmon (more on that below). <br /><br />“They feel unexpected at first glance, but when you see them together, it just clicks and creates this intriguing balance,” Wells explains. “Plum noir brings this cool, collected depth, while wasabi instantly wakes up a space.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Electric Wasabi</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956901.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>From <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/prada/slideshow/collection#7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Prada</a> to <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/azzedine-alaia/slideshow/collection#36"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alaïa</a> to the fringed clutch that creative director Jonathan Anderson presented at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-couture/christian-dior/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dior,</a> a neon yellow shade of green –– we’re dubbing it electric wasabi –– will reign supreme for 2026. Though it may seem intimidating for some, the key is to start small. A pair of statement flats can be a great place to start.<br /><br />“You can also layer a colorful piece under a neutral jacket or sweater,” Wells says. “The goal is to sprinkle in color in ways that feel authentic to you.” For a more head-turning look, layer a brightly-colored bra under a sheer top or peeking over a plunging neckline.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Shocking Pink</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956904.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The industry’s penchant for pink is set to continue well into 2026. The bright magenta of shocking pink consistently popped up across the latest runway collections. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/mm6-maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/collection#17"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">MM6 Maison Margiela</a> showcased head-to-toe pink looks, while <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#34"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry</a> offered ample style inspo by adding a neon pink scarf to an otherwise muted outfit. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">Bright tights</a> underneath mini dresses and sheer skirts are another great option if you’re looking to (literally) dip your foot into the trend instead of jumping right in. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chocolate Brown &amp; Blue Frost</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956906.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mint chocolate chip, anyone? Repurpose the icy blue pieces you likely added to your closet in 2025 by pairing them with chocolate brown. If you’re looking for some cold-weather inspiration, turn to the team at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-menswear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection#13"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Acne Studios</a>, who layered a brown <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer coat</a> with a light-blue shirt peeking out from underneath in their fall 2026 collection. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/emilia-wickstead/slideshow/collection#22"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emilia Wickstead</a>, meanwhile, offered up a host of sweaters in cheery stripes for a more nostalgic feel. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Juicy Persimmon </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956905.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’d like to look good enough to eat, try on a few pieces in the rich, reddish shade of orange aptly named persimmon. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/christopher-john-rogers/slideshow/collection#23"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christopher John Rogers</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/no-21/slideshow/collection#4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">No. 21</a> were just a few of the brands who embraced the bright hue during the Spring 2026 collections, with bold separates and monochromatic looks galore. Despite the tropical feel, the shade transitions well into the winter months, too — persimmon-colored cold-weather accessories like a beanie or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">hooded scarf</a> are bound to make a statement.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Turquoise</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956900.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Brands all around the world, including <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/shanghai-spring-2026/xu-zhi/slideshow/collection#43"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Xu Zhi</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/patou/slideshow/collection#36"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Patou</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/j-w-anderson/slideshow/collection#31"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">JW Anderson</a> are incorporating turquoise into their collections for fall 2026, making it a must-have shade for the seasons ahead. Whether you invest in turquoise outerwear à la the latest <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#21"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry</a> collection or opt for a jewel-toned pair of leather gloves, the standout hue is a lot easier to integrate into your wardrobe than you may think. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, February is not playing around. This is an eclipse month, the official start of the Year of the Fire House, and one of those rare chapters where it feels like the universe is flipping multiple switches at once. The month opens with a vibrant Full Moon in Leo on February 1<sup>st</sup>, a heart-forward, spotlight-stealing lunation that kicks off eclipse season. </p>



<p>Since this Full Moon arrives just before a solar eclipse, it acts as a culmination point, illuminating themes that began around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/new-moon-in-leo-2025-july-horoscope-meaning-effects"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Leo New Moon</a> six months ago. Think creativity, confidence, romance, leadership, and self-expression. Where were you dimming your light last summer, and where are you finally ready to celebrate yourself now? The shadow here is ego or performative confidence, but the medicine is remembering that taking up space does not require apology. </p>



<p>Just two days later, we hit another major milestone as Uranus, the Planet of Surprise, stations direct in Taurus for the final stretch of its transit, something we will not see again in our lifetimes. This is big. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been shaking up our relationship with money, food systems, land, labor, and material security. As it moves forward without another retrograde in this sign, expect acceleration. </p>



<p>Economically and socially, conversations around value, resources, sustainability, and wealth distribution may reach turning points. Politically, this can look like sudden shifts tied to land, currency, or supply chains. On a personal level, it is about finally acting on the changes you’ve been circling for years. Your comfort zone is officially obsolete. </p>



<p>The first half of February carries a distinctly Aquarian flavor. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Pluto all in Aquarius, the collective mood is future-focused, innovative, and a little rebellious. We’re thinking bigger than ourselves, questioning systems, and imagining new ways of living and organizing. Then, starting February 6th, the energy softens as Mercury enters Pisces, followed by Venus entering Pisces on February 10th. This shift brings emotion, intuition, and compassion back into the picture. Logic gives way to feeling and vision meets vulnerability. It’s a reminder that even as we dream up new futures, we still need tenderness, beauty, and emotional honesty to sustain them. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the astrology takes a sharp turn as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, joining Neptune, which recently made the same move. After years of Saturn in Pisces fog, this is a wake-up call. Saturn in Aries is about discipline, courage, and taking responsibility for your desires. No more waiting for permission. No more spiritual bypassing. When Saturn and Neptune conjoin on February 20th, the message is loud and clear: our dreams require structure and inspiration needs action. This is a rare alignment that supports launching creative projects, movements, or personal initiatives that feel both visionary and grounded. The shadow of the conjunction is ego battles or authority figures posturing for dominance, especially on a global scale. The higher path is conscious leadership that builds rather than destroys. </p>



<p>The centerpiece of the month is the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius at 28 degrees, a potent reset that squares Uranus in Taurus. This is not subtle energy. Expect breakthroughs, plot twists, and moments that force rapid change. Collectively, this can coincide with political shocks, technological shifts, or sudden awakenings that demand adaptability. Personally, you may feel restless, electrified, and oddly optimistic all at once. Life may move faster than planned. The key is practicing flexibility. </p>



<p>Pisces Season begins the very next day on February 18th, reminding us that even during revolution, rest matters. As Mercury retrograde begins on February 26th in Pisces, the month closes with an invitation to slow down, reflect, and release. Forgive where you can. Tie up loose ends, sleep more, create more, and love more. You cannot spell r<strong><em>evol</em></strong>ution without love, and this month reminds us that the most sustainable change always begins in the heart. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, February starts with fireworks, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of creativity, faith, freedom, and self-expression, reminding you that you were never meant to play small. This is a feel-good, heart-opening moment where passion projects, romantic sparks, or creative risks reach a turning point. You may feel inspired to put yourself out there, share your work, or follow joy more unapologetically. The shadow, though, is burnout or overconfidence. Leo Full Moons can make everything feel urgent and dramatic, so pace yourself. You do not need to prove your brilliance by exhausting yourself. Let confidence come from authenticity, not pressure. </p>



<p>A few days later, the energy shifts in your favor as Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for its final stretch. This is a green light moment. Financial progress that felt stalled can suddenly move forward, and new ideas around income, pricing, or independence may land quickly. Because Uranus <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">rules Aquarius season</a>, which dominates most of February in your friendship, technology, and community sector, this is also a powerful time to show up more online, collaborate, or lean into digital platforms. Friendships, group projects, and social media can become surprisingly lucrative or confidence-boosting. Say yes to connections that feel future-focused and mutually supportive, especially if they align with your long-term goals. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight turns fully toward you as Saturn enters your sign on February 13th, beginning a two-year chapter of growth, responsibility, and leadership. This is not light energy, but it is meaningful. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, to commit to who you are becoming, and to step into authority over your life. Some days may feel heavy, like the pressure is on, but here’s the magic: Neptune is also in your sign, adding vision, faith, and imagination. When Saturn and Neptune meet on February 20th, you experience a rare blend of discipline and dreaminess. This is a metamorphosis moment. You’re learning how to build your dreams in real time. The start of the Year of the Fire Horse, paired with the Aquarius solar eclipse in your community sector, reinforces this theme. You’re not just changing yourself, you’re changing how you lead, inspire, and move within the collective. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins on February 18th, shifting your focus inward. After such an activating start to the year, you’re invited to rest, reflect, and reconnect with your spiritual side. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages solitude, forgiveness, and tying up loose emotional ends. This is not a slowdown, it’s sacred preparation. The next four weeks are about integrating everything you’ve learned, releasing old identities, and clearing space for your birthday season and the astrological new year ahead. Trust that stepping back now helps you come back stronger, wiser, and more aligned than ever. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, February marks a once-in-a-lifetime turning point for you. When Uranus stations direct in your sign early this month, it officially enters the final stretch of a transit you will not experience again in this lifetime. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been reshaping your identity, your body, your confidence, and your relationship to stability. Now, there’s no more backtracking. The final months of this transit, through to April 26th, are about embodiment. This is your moment to fully <em>own </em>the version of yourself that has been quietly emerging. Radical self-acceptance, personal reinvention, and freedom from old labels are not optional anymore… they’re the assignment. The more you resist change, the louder it gets. The more you cooperate, the more empowered you feel. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st sets the tone by illuminating your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. You may feel pulled between craving comfort and needing independence. This Full Moon can bring breakthroughs around living situations, family roles, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/08/11094940/workplace-boundaries-unhealthy-environment"">or emotional boundaries</a>. The magic here is realizing that you can create safety without staying small. The shadow is stubbornness or emotional defensiveness. Let yourself feel proud of how far you have come, but stay open to growth. Security does not mean stagnation anymore. </p>



<p>Mid-month, things get real as we approach the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which lands in your career and public life sector and squares Uranus now direct in your sign. This is major. Eclipses bring sudden shifts, and this one may force a choice between authenticity and expectation. Career pivots, changes in direction, or moments of visibility may arrive unexpectedly. The tension is real, but it is productive. If something collapses or feels unstable, it is because it cannot come with you into the next chapter. This eclipse asks you to trust the version of yourself that Uranus has been sculpting for years, even if the world has not fully caught up yet. </p>



<p>As February unfolds,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects""> Aquarius Season keeps</a> your focus on ambition and long-term goals, while Saturn entering Aries on February 13th pushes you to take rest, healing, and mental health seriously. You’re learning that growth requires recovery, not just effort. By the time Pisces Season begins later in the month, the energy softens, encouraging spiritual grounding and community support. Mercury retrograde toward the end of February invites reflection rather than reaction. Taurus, this isn’t a month to rush. It’s a month to <em>claim</em>. You’re stepping into the final chapter of a long reinvention. Make it intentional, make it honest, and make it yours. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, February feels like a breath of fresh air and a spark to the mind all at once. The month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and self-expression sector. This is a moment of clarity around your voice. A conversation, announcement, creative project, or piece of writing may reach a culmination point. You may feel more confident sharing your thoughts or finally being seen for your intelligence and creativity. The shadow is overperforming or feeling like you have to say everything at once. Let your words land with intention. You don’t need to dominate the room to make an impact. </p>



<p>One of the biggest themes for you this month is movement, mentally, socially, and spiritually. With Uranus now direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, healing, and intuition sector, breakthroughs may come quietly but powerfully. Old fears, limiting beliefs, or mental habits you’ve outgrown are ready to dissolve for good during the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus through April. Pay attention to dreams, sudden insights, or moments of clarity that arrive out of nowhere. As an Air sign, you may be tempted to overthink these shifts, but this transit works best when you trust your inner knowing rather than analyzing it to death. </p>



<p>Mid-month brings a major reset with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, landing in your fellow Air sign and activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture vision. This eclipse kicks off the Year of the Fire Horse, and for you, it feels like momentum returning after a period of mental fog. Opportunities to expand your world, learn something new, or share your ideas more widely may appear suddenly. The square to Uranus means plans may change quickly, but those changes are purposeful. Stay flexible. This is not about controlling the path, but following the curiosity that pulls you forward. </p>



<p>As the month winds down, the focus shifts to your career and public life as Pisces season begins, followed by Mercury retrograde on February 26th in your professional sector. Because Mercury is your ruling planet, you will feel this deeply. Work plans may slow, feedback may feel confusing, or old goals may need revision. This is not a failure moment, it is a reroute. Instead of spiraling, use this time to reflect on what success actually means to you now. Dream up new possibilities without forcing immediate answers. February is asking you to trust that clarity arrives when you stop rushing it. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, February hits different for you because you’re ruled by the moon, and this month is basically a lunar rollercoaster in the best and most transformative way. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your money, self-worth, and security sector, bringing big feelings around value, confidence, and what you deserve. This can look like a financial win, a reality check, or a moment where you finally realize you’ve been underestimating yourself. Because eclipse season begins immediately after, emotions may feel heightened, dramatic, or extra revealing. Try not to react impulsively. Lunar energy always passes, but the insights it brings are lasting. If something feels loud, it’s because it needs your attention, not your panic. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight intensifies with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which activates your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. For a moon-ruled sign, eclipses can feel like emotional plot twists. You may experience breakthroughs around trust, vulnerability, finances tied to others, or emotional bonds that no longer feel safe or reciprocal. Things may shift quickly, especially as this eclipse squares Uranus, bringing sudden realizations or changes. Breathe through it… What’s being cleared now is making space for deeper, healthier connections. You are not losing control, you’re releasing emotional weight you were never meant to carry alone. </p>



<p>One of the most important long-term themes for you begins this month as Saturn and Neptune both move through Aries, your career and public life sector. Yes, this is very different energy from your natural watery rhythm, but it is also powerful. Aries is a fellow Cardinal sign, which means you’re being asked to lead, initiate, and take yourself seriously in new ways. Saturn may bring pressure, responsibility, or moments of self-doubt around your path, while Neptune adds vision, faith, and creativity. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel a strong pull toward a new purpose or calling. The key is not shrinking in the presence of fire. You don’t need to become someone else to succeed. Lead with emotional intelligence. Your sensitivity is not a weakness here, it is your edge. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces season begins, harmonizing with your Cancer sun and offering emotional relief. After a month of intensity, Pisces Season invites rest, spiritual reflection, creativity, and compassion. Mercury retrograde late in the month encourages you to slow down, revisit old beliefs, and give yourself grace. You’re not behind… you’re integrating. February teaches you that emotional courage is just as powerful as action. When you honor your feelings instead of fighting them, you move forward with far more strength than you realize. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, February opens with <em>your </em>moment in the spotlight, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lands in your identity, confidence, and self-expression sector, officially kicking oﬀ eclipse season and reminding everyone who the main character is. This is a powerful culmination point tied to intentions you set<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/leo-season-2025-horoscope-july-meaning-effects""> around Leo Season</a> last summer. You may feel seen, celebrated, or finally ready to own a version of yourself you’ve been growing into quietly. Creativity, romance, leadership, and self-belief are amplified. The shadow is overdoing it, overpromising, or feeling crushed if the applause doesn’t come fast enough. Let this Full Moon be about authentic confidence, not performance. You don’t need to prove anything… your presence already speaks. </p>



<p>For most of the month, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season puts your relationships</a> front and center, and things get real fast. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse later in the month activates your partnership sector and squares Uranus in Taurus, which has been shaking up your home, family, and emotional foundation for years. Translation: relationship dynamics may force conversations you’ve been avoiding. A partnership could change form, deepen, or end so that something more honest can take its place. Living situations, family roles, or emotional attachments may suddenly feel incompatible with who you’re becoming. This eclipse isn’t the most comfortable, but it is necessary. Breakthroughs arrive when you stop trying to control the narrative and allow the truth to surface, even if it disrupts the status quo. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Saturn and Neptune in Aries begin reshaping your beliefs, worldview, and sense of purpose. You’re being asked to commit to a bigger vision for your life, not just chase validation. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel called to step into a leadership role, spiritual path, or long-term goal that requires courage and consistency. The challenge is impatience. Fire wants everything now, but this chapter rewards faith paired with discipline. Trust that clarity builds through action, not just confidence. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy deepens as Pisces Season activates your intimacy, shared resources, and healing sector. After a very visible, relationally charged start to the month, you’re invited inward. Emotional honesty, vulnerability, and energetic cleanup become priorities. Mercury retrograde late in February encourages reflection around trust, finances tied to others, and emotional boundaries. This is not a step back, it’s integration. February teaches you that true main-character energy isn’t about being adored, it’s about being aligned. When you honor that, everything else follows. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, February is not just another month for you. It’s a preview episode. The eclipse storyline unfolding now is actively leading toward the total lunar eclipse in your sign on 3/3/2026, and what you feel, notice, or question around mid-February is part of a much bigger arc. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your rest, healing, and subconscious sector, stirring emotions, memories, and realizations that may not fully make sense yet. That’s okay. This is your cue to slow down and listen. The work right now isn’t fixing or optimizing. It’s observing patterns, especially around burnout, self-criticism, or where you’ve been carrying more than your share. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season and</a> the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activate your work, wellness, and daily routines sector. This is major for you. Eclipses here can bring sudden shifts in schedule, job dynamics, health habits, or how you structure your days. Something may stop working the way it used to, and that’s intentional. This eclipse is asking you to redesign your life in a way that supports your energy, not just your productivity. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes may feel abrupt or inconvenient, but they’re opening the door to a more sustainable rhythm. Think of this as the first draft. The full revelation comes in March. </p>



<p>Relationships also play a central role this month as Pisces season begins on February 18th, activating your partnership sector. Emotional sensitivity increases, and you may feel more aware of imbalances, unspoken expectations, or where you’ve been over-functioning in connection. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages reflection rather than confrontation. This is not about making final decisions yet. It’s about noticing how your body responds to certain people and commitments. Your nervous system is giving you data. Trust it. </p>



<p>The most important preparation you can do now is rest, honesty, and gentle recalibration. February is helping you shed layers before the 3/3 Virgo eclipse asks you to step into a new version of yourself. You don’t need to rush clarity. You need to protect your energy, simplify where possible, and stay curious about what’s ending naturally. This is not a breakdown… it’s a sacred edit. And you are right on time. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, February opens with a clarifying moment as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This lunation asks you to look closely at who you’re building with and where you truly belong. You may feel proud of a collective achievement, step into a more visible role within a group, or realize that certain social dynamics no longer fit the future you’re envisioning. The shadow here is staying connected out of obligation or fear of rocking the boat. Let this Full Moon remind you that alignment matters more than approval. </p>



<p>As the month moves forward, the tone deepens significantly. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your partnership and marriage sector for the next several years. This is a major chapter opener. Saturn brings reality checks, boundaries, and long-term commitments, while Neptune dissolves illusions and asks for soul-level honesty. Together, they begin reshaping how you approach relationships of all kinds. Some connections may feel heavier, more serious, or more demanding, while others reveal whether they can actually go the distance. The most important shift, though, starts internally. Your relationship with yourself is being redefined, and from that place, your standards naturally rise. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector, adding unpredictability to the mix. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, sparks can fly unexpectedly. A creative breakthrough, romantic turning point, or sudden realization about what truly brings you joy may arrive quickly. While this energy can feel destabilizing, it’s also liberating. It challenges you to choose pleasure, authenticity, and passion without apologizing or over-explaining. If something cracks open now, it’s because it was limiting your ability to feel alive. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward work, wellness, and daily balance, encouraging you to slow down and integrate everything you’ve learned. Mercury retrograde later in February asks you to revisit habits, commitments, and routines that affect your energy. Libra, February is not about rushing relationship decisions. It’s about clarity, honesty, and laying a foundation that can actually support love, partnership, and self-respect over time. The choices you make now echo far beyond this month, so trust the pacing. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, February opens with a moment that puts you <em>on the map</em>, whether you asked for it or not. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your career, reputation, and legacy sector, bringing a culmination or revelation around your professional life. This could look like recognition, a new role, a public win, or the realization that the version of success you’ve been chasing no longer fits. And yes, both can be true at the same time. The shadow of this Full Moon is over-identifying with achievement or feeling pressure to perform. The lesson is visibility without self-betrayal. Let yourself be seen, but not at the cost of your well-being. </p>



<p>Around this same time, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing a noticeable shift in your partnership and relationship sector. After years of unpredictability, surprises, and emotional curveballs in one-on-one dynamics, things begin to stabilize in a new way. Not “back to normal,” but clearer. You may feel more grounded in what you want from relationships, less reactive to sudden changes, and more confident advocating for space, honesty, or freedom. This direct motion helps rebalance your relational life, especially after a long period of adapting to the unexpected. The lesson now is integration. You don’t have to abandon intimacy to protect your independence. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, a deeper shift begins as Neptune and Saturn move through Aries, your work, routines, and energy-management sector. Neptune is already here, heightening your sensitivity to environments, tasks, and expectations that drain you. You’re no longer willing to tolerate work that feels misaligned, performative, or soul-sucking. Saturn’s entry on February 13th, followed by their conjunction on February 20th, asks you to restructure how you work, not just what you work toward. Boundaries become non-negotiable. You may need to be a little more “selfish” with your energy, and that’s not a flaw, it’s wisdom. This is the beginning of a longer chapter where sustainable success matters more than grinding for approval. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your home and emotional foundations sector, creating tension between public life and private needs. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes around living situations, family dynamics, or emotional security may arrive suddenly. You may realize that certain professional goals require a different kind of support system, or that your current setup is no longer compatible with the life you’re building. The Leo–Aquarius polarity running through this month makes one thing clear: you can’t keep sacrificing your inner world for external validation. </p>



<p>By the end of February, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces Season begins, harmonizing with your Scorpio nature. This brings more creativity, romance, play, and emotional release. You’re reminded that joy is not a reward for productivity, it’s a necessity. Mercury retrograde later in the month invites reflection rather than action, helping you integrate everything you’ve learned. Scorpio, this eclipse season isn’t just about career breakthroughs, it’s about finally letting the world see the full range of what you oﬀer. You have talents, gifts, and ideas that deserve daylight. Stop hiding them. The right people are ready to receive what you’ve been holding back. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, February opens with a spark that reignites your sense of purpose and possibility. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of travel, education, belief systems, and long-term vision, bringing clarity or culmination around a dream you’ve been nurturing since last summer. You may feel ready to take a leap, say yes to an opportunity, or finally trust a path that once felt uncertain. This Full Moon is about faith, but the shadow is overconfidence or assuming everything will work out without eﬀort. Let inspiration lead you forward, but back it up with follow-through. </p>



<p>The month continues with a strong Aquarian influence as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius season activates</a> your communication, learning, and local community sector. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse mid-month brings sudden shifts in how you share ideas, connect, or move through your daily environment. Conversations, contracts, or plans may change quickly, but these shifts are meant to open new doors. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, flexibility is essential. The more open you are to rerouting, the easier this transition becomes. Think curiosity over control. </p>



<p>A major long-term shift arrives as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your sector of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This marks the beginning of a more serious relationship with your passions. You’re being asked to commit to what lights you up, not just chase excitement. Neptune brings imagination and inspiration, while Saturn asks for structure and discipline. Together, they help you turn play into purpose. The challenge is impatience. Creative growth takes time, even when the vision feels urgent. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins, drawing your focus toward home, emotional grounding, and rest. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than action, especially around family matters or personal decisions. This is a moment to slow down, integrate the lessons of an intense month, and reconnect with what feels emotionally supportive. Sagittarius, February reminds you that expansion doesn’t always mean movement. Sometimes growth happens when you let yourself land.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, February opens with a moment that asks you to slow down and feel before you act. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth, bringing a culmination around trust, vulnerability, or financial entanglements. This can look like an important conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or a moment where you see clearly what feels reciprocal and what doesn’t. The shadow here is control or emotional withdrawal. The medicine is honesty. Let yourself be real about what you need instead of managing everything from behind the scenes. </p>



<p>The bigger shift arrives mid-month, and for you, it’s <em>major</em>. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, ending its two-and-a-half-year journey through Pisces. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’ve felt Saturn in Pisces deeply, often as emotional fatigue, blurred boundaries, or the pressure to hold space for others without clear structure. Saturn moving into Aries is a sharp pivot. This is fire, not water. Action, not ambiguity. But here’s the tension: Aries squares Capricorn. Over the next two years, you may feel challenged to act faster than you’re comfortable with, to initiate before everything feels perfectly planned. Frustration can arise if you cling too tightly to control. The growth edge is learning when to lead boldly instead of cautiously. You don’t lose authority by adapting, you expand it. </p>



<p>That lesson intensifies as Saturn conjoins Neptune on February 20th, activating your home, family, and emotional foundations sector. This is about restructuring your inner world, not just your external goals. You may feel called to redefine what stability actually means, where you live, who you build with, or how you emotionally ground yourself. Neptune adds sensitivity and imagination, while Saturn demands realism. Together, they ask you to build a life that supports your nervous system, not just your resume. This is not about abandoning ambition, it’s about rooting it somewhere sustainable. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward communication, mindset, and emotional processing. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than decisive action. Old conversations may resurface. Plans may need revising. Take that as a gift, not a setback. Capricorn, February is a turning point. You’re learning how to lead without carrying everything alone, how to adapt without losing yourself, and how to build a future that feels as solid internally as it looks externally. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, February opens with your relationships front and center as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your partnership sector. This is a culmination point around love, commitment, collaboration, or even long-standing dynamics that have needed clarity for a while. You may feel seen by someone in a new way or finally realize where a relationship has been more about performance than presence. The shadow here is ego clashes or projecting instead of listening. The growth is learning that real connection does not threaten your independence, it strengthens it. </p>



<p>Then, everything pivots toward <em>you</em>. The first three weeks of February are dominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">by Aquarius Season</a>, and this year, it’s not subtle. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign is a major identity reset, one that you will continue to feel echoes of for the next two years. Eclipses in your sign are not casual… they’re chapter-defining. This one asks you to shed an old version of yourself, whether that’s a role, label, or way of moving through the world that no longer fits. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, your modern ruler, changes may feel sudden or destabilizing at first. Plans can shift quickly. Your sense of direction may evolve overnight. Trust that whatever is cracking open now is making room for a more authentic version of you to emerge. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Uranus stations direct in Taurus early in the month, ending its final retrograde in a sign it will not revisit in your lifetime. As a Uranus-ruled sign, you feel this shift deeply. This direct motion brings momentum to changes around home, family, emotional security, and where you put down roots. Uranus’ shift direct reminds you that growth requires movement, even when it disrupts comfort. This isn’t about chaos for chaos’ sake. It’s about liberation. This February, the universe is nudging you to choose evolution over familiarity. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the plot thickens as Saturn, your traditional ruler, enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th. Saturn moving into Aries activates your communication, mindset, and learning sector, asking you to take your ideas seriously and follow through on them. This is about disciplined thinking, intentional speech, and committing to a vision rather than floating between possibilities. With Neptune involved, dreams feel vivid, but Saturn insists on structure. The tension you may feel is between wanting freedom and needing responsibility. The breakthrough comes when you realize you can have both. Aquarius, February is a spotlight moment. You’re being reshaped in real time. Let the world see you as you are becoming, not as you used to be. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, of all the signs, you <em>made it</em>. February marks the end of one of the most intense chapters of your life as Saturn finally leaves your sign, closing a cycle that began back in 2023. This transit has tested your boundaries, maturity, resilience, and sense of self in ways that few people around you could fully see. You were asked to grow up, and show up, even when you were tired, unsure, or grieving old versions of yourself. The weight begins to lift this month, and while you’re not magically “done” with the lessons, you’re done carrying them alone. Take a moment to honor yourself. Seriously. </p>



<p>Before Saturn fully changes the game, the month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, activating your work, health, and daily routines sector. This can bring clarity around habits, jobs, or responsibilities that have been draining you. You may realize how much you’ve been doing on empty, or finally see which systems no longer support your energy. The shadow is pushing through exhaustion just to prove you can. You don’t need to prove anything anymore. This Full Moon asks you to choose sustainability over self-sacrifice. </p>



<p>The real plot twist arrives mid-month when Saturn enters Aries, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for the next two years. At first glance, this could sound intense, Saturn is still Saturn, after all. But here’s the magic: Neptune is already in Aries too. This means that for the first time in years, discipline and dreaming are working <em>together </em>for you, especially around finances. Instead of feeling restricted, you’re learning how to build something real from your imagination. Around the Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, you may have a breakthrough around income, pricing your work, or realizing that you’re allowed to be both spiritual and supported. You’re not here to struggle forever. That chapter is closing. </p>



<p>As the month continues, Pisces Season begins, returning the spotlight to you and reminding you who you are beneath the pressure. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse earlier in the month may have stirred subconscious fears or old patterns, but by the end of February, clarity replaces confusion. Mercury retrograde invites reflection, forgiveness, and gentle release rather than big pushes. Pisces, February isn’t about rushing forward. It’s about exhaling. You’ve done the hard part. Now you get to build a life that actually feels like yours, with faith, structure, and self-worth finally aligned. </p>

<p>While Oregon became a state in 1859, Latines have been part of the region for more than 150 years. Arriving mostly from Mexico within decades of statehood and, in some cases, before it, they often came as laborers, working railroads, agriculture, mining, and ranching. And today, the more than 70,000 Latines who call Portland home carry that legacy forward, contributing not only to the city’s economy but to its cultural fabric, politics, and future.</p>



<p>These days, much of the community — still overwhelmingly Mexican, but also shaped by migrants from across Central America, South America, and the Caribbean — are behind the city’s community pillars. During a recent trip to Portland, sponsored by <a href=""https://www.travelportland.com/"">Travel Portland</a>, I experienced these bustling Latine-owned businesses firsthand. </p>

<p>I spent the initial hours of my first night at <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a wellness space and shop selling plant-based beauty and wellness products hand-mixed by owner and curanderista Yvonne Pérez Emerson. Drawing from her Indigenous Mexican and Scottish lineage, she also offers healing services including limpias, rebozo rituals, drum cleansing, and hapé ceremonies. After first holding me in a plática — a heart-to-heart conversation meant to better understand my emotional and spiritual state — I laid down on a bodywork table as she utilized prayer, sacred plants, cleansing smoke, breath, rhythm, and, at times, an egg to clear dense, stagnant energies and attachments throughout my body. The limpia, deeply emotional and beautifully insightful, eased the weight I had been carrying in my mind, body, and spirit, leaving me calm, open, and ready for the weekend ahead. </p>



<p>An adorably walkable city where history and progressive fight live on every corner, some mornings I walked past walls shouting reminders like “the border crossed us” — a popular Mexican saying that speaks to how the U.S. invaded Mexico and claimed its land, turning Mexican residents into so-called immigrants overnight — before grabbing a veggie burrito at Mexican-owned <a href=""https://losburrossupremos.com/"">Los Burros Supremos</a>. During the day, I hiked Forest Park, the largest urban park in the country, with <a href=""https://aroundportlandtours.com/"">Around Portland Tours</a>, learning both about how locals are protecting native flora and fauna as well as the mystical, age-old tales of women who fled and avenged the violence of men, their secrets and mysteries still held safe under the shadowy canopy of the Douglas firs. At night, I made my way to <a href=""https://milagro.org/"">Teatro Milagro</a>, a Latine arts and culture center that’s been serving the community since 1985, to catch <em>Autoretrato de Fridita,</em> a table-top puppetry show telling the story of a young Frida Kahlo and how she used her imagination and a box of paints to help her overcome challenges and create her own world amid the Mexican Revolution.</p>

<p>Other days, I was immersed in the city’s often-overlooked history. At the <a href=""https://www.ohs.org/"">Oregon Historical Society</a>, I learned about the nearly 15,000 Mexican men who came to Oregon during World War II through the Bracero Program, helping sustain the state’s farming and timber industries while U.S. men were deployed, and often experiencing wage theft, dangerous conditions, and segregation in return. At the <a href=""https://www.portlandmuseum.org/"">Portland Museum of Art</a>, I marveled at abstract works by Afro-Puerto Rican artist Iván Carmona Rosario that took inspiration from the mountains of a Caribbean land we both call home. And at <a href=""https://letshopscotch.com/locations/portland"">Hopscotch</a>, an immersive art experience, I wept in the Secret Garden, a room by artists Paloma Cortez and Pamela Rachel, where participants safely and anonymously share their deepest secrets, trusting strangers to listen and hold them beneath the shelter of artistic tree and bush forms. Finally, I ended the night, and my trip, at <a href=""https://www.barpalomar.com/"">Palomar</a>, a tropical, dimly-lit Cuban restaurant-bar, savoring a deeply satisfying jackfruit ropa vieja tostada.</p>



<p>When I boarded my flight back home to Orlando, I was deeply proud of the Latines who, for generations, have carved out home in this Northwest city, and eager to uplift their stories, spaces, and brands.</p>



<h2><strong>Orox’s Leather Goods</strong></h2>



<p>The people have spoken, and they have named <a href=""https://www.oroxleather.com/"">Orox</a> the best-smelling shop in Portland. The scent of warm leather may initially draw passersby into the store and workshop in the city’s Old Town district, but it’s the quality of the handbags, aprons, and jackets — and the multi-generational story behind each piece – that keeps them coming back. </p>



<p>The story of Orox — a play on Oregon and Oaxaca, the Mexican city where its origins begin — dates back to 1933, when Don Felipe Martínez Audelo began crafting custom leather baseball gear and belts for his own team, Los Audelos. His grandson, José, would later hone the family trade in Japan, where he spent years developing and manufacturing his own leather designs. When José eventually returned to Oaxaca, he believed he would leave the craft behind. Instead, his son, Martín, moved to Portland, studied business, and reignited the family legacy.</p>





<p>Today, Orox is a family-owned and -run business, grounded in the belief that family is formed not only through blood but also through chosen bonds. From the aprons worn by restaurant chefs, to the purses slung over women’s shoulders, to the journals university students fill with notes, each piece proudly carries the Orox name.</p>



<p>And the leather goods, designed by José in Oaxaca and handcrafted and assembled in the Portland shop, are made to last lifetimes. “We aim to create high-quality, durable goods that, while stylish, don’t go in and out of style,” the website notes of its items. “We hope that our products will be used and loved for years, and eventually passed on to the next generation.”</p>



<h2><strong>Make &amp; Mary’s Wellness Essentials</strong></h2>





<p>Drawing inspiration from her ancestral lineage — Mexican and Scottish — herbalist and curandera Yvonne Pérez Emerson uses earth-based wisdom to grow, blend, and bottle botanical offerings through her brand <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/"">Make &amp; Mary</a>. Since 2016, the brand has crafted and refined wellness and beauty creations that are natural, cruelty-free, vegan, and thoughtfully low-waste. The brand carries <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/face-body-serum"">face serums</a> formulated with rosehip seed, wild carrot seed, and rose geranium; bath essentials like <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/ritual-bath-essentials/products/forest-bathing-body-polish"">Forest Bathing Body Polish</a>, made of mango, shea, lime, vetiver, and clary sage; nourishing <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/armonia-cacao-hemp-tea"">Armonía Cacao Hemp teas</a>; and home goods, like the delicious <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/soulshine-ritual-essential-oil-candle"">Soulshine Ritual Essential Oil Candle</a>, with notes of palo santo, holy basil, and ylang-ylang. The brick-and-mortar shop in Portland’s Alberta Arts District, where Pérez Emerson produces her entire line, also houses <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a space for deeply spiritual and transformative self-care rituals and events.</p>



<h2><strong>Arium’s Houseplants </strong></h2>





<p>With the belief that “there is a plant out there for everyone,” Tylor Rogers and Alba Sanchez founded <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com"">Arium</a>, Latin for “a space or vessel that contains something,” in 2017. The queer-, Latine-, and vegan-owned houseplant shop is a safe space where all, regardless of gender, immigration status, or religion, are welcome — and where no question about plants is silly or illegitimate. It’s a space for learning about and taking home unusual plants. It nurses smaller <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/agraecum-leonis"">Agraecum leonis</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/ceropegia-ampliata"">Ceropegia ampliatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/dracaena-masoniana"">Dracaena masonianas</a> as well as larger <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/monstera-deliciosa-xl"">Monstera deliciosas</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/dracaena-marginata-xl-1"">Dracaena marginatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/ficus-elastica-burgundy"">Ficus elasticas</a>. Even more, they work with small businesses and makers for its stunning selection of handmade planters and ceramics.</p>



<h2><strong>Nossa Familia Coffee</strong></h2>





<p><br /><a href=""https://www.nossacoffee.com"">Nossa Familia Coffee</a> was founded in Portland in 2004, but owner Augusto Carneiro comes from a lineage of coffee growers in the highlands of his homeland, Brazil, that dates back to the 1890s. After a career in mechanical engineering left him unfulfilled, he found his thoughts drifting back to his childhood and the time he spent working on his family’s coffee farms in Brazil. Nossa Familia, Portuguese for “our family,” ultimately brought those reveries, and ancestral traditions, into his new life in the Northwest. But his business, which now comprises a Portland-based roastery and two zero-waste cafés, is still deeply rooted in home, working with coffee-growers in Brazil as well as in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia, and more. </p>



<h2><strong>La Familia Cider </strong></h2>



<p>As a first-generation Mexican immigrant family, the Gonzalezes wanted to create something that was at once Oregonian and Mexican. When wife and mother Shani tasted locally-made cider, she had the idea of combining Oregon’s new craft cider movement with Mexico’s passion for fresh-fruit drinks. After convincing her husband and children, <a href=""https://lafamiliacider.com/"">La Familia Cider</a>, founded in 2017, was born. </p>





<p>Every cider is crafted with 100% Northwest apple juice, using mainstay flavors like manzana, tamarindo, and hibiscus (or the seasonal guayaba flavor) to offer distinctive hard ciders inspired by Mexico’s aguas frescas. Named “Best Taproom of Salem, Oregon,” La Familia operates out of Salem and Portland, and can be found in more than 500 local shops around Oregon and Washington. Helping the cider taste even sweeter: a percentage of La Familia Cider’s profits are donated to organizations supporting immigrants’ rights.<br /></p>
