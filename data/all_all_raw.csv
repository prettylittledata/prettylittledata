The stadium project covers 13,500 square meters and provides high-quality facilities for both residents' sports activities and top-level football experiences for 8,000 spectators. The stadium meets the main UEFA category 4 requirements, which means it can also be used for example UEFA Europa League and national team matches. Every seating position in the stadium offers an unobstructed view of the entire field. The stadium also accommodates 15,000 people for concerts and other larger events. The stadium is part of a nearly 50,000 square meter hybrid block, complementing the urban structure, which consists of eight interconnected plots, including the football stadium, five residential buildings, a commercial centre, and parking facilities.</p>",

Our phones track how much we use them, present this data as evidence of failure, and then leave us alone with our guilt never really addressing why we reached for them in the first place or offering constructive suggestions for improvement.</p><h4>A brief history of digital wellness tools</h4><p>Digital wellness tools <a href=""https://www.apple.com/gr/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/"">emerged around 2018</a> in response to concerns about device addiction. With Apple’s Screen Time and Google’s Digital Wellbeing, suddenly our phones came equipped with features to monitor and limit their own use through dashboards and constraints.</p><p>The digital wellness market is now worth <a href=""https://www.rootsanalysis.com/digital-detox-apps-market"">almost $1 billion</a> — which is not an insignificant number for an industry built on helping us use our phones less yet entirely dependent on our phones to exist.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ubI30RiPmFwEHcZK1Mr6Zg.png"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Screen Time app (collage by author, image <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphbfa595995/ios#:~:text=View%20your%20Screen%20Time%20summary%20*%20Go,see%20a%20summary%20of%20your%20daily%20use"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>These products’ framing deliberately takes from self-care vocabulary (using words like “wellbeing” and “focus”, some apps “diagnose” your focus levels) positioning themselves as caring for our health. But under the surface, these tools share a common mechanism: they make us feel guilty about our behaviour instead of questioning the patterns that influence it.</p><p>There are many digital wellness apps out there, and most follow similar patterns. A couple of the most popular ones are Forest and Opal.</p><p><strong>Forest</strong> is a focused-timer app that uses simple gamification: you set a timed session (like a Pomodoro timer) and a virtual tree begins to grow. If you leave the app to check notifications or else, the tree dies. Completing sessions adds trees to your collection, and you can aim to gradually build a virtual forest.</p><p>Instead of growing a tree, <strong>Opal</strong> works by blocking selected apps and notifications for a set period of time, creating intentional friction between you and your distractions. When a session is active, attempting to open a blocked app triggers a screen reminding you of your focus goal, making the act of “breaking” your session a more conscious decision. Completing sessions adds gems to your collection and ranks you on a leaderboard.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JTHn9mP3e68Kj5XWp_pb5g.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of how guilt is used by Forest app to nudge users (image by author)</figcaption></figure><h4>Guilt as the special sauce</h4><p>These are great examples of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/behavioral-design"">behavioural design</a> at work, and even better examples of how digital wellness tools have convinced us that excessive phone use is a personal failure requiring personal intervention.</p><p>The problem is that this leads to a lot of self-guilt that doesn’t just come up naturally from our phone habits, but it’s also baked into these tools.<strong><em> </em></strong>From a psychological perspective, guilt emerges when we believe we’ve violated a personal standard. Digital wellness features tap into this directly: they highlight “failures” (ie. your tree died because you made a phone call) amplify them with comparisons (ie. your friend is in the top 1% on the focus leaderboard and you are not) and present usage as deviations from a norm.</p><p>Every dead tree or broken streak are feedback mechanisms the apps use to prove their worth, but they’re also guilt triggers aimed directly at users.</p><h4>Why data alone is not enough</h4><p>I don’t think we should have to pay our way out of the attention economy so as an iPhone user, I rely on <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphbfa595995/ios#:~:text=View%20your%20Screen%20Time%20summary%20*%20Go,see%20a%20summary%20of%20your%20daily%20use."">Screen Time</a> to monitor my habits. It’s free, built in and, at least at surface level, useful. In my opinion, however, it has one major flaw: it tries to teach users how to build better habits while making no changes whatsoever to the core product mechanics. In other words, it’s a diagnostic tool and, as such, its benefits are limited to making the user aware of a problem but not necessarily helping find a solution to it.</p><p>This is a common problem among digital wellness tools and it’s become one of the most widely accepted examples of how technology frames our behaviour as a personal problem to fix, and therefore a source of guilt.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HnkzGI5-6YuzSdTzPw-Cnw.png"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Screen Time is a great example of a data-rich but insight-poor tool. It shows you the numbers but doesn’t help you interpret or act on them. In UX terms, it lacks actionable insights. Data without support often turns into guilt, not change (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, the metrics presented aren’t even that accurate. Screen Time can’t distinguish between types of use, and it doesn’t let you exclude certain apps from the totals. So users are confronted with numbers that tell them almost nothing useful about their <em>actual</em> behaviour.</p><p>I will use my own data as an example. Screen Time told me last Monday I’d spent 5 hours on my phone. If that were 5 hours of scrolling TikTok, fair enough — that could be concerning. But when I dug into the breakdown, I found an hour of Google Maps because I was driving and another 30 minutes of YouTube because my son wanted a dance party after school and we had music playing in the background.</p><p>So my “real” screen time was closer to 3.5 hours. Still a lot probably, but notably less alarming than the initial number. The app had done its job by presenting decontextualised numbers and letting my brain fill in the narrative of personal failure, so before I even looked into what it meant, I felt that pang of shame.</p><p>There is a clear discrepancy between the intended use and purpose of this app versus what it’s able to deliver to users, which is an incomplete experience that doesn’t provide guidance or suggestions on how to take more control over our time.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vapF-8p1mKFJA5FA3zQK3w.png"" /><figcaption>Quick exploration of what it could look like if Screen Time leveraged data to prompt users to take action by providing guidance through insights (image by author)</figcaption></figure><h4>What guilt-free design could look like</h4><p>Screen Time presents usage as a static result rather than a dynamic behaviour, showing numbers but offering no interpretation.</p><p>An alternative to guilt-based design wouldn’t be to remove all this feedback but rather empower users to make change by contextualising the information and offering proactive suggestions.</p><p>My phone knows I’m at work — I have Work Focus on — so why can’t it contextualise my usage? Why not tell me I spent 30 minutes on Instagram during work hours specifically, letting me take accountability where it matters? Or if my Saturday usage suddenly spikes compared to my usual pattern, why not nudge me with a reflection point by letting me know that this is unusual for me at the weekend?</p><p>All these small interventions could help us <em>understand </em>our behaviour instead of just measuring it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9vKYK8rz3cUxSbTiou1wEg.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of how Slack proactively reduces noise and distraction by decluttering the interface. It doesn’t inform the user about the number of inactive or muted channels, but rather offers proactive suggestions on what to do with them, guiding users to a solution (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Digital wellness, to truly live up to its name, should feel more like an environment that supports the user, rather than just a dashboard that informs.</p><p>That could mean more supportive defaults, interfaces and prompts that are able to adapt to context, so instead of leaving users alone with the numbers, design can create conditions where healthy behaviour can develop more naturally.</p><p>I saw a comment on a LinkedIn post about the launch of yet another digital wellness app that I wish I had screenshotted, but it was along the lines of <em>“I don’t need another app to manage how I use my phone. If I want to stay away from it, the best way to do it is simply to leave it another room”.</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pSkJgGkUtrx-lJo0_l9MwA.png"" /><figcaption>Apps like Opal still rely on frequent motivational notifications to encourage “healthy” phone habits, but this means users have to pick up their phone in order to be reminded to put it down. These interruptions however generate additional screen interactions that end up plugging users right back in (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Using our phones to manage our phone usage will always have its obvious limitations. Digital wellness apps are still apps — they need our attention to teach us about attention and require engagement to promote disengagement, and it feels like a lot of the current solutions are just slapping a timer on a problem that’s way more complex.</p><p>They can track, nudge, or create a bit of friction, but they can’t fundamentally change the habits or patterns that the system itself creates. However, acknowledging those limits makes the whole experience less about judgment and more about awareness.</p><p>As users, what we <em>can</em> do with that awareness is to make small, realistic adjustments, and as designers what we can do in turn, is to build interfaces that make those adjustments feel a little easier instead of adding more cognitive load, working towards making the relationship between us and our devices feel a bit more intentional.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f4d4dfaca1e8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-behind-screen-time-guilt-f4d4dfaca1e8"">The UX behind screen time guilt</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s the first major platform to actually adjust to what a lot of people have been feeling. Our feeds across a broad spectrum of apps are being flooded with low-quality AI slop. The effect is a degradation of trust and an increasing desire to have more control over what we actually see. Pinterest’s move is the first real signal that platforms are recognizing there’s a growing problem instead of pretending that AI generated content and design is the future.</p><p>While I’m not proud to say it, I do occasionally scroll TikTok to kill a few brain cells and a few minutes in my day. My partner also sends me TikToks which she says is her love language, which I in turn use to justify the habit. But these days I’m seeing a trend, there is a <em>stark</em> increase in comments trying to figure out whether a video is AI. We’re literally becoming reality police in the comments of these feeds. Sometimes it’s obvious, there’s that monotoned, programmatically friendly voice playing over a grainy, intentionally retro aesthetic designed to hide AI distortions. But even when it isn’t obvious, people are suspicious. There’s a growing paranoia around what to believe and not believe when scrolling through your feeds on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and more.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDf5qkCZYMA69Z6rOqjFAg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a painfully predictable side effect of releasing an unregulated video-generation tool that tries its hardest to pass for reality. There are many tools racing towards that meaningless end but the most notable example is <a href=""https://sora.chatgpt.com/"">Sora</a>. There’s the famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-8kAnBL2s"">bouncing bunnies video</a> or the progressive pastor video, that went mainstream and gave Sora some early hype. But to me it seems like the hype has evaporated. I don’t know a single person who actually uses Sora.<strong> </strong>Not one. I barely know anyone who even downloaded it! And the people who did opened it once, generated something vaguely cursed, laughed nervously, and then abandoned it.</p><figure><img alt=""Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sCSb6GAwY_UMxcBA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.digit.in/news/apps/openais-sora-app-is-already-flooded-with-disturbing-sam-altman-deepfakes.html"">Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora</a></figcaption></figure><p>To me it’s unsurprising, as it seemed like the main use case for downloading the app was making creepy videos of <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-sora-app-ai-videos-2025-10"">Sam Altman being mocked</a> in increasingly bizarre and slightly more humiliating situations. Along with a string of racially insensitive videos of MLK making fake speeches, which were eventually disallowed after the very busy ethicist of open <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo"">AI Olivia Gambelin told the BBC OpenAI that limiting further use of Dr King’s image was “a good step forward”</a>. Not only were there weird historical recontextualized videos but also blatant copyright infringements of famous characters. Which we all know is a favourite of OpenAI. Videos on Sora are considered a “success” when they reach escape velocity and seep into mainstream content, which is a strange metric for anything, let alone for a CEO who keeps insisting this tech is “inevitable.”</p><p>But all of this “inevitability” talk from AI tech CEOs is starting to wear thin. Sure, we exist within certain systems. Yes, capital moves the way capital moves. But companies only have power because users hand it to them. When people walk away and engagement drops the inevitability story starts to look flimsy.</p><p>It’s been a awhile now since the first big wave of AI models started generating shockingly polished visuals. And I’ll be honest: sometimes the results are impressive! But my standards for AI are different from my standards for humans. There is still a huge amount of rich, deeply human art being made every day as well as a huge historical trove to dig through that is fundamentally more interesting because it comes from people with taste and lived experience.</p><p>Also the hard truth for AI generated content is that the people who can make beautiful things already are the ones best positioned to make beautiful AI-assisted things. And what are their incentives? Across the board creatives are getting fired because of the threat of AI replacement, why would they be the first to hop onboard to support a tool that’s literally trying to take their jobs. Right now it seems like lot of AI content online comes from people with no creative background dumping average outputs into the feed. People are trying their hand at it, making something new from nothing, and while I admire the spirit in that the harsh truth is it adds almost nothing.</p><p>It turns out making something good that people care about is extremely hard. And making something great is harder still. Great work in my view is inherently collaborative, political, relational. It requires conflict, iteration, and concession. You can’t flatten all of that into a prompt without losing what makes it resonate. Most recently <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">OpenAI announced that they would be making an AI first movie called Critterz for under 30 million</a> as an attempt to try and show the power of AI in film/animation production. But it does beg the question, why is it that OpenAI has to front the cash here? Maybe it’s because independent filmmakers aren’t interested in leveraging this tool? If it was truly a great tool for filmmakers, we would already be hearing about the new voices breaking through the cultural marketplace signalling the importance of this new medium. It ain’t happening!</p><figure><img alt=""Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JauRQvulDh1F49f4x_DiFQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Oftentimes when I tell this to AI boosters there’s this pushback that it’s only getting better and better, and while yes the fidelity and realism is increasing, I have yet to feel the rumblings of a creative AI revolution. I firmly believe you cannot collapse a lifetime of discipline and taste into a few paragraphs of prompting. You can’t try and remove collaboration and expect a better product. Yes, I’ve seen beautiful AI imagery, but they are the exceptions, not the rule. And more importantly: no one is asking for more of it, in fact they’re asking <strong>for less</strong>.</p><p>When people identify a video as AI, it’s usually to warn others not to trust it. That alone tells you what demand actually looks like. Most social platforms exist on human-generated content and I think the flood of AI slop is not likely to increase engagement. We all buy into this story that AI will optimize for our attention, stimulating the exact parts of our brain to create dopamine zombies and while I don’t deny that’s certainly possible, I do think that it’s actually quite unlikely. There is still no comparison between human content and AI content from a quality perspective.</p><p>Pinterest’s new filter lets users reduce or outright hide AI-generated content. TikTok is now testing a similar feature. And I know I’ll be turning it on the second it becomes available. No one begged for this influx of AI content. It doesn’t solve a problem that actually existed or if it does, I certainly can’t put a finger on it. It’s a novel toy that has overwhelmed entire corners of the internet, suffocating feeds and making us all paranoid and platforms are finally starting to admit it. While they’ll never say “our feeds were drowning in AI nonsense and users hated it.” features speak louder than words. When Pinterest gives you the option to filter out AI, and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/"">TikTok rushes to pilot something similar</a>, the message is clear: <strong>people want the human internet back.</strong></p><p>I have hope that creativity online won’t be defined by who has the most generative models pumping out piles of content. The novelty of AI is already wearing off and the fatigue is very very real. If platforms want engagement, if they want trust or if they want actual culture to keep happening on their watch, they’re going to have to give us control over our feeds, including the ability to filter out, reduce, or completely remove AI-generated content.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3e832e8ad0d0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-internet-needs-an-ai-off-switch-3e832e8ad0d0"">The internet needs an AI off switch</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>

<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">editor-favorite skincare brand Medik8</a> is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C serums</a> leave skin feeling itchy and red, but <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8’s C-Tetra</a> is built differently. It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p>This isn’t your average <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/hydr8-b5"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hyaluronic acid serum</a>. It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

Ah, Christmas. A time when we string colored lights around our homes, whip out Christmas stockings, bake gingerbread and gorge ourselves on, well, everything. But what's a Christmas without sitting in front of the TV with a glass of champagne in hand, devouring a wholesome, corny or just <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">so bad-it's-good Christmas movie</a>? <br /><br />Whatever you're looking for — a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/christmas-movies-toxic-men"">cheesy rom-com</a> to play in the background while you ice some gingerbread people, a thrilling Christmas <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror with an edge</a>, a Christmas musical that'll have you singing along, or you only want to see <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/set-visit-netflix-knight-before-christmas"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> in another outlandish Christmas film, we've got you covered.<br /><br />Ahead, the very best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11946456/7-christmas-movies-tv-netflix"">Christmas movies</a> of all time.<figure><figcaption><h2>It's A Wonderful Life (1946)</h2><br />Universally hailed as <em>the</em> best Christmas film to watch each year, <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em> has come to define the genre. It stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has become suicidal. But he's soon visited by an angel who shows him what really matters in life and what life would be like without his existence. A compelling, moving and heartwarming masterpiece, courtesy of Frank Capra. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Die Hard (1988)<br /></h2><br />Sparking arguments and transforming friends into enemies, <em>Die Hard</em> reinvigorated the discussion on what is meant to be a Christmas movie (and for the record, it definitely is one). Set on Christmas Eve, it follows an NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) as his Christmas plans are interrupted thanks to a group of terrorists (featuring the late Alan Rickman). In true Bruce Willis fashion, he's the only one that can save the day (and Christmas!).  </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)<br /></h2><br />Is it a Christmas movie? Is it a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/10/11572922/amazon-prime-halloween-movies-horror"">Halloween movie</a>? Who cares. When you've got a gorgeous stop-motion film as charming as this, you'll be wanting to make your Christmas morning as macabre as possible. Written by the notable Tim Burton, a visit to Christmastown should be on the cards every year (just don't forget to sing along). </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Gremlins (1984)<br /></h2><br />If you think all Christmas movies need to be peppy and upbeat, think again. <em>Gremlins</em> pumps us full of Christmas cheer, but not without the help of some demonic creatures.  This horror-comedy follows a father who finds an extra special Christmas gift for his son, but with a proviso — don't expose it to bright light, never add water, and only feed it after midnight.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Elf (2003)<br /></h2><br />A Christmas staple. Will Ferrell excels in this classic as Buddy, a childish adult/large elf who searches for his biological father in New York City. As he navigates the human world, we're treated to instantly quotable lines and enough laughs to give us an ab workout.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)</h2><br /><br />Written by John Hughes (best known for classics like <em>Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink</em>, and<em> The Breakfast Club</em>), <em>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</em> is a bible on how to do a flawless Christmas comedy. Clark Griswold (Chevy Case) wants the perfect Christmas and plays it safe by staying at home, but things go wrong pretty quickly after his hick cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his family show up without an invite. Watch this, then treat yourself to the other five <em>National Lampoon's Vacation</em> movies, just because.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Carol (2015)<br /></h2><br />Say it with me: more queer Christmas films! <em>Carol</em> has easily cemented itself into the Christmas movie rotation of many thanks to the bittersweet love it portrays. Starring Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, it follows two women as they fall in love and have a forbidden affair. And while it's just an objectively good movie, it also features plenty of Christmas hats, cookie decorating, and Christmas cheer to fill that festive hole in your heart.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Batman Returns (1992)<br /></h2><br />Batman in a Christmas movie? Well, almost. While Bruce Wayne doesn't exactly don Christmas getup head to toe, <em>Batman Returns</em> landscape is spectacularly festive. With a huge Christmas tree in the centre of Gotham, plenty of decorations to go around, and even a Grinch-esque character in the form of Max Shreck and Penguin, this is the perfect Christmas movie for comic book fanatics.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)<br /></h2><br />Have you heard of Whoville? If not, you're in for a treat. It's one of the most wonderfully blissful and friendly places that'll have you returning for your dose of Christmas cheer, every year. We all know who The Grinch is — he's a bloody grouch. He doesn't believe in Christmas and most certainly won't be participating in any local decorating competitions. But things change when he meets six-year-old Cindy Lou. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bad Santa (2003)<br /></h2><br />Dark comedy and Christmas is an unexpected match made in heaven, seen nowhere better than in <em>Bad Santa</em>. The star of the show, Billy Bob Thornton, stars as a gross, vile, alcoholic, chain-smoking and horny shopping centre Santa Claus ripoff — and we love him for it. Just don't make the mistake of showing this one to the kids. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holiday (2006)<br /></h2><br />You've got your <em>Love Actually </em>girlies, and you've got your <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11596077/is-the-holiday-a-christmas-movie"">The Holiday</a> </em>girlies. Whatever side you fall on, you'll still appreciate this as one of the best Christmas movies of all time. It follows two women (played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) who swap lives and their perfect homes for a fortnight to escape their problems and heartbreak. Jack Black and Jude Law also star in this fan favorite. Someone bring out the mistletoe, stat. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silent Night (2021)<br /></h2><br />An apocalyptic dystopian Christmas film starring Keira Knightly? Sign me up. After a couple invites their friends over for Christmas dinner, they soon discover that it's their last night on Earth, thanks to a toxic cloud sweeping across the planet. Coined as a ""<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">f*cked up </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">Love Actually</a></em>"" by Refinery29's own Maybelle Morgan, this gem is satirical, self-aware, and well worth a rotation on your telly over the holidays. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Actually (2003)<br /></h2><br />While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-actually-is-the-worst"">polarizing, <em>Love Actually</em></a> is still a firm favorite among many lovers of Christmas movies. With a stellar ensemble cast including Emma Thompson, Jude Law, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant and more, this 2003 film shows different aspects of love through ten separate stories. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holidate (2020)<br /></h2><br />Starring Emma Roberts and our own Aussie Luke Bracey who decide to be each other's holiday dates, Holidate is a rom-com with all the predictability and cheesiness we crave come Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Lord Of The Rings (2001)</h2><br />If <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>wasn't a Christmas movie, then why was it released on Boxing Day every year? Checkmate. A tradition in the Koster residence and our Christmas movie of choice every year, prep yourself to settle down for 10+ hours of Middle Earth shenanigans. One movie for Christmas Eve, one movie for Christmas Day, and one movie for Boxing Day. You're welcome.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Hard (2021)<br /></h2><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">Love Hard</a></em> combines romance with the holiday spirit. Starring <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> actress Nina Dobrev, the Netflix original Christmas film sees her character Natalie get catfished when she thinks she's chatting to a dreamy guy, Tag (Darren Barnet from <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/07/10586990/most-underrated-line-never-have-i-ever"">Never Have I Ever</a></em>), but it's actually Tag's childhood friend Josh (Jimmy O. Yang).<br /><br />This movie is just as much about the challenges of dating in the online world as it is about our desire for love and connection, especially during the festive season. It's also a big win for Asian representation in Hollywood. As <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> writer Maggie Zhou puts it, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">casting of Jimmy O. Yang as a potential love interest</a> welcomes a change from the problematic stereotypes about Asian men that have so often been perpetuated in Hollywood over the years. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (2020)<br /></h2><br />With visuals that look like they've been plucked from a storybook, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10222779/jingle-jangle-best-black-christmas-movies"">Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</a></em> is a cute and fresh Christmas flick from Netflix. It follows a toymaker (Forest Whitaker, no less) and his apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key), who steals one of his prized inventions. It's up to his granddaughter (Madalen Mills) to save the day and reignite the magic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)<br /></h2><br />With Michael Caine as Scrooge, Gonzo the Great as Charles Dickens, and a whole bunch of Muppets, <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol </em>has easily cemented itself as one of the most easily recognizable and well-loved Christmas movies out there. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Princess Switch (2018)<br /></h2><br />In what is the best work by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/10/10698806/vanessa-hudgens-nude-photo-leak-2007-reaction"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> since <em>High School Musical</em>, this movie is perfect if you're looking for a 90-minute happily ever come Christmas time. You'll be seeing double because Hudgens plays two women: Stacy DeNovo, a baker who runs a popular pastry shop in America, and Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro in Belgravia, London. When they meet, they do their best <em>Parent-Trap</em> style swap of sorts and switch places. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Falling For Christmas (2022)<br /></h2><br />Speaking of <em>The Parent Trap, </em>the Lindsay Lohan renaissance is upon us! And I, for one, welcome our new overlord. <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/11/11185134/falling-for-christmas-lindsay-lohan-netflix"">Falling For Christmas</a></em> is a fresh Christmas flick in which Lohan plays a spoiled heiress who loses her memory after a skiing accident. She falls (literally) into the arms of a supremely hot widower. You can probably guess what happens next.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Violent Night (2022)<br /></h2><br />An R-rated Christmas movie? Yes, please. Starring everyone's daddy, David Harbour, this black comedy action flick features a heroic Santa Claus who must step in to save the day after a group of mercenaries attack the estate of a wealthy family.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Home Alone (1990)<br /></h2><br />Another John Hughes classic, <em>Home Alone</em> is a holiday essential. Featuring Macaulay Culkin as the sadistic kid we knew him as, Kevin ends up being left home alone after his preoccupied parents head off on a holiday. Soon, he has to protect his house against burglars — a feat which he accomplishes in a very creative fashion.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lethal Weapon (1987)<br /></h2><br />In <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover gift us with an action-packed thriller that's chock-full of blood and violence. Doesn't quite sound Christmassy? Let this movie convince you otherwise. Shane Black, the MVP of writing screenplays that always somehow involve Christmas, has done it again. This time, it's with two cops on a mission to take down drug dealers — on Christmas, of course. If <em>Die Hard</em> is a Christmas movie, <em>Lethal Weapon</em> should definitely get a seat at the table. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Single All The Way (2021)<br /></h2><br />In an attempt to avoid judgement from his family for being single, Peter (Michael Urie) convinces his bestie, Nick (Philemon Chambers), to pretend that they're in a relationship. Aaaand, cue the romance. If the fake-dating trope isn't enough to reel you in, perhaps some Jennifer Coolidge might do the job.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tangerine (2015)<br /></h2><br />If you haven't noticed yet, queer Christmas films are excellent. And <em>Tangerine</em> is no exception. Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a pair of transgender women (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor), a pair of sex workers who search for a heart-breaking pimp. Shot entirely on an iPhone, it's a cinematic feat as well as just a bloody good Christmas film.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Story (1983)<br /></h2><br />A cult classic, <em>A Christmas Story</em> tells the tale of a young boy who tries to convince his parents, teacher, and Santas Claus that a BB gun is the perfect Christmas gift.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Krampus (2015)<br /></h2><br />Who says Christmas movies can't also be horror? Not us! <em>Krampus </em>is a scary goodie. It features Toni Collette and Adam Scott as they deal with a festive Christmas demon who has been summoned into their home. And you thought Christmas dinner with your conservative uncle was bad.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe (2005)<br /></h2><br />The MVP of cosy movies, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> embodies childhood joy. Based on C.S. Lewis' novel, we see four children enter a magical, snowy land through a wardrobe door. Father Christmas even makes an appearance (plus James McAvoy as a very hot half-faun/half-human). <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2><br />Whilst not explicitly Christmassy, I'm sure many will agree that Harry Potter's first instalment just gives off that fuzzy, Christmas morning feeling. If you don't mind, we'll just be off pretending that we're unwrapping gifts at Hogwarts on Christmas morning.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Knight Before Christmas (2019)<br /></h2><br />In a strange turn of events, Vanessa Hudgens is now known as <em>the</em> Christmas movie star. I know, I didn't see it coming either. In <em>The Knight Before Christmas, </em>she meets a hot medieval English knight (Josh Whitehouse) who magically time-travels to present-day America.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Scrooged (1998)<br /></h2><br />Based on Charles Dickens' novel, <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, <em>Scrooged</em> features Bill Murray as a cynical, mean television exec who's visited by three spirits. Here, they give him a chance to right his wrongs — all on Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Black Christmas (1974)<br /></h2><br />After a group of sorority girls plan to go away for the Christmas holidays, they're soon confronted by a terrifying stalker. An intelligent, unnerving Chrissie slasher that's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-horror-movies"">a must for any horror fanatic</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>In Bruges (2008)<br /></h2><br />If you're hankering for a not-so-Christmassy Christmas movie, <em>In Bruges</em> should be at the top of your list. Set in Bruges, Belgium, we're treated to a wonderfully festive landscape. The plot, however, isn't as festive — two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), head to Bruges to hide out. But things get complicated when their boss (Ralph Fiennes), asks Ken to kill Ray.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)<br /></h2><br />In possibly the cutest addition to this list, <em>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer </em>is the epitome of Christmas joy. It's the story we all know and love, but artistically, it's way beyond its years. With groundbreaking stop-motion animation using puppets, you'll find it hard to wipe the smile off your face. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Polar Express (2004)<br /></h2><br />This animated musical adventure is based on the 1985 book of the same name, and as cliché as it sounds, it reminds me of the magic of Christmas that you beautifully embrace as a child and then look back on fondly as an adult. You'll never feel too old to watch this movie, where a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole aboard the Polar Express train. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)<br /></h2><br />Is it even Christmas if you don't listen to a bit of Judy Garland? In this musical masterpiece, we meet four sisters as they learn about life and love, and face their childhood fears.  It makes for perfect background viewing while some gingerbread people decorating, thanks to its stellar soundscape. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Little Women (2019)<br /></h2><br />Set during two life-changing Christmases, Little Women is the perfect Christmas movie. In this soul-crushing and spellbinding adaptation, we follow the March sisters (played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen), as they enter womanhood. With snowy landscapes, Christmas parties, pine trees and fireplace-laced stockings, it's hard to not consider this one of the Christmas greats. Just maybe skip over <em>that</em> marriage proposal scene if you want to keep the mood light. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)<br /></h2><br />For the anti-consumerist Christmas critics among us (hello!), <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> is the perfect way to get into the festive spirit. Stanley Kubrick's last film, considered his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"", follows Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), after she admits to dreaming of having an affair. Everywhere you look, it's hard to ignore that the spirit of Christmas is rife — holiday parties, strung-up lights, toy stores, and mall Santas. But it's not without its criticism. Instead of whimsical, Kubrick presents Christmas as critique of the Western world's obsession with consumerism. File under: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/holiday-movies-sex-scenes"">Christmas movies to watch when you're horny.</a><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Night Before (2015)</h2><br />A Christmas movie for those who flock to stoner comedy (read: any Seth Rogan film), <em>The Night Before</em> features the man himself, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie as they say goodbye to their years of Christmas traditions in anticipation of fatherhood. With one last night of debauchery, they head to New York and hunt down the elusive Nutcracka ball. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)<br /></h2><br />An icon in itself, this <em>Peanuts</em> Christmas film tackles Christmas materialism in a lighthearted way as Charlie Brown tries to find a deeper meaning to Christmas. We love some Charlie Brown existentialism!<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Santa Clause (1994)<br /></h2><br />After Tim Allen accidentally causes the death of Santa, he magically transforms into the new big man. A cornerstone of any 90s kid's Christmas,<em> The Santa Clause</em> is a heartwarming story of a dad repairing his relationship with his family.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Happiest Season (2020)<br /></h2><br />Another queer Christmas movies, <em>Happiest Season </em>stars the likes of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/kristen-stewart-spencer-interview"">Kristen Stewart</a>, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Dan Levy and more. It follows a woman who struggles to come out to her conservative parents while she and her girlfriend visit them during the Christmas holiday. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017)<br /></h2><br />In <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em>, we take a deep dive into how Charles Dickens wrote one of the most quintessential Christmas tales — <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Anyone who's had writer's block will resonate.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Four Christmases (2008)<br /></h2><br />There's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/why-we-love-bad-christmas-movies"">something about objectively bad Christmas films that make them so good</a>. I'll be straight with you — this is not a good movie. But it is a good movie for Christmas. Featuring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, a couple spends Christmas Day jumping between family get-togethers after their holiday to Fiji is cancelled.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Dolly Parton's A Christmas On The Square (2020)<br /></h2><br />Everyone's Christmas could do with a little more Dolly Parton. In this campy song-and-dance story, a Scrooge-y woman who's planning on selling off a small town, receives a visit from an angel (Dolly Parton, of course).<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966)<br /></h2><br />In the original 1966 rendition, Dr. Seuss' classic is told to us true to form as a cartoon spectacle. This Christmas movie is like watching the book come to life. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Spirited (2022)<br /></h2><br />Starring Christmas legend Will Ferrell, and everyone's boyfriend, Ryan Reynolds, this fresh festive flick is a musical version of Charles Dickens' famous story. But with a cast like this, there's no way it's the same story we've seen time and time again.   <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Prince (2017)<br /></h2><br />With a Hallmark essence that's so bad it's good, <em>A Christmas Prince</em> follows a young reporter who is sent abroad to get the scoop on a very hot, very vanilla prince. With a whopping IMDb rating of 5.8/10, it's the perfect bad Christmas film to watch these holidays.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Miracle on 34th Street (1994)<br /></h2><br />Young Susan (played by Mara Wilson of Matilda fame) doesn't believe in Santa. When an elderly man is called in by Susan's mother to replace an intoxicated department store Santa, things start to change. Introducing himself only as Kris Kringle, he claims he's the real Santa Claus, leading to locals trying to sabotage him and landing him in a court case. There's a heartwarming message in this movie about the beauty in believing and Christmas wishes. The 1947 original is also well worth a viewing. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)<br /></h2><br />Set during Christmas in Los Angeles, this film looks closer to a Christmas in Sydney than it does in a winter wonderland US. In true Shane Black fashion (a la <em>Lethal Weapon</em>), the Christmassy elements are just background noise. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan in a sexy Santa suit, <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </em>is a witty crime comedy that doubles as a murder mystery. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Last Holiday (2006)</h2><br />Queen Latifah shines in this early naughties movie that sees her as a saleswoman and budding home chef named Georgia Byrd. After receiving a terminal illness diagnosis, she then uses her life savings to fly to Czechia and spends the last few weeks of her life like a lavish billionaire. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holdovers (2023)<br /></h2><br />While Christmas time often invites us to watch downright <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11605440/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">bad holiday flicks</a>, The Holdovers cannot be considered in this category — it's a great Christmas film. In fact, it's a great film, period. Directed by Alexander Payne (of <em>Nebraska</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>), <em>The Holdovers</em> follows a cranky instructor (Paul Giamatti) who's forced to remain on campus during the Christmas holidays to babysit the kids who have nowhere to go. Expect tears.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Best. Christmas. Ever! (2023)</h2><br />Starring Brandy (!) and Heather Graham, Netflix's new Christmas movie, <em>Best. Christmas. Ever!</em> is so bad it's good. Honestly, you don't even need to know the plot of this one to add it to your queue list. It has Brandy in it! I repeat, it has Brandy in it!</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Klaus (2019)</h2><br />This gorgeous hand-drawn animated film is a welcome addition to our Christmas movie rotation. It's sweet, funny, and just oozes that warm nostalgic feeling. It also happens to feature a packed cast, including Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and J.K. Simmons.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022)</h2><br /><br />Whether or not you're a fan of the Marvel movies, <em>The Guardians of the Galaxy</em>'s Christmas special is a go-to if you're after an action-packed holiday film. With a special appearance from Kevin Bacon, we see the usual Guardians crew as they set off on another adventure. It's not the same calibre we expect from the Marvel heavy hitters, but when it's Christmas, don't you just want something fun?</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>I look forward to December every year, simply for the chance to sit in the lounge and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-australian-christmas-movies"">binge Christmas movies</a>. I love the classics, from <em>Home Alone</em> to <em>Love Actually</em>, but there’s always a new set of films that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/8-tv-film-netflix-watch-december"">appear on Netflix</a>. The streamer has come out with some gems over the past few years, like <em>Love Hard</em>, <em>Hot Frosty</em> and <em>Klaus</em>, so I’ve been eagerly awaiting their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-christmas-movies"">holiday slate</a>.</p>



<p>From Alicia Silverstone’s new <em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em> to <em>Jingle Bell Heist</em>, there’s some great festive options to pull up on your screen. If you prefer lifestyle shows over movies, Meghan Markle has conjured up a special holiday edition of her show <em>With Love, Meghan</em>. To take a look at the best Christmas content coming to Netflix, read on.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em></h2>

<h2><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em> shot to number one on Netflix’s most-watched movies list just hours after it was released, it’s one to watch.

It’s about a woman named Layla (Christina Milian) who is on a quest to meet James, the man of her dreams (Kofi Siriboe), so she races across New York City with a Christmas concierge (Devale Ellis) hoping to find a ticket to a sold-out Pentatonix Christmas concert.</p>

Makeup is one of the easiest ways to embrace the grandeur of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">party season</a>, and <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">some <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-naked-beauty-interview"">makeup looks</a></span> are simply synonymous with this time of year. Glitter eyeshadow? Tick. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/11/78055/taylor-swift-red-lipstick-looks"">Red lip</a>? Check. However, while crimson pouts and shimmery eyelids might be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">Christmas and New Year’s Eve</a> classics (for good reason), they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to winter party makeup.<br /><br />This time of year provides the perfect excuse to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">up your beauty game</a>. Inspiration for new looks isn't always the easiest to find, though, especially in the hectic holiday haze of party planning and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift shopping</a>. So, if you're on the hunt for some festive inspiration, we’ve got you covered. Whether you're a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-makeup-skincare-gifts"">beauty enthusiast</a> or more of a novice, a glitz and glam lover or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025"">makeup minimalist</a>, we scoured Instagram to bring you 32 holiday party makeup looks to suit all budgets and preferences.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Bonus points if you have a light champagne-coloured eyeshadow to pair with your look, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glossier.com%2Fproducts%2Flidstar%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopyfpy2XNrxavXSR5Rlz8-haE29BTCthGEwIH4nADwG8fKMmreG"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossier Lidstar in Moon</a>, or <a href=""https://fave.co/3VwJOZD"">Rare Beauty All of the Above Weightless Eyeshadow Stick in Integrity</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Après-Ski Flush</h2><br /><br />Look as if you are fresh from the snowy slopes — no runny nose required. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/patrickta/"">Patrick Ta</a> gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gigihadid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gigi Hadid</a> a faux cold-weather flush with a matching berry cheek and lip. The key here is to make the blush and lip colour you apply appear soft and blurred. Pro tip: Use your fingers to soften the pigment by gently patting your lips. For a diffused look on your cheeks, add a very slightly lighter blush around the outside of your main tint, and blur the edges using a brush or your fingers.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Cinnamon Spice Soirée</h2><br />Pumpkin spice season may start in the fall, but it stretches all the way into winter sweater weather. Use pumpkin pies and cinnamon rolls as your inspiration for a delicious, smoky, bronzed eyelid, such as this example from makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/racheltzairi_makeup/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Tzairi</a> on Instagram. Finish with glossy lips via <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-lip-butter-balm-P455936"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm,</a> in Iced Coffee.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Red &amp; Razor Sharp</h2><br /><br />If Santa were into glam eye makeup, this is what he would wear. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexandraafrench/"">Alexandra French</a> gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/then0t0ri0usvip/"">Victoria Pedretti</a> this winged red eye look that’s perfect for a holiday party. To achieve this festive eye makeup, make sure to reach for bold pigmented eye colours that are easy to diffuse and soften with a brush, like the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdanessa-myricks-colorfix-24-hour-cream-color-P468353"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Danessa Myricks Beauty Colorfix Liquid Pigment in Primary Red</a>. Want to look even edgier? Fluff up your brows with a clear brow gel like the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2F24-hr-brow-setter-P409242"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Benefit 24-Hour Brow Setter</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Snow Angel Wings</h2><br /><br />If you’re looking for something outside of more traditional and glam makeup, consider this more abstract wintery eye look. Draw the outline of a big, oversized wing in white and leave it at that. If you want a sharper siren eye, look to this example on Ashley Park by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/makeupvincent/"">Vincent Oquendo</a> and line your inner corners, as well. We love <a href=""https://fave.co/3ONPdHW"">Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner in Snow</a>, for easy application and ultra precision to draw the sharpest wings possible.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Velvet Eyes</h2><br /><br />‘Tis the season to wear velvet. Instead of just having it adorn your holiday party outfit, add it to your eyes, as well. Look to this sultry example on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/simoneashley/"">Simone Ashley</a> as done by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/babskymakeup/"">Alex Babsky</a>. Reach for a creamy and buildable eye shadow in an opulent, velvety shade, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-lid-lustre-trio"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre in Midnight</a>. To complete the look, tightline your top and bottom lids with black eyeliner (<a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsatin-kajal-liner"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Beckham Beauty</a> is a safe bet when it comes to eyeliner, too).</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Purple Frost</h2><br /><br />Statement shimmery eyes aren't limited to just gold and silver metals. Try opting for a frosted purple metallic look, like the one here on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fkatwigs/"">FKA Twigs</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/raoulalejandre/"">Raoúl Alejandre</a>. Not only is there glitter on the eyes, but subtle sparkles all over her face, too, along with a very <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-glitter-y2k-comeback"">Y2K glittery lip</a>. Use a soft glittery eyeshadow that can double as full-face shimmer, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmakeup-by-mario-master-crystal-reflector-tm-P33257988"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Makeup by Mario Master Crystal Reflector</a>, and a sparkly lip colour like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftom-ford-sun-spark-lip-balm-P516416"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford Sun Spark Lip Balm</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holly Wreath Green</h2><br /><br />Red gets a lot of the attention when it comes to makeup during the holiday season, but green is equally as festive. This example by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/allanface/"">Allan Avendaño</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/LanaCondor/"">Lana Condor</a> is a great example of a bright, holly-hued eye that will shine at any festive occasion. In this look, Avendaño uses eyeshadow from <a href=""https://www.patmcgrath.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pat McGrath Labs</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Christmas Cat Eye</h2><br /><br />Avendaño gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/genneyawalton/"">Genneya Walton</a> a classic black cat eye, cherry red lip, and the kind of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-prickly-pear-serum-review"">glowing skin</a> you can never go wrong with — no matter the time of year.

A red eyeshadow moment can feel intimidating, but don't let it be; makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amberdmakeup/"">Amber Dreadon</a> uses the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patmcgrath.com%2Fproducts%2Fmothership-v-bronze-seduction"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pat McGrath Labs Mothership V: Bronze Seduction Palette</a>, to create this look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiegavs/?hl=en"">MUNA’s Katie Gavin</a>. <br /><br />Just remember that some red pigments can stain the skin, so make sure to use an eye primer like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion</a>, or a colour-correcting concealer like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F3c-color-correcting-concealer-palette-xlsImpprod12011171%3Fsku%3D2283240"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">NYX Professional Makeup 3C Palette</a>, beforehand.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Embellished Inner Eyes</h2><br /><br />If you’re after something both minimal and festive, look no further than this example by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iammaeng/"">makeup artist Maeng</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zuhazana/"">Kazuha of K-pop</a> group <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/le_sserafim/"">LE SSERAFIM</a>. The main focus, of course, is the sparkly ice-blue dots of colour in the inner corners of the eyes, but the look is made complete with simple, thin winged liner and a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-pocket-blush-review"">subtle, glowy blush</a>. For this particular look, Maeng uses the cult-favourite <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetlemonhead.com%2Fproducts%2Fspacepaste%3FzCountry%3DGB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lemonhead LA Spacepaste Glitter Concentrate</a>, for the inner eye glitter and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/ETUDE-Blusher-Grapefruit-Long-Lasting-Application/dp/B0CFXN7LZG"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Etude Lovely Cookie Blusher in Grapefruit Jelly</a>, for the blush.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Haute Chocolate</h2><br /><br />Not every gorgeous makeup look requires using vibrant colours and bold textures. Utilise the matte browns and taupes already in your collection to create <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-makeup-tips-professional-artist"">a natural look</a> that works for day or night, like this one on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zoesaldana/"">Zoe Saldaña</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/makeupbyvera7/"">Vera Steimberg</a>. It’s perfect for going from the office Christmas party to the office Christmas after-party... and maybe even the after-after-party. Oh, and if you don’t have brown eyeshadow to hand, cheat your way to this look by using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bronzer-application-tips-makeup-artist"">your go-to bronzer</a> instead.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Ice Queen</h2><br /><br />Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlygiglio/"">Carly Giglio</a> must be a Michelle Trachtenberg fan because this silvery, icy makeup look embodies the feeling of a winter blizzard. The cool-toned grey/blue shadow and brick shade of blush, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fflush-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Merit Flush Balm Cream Blush in Fox</a>, paired with a fluffed bushy brow, is just cool enough to keep you warm at any festive event.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Pearl Princess</h2><br /><br />Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kirinstagram/"">Kirin Bhatty's</a> dreamy pearl look created for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lola.tung/"">Lola Tung</a> is a perfect winter party look. It's a little unexpected and playfully ornate, but not over-the-top. Not to mention, it’s actually pretty easy to replicate and a dream for those who may not be the most handy with a makeup brush, but still want to serve a true festive look. We adore the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhalfmagicbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fface-pearls-1%3Fvariant%3D44040857977009"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half Magic Face Pearls</a>, to create a style like this.

This old Hollywood sultry look comes from softly blending a dark brown on the outer edges of the eye with a shimmery caramel gold on the centre of the lid. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/smoky-brunette-hair-color-trend"">smoky look</a> is completed with a brown eyeshadow pencil drawn and smudged in the inner and outer corners of the eyes, crease, and lower lash line.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Ethereal Disco Party</h2><br /><br />Bring the party to you à la makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lindahallberg/"">Linda Hallberg</a>’s iridescent disco-ball creation.

Place the gems on top of an exaggerated cat eye and add some below your brows for extra effect.

Use your glittery outfit as inspiration when you're in a makeup rut and extend a shimmery colour out towards your temples in a wing-like shape. Finish with a smaller black wing and lashings of mascara — look to this photo of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dovecameron/"">Dove Cameron</a> for inspiration.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rose Gold Champagne</h2><br /><br />Move over gold and silver. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> pairs this gentle rose gold shimmery shadow with a bright, true red lip, and it screams Christmas without feeling like you belong in a Hallmark movie. What really makes this look stand out is the mascara.

We said <em>almost</em>. To achieve a similar matte eyeshadow look in one product, a liquid eyeshadow is your best friend. <a href=""https://fave.co/3OKVc0g"">ILIA Liquid Powder Eye Shadow Tint in Tannin</a>, and <a href=""https://us.lisaeldridge.com/products/gaia-liquid-silk-liquid-eyeshadow?variant=50406424903983"">Lisa Eldridge Liquid Silk Eyeshadow in Gaia</a>, will give you everything you need.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Very Camo Christmas</h2><br /><br />Camo-coloured clothes are here to stay, and this olive-toned shadow look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexademie/"">Alexa Demie</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaleteter/"">Kale Teter</a> will definitely make you stand out from the crowd.

That gentle pop of brown really elevates the look as a whole.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lively Lavender</h2><br /><br />We're not gonna lie — we've already started tucking away our vivid pastel colours from summer, but this lavender liner Babsky uses on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/negga.ruth/?hl=en"">Ruth Negga</a> is proof that pastel is still in, even in the wintertime. It's topped off with the perfect nude shimmery lip.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Neon Hot Winter</h2><br /><br />A bright neon pink might feel off-season when it comes to our wardrobes, but this look on Dove Cameron by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaleteter/"">Kale Teter</a> is proof that it works on eyelids all season long — especially when using negative space. <a href=""https://www.glistencosmetics.com/products/strawberry-wet-liner"">Glisten Cosmetics Wet Liner</a>, is easy to use when recreating this look at home.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Cranberry Wine</h2><br /><br />It's officially time to pull out your vampy purples and make a huge statement at your New Year's Eve party. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/monicastylemuse/"">MonicaStyleMuse makes</a> a strong case for the vampy, plum wine lip with this look, which you can try for yourself using <a href=""https://fave.co/4ipfSbL"">Gucci Rouge a Levres Satin in Virginia Fleur de Lis</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Festive Smoke</h2><br />Upgrade your basic smoky eye to a sultry one by adding a pop of color in your lower lash line, similar to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/itsmyrayeraye/"">Raye Boyce</a>'s.

To achieve this look, start with a layer of sunny yellow eyeshadow, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Feyewear%3Fvariant%3D41020610576418"">Victoria Beckham EyeWear in Sunflower</a>, and top it with a warm gold, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maccosmetics.com%2Fproduct%2F13840%2F363%2Fproducts%2Fmakeup%2Feyes%2Feyeshadow%2Feye-shadow%3Fshade%3DIf_It_Ain%2527t_Baroque"">MAC Eye Shadow in If It Ain’t Baroque</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Feye%2Feyeshadow%2Fultimate-glow-shots-liquid-eyeshadow%2F800897225414.html"">NYX Ultimate Glow Shots Liquid Eyeshadow in Lemon Slayed</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Glam And Gorgeous</h2><br />Want to be the <em>extra </em>cousin at the family party?

Start with a smudged smokey eye (the more unkempt, the better) and top it with some glitter in the center of the eye on both the upper and lower lids. Opt for either a less precise splash of sparkles or a more deliberate vertical line of glitter  — think chic clown makeup.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>Some things remain constant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">every winter</a>: no matter how prepared you are, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">your skin</a> will feel the brunt of the cold, you’ll almost always hate the sweaters you bought in last year’s sale with every intention of wearing them, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cherry-perfume-fragrance"">the perfumes</a> that saw you through spring, summer, and fall just won’t feel right once the temperature drops.</p>



<p>Luckily, perfumers have been busy whipping up all manner of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-only-human-fragrance-review"">winter-appropriate fragrances</a> to suit every winter mood, whether you want to feel cozy, confident at parties, or refreshed on gloomy mornings. </p>



<p>Scroll ahead for the most inviting winter perfume trends and tips on how to wear them this chilly season — and beyond.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>



<p>Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Fp%2Fbalmain-beauty-balmain-cuir-elysees-edp-50-prod284410126"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain Cuir Élysèes Eau de Parfum</a>, which blends raspberry with moody leather and enveloping sandalwood. If berries aren’t your thing, consider <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fjo-malone-sandalwood-spiced-apricot-cologne%2F8558395%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoraoEdGbW_5g9CjthQuB_RAWQYbSCQ5JIh4cnkd3OBbzQUVD6pM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jo Malone Sandalwood &amp; Spiced Apricot Cologne</a>, which pairs an otherwise summery fruit with rich, dark cardamom.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>



<p>Try layering <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcherry-ambition-eau-de-parfum-P508411"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition</a> (cherry, plum, vanilla marshmallow) with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP518376"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali Freedom Musk Latte Eau de Parfum</a> (latte, chocolate musk, and cinnamon). Returning this year, we also love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fjo-malone-london-ginger-biscuit-cologne-P509028"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jo Malone Ginger Biscuit Cologne</a>, featuring lemon, roasted hazelnut, and tonka bean with hints of vanilla and tobacco.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>

So crave-worthy, Stegemann says this “foodie fragrance” sold out in 48 hours in more than 60 Sephora stores and immediately became the number two fragrance on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2F7-virtues"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sephora.com</a>. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>

Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/horoscope"">December opens with a spark</a>… and it’s not subtle. Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30th, and suddenly the collective mood shifts from Scorpio’s  shadowy introspection to something brighter, bolder, more curious, and admittedly  more chaotic. Venus in Sagittarius wants us to flirt with life again: say yes to adventure,  follow the spark, romanticize the journey, book the flight, flirt with the stranger at the café, and let our hearts stretch wider than our comfort zones. But the shadow side of Venus in Sag is real: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">burnout, overbooking ourselves</a>, saying yes to too many  invitations, and then remembering (sometimes too late) that we still live in human bodies with human limits. Water signs and Earth signs in particular may feel the social  pressure rising, so move with intention: joy doesn’t have to mean depletion. </p>



<p>The week also begins with the Moon in Aries, forming a fiery trine to Venus in Sagittarius. This combo is pure superhero energy for the collective: confidence, momentum, fresh starts, bold declarations, and an “I can do anything” vibe that’s both empowering and a little dangerous. Aries fire plus Sagittarius fire equals fast decisions, big feelings, impulsive confessions, and the urge to start ten new things at once. You should absolutely use the momentum, but remember that fire needs direction or it  becomes a wildfire. If you’re feeling scattered or overstimulated, breathe, center yourself, and slow down before you sprint. </p>



<p>From December 2nd to 3rd, the moon settles into Taurus, offering a stabilizing, grounding pause before the cosmic plot twist: the Gemini Full Moon strikes December 4th at 6:14 p.m. EST. This lunation is information-heavy, and could lead to breaking news, big reveals, sudden clarity, misunderstood texts, resurfaced conversations, and plot twists in communication. Geminis in your life may act differently this week, more  honest or more unfiltered. Because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury just ended its retrograde</a> (and is still  moving through its post-shadow), this full moon may bring echoes or loose ends from the retrograde cycle: the truth behind something you misread, the person who ghosted suddenly reappearing, unfinished conversations resurfacing. Flexibility is your best friend. Stay curious, not reactive. </p>



<p>And then, as if the cosmos knew we’d need a moment to process, the moon enters Cancer late on December 5th, softening the edges of all the stimulation. This Cancer Moon weekend invites us to retreat gently into ourselves: rest more, feel more, listen to our intuition more closely. After the fiery open to the week and the airy full moon peak, Cancer reminds us that integration happens in silence. This is the weekend to trust your inner tides, not the noise of the world. December wants momentum, but it wants  emotional wisdom, too. The question is: can you honor both? </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, start the week with a spark, not a sprint. The moon’s in your sign, harmonizing  with Venus, which has freshly entered Sagittarius. It’s giving “inspired momentum,” not  “burnout hustle.” You may feel the urge to dive headfirst into new ventures,  conversations, or crushes, but let your fire simmer rather than explode. Venus in  Sagittarius is lighting up your expansion and travel sector for the next few weeks, encouraging you to think bigger about love, passion, and creative collaborations — and to not settle for lukewarm. This is the kind of energy that asks: what would your life look like if you actually believed it could feel like an adventure? </p>



<p>By December 4th, the Full Moon in Gemini hits your communication sector, bringing a six-month story to a head. Think back to the ideas you had or seeds you planted around the Gemini New Moon in early June — what’s blossomed? What needs pruning? This lunation’s about reclaiming your voice, refining your message, and letting curiosity lead you closer to truth. If your opinions have changed, let them. If your truth  has evolved, speak it. Your identity is expanding, and so is your power to influence. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your planetary ruler Venus enters Sagittarius this week, activating your sector  of intimacy, shared resources, and transformation, and it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sugar-daddy-relationship-financial-benefits"">giving </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sugar-daddy-relationship-financial-benefits"">spiritual sugar daddy</a>, </em>but make it emotional alchemy. You’re being asked to trust more deeply, not just in  others, but in your ability to evolve through the unknown. The Aries Moon earlier this  week stirs your subconscious, surfacing long-lost dreams, old fears, and buried  passion projects that still deserve a seat at your table. Let those messages rise without judgment. This is a week to check in with yourself: have you been overgiving or underreceiving? </p>



<p>By the time the Full Moon in Gemini arrives on December 4th, your value systems, income streams, and confidence levels get a cosmic spotlight. You’re invited to  celebrate how far you’ve come since June while also being real about what needs  rebalancing. Financially, you might be tying up loose ends or finally getting a payoff. Emotionally, it’s about owning your worth and no longer letting guilt or comparison dim  your light. Say yes to aligned abundance, Taurus. And say no with your whole chest to anything that drains your joy. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to reintroduce yourself? This is <em>your </em>annual Full Moon week,  peaking December 4th, and it’s giving radiant reinvention, emotional release, and main  character spotlight. But before we get there, Venus slides into Sagittarius and lights up  your sector of relationships, partnerships, and soulmate contracts. People from your past may resurface, but so might visions of the kind of love, support, and collaboration you’ve long craved. The key? Don’t settle for half-hearted connections… not when the universe is offering you soul-deep mirrors. </p>



<p>With the moon shining brightly in your sign on the 4th, the spotlight is undeniably on you. This lunation wraps up a six-month cycle that began with the Gemini new moon in June, and it’s showing you just how much you’ve grown in your identity, your self expression, and your capacity to communicate your truth, even when it’s messy or uncertain. This is a week to reintroduce yourself, not because you’ve changed who you are, but because you’re finally ready to own who you’ve always been. Let your inner twins dance it out. People are watching and your life is accelerating in the direction of your brightest dreams. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/healed-too-much-self-work-romantic-relationships"">your healing era</a> has officially begun. Venus enters Sagittarius this week, activating your sector of wellness, rituals, and routines, and it’s reminding you that self care doesn’t have to be boring. Whether it’s journaling in your robe, a mid-morning dance break, or meal-prepping with incense and a playlist, you’re being encouraged to re-enchant your day-to-day. Love, pleasure, and creativity can all thrive when you feel  grounded and well-nourished. You may attract partners or collaborators who genuinely want to help you glow — don’t push them away out of pride. Venus in Sag invites you to loosen your grip on perfection and welcome a more easeful rhythm. And with Mercury no longer retrograde in your sector of health and service, it’s easier to set boundaries, ask for support, and find new systems that actually serve your peace. </p>



<p>But it’s the Gemini Full Moon on December 4th that tugs most deeply at your spirit. Lighting up your sector of closure, healing, and dreams, this lunation is a soul cleanse. Since the Gemini New Moon in June, you’ve been quietly shedding subconscious patterns that were never yours to carry… especially in your relationship to work, rest, and being needed. This is a powerful moment to retreat, unplug, and reflect. You’re ruled by the moon so you’ll likely feel this one viscerally. Let yourself cry, laugh, sleep,  scream, or do all four in one hour. Release with grace. There’s a version of you that’s  trying to emerge, and this full moon is clearing the path. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Venus has entered your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius, lighting up your creativity,  romance, and joy sector like a sparkler on a summer’s night. After a period of deep  emotional excavations during Venus in Scorpio — perhaps tied to your home, family, or  even inner child wounds — you’re ready to remember that love can be playful, not just  profound. This transit reminds you that not every muse has to be a twin flame; sometimes the best art and affection comes from those who make you laugh. Your magnetism is magnetic (yes, we meant that twice), and your heart is craving  movement, beauty, and fresh flirtations. If love has felt like a to-do list lately, Venus in Sag is here to toss that list in the bonfire and dance with you instead. </p>



<p>Then comes the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th, activating your community and collaboration sector. It’s asking: who’s in your corner, really? You’ve been reflecting on the difference between friends and fans, between acquaintances and soul kin. This full moon brings clarity and possibly closure to a social chapter that began around the Gemini New Moon six months ago. Whether you’re stepping into leadership, launching a new project with friends, or letting go of social obligations that feel fake, trust the shifts. As a Fixed sign, change isn’t always comfy, but this one is necessary. Celebrate the connections that feel soul-deep and peacefully release the ones that are draining. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Venus in Sagittarius lights a fire in your home, roots, and emotional foundation sector this week, Virgo, and it might stir up some beautifully chaotic feelings in the process. You’re being asked to soften, to laugh more at the messiness of  life, and to stop trying to spreadsheet your healing. Whether it’s love blooming under your roof or creativity sparked through nesting, this transit is inviting you to romanticize your inner world again. After the intensity of Venus in Scorpio sharpening your thoughts and deepening conversations, now’s the time to tend to your space, physical, emotional, and energetic, with warmth and joy. Fall in love with your corner of the universe. </p>



<p>The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th hits your career and legacy sector, marking a  moment of recognition, realignment, or both. A goal you’ve been quietly working toward since June might now come to fruition, or you may realize that a certain  path no longer resonates. Either way, clarity is the gift of this lunation. As a Mercury-ruled sign, you’ll appreciate the full moon’s ability to illuminate what’s real and what’s not in your professional life. Just don’t get so caught up in  proving your worth that you forget you’re already worthy. This week, lead with grounded confidence, and let the results speak for themselves. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, your days are asking for devotion, not perfection. Venus, your planetary  ruler, has moved into Sagittarius and is lighting up your communication sector. That means love notes, passion projects, and big ideas are flowing with ease — especially when you stop overthinking and speak straight from your heart. This is a great time to pitch your work, submit that manuscript, or flirt your way through a meaningful DM exchange. Conversations feel more abundant, playful, and less stuck in their usual spirals. You’re still integrating the lessons from Venus in Scorpio, which asked you to get serious about your worth. Now it’s time to expand romantically, creatively, financially.  </p>



<p>Later in the week the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th activates your expansion zone and brings major clarity around your long-term vision. A seed you planted six months ago — maybe an online course, travel plan, spiritual practice, or even a shift in mindset — is now blooming in a way that surprises you. You’re being invited to believe in your future self, not just in theory, but through consistent rituals and courageous choices. Give yourself permission to dream again… The  world hasn’t seen all your magic yet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, if it feels like a test, you’re probably passing. This week begins with Venus exiting your sign and entering Sagittarius, activating your finance and self-worth zone for the next four weeks. You may feel a sudden shift from  introspection to action, such as suddenly feeling ready to monetize your magic… or at least stop second-guessing it. Your relationship with money is transforming, and so is your sense of what you truly deserve. Opportunities to attract more (whether clients, resources, or love) are magnetized when you stay  rooted in your values. Even small wins like paying off a bill or receiving an unexpected gift are proof that you’re expanding. You’ve done the inner work. Let the outer abundance meet you halfway. </p>



<p>On the 4th, the Gemini Full Moon lands in your intimacy and transformation sector, helping you release old attachments or debts from the past six months, both emotional and energetic. A story that’s been unfolding since June is reaching its next chapter, especially in terms of trust, sex, or shared resources. This is deep water, but you’re a Scorpio: you were made for this. Swim through it — not alone, but with someone who’s shown they can hold your hand in the dark. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, are you ready for all eyes to be on you? Venus enters your sign this week and you’re on top of your game — socially, financially, and creatively. There’s a glow up happening, not just in how you look but how you love, but  how you attract abundance, and how you carry yourself through the world. This is your magnetic reset. Don’t be surprised if exes come knocking or new admirers start orbiting… you’re radiating warmth and people are taking note. Professionally, this is also a great time to pitch or relaunch something, especially if it involves personal branding. View yourself as both the muse and the mogul. </p>



<p>But underneath all this shine, the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th turns your  attention to your relationships. Whether romantic, platonic, or business-related, you’re seeing a dynamic more clearly now — maybe one that’s been foggy or undefined since June. You might decide to commit deeper, renegotiate terms, or lovingly let go. Either way, you’re craving real reciprocity. Are your connections mirroring your growth, or have you outgrown some dynamics you once clung to? Full moons can feel like emotional crescendos, and this one reminds you that the version of love you accept is also the version of love you believe you deserve. Choose yourself first, and watch the rest align. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the softer you become with your inner world, the stronger your outer world  gets. Venus enters your sector of solitude, healing, and closure this week, encouraging  you to unplug, reset, and nourish your body and spirit. This is a cosmic reminder that the richest creativity and wealth often arise in moments of rest, not hustle. If you’ve been moving at full speed recently, Venus in Sagittarius offers permission to pause and realign your routines with your deeper values. You’re allowed to take breaks. You’re allowed to do less and still be deeply worthy. Quiet luxuries like journaling in bed, saying no without explanation, and choosing pleasure over performance are your medicine now. </p>



<p>As the Gemini Full Moon peaks midweek, your sector of wellness, work, and daily structure is illuminated, revealing what needs to shift in how you manage your time and energy. Maybe you’ve been doing too much for too many, or maybe you’ve been stuck in patterns that drain you more than they serve you. This lunation helps you draw  clearer boundaries, especially now that Mercury is no longer retrograde. You can finally  see where you’ve been overextending and where life is inviting more ease. Let go of  the need to prove your worth through productivity. It’s time to reorganize your priorities so that they reflect your actual dreams… not just your obligations. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you finally ready to let the group chat know what you’re up to? Venus in  Sagittarius is activating your sector of social networks, friendships, and visibility for the  next four weeks, encouraging you to step out of hermit mode and into the mix. You may find yourself craving more authentic connection with people who reflect your values and dreams, especially the ones you’ve met online, across oceans, or through shared intellectual passions. If you’ve been holding off on launching a project, selling a digital product, or seeking support for a community-based idea, this is the green light you’ve been waiting for. Venus here brings charm, optimism, and abundance when you lead with joy and collaboration. Don’t underestimate the power of your presence; your  people are watching, rooting, and ready to support. </p>



<p>The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th lights up your sector of creative expression, romance, and inner child healing — and it’s a powerful moment to reclaim your right to play. What have you been quietly dreaming of creating, birthing, or sharing with the world since June’s new moon? This lunation wants to remind you that you are not too weird, too different, or too far ahead… you are <em>exactly </em>what’s needed. Pour yourself into your  poetry, your crushes, your late-night brainstorms. Even if it’s messy or unfinished or doesn’t “convert,” the process itself is sacred. Let art and flirtation become your medicine. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, it’s time to stop hiding your brilliance. Venus enters Sagittarius at the start of the week and lights up your career and legacy sector, helping you bring more magnetism, style, and abundance to your professional life. You may find yourself offered an opportunity that feels both expansive and slightly intimidating… trust that you’ve already done the inner work to be ready. People are noticing your gifts in rooms you don’t even know you’re in yet. Venus here softens your self-doubt and reminds you that grace, creativity, and intuition are your leadership superpowers. If you’ve been waiting to pitch an idea, publish something major, or relaunch your personal brand, do it now. It’s time to let your name be known. </p>



<p>Then on the 4th, the Gemini Full Moon peaks in your sector of home, ancestry, and emotional foundations, asking you to slow down and reflect on how much you’ve changed since June. This lunation might feel more sensitive than usual, not in a bad way, but in a way that encourages you to root deeper into what feels nourishing and real. Tears may come, memories may return, and your inner child may speak louder than usual. Let it all be data, be guidance, be sacred. It’s okay to want more safety, softness, and clarity at the same time as you reach for your goals. You’re allowed to  want it all Pisces, and with Saturn now direct in your sign for one final stretch, you’re getting closer. </p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: Black Friday is the biggest day of the year for can’t-miss deals.</p>



<p>With the big day finally here, it’s finally time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>
