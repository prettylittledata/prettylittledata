<p>Project 1374 is located in one of the plotted developments in the north of Bangalore, characterized by well-demarcated plots, spacious roads, and organized infrastructure. Trees flank the wide streets, dividing the plots with dense canopies offering shaded avenues. Abutting the plot stood a cluster of trees- a quiet presence. We borrowed these trees into the design, their presence extending into the home's narrative. </p>",

<p>Located in Danjingshan Town, Pengzhou, Sichuan, the Jianjiang Small Train Linear Park is a comprehensive tourism route centered on railway stations, organically connecting dining, exhibitions, arts, and heritage revitalization. Its predecessor, the Peng-Bai Railway, was a narrow-gauge line opened in 1961. Although operations ceased in 2004, it remains an irreplaceable emotional bond for the people of Pengzhou. In 2024, driven by the ""Operations-Led"" philosophy, Jiulong Xinchuang and UN-GROUP launched a revival plan. They proposed the concept of ""Time Fold · Rebirth on Tracks,"" linking over ten project nodes via 3.5 kilometers of rail, with full completion expected by 2026.</p>",

<p>""Vala"" is a response to a fundamental question: How can we create a place for collective living and conscious presence within today's dense and vertical urban fabric? The project, centered on the construction of 50 residential units within a single volume, brings human density into an integrated structure where social interactions and a sense of belonging to the neighborhood can emerge.</p>",

<p>The BTE - Casa Machado project is situated on a plot measuring 13 meters in width by 44 meters in depth, resulting from the subdivision of the garden of a former grand residence, located in a residential neighborhood of Castelar characterized by its traditional houses. This dwelling stands out for its commitment to sensitive habitability, achieved through the fragmentation of a compact volume by creating internal courtyards that seek a careful synergy between interior spaces and the surrounding vegetation.</p>",

<h4>Why designing for ongoing reflection matters</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YdEqBs6grwOdVyas5r5wmg.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>It’s that time of year again where apps confidently tell us who we are. This year, Spotify informed me that I’m 78 years old in Spotify years (I’m 33 in human ones). I personally thought my affinity for Chapel Roan would have shaved off a decade or two but I guess not! Strava had thoughts about my running habits. YouTube summarized my viewing habits and decided I was an Adventurer, whatever that means. Even LinkedIn had something to say about who I’d been professionally!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBtrompAT6QsWV11msQQYA.png"" /><figcaption>Image of YouTube, LinkedIn and Spotify Wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly I don’t want to be a hater, these year-end wrap ups are fun! They feel personal. They often even feel accurate. But also they create an uneasiness and raise a question I keep coming back to. <strong>How do these systems actually decide who we are?</strong></p><p>At a high level, most of the systems I mentioned learn about us through our behavior. Some of that behavior is subtle, like how long we linger, what we skip, when we hesitate. Some of it feels more intentional like likes, follows, comments, subscriptions etc. In most cases, we’re not carefully declaring who we want to be to our products.</p><p>Over time, we learn that these implicit behaviors function as levers. If we want less of something, we skip it. If we want more, we engage. We adapt ourselves to these janky systems. It’s a very narrow kind of control because we don’t know the weight of each actions on our experience. Then once a year, we’re handed a polished summary of who the system thinks we are. But there are better ways to explore this.</p><p>Awhile ago, I had the opportunity to work on a project for a company called Ground News. Their goal is to aggregate news sources into one place in order to give you a clearer picture of your news diet. Part of how they do that is through a feature called <a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage""><em>My Media Bias</em></a>. This feature returns your media consumption data back to you in a structured, legible way showing what sources you read, how they’re distributed across the political spectrum, and where potential blind spots might exist.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of the design for My Media Bias showing all the different ways to see bias"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yBtPNS4Qc0D9lDAtm47SBQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage"">Image of the design for My Media Bias</a></figcaption></figure><p>The design intent wasn’t to tell people what their biases were, but to make their own consumption data visible in a way that could be inspected and revisited over time. <strong>Over time</strong> is a distinction that matters. Ground’s approach treats visibility as part of the ongoing experience, not a once-a-year summary. That kind of continuous feedback supports insight and intentional adjustment in a way that opaque behavioral feedback loops don’t.</p><p>In truth there’s a reason most large platforms privilege behavioral signals. From a systems perspective, <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781121"">they work</a>! Observed behavior (what we click, watch, skip, or linger on) is abundant, continuous, and highly predictive of what we’ll do next. Decades of recommender systems research show that these implicit signals consistently outperform self-reported preferences when it comes to predicting future interaction.</p><p>And I can’t deny that, but these signals only describe what happened, not what a person is trying to do. That’s where explicit preferences matter. They’re messier, slower, and harder to collect but they’re the only place intent actually lives. When systems treat stated preferences as secondary or optional. They often sideline the user’s own goals.</p><p>What’s interesting about these year-end summaries is the kind of relationship they establish between the system and the person using it. You can see what the system thinks of you, but you can’t interrogate it, correct it, or guide it in any explicit way. The moment for reflection arrives only after the system has already learned everything it’s going to learn from you that year.</p><p>When assumptions are visible as they’re being formed, users have the opportunity to respond with intention rather than reaction. That’s a fundamentally different kind of agency. It treats people less like sources of signals and more like collaborators in the modeling process.</p><p>Systems that meaningfully shape what we see, hear, and engage with are making value-laden decisions on our behalf. When the only way to influence those decisions is through opaque behavioral feedback, users are left guessing how to express intent.</p><p>Wrapped features are interesting because they acknowledge that people want to understand how they’re being seen. The problem is that so far all of the examples I’ve seen stop short of giving users the tools that would actually support that understanding. There’s no invitation to adjust or say this doesn’t quite feel right.</p><p>To be clear, I’m glad Wrapped exists. I hope more companies keep doing these kinds of reflections. They offer a rare glimpse into how these systems see us, what they prioritize, and where their interpretations fall short.</p><p>The more interesting question isn’t whether Wrapped gets us right or wrong. It’s why reflection shows up as a once-a-year artifact instead of an ongoing conversation. If systems are going to model us continuously, it’s worth asking why we’re only invited to reflect after the fact, rather than participate while that model is still being formed.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9e04820ac1fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/well-thats-a-wrap-9e04820ac1fb"">Well, thats a wrap…</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Designing trustworthy AI for healthcare products.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BPMSzNXvppl613yAsV2cgw.png"" /><figcaption>User holding a phone using an AI healthcare assistant</figcaption></figure><p>AI is entering one of the most human domains: healthcare. It helps people track sleep, manage chronic conditions, monitor mental health, and navigate loneliness. It listens, advises, and sometimes comforts. Yet despite these advances, hesitation remains, not because the algorithms are weak, but because the experience does not always feel reliable.</p><p>In this context, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not just an emotional response. It is about system reliability, the confidence that an AI assistant will behave predictably, communicate clearly, and acknowledge uncertainty responsibly. In healthcare, that reliability is not optional. Even when AI performs well, people still hesitate. They ask: <em>Can I rely on this? Does it really understand me? What happens if it’s wrong?</em></p><p>Patients will not act on guidance they do not trust, and clinicians will not adopt tools they cannot interpret. Yet most discussions about healthcare AI focus on accuracy, regulation, or data quality. The lived experience of reliability, the part users actually engage with, often remains underdesigned.</p><p>Trust is not built by algorithms alone. It is shaped by clarity, empathy, and predictable behavior. Micro-decisions matter, how an AI care assistant expresses uncertainty, the tone it uses when discussing symptoms, and how transparently it explains its limits. These design choices determine whether people rely on a system when it matters most.</p><p>For healthcare designers, the role extends beyond usability. We design for psychological safety, ensuring technology does not confuse, mislead, or cause harm. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-role-of-ux-in-ai-driven-healthcare-2ed0ffc15801""><strong>Roxane Leitão (2024)</strong></a> describes this shift as UX moving from interface design to <strong><em>risk mediation</em></strong> in AI-driven healthcare.</p><h3><strong>Trust is a design problem, not an AI problem</strong></h3><p>Conversations about trust in AI often drift toward technical questions: <em>How accurate is the model? How clean is the data? How fair is the output?</em></p><p>These questions matter, but they miss a core truth: users do not experience algorithms. They experience interfaces. Jakob Nielsen’s observation that <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-new-ui-paradigm""><strong>AI is the first new UI paradigm in 60 years</strong></a> underscores this shift: intelligence is now expressed through interaction, not screens alone.<strong> </strong>People engage with tone, timing, and transparency. They form mental and emotional models of a system based on how it behaves under uncertainty.</p><p>Take AI-powered symptom checkers. Many rely on similar clinical models and datasets, yet users trust some far more than others. The difference is rarely accuracy alone. It lies in how uncertainty is framed, when human escalation occurs, and whether the system explains its reasoning.</p><figure><img alt=""Symptom checker demo from ADA Health"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZPMhikb0CCQDaIj3tHrMgA.gif"" /><figcaption>ADA Health © Symptom checker demo</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>When a chatbot says, </em><strong>“Based on what you shared, this could be consistent with a mild infection,”</strong> <em>versus</em> <strong>“You might have an infection and should seek care immediately,”</strong> <em>the underlying model may be identical. The experience is not. One response supports informed judgment; the other triggers anxiety. That shift affects behavior, follow-up, and long-term trust.</em></blockquote><h3><strong>The emotional layer of accuracy</strong></h3><p>Healthcare AI is becoming more precise, but precision alone does not drive trust. What matters is whether people feel they can rely on the system in practice.</p><p>In its reporting on AI and chest X-ray diagnosis, The New York Times<strong> </strong>described a recurring pattern: AI systems performed well in benchmarks, yet experienced radiologists made better decisions in real clinical settings. The story emphasized that the problem was not technical failure, but what happens when AI moves from controlled environments into everyday medical practice. Radiologists explained that they interpret images in context, weighing patient history, ambiguity, and uncertainty. By contrast, <a href=""https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ai-nhs-tests-radiologist-lung-disease-diagnosis-jl5h3t59w?id=17515457033&amp;gad_source=1""><strong><em>the AI systems featured in the article</em></strong></a> could detect patterns but struggled to explain why a finding mattered or how confident it was. Clinicians did not reject AI; they stressed that it worked best as an assistant, not an authority. When conclusions arrived without context or visible uncertainty, hesitation followed, not because the AI was wrong, but because it was difficult to rely on safely.</p><p>Interfaces that feel inconsistent, cold, or evasive undermine confidence, even when the model is strong. Conversely, systems that communicate clearly, behave consistently, and acknowledge uncertainty support reliable decision-making, even when answers are imperfect.</p><p>As AI becomes part of daily health routines, designers play a key role in:</p><ul><li>Turning complex care flow into clear signals users can trust and act on</li><li>Deciding when the system should sound confident, cautious, or humble</li><li>Communicating risk and uncertainty without creating unnecessary fear</li></ul><h3><strong>Designing the micro-interactions of reliability</strong></h3><p>Reliance is built through micro-interactions:</p><ul><li>How the AI care assistant responds to “<strong><em>I’m tired”</em></strong></li><li>Whether it remembers prior concerns or treats every interaction as new</li><li>How it communicates limits or inability to help</li><li>Whether it sets realistic expectations instead of overpromising</li></ul><p>These signals accumulate, creating either a sense of dependable consistency, or its absence.</p><figure><img alt=""The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*igRBOAa4hzdnKyBvBRbBaA.png"" /><figcaption>Julian Chokkattu for Wired © «The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach »</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/9Az-rDDEuT8?si=Jsc4H8XaVA4EI28k""><strong>Fitbit’s AI Coach</strong></a> offers a useful example. As Julian Chokkattu described in <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/fitbit-app-ai-personal-health-coach/""><strong><em>Wired</em> (2025)</strong></a>, Fitbit’s shift toward an AI-powered health companion focuses less on prediction and more on explanation. It does not diagnose or claim medical authority, yet millions rely on it daily for sleep insights, recovery guidance, and activity suggestions. Its credibility comes from consistency, data grounding, and clear boundaries. By explaining why it makes suggestions, for example, “<em>Here’s a breakdown of what your data tells us</em>…” and framing guidance as optional rather than prescriptive, the system informs rather than instructs.

Users expect empathy, yet systems must remain factual. They want guidance, but AI cannot diagnose. They seek simplicity, but transparency introduces complexity.</p><p>Balancing these tensions is where UX becomes strategy. Design is no longer about polish or delight. It defines the relationship between humans and technology in moments of vulnerability. As <a href=""https://www.g-co.agency/insights/healthcare-ux-design-transforming-patient-journeys-for-better-care""><strong><em>G &amp; Co. (2025)</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>describe, healthcare UX increasingly functions as care choreography, aligning emotional, informational, and clinical layers. Trust in healthcare AI is not a technical output, it is a design outcome.</p><h3><strong>Designing for trust: three core principles</strong></h3><h4><strong>Progressive transparency</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant explains its actions without overwhelming users. It communicates what it knows, what it does not, and how it reached its conclusions.</p><blockquote><em>For example, instead of saying, </em>“<strong>This application does not provide medical advice,</strong>”<em> the system might say, </em><strong>“I’m not a doctor, but I can help you understand your symptoms and decide whether to speak with a healthcare professional.”</strong><em> Making uncertainty visible, such as indicating “70% confident,” while offering next steps reassures users and preserves agency</em>.</blockquote><h4><strong>Calibrated empathy</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant adjusts its tone to the user’s context, acknowledging emotion and uncertainty without amplifying anxiety. AI mental-health products like Wysa © and Woebot © exemplify this approach, guiding users toward coping strategies or human support without emotive excess.</p><p>If a user says, <strong>“<em>I’m feeling anxious</em>”</strong> a helpful response might be, <strong>“<em>Here are a few techniques that may help”</em></strong><em>, or </em><strong><em>“I can help you find professional support</em>”</strong> rather than a generic emotional reaction like, “<em>I’m sorry you’re feeling that way </em>❤️.”</p><p>Active listening cues such as <strong><em>“It sounds like…”</em></strong>, avoiding overly friendly avatars, and maintaining emotional consistency make empathy functional: it recognizes feelings while guiding toward clear next steps.</p><h4><strong>Consistent reliability</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant behaves predictably across interactions, so users know what to expect. Consistency appears in voice, style, context awareness, privacy considerations, and responsiveness. Making the system’s actions visible reduces confusion from sudden silences or unexpected behavior. Holistic consistency also limits AI hallucinations <strong><em>(</em></strong><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01670-7""><strong><em>npj Digital Medicine, 2024</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong> and prevents misleading outputs. Predictable systems reduce cognitive load, letting users focus on health rather than interface interpretation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hingehealth.com/fr/fr/about/our-approach-to-ai/""><strong><em>Hinge Health</em></strong></a> illustrates these principles in practice. Its AI-driven programs integrate clinician oversight to maintain progressive transparency, guide interactions with calibrated empathy, and deliver consistent, predictable feedback. This approach reinforces trust, human judgment, and patient agency simultaneously.</p><h3><strong>DesignOps and collaborative design</strong></h3><p>In healthcare, a good user experience must also be safe and accountable. DesignOps plays a critical role; key design decisions, ethical, clinical, and psychological, should be documented and defensible. Alignment across UX, product, data, and clinical teams creates shared accountability.</p><p>High-performing teams involve clinical co-design early, run cross-disciplinary reviews, and treat user research as validation, measuring trust as a real outcome. When trust becomes a shared goal, the product shifts from tool to <strong><em>companion.</em></strong></p><h3><strong>Measuring the UX of trust</strong></h3><p>When users interact with AI care assistants, clicks and retention are not enough. Emotional insight matters. Beyond engagement metrics, teams increasingly track:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived reliability:</strong> <em>Does this assistant give credible answers?</em></li><li><strong>Transparency recall:</strong> <em>Do users understand its limits?</em></li><li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> <em>Did the experience reassure or confuse?</em></li></ul><p>These measures reflect a growing shift toward <strong>trust as a design KPI</strong>, supported by qualitative research and sentiment analysis.</p><h3><strong>Design as a layer of safety</strong></h3><p>Safety in healthcare AI is not only technical or clinical; it is experiential.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear disclaimers</strong> reduce misuse</li><li><strong>Timely reassurance</strong> reduces anxiety</li><li><strong>Predictable care flows</strong> reduce cognitive load</li></ul><p>The design system, therefore, is not just aesthetic, it’s behavioral infrastructure. It shapes how people feel in moments that matter. That’s a responsibility, not just a craft. In healthcare, good design can literally make people feel safer, and act safer.</p><figure><img alt=""Heidi Health is an AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0NC8tqa_GAcYv8k4bFwNuQ.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Heidi Health ©</strong> An AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Human-in-the-loop as a design choice</strong></h3><p>Visible human oversight is a strong trust signal. On <a href=""https://huma.com/products/huma-intelligence""><strong><em>Huma Therapeutics</em></strong></a> ©’s platform, generative AI synthesizes data and drafts insights, but clinicians review every output. AI supports care without replacing accountability. Making human oversight visible transforms AI from an invisible authority into a transparent assistant.

That’s how trust moves from being an abstract value to something tangible in the experience.</blockquote><h3><strong>Closing thought</strong></h3><p>Designing AI for healthcare means designing for trust, vulnerability, and agency, simultaneously. <strong><em>Trust</em></strong> is not abstract. It can be designed, documented, measured, and protected. The goal is not to make machines appear human, but to make technology worthy of human reliance. In digital health, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not a luxury; it is a prerequisite.</p><p>When we build a health AI assistant or companion, we’re inviting vulnerability. People share their symptoms, their fears, their habits. They’re stepping into a space where mistakes, misunderstandings or miscommunications really matter. Our responsibility as designers is to make that exchange safe, by showing limits, guiding with care, and behaving consistently enough that users know what to expect.</p><p>Ultimately, the next frontier is agency: empowering people with control, not just information.</p><p><strong>I hope this article sparks new ways of thinking about design in AI healthcare.

<h4>Generative AI and the long history of artistic automation</h4><figure><img alt=""An AI-generated image in the style of a Renaissance drawing. The drawing features a Renaissance era studio but with futuristic elements such as robot arms and mechanical computers"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qtSUcZMRdCQn9eZJtfBeyg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image generated via Google Nano Banana</figcaption></figure><p>The discourse surrounding generative AI in the creative arts is frequently characterised by a sense of historical rupture, a seismic shift unlike any that has come before. Critics often frame the emergence of Large Language Models and diffusion-based image generators as an unprecedented existential threat to the ‘soul’ of human expression, a black swan event that may signal the end of human creative sovereignty. However, when we look back over the history of Western art and technology, it becomes clearer that this anxiety is not a new phenomenon but rather a recurring structural feature of the relationship between human intent and technical innovation. Whenever a new tool emerges that threatens to lower the barrier to entry or automate a process previously governed by arduous manual labour, the established artistic class has responded with a mixture of moral panic, accusations of ‘soullessness,’ and a retreat into essentialist definitions of <a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">what constitutes ‘true’ art</a>.</p><p>To understand this moment, we must contextualise AI within the history of artistic tools and conceptual shifts, while simultaneously confronting the very real socio-economic and ethical challenges it poses to the creative ecosystem.</p><h3>Deconstructing the toupee fallacy</h3><p>Early criticism of generative AI focused on the poor quality of its output. GenAI was not yet a threat because it could not compete with human creative output on quality or believability.</p><p>The visceral reaction against early GenAI perhaps stemmed from a hypersensitivity to anomalies that break the illusion of human authorship. The ‘uncanny valley’ describes a revulsion response to humanoid representations that are almost, but not quite, human — a phenomenon observed in robots, animatronics, and increasingly, AI-generated imagery. When an AI image displays six fingers or background incongruities, the viewer immediately labels it as ‘artificial’ and files it away as evidence that AI is easily detectable and low-quality.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href"">https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href</a><p>This creates a false impression of the technology’s overall capabilities through several reinforcing psychological biases. <a href=""https://gregrobison.medium.com/fooled-by-fakes-how-the-toupee-fallacy-blinds-us-to-high-quality-ai-content-a41e6b16b998"">The Toupee Fallacy</a> ensures that only the most noticeable (and typically worst) examples are identified, leading to the belief that AI is inherently detectable and of low aesthetic value. Flawless AI-generated images pass by unnoticed and unquestioned, creating a survivorship bias where only the failures are used to judge the entire category. This mental machinery is further fueled by the uncanny valley, where minor glitches like extra fingers are perceived as deep moral or spiritual failures rather than technical ones. Finally, anchoring bias causes us to fixate on these first ‘bad’ impressions, leading to a resistance to recognizing that these models improve exponentially over time.</p><p>This desire for authenticity can be observed in the ‘Invisible CGI’ phenomenon in the film industry. To guard against a backlash toward CGI in cinema, studios frequently market films by claiming “No CGI was used,” despite employing thousands of digital artists to composite scenes, remove safety rigs, and enhance environments. This practice was the subject of a video essay by Jonas Ussing titled <a href=""https://youtu.be/7ttG90raCNo?si=-FBLjvFtoqSpG8VI""><em>“NO CGI” is really just INVISIBLE CGI</em></a>.</p><p>When the CGI is ‘invisible,’ the public credits the ‘practical’ mastery of the director; when it is ‘bad,’ the technology is blamed. Direct experience becomes an unreliable guide to overall quality, as the viewer samples from the bottom of the distribution while remaining oblivious to the top performers.</p><h3>The mechanization of vision: from Vermeer to the silicon brush</h3><p>The most persistent argument against GenAI is that it removes the skill of the artist, allowing an amateur to produce high-quality work without the arduous training traditionally associated with mastery. Yet, the history of the Old Masters suggests that ‘skill’ has always been a fluid concept, frequently augmented by hidden technical aids. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockney%E2%80%93Falco_thesis"">Hockney-Falco thesis</a>, proposed by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles Falco, argues that the dramatic rise in naturalism in Western art from the early Renaissance was not due solely to improved talent, but to the widespread use of optical devices such as the camera obscura, camera lucida, and curved mirrors.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustrated diagram of the function of a camera obscura"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UE8Pr5R_ZtcI2ioTCIRrhw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration of a “portable” camera obscura studio in Kircher’s Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae (1645).</figcaption></figure><p>Johannes Vermeer is often cited as the archetype of this intersection between art and technology. Analysis of Vermeer’s work reveals ‘circles of confusion’ (pointillés) — optical artifacts that are physically impossible for the human eye to perceive but are characteristic of the ‘imperfect lenses’ of 17th-century camera obscuras. These halations of light on reflective surfaces, such as polished wood or glass, suggest that Vermeer was not ‘eyeballing’ his scenes but was instead ‘transcribing the intensities of light’ projected onto his canvas. Furthermore, the maps hanging in the background of Vermeer’s interiors have been found to be cartographically precise, a level of accuracy that <a href=""https://www.americanscientist.org/article/camera-obscurities"">strongly supports the use of a projection device</a>.</p><p>The historical trajectory of these aids directly parallels modern AI capabilities. The camera obscura, used by Vermeer and Canaletto, functioned by projecting a real-world scene onto a flat surface for tracing–a process mirrored by modern tools like Stable Diffusion’s ControlNet, which provides a structural ‘sketch’ for a model to fill. Similarly, the camera lucida, a prism device allowing an artist like Ingres to see the subject and canvas simultaneously, parallels current ‘image-to-image’ techniques that transform a base composition into a polished work.</p><p>Critics of the Hockney-Falco thesis, much like critics of AI, argue that such tools take away from the greatness of the masters. They maintain that a ‘man of genius’ should not require mere mechanism to achieve realism. However, experiments by Tim Jenison demonstrated that an individual with no formal training as a painter could reproduce a Vermeer-like image using a system of lenses and mirrors available in the 17th century (see Penn &amp; Teller’s documentary <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1""><em>Tim’s Vermeer</em></a>). Jenison’s work proved that Vermeer’s genius was not necessarily found in the manual dexterity of his hand, but in his choice to use technology to capture light in a way that was previously unthinkable.</p><p>Critics might argue that Vermeer still required the manual dexterity to apply the paint, whereas AI automates the image creation itself. This highlights the first major ‘shade of grey’: the transition from the handcrafted image to the ‘mechanically assisted’ image is centuries old, but the <em>degree</em> of automation in AI represents a quantum leap that challenges our definition of artistic labor.</p><h3>The human algorithm: the atelier system and the ‘broken pipeline’</h3><p>A secondary critique of AI-generated art is that it is ‘dehumanised’ because a machine performs the labour. This argument relies on the romantic myth of the ‘lone genius’ labouring in solitude, an image that has long permeated art history but rarely reflects the reality of major historical commissions. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, artistic production was organised through <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">guilds and the atelier (workshop) system</a>.</p><p>In the studios of masters like Raphael and Peter Paul Rubens, the master functioned more as a creative director than a solo laborer. Raphael presided over a ‘hive of activity’ in Rome with more than fifty assistants. He would provide the ‘cartoons’ (preparatory drawings), while the actual brushstrokes were often executed by pupils who specialized in specific tasks: one might paint the drapery, another the clouds, and a third the architectural backgrounds. <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">The master would reserve for himself only the most critical elements</a> (faces and hands) before signing the final work.</p><figure><img alt=""A engraving print showing a bustling Antwerp atelier: at centre the master paints Saint George and the Dragon, while an assistant mixes oil pigments, a youth copies a sculpture, and other hands grind colours and paint portraits."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eGZNn9jArnSh27NBXLG4sA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Invention of Oil Painting, by Philip Galle, c. 1580–1605.

Source: Royal Museums of Greenwich, London</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI functions as a digital extension of this atelier system. The prompter acts as the ‘master,’ handling conceptualisation and curation, while the algorithm acts as the Apprentice or Journeyman, taking on the labour of pigment grinding (data preparation), underpainting, and the execution of complex backgrounds or environmental details. Even the specialists of the Renaissance, who focused solely on flesh or water, find a modern equivalent in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models trained to reproduce specific styles or objects with high fidelity.</p><p>This system reveals that the ‘master’s signature’ represented a brand and a vision, not necessarily the manual labour of the signer. A painting signed ‘by Raphael’ fetched more than one painted by an unknown journeyman, even if the journeyman performed 90% of the manual labour. Generative AI is the latest iteration of this ‘operational elevation,’ allowing the artist to focus on strategy, decision-making, and leadership instead of routine monitoring or manual repetition.</p><p>Yet, here lies a profound contemporary downside: the <a href=""https://people-work.io/blog/junior-hiring-crisis/"">Junior Hiring Crisis</a>. In the traditional atelier, the apprentice performed ‘grunt work’ (grinding pigments, stretching canvases) in exchange for training and a pathway to mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the change in senior and junior employment rates after the launch of ChatGPT.

Recent data indicates a sharp contraction in early-career roles; UK tech companies, for instance,<a href=""https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/uk_tech_grad_jobs/"">cut graduate roles by 46%</a> in 2023–2024. This broken pipeline suggests that, while AI may offer ‘operational elevation’ for senior professionals, it threatens to leave the next generation without the foundational experiences required to develop professional judgment.</p><h3>The Luddite misunderstanding: wages, not aesthetics</h3><p>The term ‘<a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/luddite"">Luddite</a>’ is frequently weaponised in modern discourse to dismiss critics of AI as technophobic. However, the actual history of the Luddite movement provides a more nuanced lens. The original Luddites were skilled textile workers in the early 19th century who objected to the use of machinery to circumvent standard labour practices and undermine the livelihoods of skilled craftsmen.</p><p>This historical legacy is reflected today in three distinct ways. The original Luddites of 1811 fought against mechanization as a tool to lower wages and hire unskilled labour, just as modern professional artists fear market saturation by AI-assisted ‘amateurs’. The Neo-Luddite movement of the 20th century expanded this into a philosophy of distrust toward technology as a system of social control, paralleling modern critiques of AI as an ‘alienating’ force that separates art from nature. Finally, the Romantic Movement’s reaction against industrialisation, which celebrated the ‘lone genius’ and ‘sublime nature’, underpins the current ‘soul in art’ argument that AI lacks genuine human feeling.</p><p>The Luddites were reacting to a shift from a domestic system, where craftspeople were paid usual price, to a factory system that prioritised efficiency. They were not against technology per se (many were skilled operators); they were against its inappropriate application to lower wages and de-skill the workforce. When applied to the arts, this argument is often misunderstood as a claim that AI makes ‘bad art.’ In reality, the fear is socio-economic: that AI will make cheap art that devalues human labour. Just as the power loom did not destroy the concept of clothing, AI is shifting art from a manual-labor economy to a conceptual-curation economy.</p><h3>The intellectual divorce: conceptual art and the ‘idea as machine’</h3><p>The move toward conceptualism in the 20th century fundamentally challenged the requirement for an artist to possess manual technical skills. Marcel Duchamp’s invention of the ‘<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp"">readymade</a>’ in the 1910s declared that the creative act resided in the choice of the object, not its manufacture. By taking mass-produced objects like a urinal (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)""><em>Fountain</em></a>) or a snow shovel (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Advance_of_the_Broken_Arm""><em>In Advance of the Broken Arm</em></a>) and placing them in a gallery, Duchamp argued that art should <a href=""https://www.thecollector.com/marcel-duchamp-readymades/"">‘serve the mind’ rather than the ‘retinal’ sense</a>. This perspective validates curation as the primary creative act in generative art.</p><figure><img alt=""The sculpture ‘Fountain’ by Marcel Duchamp – a found urinal which the artist signed R. Mutt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*L2l9k4a1MTGbQRe8lhTQ2Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Marcel Duchamp Fountain, 1917, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz</figcaption></figure><p>Sol LeWitt famously extended this in 1967, stating: “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art”. For LeWitt, <a href=""https://infiniteimages.toledomuseum.org/essay/coded-nature"">the execution is a “perfunctory affair”</a>. He often provided loose instructions for <a href=""https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/"">Wall Drawings</a> that were then executed by assistants. Because the planning and decisions are made beforehand, the artist is free even to surprise himself. This is a verbatim description of generative art, where the prompt acts as the machine that executes the work.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of ‘Wall Drawing 11’ by Sol LeWitt – it features lines applied to a wall which is divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/487/1*1EaGFycbyNzUsOuAJ5gtug.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Wall Drawing 11</em> by Sol LeWitt — ”A wall divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed.”</figcaption></figure><p>Yoko Ono’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit_(book)""><em>Grapefruit</em></a> (1964) furthered this by offering ‘instruction pieces’ that could be realised by anyone in their imagination or as an action. She viewed her work as a “recipe for creating reality,” where the artist relinquishes control to the audience. In this framework, the artist is the architect of a possibility space, a role shared by Joseph Kosuth, whose “<a href=""https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137438"">idea as idea</a>” prioritized the conceptual premise over the physical manifestation.</p><p>The modern AI user who explores the ‘latent space’ of a model is the modern heir to this tradition. However, in outsourcing much of our thinking to machines we risk ‘cognitive atrophy.’ While we may increase efficiency, we may lose the creative trial-and-error, the messy process that is essential to creative growth and identity.</p><h3>The evolutionary remix: jazz, sampling, and the laws of culture</h3><p>A central ethical argument against GenAI is that it ultimately steals from human artists. The training of AI models requires large-scale ingestion of copyrighted material, often without consent or compensation. Critics describe the process as ‘strip-mining’ human expression. From an ethical standpoint, many creators feel that using their life’s work to build a product that might eventually replace them is a fundamental violation of creative rights.</p><p>This assumes that human creativity is <em>ex nihilo</em> (springing from nothingness) rather than being a recursive process of transformation. Kirby Ferguson’s <a href=""https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc?si=OFgCxW97n2QFFKb0""><em>Everything is a Remix</em></a> philosophy argues that all creative work is built on three pillars: Copy, Transform, and Combine.</p><p>This recursive process is visible across various media. In jazz, ‘standards’ serve as a foundational language for musicians to improvise upon, turning popular melodies into exploratory pieces of free jazz. Hip-hop sampling utilizes the ‘copy, transform, combine’ method using turntables and samplers to recontextualize existing beats into new lyrical meanings. Folk music relies on the passing down and <a href=""https://heretakis.medium.com/everything-is-a-remix-the-myth-of-originality-and-the-truth-about-creativity-inspired-by-kirby-94259048fb17"">altering of melodies over generations to evolve cultural narratives</a>.</p><p>The legal landscape in 2025 remains a ‘law unmade.’ While some judges have ruled that AI training is highly transformative and qualifies as fair use, others have rejected this defense when training data is sourced from shadow libraries of pirated books such as LibGen. Futurist Jaron Lanier has proposed ‘<a href=""https://theaiinsider.tech/2025/02/26/vr-pioneer-jaron-lanier-on-data-dignity-and-elevating-human-innovation/"">Data Dignity</a>’ as a solution, a system that moves away from the black-box model to one where the most unique contributors to a model’s output are acknowledged and compensated via data trusts or ‘Mediators of Individual Data’ (MIDs).</p><p>Generative AI represents the digital culmination of a generations-long chain of inheritance. It functions by predicting outcomes based on latent space weights, effectively synthesising billions of artistic ‘quotations’ into a new expression. Roland Barthes’ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author""><em>Death of the Author</em></a> argued that a text is a “tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture”. AI models are the most sophisticated intertextual looms ever created; they do not ‘steal’ in the sense of removing an object, but rather presuppose and embed prior expressions into new contexts. The liberation of ‘remix thinking’ frees us from the impossible burden of originality and gives us permission to start where others left off. The question of the legal permission to train and make use of all prior links in the chain of inheritance still remains to be solved for now.</p><h3>The false equivalence: craft vs. art and the amateur’s dilemma</h3><p>A common critique of AI is that it creates a false equivalence between the professional and the amateur. This debate mirrors the historical reaction to photography. Critics in the 19th century argued that photography was a “<a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">thoughtless mechanism for replication</a>” that lacked the “refined feeling” of a human genius. However, the history of art shows that manual craft does not always equal high art.</p><p>This spectrum of production is well-documented. Bob Ross used an instructional, ‘wet-on-wet’ manual technique to promote a democratic form of craft that, while widely popular, was often excluded from the high art canon. Conversely, Thomas Kinkade utilised an assembly-line factory model where original paintings were digitally transformed into lithographs and ‘enhanced’ by technicians. Kinkade was commercially professional but critically labeled as kitsch.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the tv artist Bob Ross holing a paint palette and brush in front of one of his canvases"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/278/1*yV7-8STcOx4tzhDHj45nrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Bob Ross at his easel</figcaption></figure><p>Prompt engineering via natural language represents a similar shift. While the tool allows high variance, professional output requires the same iterative curation and historical dialogue used by traditional masters who spent years training to guard their status. The tool does not confer professional status; the consistency and depth of the vision do. AI makes everyone an image generator, but becoming an artist still requires the intellectual labor of curation and thematic depth. GenAI has the ability to uplevel creatives at every level of expertise. Yes, it can enable the novice or amateur but when harnessed by the experienced professional it has the potential to lead us to new and exciting horizons.</p><h3>The unsynthesised truth: synthesisers and the “no bullshit” backlash</h3><p>The musical world offers a direct historical parallel to the visual AI controversy through the introduction of the synthesiser. In the early 1970s, <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/synthesizers-impact-heavy-metal/"">the synthesiser was viewed with intense suspicion by the rock establishment</a>. The band Queen famously included “No Synthesisers” declarations on their album liner notes up until 1980. This was not a rejection of electronic sound itself, but a ‘commitment to the unsynthesized’ intended to prove their ‘technical prowess’ as musicians who could create complex sounds using only guitars and overdubbed vocals.</p><p>Critics of that era, such as those at <em>Melody Maker </em>magazine, often mistook Brian May’s innovative guitar harmonizing for synthesizers. The band used the ‘no synths’ policy as a marketing hook to separate themselves from disco groups and to assert a hierarchy of ‘real’ music over electronic devices.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the liner notes to Queen’s ‘A Night at the Opera’ album. It features a list of performers on the album as well as the disclaimer ‘No Synthesisers!’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zn3SAEYmk0GhOpn5Jua2Ig.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Liner notes from Queen’s <em>A Night at the Opera</em> album</figcaption></figure><p>However, by the mid-1980s, the ulterior motives of even the staunchest holdouts were revealed. Iron Maiden, who had proclaimed “No synthesisers” on their 1983 album <em>Piece of Mind</em>, heavily embraced guitar synthesisers just three years later on <em>Somewhere in Time</em>. They found that the technology allowed them to explore “conceptual themes such as robotics and artificial intelligence” in a way that traditional instruments could not</p><p>The transition from “no synths” to “synths as standard” highlights the recurring pattern: technology is initially rejected as a ‘detriment to technical prowess,’ then used as a ‘special effect,’ and finally integrated as a ‘more complex musical layer’. Today’s AI tools are in the ‘special effect’ stage, facing the same backlash that once targeted the Moog and the Fairlight CMI.</p><h3>Toward a new synthesis of creative agency</h3><p>The systematically refutable arguments against generative AI in the arts are almost entirely rooted in a misunderstanding of both art history and cognitive bias. When we peel back the layers of Romantic mythology, we find that the history of art is a history of technological integration. Perhaps Vermeer’s genius was his mastery of the camera obscura; Raphael’s genius: his management of a human algorithm; Duchamp’s genius: the conceptual choice that liberated art from the hand.</p><p>Generative AI does not represent a break from this tradition, but its most democratic evolution. By acting as a digital atelier, a conceptual machine, and an intertextual loom, AI allows for an ‘operational elevation’ where humans can focus more on the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of creation, rather than the ‘how’. Physical craft will not disappear, it may even be elevated in value within this new creative context.</p><p>The future of art is, as it has always been, intelligent and powered by people. The ‘soul’ of the work resides in the intent of the creator, the curation of the expert, and the historical dialogue that no machine can engage in without a human partner. AI is not the end of art; it is the beginning of the most complex atelier in human history, one that requires us to be more human, not less.</p><h3>Further reading from UX Collective</h3><ul><li><a

At that exact moment, Singapore Polytechnic was hosting its annual <a href=""https://www.sp.edu.sg/courses/schools/sma/happenings/detail/industry-events/dt-ux-summit-2023"">Design Thinking and User Experience (DT | UX) Summit</a>. Upon hearing he would be in town, the organiser moved quickly to invite him, and soon after, Don was on stage delivering an impromptu keynote about his latest book, <a href=""https://beta.thestorygraph.com/books/09c28083-fa28-4b89-b718-02703100879d""><em>Design for a Better World</em></a>.</p><p>What began as a chance encounter has since grown into a historic partnership. That one-off meeting paved the way for the <a href=""https://dnda25.sp.edu.sg/"">2025 Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Summit</a>, marking the first time this prestigious event has been held outside of the United States and recognising Asia’s expanding influence in design for societal impact.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman"">Don Norman</a> is a titan of the industry.

Eschewing a quiet retirement, he endured gruelling long-haul flights to engage with the community firsthand. While he remains quick to critique poor design, he is equally driven by an insatiable curiosity about people. Throughout the DNDA conference, he bypassed the typical “celebrity” routine, choosing instead to listen to the stories of everyone he met.</p><p>Over three intensive days, Don connected with countless changemakers, insisting that their contributions be recognised through the DNDA platform. Ultimately, it was Don’s opening and closing remarks that defined the event’s core mission: the evolution from Human-Centred Design (HCD) to Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+).</p><p>Here are the key insights shared by the emeritus professor on the future of our craft.</p><h3>1. The Artificial Nature of Our World</h3><p>We might point to AI as the obvious answer, but the reality goes beyond the digital realm. A look around the places we live gives clues about how things are placed by people: the names of streets, the flattened terrain for buildings, or the borders of nations. So long as something is an invention of an idea, it was designed not by designers alone but by policymakers, historians, and citizens. This means this “amazing mess” of artificial constructs can be questioned, undesigned, and redesigned to make a better world.</p><figure><img alt=""Design is an invention of ideas, from street names to national borders, meaning our “artificial” mess can be questioned and redesigned.

Redefining Awards and Conferences</h3><p>This concept brought a new awareness for Don about the constructs that matter to him. He questioned the notion of awarding only well-known companies and instead rewarded early-career pioneers who need traction. He questioned the format of conferences, favouring an “unconference” approach where participants became speakers. “Chaotic but stimulatingly authentic” sums up the experience of being able to collectively own a narrative.</p><figure><img alt=""True impact comes from shifting focus from big corporations to early-career pioneers and replacing rigid expert panels with “unconference” dialogue.

Scaling Through Nature’s Metaphors</h3><p>When Don’s team realised they needed to scale HCD+ larger, they looked to nature for metaphors. <strong>Dandelions</strong> represent the ability to spread like weeds, creating an exponential effect. An <strong>Umbrella</strong> represents bringing different bodies together.</p><p>However, Don updated his metaphor after hearing from Dr Wong Sweet Fun regarding <strong>corals</strong>. Unlike the “Great White Shark” model (which eats everything else) or the “School of Fish” (which represents standardisation), the <strong>Coral Reef</strong> model allows diverse organisms to reach an equilibrium of coexistence. Proliferation is possible when you provide a frame with the right conditions.</p><figure><img alt=""Moving from the “Great White Shark” of mass participation to the “Coral Reef” model allows for an ecosystem where diverse ideas coexist and flourish.

From Problem Solver to Conductor</h3><p>Could artificiality also apply to the current role of the designer? While there is a long-standing perception that design is primarily about making things attractive, Don Norman challenged us to be <strong>problem finders</strong>. Rather than solving for symptoms, we must identify root causes. This is a shift that often forces designers out of their comfort zones and beyond the traditional boundaries of the craft.</p><p>If the original intent of design is to facilitate change, then we must do more than just draft a plan; we must see its implementation through. Currently, an understanding of engineering, business, and politics is missing from many design curricula. A relentless focus on aesthetics in education not only leaves designers ill-equipped for the complexities of the modern workplace but also prevents them from ascending to senior leadership roles in the global arena.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-or-px-why-naming-matters-5cf890f64a9a"">UX or PX? Why naming matters</a></p><p>Admittedly, moving into these spaces may lead to a situation where designers do not know everything. According to Don, that is actually an advantage. Being a “beginner” does not hamper creativity; instead, it provides the intellectual room for entirely new approaches. Don recognises this as the true power of design, which is the ability to enter new fields and synthesise fresh understandings. Ultimately, the modern designer must act as a <strong>conductor</strong>, someone who can synchronise and bridge conversations across various disciplines with enough knowledge to guide meaningful outcomes.</p><h3>5. AI, Emotion, and the Power of Story</h3><p>Don speaks passionately about the possibilities of using AI as a powerful and “thinking” digital library. He recognised that it is still in a developmental stage, likely requiring another 15 to 20 years to fully mature. However, he drew a sharp distinction between <strong>cognition</strong>, which is the ability to process information, and <strong>emotion</strong>, which is the feeling of the world. AI possesses cognition but lacks emotion. While it can provide comparisons or data, it requires a human to use emotion to finalise decisions.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-be-the-designer-in-the-ai-loop-e14a5fb8c375"">How to be the designer in the AI Loop</a></p><p>This is why stories remain the most effective way to connect people. Don shared that in the boardroom, a personal anecdote is often the finishing move that makes data relatable and leads to a concrete decision. AI can be a fantastic collaborator by removing obsolete skills from design education, allowing designers to focus on creativity and people. By using AI to learn the languages of business or finance, designers can ensure their work is actually implemented.</p><h3>6. The Shift to Humanity-Centered Design (HCD+)</h3><p>Don circles back to the true power of design. The problem with Human-Centred Design (HCD) is not that it was inherently wrong, but that it often misses the broader picture of humanity and the systemic issues facing our world. We must consider how the world is impacted by the mining of materials, the pollution from our energy sources, and the erosion of cultures through addictive digital technologies. These concerns led Don to champion Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+).</p><p>Design often possesses a “quiet” quality where designers finish their work and hand it off. This creates a design bubble that isolates practitioners from other critical disciplines. Don’t let “loving design” prevent you from engaging with the broader organisation. Don offers a straightforward solution: rather than designing <em>for</em> people, designers should design <em>with</em> all. By joining the conversation among diverse communities and corals, designers can place their emphasis on the <strong>quality of life </strong>rather than just profit and efficiency.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-we-need-to-have-a-change-of-heart-with-ux-metrics-1c229e830914"">Why we need to have a change of HEART with UX metrics</a></p><h3>A Personal Note of Thanks</h3><p>Thank you, Don Norman, for coming to Singapore. Your work has been inspiring since I first learnt about affordances from your books 15 years ago. Back then, “user experience” still felt undefined, yet it shaped who I am today as a design manager.</p><p>During the conference, you reminded us that it is not enough for organisations to learn to speak “design”; we must also learn to speak theirs. You challenged us to influence policy, business, and communities. Beyond the collaterals, it was the conversations and your curiosity that mattered most.</p><p>You’ve shown us what it means to turn ideas into action for a better world. My deepest respect to you, Don, and to everyone who made the Don Norman Design Award Summit possible!</p><figure><img alt=""A short conversation with Don Norman and Srini Srinivasan during the Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Conference (image source: Yeo)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BdZnBjWvNxT__LBk2y0i2g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A short conversation with Don Norman and Srini Srinivasan during the Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Conference (image source: Yeo)</figcaption></figure><h3>References</h3><p>Norman, D.

<h4>Opinion</h4><h4><strong>We are confusing motion with progress. In physics, this mistake has a name: speed without direction. In civilisation, it has a cost.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Infographic comparing speed and velocity. Speed is shown as a car moving in a circle, representing motion without direction. Velocity is shown as a car moving in a straight line with an arrow, representing motion with direction. Text explains that speed measures how fast an object moves, while velocity measures how fast and in which direction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TURS6wqrOBJimfXmxy_Hyw.png"" /><figcaption>Speed vs Velocity (generated with ChatGPT 5.2)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a truth from physics that should concern every executive racing toward AI dominance: <strong>speed tells you how fast you’re moving. Velocity tells you how fast you’re moving — and in which direction.</strong></p><p>A car travelling at 100 mph in circles has tremendous speed but zero velocity. It goes nowhere. It only burns fuel, overheats the engine, and eventually becomes a hazard to everything nearby.</p><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey"">Stephen Covey</a> put it more bluntly: “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction.”</p><p>Sam Altman reportedly <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/12/02/altman-code-red-memo-urges-chatgpt-improvements-amid-growing-threat-from-google-reports-say/"">issued</a> an internal “code red” at OpenAI in December 2025 — an emergency directive to focus resources on improving ChatGPT whilst delaying initiatives like advertising or Pulse triggered by Google’s launch of <a href=""https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#gemini-3"">Gemini 3</a>. The flagship product that triggered the current AI frenzy, deployed to hundreds of millions of users, needed an internal alarm bell. Not because it had fundamentally failed. But because in the race to stay ahead, the product itself required urgent consolidation before it could bear the weight of continued competition.</p><p>This isn’t an isolated corporate moment. It’s the logical endpoint of what researchers <a href=""https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njtip/vol18/iss2/1/"">Houser and Raymond</a> identified in their 2021 analysis: an AI race that “lacks definition, a goal, or even an aspirational dream” — yet we keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line.</p><h3><em>Motion</em> is not progress</h3><p>We measure “leadership” in the AI race through release dates, funding rounds, model sizes, benchmark wins. These are metrics of <strong><em>motion</em></strong>, not <strong><em>progress</em></strong>. They tell us who is accelerating — not who is steering.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll"">Lewis Carroll</a> understood the danger: “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.”</p><p>And when steering disappears, two failures cascade: products become the strategy — you ship because you can, not because you should. <br />And users become raw material — queries as data, confusion as engagement, vulnerability as conversion.</p><p>We’ve seen this pattern before. Facebook’s “move fast and break things” contributed to outcomes such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"">Cambridge Analytica</a>, the amplification of ethnic violence in <a href=""https://systemicjustice.org/article/facebook-and-genocide-how-facebook-contributed-to-genocide-in-myanmar-and-why-it-will-not-be-held-accountable/"">Myanmar</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/the-myth-of-metas-free-speech-places-democracy-at-risk/"">algorithmic radicalisation</a>. The company <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebooks-new-motto-2014-5"">changed</a> its motto — but only after harming democracies. That’s speed without velocity: motion that creates value for shareholders whilst externalising catastrophic harm onto societies.</p><p>The advertising rumours around OpenAI matter not as scandal, but as signal. When a product loses strategic clarity, monetisation stops being a consequence of direction and becomes a substitute for it. This is profitable aimlessness.</p><h3>The speed trap</h3><p>The real divide between the United States and Europe is no longer “regulation versus innovation.” It is <strong>speed versus velocity</strong>.</p><p>America has chosen speed. Deploy faster, scale bigger, monetise quicker. Ask forgiveness later — if anyone is still empowered to ask. This is innovation as extraction: build, break, capture, repeat. Humans become datasets. Long-term damage becomes acceptable externality. Consent becomes a legal checkbox rather than an ethical foundation.</p><p>Europe has chosen velocity. Not mere movement, but movement <em>towards something</em>: a society where rights don’t evaporate when a model improves, where consent is not a checkbox, where accountability has a name, a process, and an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is choosing direction.</p><p>Critics argue — rightly so — that European regulation has slowed deployment. That whilst Brussels debated AI Act provisions, Silicon Valley shipped products to hundreds of millions of users. That market leadership matters, and hesitation costs.</p><p>True. But incomplete.</p><p>Because the question isn’t “who shipped first?” It’s “who shipped something that can scale without collapsing and who can articulate why it needed to exist at all?” <br />Speed means nothing if you cannot answer what problem you’re solving.</p><p>The OpenAI code red memo is an existence proof: shipping fast doesn’t guarantee shipping well. And when trust collapses, market leadership becomes a liability, not an asset.</p><p>The GDPR didn’t slow European innovation — it prevented European companies from building on foundations of exploited data that would later crumble. <br />The AI Act isn’t delaying deployment — it’s preventing deployment of systems that would later require expensive retrofitting or complete abandonment.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is avoiding the expensive mistake of building systems that cannot scale with trust.</p><h3>Guardrails are compasses</h3><p>The European regulatory framework is doing something more sophisticated than restriction. It is building infrastructure.</p><p><a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/"">GDPR</a> doesn’t prohibit data usage — it demands transparency: what you collect, why you collect it, how long you keep it, who you share it with, and what rights people retain. That is not restriction. That is direction.</p><p>The <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/"">AI Act</a> doesn’t ban artificial intelligence — it categorises AI systems by risk level and mandates transparency, human oversight, and accountability proportional to potential harm. High-risk systems affecting employment, education, healthcare, law enforcement must meet minimum standards before deployment. This is infrastructure for trust.</p><p>The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act"">Data Act </a>ensures that data generated by connected devices remains accessible to users and can be shared across services, preventing monopolistic data hoarding. It creates foundations for competitive markets and genuine user agency.</p><p>But the real power of European regulation lies not in what it prohibits, but in what it insists upon:</p><p><strong>1. Accountability means someone can answer when things go wrong.</strong> Not “the algorithm decided.” Not “the model optimised for engagement.” But a named human being who can explain the logic, justify the outcome, and bear responsibility for the consequences.</p><p><strong>2. Transparency means systems can be understood.</strong> Not just by engineers who built them, but by citizens affected by them. If we cannot understand how decisions are made, we cannot contest them. And if we cannot contest them, we have abdicated governance to machines that cannot be held responsible.</p><p><strong>3. Responsibility means consequences attach to choices.</strong> When an AI system fails, when it discriminates, when it causes harm — there is a legal pathway for redress. This is the foundation that allows innovation to scale with trust rather than collapse under its own externalities.</p><p>Consider <a href=""https://e-estonia.com/estonia-and-automated-decision-making-challenges-for-public-administration/"">Estonia’s</a> digital governance <a href=""https://loti.london/blog/estonia-insights/"">framework</a>. Every government algorithm that touches citizen data requires human approval, logging, and audit trails. The result? One of the world’s most digitalised societies — and one of the most trusted. Speed of deployment matched by clarity of accountability.</p><p>Or think about the <a href=""https://iapp.org/news/a/digital-welfare-fraud-detection-and-the-dutch-syri-judgment"">Netherlands</a>’ court ruling against the government’s welfare fraud detection algorithm. The <a href=""https://www.asser.nl/news/interview-curtailing-the-surveillance-state-anticipating-the-syri-case-judgment"">system</a> was fast, efficient, and… discriminatory. The court demanded transparency and accountability. The ruling didn’t stop innovation. It redirected it towards systems citizens could actually trust.</p><p>This is velocity: movement with direction, protected by accountability.</p><h3>The race makes cooperation impossible</h3><p>Here is the danger that few acknowledge: <strong>the race narrative makes global cooperation impossible.</strong></p><p>Not difficult. Not unlikely. Structurally incompatible<em>.</em></p><p>When nations frame AI development as existential competition, every shared standard becomes potential weakness. Every regulatory alignment becomes strategic vulnerability. Every moment of cooperation risks exploitation by adversaries who might be moving faster in the shadows.</p><p>As Houser and Raymond observed: an AI race can keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line. The race narrative fractures the possibility of building AI systems grounded in shared values, mutual accountability, and collective benefit.</p><p>Without cooperation, we do not get faster innovation. We get incompatible systems, fragmented standards, and a technological landscape where human rights are jurisdiction-dependent accidents rather than universal guarantees. We get a world where the same AI system can respect privacy in Brussels, ignore it in San Francisco, and weaponise it in Beijing.</p><p><strong>The future of AI depends on cooperation, infrastructure, and uniform standards</strong> — on shared definitions of harm, shared accountability mechanisms, shared ethical foundations. But velocity requires shared bearings. Speed doesn’t. Speed just requires a competitor.</p><p>This is not speculation. This is happening now. And the window for choosing differently is closing.</p><h3>The architecture of endurance</h3><p>The Renaissance was not built in haste. It was intentional. European cathedrals took generations to complete. Their builders knew they would not see the finished work. Yet they built with precision, with vision, with responsibility to those who would inherit what they created. Ideas were allowed to mature. Beauty was given time to emerge. Architecture was designed for endurance, not obsolescence.</p><p>Contrast this with structures built for speed: temporary, disposable, optimised for immediate utility. They served the moment. Then vanished, leaving nothing worth preserving.</p><p>We face this choice now. Build fast and disposable, or build to last. Optimise for quarterly returns, or generational impact. Compete for market share, or create foundations worth inheriting.</p><p>Europe remembers this lesson. America seems determined to forget it.</p><h3><strong>Choosing direction</strong></h3><p>If you are responsible for AI strategy, governance, or risk management, velocity requires three shifts:</p><p><strong>First, reframe your metrics.</strong> Speed metrics — deployment velocity, time-to-market, model performance — must be balanced by direction metrics: clarity of purpose, user safety outcomes, accountability pathways. If you cannot measure direction, you cannot manage it.</p><p><strong>Second, build </strong><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><strong>accountability</strong></a><strong> chains.</strong> Every AI system needs a named human who can explain, justify, and take responsibility for its decisions. If you cannot identify that person, you cannot deploy the system responsibly. These chains cannot be retrofitted — they must be designed from day one. There’s an old IBM memo from 1979 worth remembering: “<em>A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision</em>.”</p><p><strong>Third, treat compliance as architecture.</strong> European regulations aren’t restrictions to work around — they’re scaffolding for building systems that can scale globally. If your system can meet GDPR and AI Act requirements, it can operate anywhere. If it cannot, you’re building for a fragmenting market.</p><p>The organisations that understand this now will have structural advantages when markets consolidate around trustworthy systems.</p><h3>Beyond the finish line</h3><p>The choice isn’t “Europe versus America.” That’s the race story trying to recruit you.</p><p>The choice is speed without accountability, or velocity with direction.</p><p>Europe’s bet: innovation scales only when trust scales with it. Real progress requires more than computational power — it demands wisdom.</p><p><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmddnge9yro"">America’s</a> bet: trust can be retrofitted later. Speed creates its own legitimacy. Winning justifies the means.</p><p>The code red memo is what it looks like when “later” arrives.</p><p>Every algorithm, every neural network carries within it the echoes of human decision-making. Our challenge is not to fear these technologies, but to consciously shape their ethical foundations. Our deepest innovations emerge not from machines, but from the human capacity to reimagine possibility.</p><p>The question before us is whether we’ll exercise that capacity — or surrender it to the illusion that speed equals progress.</p><p><strong><em>Author’s Note:</em></strong><em> The thinking, research, and arguments in this article are entirely human.

<h3>AI will kill most startups — and that’s a good thing</h3><h4>When anyone can build the product, only authority differentiates the outcome.</h4><figure><img alt=""Close-up of a computer keyboard with “COPY” and “PASTE” written on large keys, symbolizing digital duplication. The tone is straightforward and technical."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ED9TlTScNeTb0W2Rdh1Sg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><p>Picture an ordinary person working in tech — a designer, developer, or product manager — who stumbles onto a genuinely good idea. Not a moonshot. Not a revolution. Just something that solves a real problem.</p><p>In the past, bringing that idea to life required capital, a team, and time. Today, it requires a laptop and a collection of AI tools. With AI filling the gaps, a working prototype can be <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">vibe coded</a> in weeks, if not hours. The product is tested, refined, and launched, and for a brief moment it appears successful.</p><p>Then reality intervenes.</p><p>Within months, near-identical products emerge, <a href=""https://medium.com/@skooloflife/99-of-ai-startups-will-be-dead-by-2026-heres-why-bfc974edd968"">copied and shipped at machine speed</a>. What began as a solo effort quickly becomes a crowded category, and any early differentiation disappears. Soon after, a large technology company notices the pattern. Without meaningful distribution or a loyal audience to defend it, <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/perplexity-ceo-big-tech-will-copy-ai-startups/"">the idea is absorbed into an existing platform as a feature</a>. A few months later, the startup is effectively gone.</p><p><a href=""https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-startups-vibe-coding"">This outcome is no longer unusual. It is becoming the norm.</a></p><p>What this reveals is uncomfortable but important. AI does not kill startups. It exposes ideas that never earned credibility. If a product can be imagined, built, and shipped by almost anyone, it can also be copied by almost anyone. That is not a failure of innovation so much as a stress test — one that reveals how thin many ideas were to begin with.</p><p>I saw this firsthand early in my career.</p><p>My first startup experience was at a publishing company building a new journal and news platform for <a href=""https://jadpro.com/"">advanced practitioners in oncology</a>. On paper, it was an extremely narrow niche. But the niche alone was not what made the product work. Plenty of people could have identified the same market and built a similar platform.</p><p>During that time, I watched multiple medical-content startups with solid ideas fail, even though the problems they were trying to solve were real and obvious.</p><p>We had a well-established advanced practitioner in oncology serving as editor-in-chief — someone deeply respected in the field, with years of lived experience and professional trust behind their name. That changed everything. It shaped how the content was framed, how the platform was perceived, and whether practitioners were willing to engage with it at all.</p><p>What mattered was credibility.</p><p>The product succeeded not simply because it existed, but because people trusted who it came from. That distinction is where many modern startups will fail. AI makes it easy to build products—it does nothing to establish why anyone should trust them.</p><p>What will survive in this new AI environment are <a href=""https://productify.substack.com/p/the-complete-guide-to-product-moats"">products with real moats</a>. And a moat is not clever functionality, a polished interface, or speed to market. It is whatever does not collapse under replication — distribution, trust, proprietary data, embedded workflows, regulatory friction. AI has a way of <a href=""https://strategeos.com/blog/f/defensive-moats-in-the-age-of-llms-when-ai-commoditizes-your-ip?blogcategory=Business+Consulting"">stripping away the illusion</a> and revealing which products actually possess these advantages.</p><p>This dynamic feels brutal, but it is ultimately corrective. AI eliminates products that existed largely because building used to be hard. In doing so, it creates space for work rooted in context, relationships, and accumulated judgment. The bar has not necessarily been raised — it has been clarified.</p><p>Some of the most durable moats are not technical at all. They are human. Trust earned over time. Expertise in a narrow, underexplored domain. Lived experience that shapes how a problem is understood. Perspective refined through accountability. Features can be copied. Credibility cannot.</p><p>AI excels at reproducing outputs. It struggles to reproduce identity, reputation, and judgment. Products that are extensions of who someone is, rather than just what they have built, are far harder to erase.</p><p>So what does a viable strategy actually look like?</p><p>It is not building faster, shipping more features, or out-executing competitors. AI has already neutralized those advantages. Competing on speed or efficiency is no longer a strategy when <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/02/07/as-ai-rapidly-becomes-a-commodity-time-to-consider-the-next-step/"">execution itself has been commoditized</a>.</p><p>The real shift happens upstream. Founders must stop asking what they can build and start asking what they are uniquely positioned to justify. That justification does not come from novelty. It comes from credibility accumulated long before the product exists. From being embedded in a domain deeply enough that the solution reflects judgment, not just capability.</p><p>In practice, this means fewer generic products and more opinionated ones. Products that make tradeoffs. Products shaped by experience rather than tooling. AI can help build them, but it cannot supply the authority behind them.</p><p>It also means that trust, reputation, and distribution are no longer problems to solve after launch. They are part of the product itself. If an idea can be detached from its creator and absorbed by a platform without resistance, it was never defensible to begin with.</p><p>The startups that survive this era of AI will not look like traditional startups. They will resemble institutions, disciplines, or professions — things with continuity, authority, and accountability. Their advantage will not be speed. It will be standing.</p><p>AI is not ending startups. It is forcing them to justify their existence. That correction, however uncomfortable, is overdue.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=73dbd8198825"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-will-kill-most-startups-and-thats-a-good-thing-73dbd8198825"">AI will kill most startups — and that’s a good thing</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Leveraging AI-driven exploration to build stronger, clearer product specifications</h4><figure><img alt=""The image depicts a collaborative workshop where a woman gestures toward an AI “Spec Brief Coach” on a laptop while a colleague reviews a “Provocative” prototype variation on a tablet. The workspace is scattered with sticky notes for “Vibe Coding” and “CUJs,” alongside a background note reflecting the goal that every digital workshop board should become a persistent AI Gem."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WASSXH85BShj6FpOXhx_3Q.png"" /><figcaption>Generated by Nano Banana Pro based on the article.</figcaption></figure><p>It can be tempting to think our job as Product Managers is to provide the team with absolute certainty. We want the “perfect” plan before we share it. But if you’ve ever felt like a blank page was staring back at you, you know that absolute clarity is often the enemy of a great idea.</p><p>I recently ran a workshop called <strong>“Writing Clear Requirements for Humans and AI”</strong> that explored a different path: using “Vibe Coding” (rapid prototyping) not to build a final product, but to explore the messy, conceptual space where the best ideas live.</p><p>Here is how you can use three specific Gemini Gems to move from a vague “vibe” to a battle-tested requirement.</p><h3>1. Embrace the “Just Enough Confusion”</h3><p>In a recent post, I wrote about how <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/creativity-requires-just-enough-confusion-eecb6c720130"">creativity requires just enough confusion</a> to actually work. We need to be a little surprised to find something new.</p><p>Vibe coding for PMs is exactly that. It isn’t about becoming an engineer; it’s about making your thinking much stronger earlier in the process. It’s about “rubber ducking” your decisions, externalizing your thinking so you can look at it in a more objective way, with a machine before you bring it to your team.</p><p>Instead of staring at a template, start with the <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1y8nq4XH7FCB3dj-nY4wp0vZDD4TZd5_a?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Brief Coach</strong></a>. This Gem acts like a consultant, interviewing you to extract the “what” and “why” of your project.</p><ul><li><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> It guides you through sections like Goals, Critical User Journeys (CUJs), and “Moments That Matter” — those key points of high emotion where the experience is won or lost.</li><li><strong>Fill the Gaps:</strong> If you’re stuck, it can even suggest content to help spark your thinking.</li><li><strong>The Artifact:</strong> You end up with a structured markdown spec that serves as the “context” for everything else you do.</li></ul><h3>2. The Power of the “Bad” Idea</h3><p>We usually try to hide our bad ideas. But in the exploration phase, a “bad” idea is a gift because it helps you define what is actually good.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1MwUzwm6OMCFNhd9SFdulMImqsV4IwcvU?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Variation Tool</strong></a> takes your initial spec and generates four different ways to realize it to open the aperture of what you are considering.</p><ul><li><strong>Variation Axes:</strong> It tests different assumptions by varying factors like automation levels or interaction paradigms.</li><li><strong>The Provocative Spec:</strong> One of these is intentionally a “provocative” or “bad” version designed to highlight anti-patterns and what <em>not</em> to do.</li><li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> By quickly prototyping these in tools like Google AI Studio, you can see where a concept falls apart. This helps broaden the aperture of exploration rather than just meandering through a single conversation.</li></ul><h3>3. Stress-Testing with a “Rude Engineer”</h3><p>You don’t want the first person to find a flaw in your logic to be your VP during a review. You want to find it yourself, in the privacy of your own AI chat.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1xWCiskHjI_wyXtHdIRIGvKq4FlMwYUqp?usp=sharing""><strong>Viewpoint Simulator</strong></a> pressure-tests your spec from multiple, highly biased perspectives.</p><ul><li><strong>The Panel:</strong> It simulates voices like a Product Designer, a Privacy Expert, and even a “Rude Senior Engineer”.</li><li><strong>The Benefit:</strong> The “Rude Engineer” is blunt and skeptical about ambiguity or over-engineering. Because it’s a machine, the feedback isn’t personal. It’s just a tool to help you find your own blind spots.</li></ul><h3>The Future: From Static Boards to “Living” Gems</h3><p>One of the most exciting shifts I’ve been thinking about is the change in how we workshop. We’ve all seen Miro boards full of sticky notes that never get looked at again.</p><p>I believe every Miro should be a Gem. The future of workshopping is a system that collects and keeps distributed context up to date. This allows us to distribute context not only about how to do the workshop later but notes from the workshop itself can become distributed context to be used when needed. Almost like a workbench to create future docs based on everything discussed so far.</p><p>Instead of a static summary, we need a system that creates constantly updated drafts or “views” for different stakeholders, whether that’s for engineering, design, or legal review. This system of drafts is always in flux as the context is updated, we learn new things, and we make hard decisions.</p><h3>Conclusion: Taking it Back to the Team</h3><p>Prototypes and specs are both necessary conversation pieces. The prototype gives the “vibe,” but the spec captures the complexity and nuance that a prototype alone cannot.</p><p>When you take these artifacts back to your team, here are the next steps to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Set Clear Expectations:</strong> Make it crystal clear that these prototypes are tests to aid in decisions, not the final product to be built.</li><li><strong>Use Tools Live:</strong> Try using these Gems live in meetings. Hearing how an engineer or designer interprets the AI’s feedback can spark valuable discussions.</li><li><strong>Don’t Replace, Collaborate:</strong> These tools aren’t meant to replace designers or engineers; they are meant to spark discussion. Use them to say, “Here is what I care about; here is some stuff to look at if it’s helpful”.</li><li><strong>Keep a Decision Log:</strong> Document what you decided <em>not</em> to do. This path of exploration helps others understand exactly how you arrived at your final direction.</li><li><strong>Help Write Agent Specs:</strong> PMs can better integrate into the development process by helping write the specs that AI agents will use to do work.</li></ul><p>Next time you’re starting something new, don’t aim for immediate clarity. Use these Gems to find that “just enough confusion” that leads to a breakthrough.</p><p><em>This article was crafted by the author, with help from Gemini, which drew from the author’s engaging workshop transcript and related materials.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11faeedb5274"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-pms-can-vibe-code-to-build-stronger-requirements-11faeedb5274"">How PMs can vibe code to build stronger requirements</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951984.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>This is a clear picture of the moon taken with a long zoom lens with the milky way in the background</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The supermoon kicks off 2026 on the right foot for us all! Mark your calendars: January 3rd brings the Super Full Wolf Moon in the sign of Cancer. As the first Full Moon of the new year, this is a magnificent time to make a list of what no longer serves us, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-protect-your-peace"">protecting our peace</a> and what we want to attain in 2026. It is essential to focus on what genuinely will propel us forward and fill us up on a spiritual level. 2025 was draining and exhausting in many ways, which is why this lunation is an excellent time for us to embark <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/new-job-hunt-motivational-career-tips"">on a new journey</a> and bring in positivity, rather than dwelling.  </p>



<p>This supermoon is closer to earth than previous ones, allowing us to feel the lunar frequency more intensely. As you may recall, a supermoon happens when the earth is positioned in perigee to the moon. The proximity allows us to experience the Full Moon in an in-depth manner, as it appears to be brighter and more illuminating than other lunations.  </p>



<p>The moon thrives when it’s in the sign Cancer. Since the Full Moon is dignified and urging us to center our hearts on intimate areas, it serves as a reminder to focus on our homes, families, relationships, friendships, and ourselves. We are figuring out who and what we are giving our emotional labor to. Are we willing to get out of our comfort zones and begin a new era? If so, what does that <em>look</em> like for our futures? More importantly, what does that <em>feel</em> like in the present situations?  </p>



<p>Let’s break down the astrology of the supermoon. Affectionate Venus and temperamental <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Capricorn</a> oppose the moon, escalating our moodiness and sentiments. Our patience is going to be tested because Mars has no chill and tends to thrust us toward impulsivity. Venus creates a push-and-pull dynamic with the moon, heightening tension around our insecurities and instincts. We are reacting to what we are acquiring from others. Keep in mind, we get what we give. So, be sure to create an environment that works best for you. The days of putting the needs of others are behind us; we are looking to uplift our auras. The most significant and meaningful relationship is the one we have with ourselves. Therefore, we should give ourselves grace and compassion as we head to a place of safety and security on all levels.  </p>



<p>The karmic Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo axis offer us compelling choices for change. We will be torn between two different (or possibly more) directions, asking us whether we want to repeat the same old situations or move into the new ones. Consider the obligations you’ve carried and the version of yourself you’re releasing. If you aren’t ready or fearful to walk into the unknown, then perhaps you should take cautionary steps. The decision is yours, but a fresh start is possible. Listen to your heart and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">lead with your intuition</a>.  </p>



<p>The sun and Venus are coming together to form a conjunction in Capricorn on January 6th. Known as Venus Star Point, a term coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, this marks a pivotal moment for relationships, self-confidence, and trendsetting. Furthermore, the Venus Star Point reflects the social climate we’re experiencing and sets the vibe for 2026. Take a look at what was happening four years before and before that, then another four years, and so on, to see the themes that will arise at this time. The next day, Venus and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars align in Capricorn</a>, heightening the energy of the Full Moon and Venus Star Point, pushing us to take additional action on the intentions set on January 3rd. </p>



<p>The Quadrantid (located near the Big Dipper) meteor shower coincides with this lunation. The magical, yet short-lived and intense celestial spark occurs every year at the beginning of January. The “fireballs” brightly light up the sky in rapid motion, offering us a beautiful landscape to gaze upon. We’ll literally wish upon a star and enchant our lives with greatness. This is another reminder from the universe to stay present and acknowledge the beauty that surrounds us as well as within our spirit. </p>

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/author/kathleen-newman-bremang""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in Hollywood with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. These are the best onscreen performances of 2025 by Black performers. </em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952582.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The headline of my end-of-year column hasn’t changed since I started compiling the best of the best in film a few years ago. <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/the-best-performances-of-2025"">The Best Performances of 2025</a> are Black, just like they <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11830656/best-black-movie-performances-2024"">were in 2024</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/12/11625372/best-black-movie-performances-2023"">2023</a>, and so on. Black performers consistently raise the bar. They are great because they <em>have</em> to be, and especially in a year when we saw <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">Hollywood roll back DEI commitments</a> and descend into a hellscape where Black actors had to defend themselves from being called “DEI hires” for simply working while Black, these performances cut through the noise and let the work speak for itself. </p>



<p>In 2025, there were so many Black performers who met the challenge of being excellent in the face of an industry that is actively trying to erase them. They took the gravity (or levity) of their material and elevated what was on the page to make it even better. In a year that tested us all — seriously, we barely survived — through their work these artists gave us so much, a reprieve from the hellscape of our social feeds and portrayals of the human experience that revealed a little more about ourselves. Every <a href=""https://variety.com/lists/2025-oscars-predictions/"">awards season</a>, I remind you that while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/09/10683126/emmys-2021-shutout-michaela-coel-divest"">we’ve long since divested</a> from the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/04/10444066/oscar-snubs-racism-2021"">gatekeeping archaic institutions</a> that consistently exclude Black folks from legacy awards, giving recognition where it’s due still matters. </p>



<p>When <em>Sinners</em> was undoubtedly (when it came to box office performance <em>and</em> cultural impact) the movie of the year, and yet still is left off of multiple (white) critics’ year-end lists and awards predictions, it’s more and more evident that we need to uplift our own (let’s not forget that winning an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11306030/naacp-image-awards-2023-winners-moments"">NAACP Image Award</a> should be just as big of an honor as getting an Oscar). We must acknowledge the best Black performances beyond the one or two actors that legacy awards deem worthy of being their annual token, albeit deserved, inclusions. We refuse to settle for crumbs. We get to exist in a timeline where a multitude of Black artistic expressions are celebrated. ‘Tis the season to look back on the best of the best of the year and the best, as always, is Black as hell — whether they get accolades from certain governing bodies or not.</p>



<p>These are the performances I’ve been yelling at you about all year. So, here is my exhaustive, definitive, and still not long enough list of 2025’s best Black film performances. <br /></p>



<h2>Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> </h2>







<p>Five years ago, I wrote a piece called “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9192700/michael-b-jordan-oscar-snubs-just-mercy"">Shouldn’t Michael B. Jordan Have An Oscar Nomination By Now?</a>.” In it, I argued that Jordan was long overdue for a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2020, the MBJ role in contention was his performance as real-life <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/12/9070851/where-is-michael-b-jordan-just-mercy-character-now"">social justice lawyer Bryan Stevenson</a> in <em>Just Mercy</em>. Despite being one of the most famous, talented, bankable heartthrobs in Hollywood, he hasn’t garnered the same accolades his contemporaries of past generations had at his age (see DiCaprio, Damon, Cruise, Pitt). It may be five years late, but Jordan is finally in contention for a Best Actor nod for his portrayal of Smoke and Stack, the prodigal twins of <em>Sinners</em>. I bring up Jordan’s awards chances not because I think a nomination or win would impact the quality of his work, but because after these performances, he deserves every accolade available to him in this industry. As Smoke and Stack, Jordan shows off range many of his detractors will swear he doesn’t have. In each scene, with a tilt of his head or the looseness of his swagger, Jordan carves out each twin’s mannerisms uniquely enough that you are rooting for Smoke while holding your breath waiting for Stack to mess things up, and subtly enough that it’s clear the brothers are inseparable and to an untrained eye, sometimes indecipherable. </p>



<p>It takes a lot of skill to carry an ambitious masterpiece like <em>Sinners</em>. And to put it simply, the film does not work without the precision and thoughtfulness of Jordan’s performances. We’ve been watching him grow as an actor since he was coming of age in<em> All My Children, The Wire, </em>and <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, to young powerhouse showings in <em>Fruitvale Station</em> and <em>Creed</em>. Then, there were the bonafide blockbusters in <em>Creed II</em> and <em>Black Panther. </em>Jordan has proven — repeatedly –  that he’s earned his status as a Movie Star. <em>Sinners</em> is proof he’s done something so many of his peers only dream of: reached his potential and surpassed it. </p>



<h2>Cynthia Erivo, <em>Wicked: For Good </em></h2>







<p>Yes, I am one of the few critics who actually liked <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/11/11944213/wicked-for-good-review-elphaba-glinda-love-story"">Wicked: For Good</a>.</em> I stand by my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/11/11944213/wicked-for-good-review-elphaba-glinda-love-story"">review of the film</a>, which argued that while the movie is the weaker half in the two-part adaptation of the Broadway musical, it did right by its source material and delivered a thrilling, emotional, and endearing conclusion. And about Erivo, who is undoubtedly the best Elphaba of all time, I wrote, “many headlines about Wicked: For Good have <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wicked-for-good-review-give-ariana-grande-the-oscar-now/"">focused on Ariana Grande</a>, and while it’s true she is great in this sequel and that it’s more Glinda’s movie than Elphaba’s, Erivo is still firing on all cylinders, delivering a timeless performance that is also worthy of unadulterated praise. Throughout <em>Wicked: For Good</em>, Elphaba goes from fugitive freedom fighter, to heartbroken friend and exasperated sister, to frustrated revolutionary, to lover in mourning, to resigned martyr. It’s a depressing arc that sees the optimism of progressivism dashed with a big dose of witch-melting water. The simplicity of the message — that doing good comes at a cost, that no matter your intentions, things don’t always work in your favor, and that facism may take on a new face but it’s an ever-present threat — is the point.” </p>



<p>The <em>Wicked</em> instalments are going to go down in history as two of the biggest movies of this decade, if not the century, and that will largely be because Cynthia Erivo gave us an unforgettable and undeniable Elphaba. </p>



<h2>Tessa Thompson, <em>Hedda</em> </h2>



<p>Not to keep quoting myself but this is what I wrote about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11939097/hedda-movie-review-tessa-thompson-interview""><em>Hedda</em> in my review</a> back in October: “Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Tessa Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period.” <br /></p>

<h2>Wunmi Mosaku, <em>Sinners</em> </h2>



<p>As mentioned above, <em>Sinners</em> is Michael B. Jordan’s showcase. But it’s more than just a vehicle for MBJ’s movie stardom or a Southern gothic horror flick like it’s been billed. It is that, but it’s also an enthusiastic musical, a consequential period drama, and an earnest romance. It’s the latter that piqued my interest the most, and its execution is swoon-inducing. I already knew Wunmi Mosaku was a star, but in this role, she’s assertive, luminous and so damn sexy. Annie is the heart of <em>Sinners</em>. She’s also its hero.  “I like to think of Annie as Smoke’s other other half, like Stack is,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11881716/sinners-movie-ending-explained-wunmi-mosaku-interview"">Mosaku said when we interviewed her in April</a>. “Stack is one side of him, but Annie is another side of him. She’s his protector, lover, mother, safe place. She is his sanctuary.” Annie’s knowledge of the spiritual world also saves everyone’s — including Smoke’s — asses. “She moves with purpose. She moves with strength and power. She has such an anchored spirit and is so in tune with the other stuff that we can’t see or feel or hear. She sees and feels and hears it.”</p>

<h2>Ayo Edebiri, <em>After The Hunt</em></h2>



<p>I’m ready to be right about <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8R6DMlDtxk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a></em>. It might take a few years, but I swear this film will outlive its discourse. The Luca Guadagnino-directed drama documents a moment in time — a disturbing, delicate, and awkward moment in time, one that we are still navigating. And for better or worse, shouldn’t we have art that reflects these times? That’s what I wrote at the time of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11937612/after-the-hunt-review-ayo-edebiri-andrew-garfield-interview"">the film’s release</a> and I stand by it: “With time, <em>After The Hunt </em>may hold up as a page to be read in the chapter of this so-called cultural reckoning. Think of it as a sleek and uncomfortable time capsule of the past half decade of #MeToo discourse, or as a character study of flawed intellectuals desperately attempting to perform their values while clinging to the facade of their respective identities. Or, as Ayo Edebiri told me, <em>After The Hunt </em>is a “<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-2795806"">Rorschach test</a>” that interrogates your discomfort. </p>



<p>And it’s in that discomfort where Edebiri and the rest of the cast (Andrew Garfield and Julia Roberts are both excellent as usual) shine. If you’ve seen <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11919394/the-bear-sydney-ayo-edebiri-emmy-nominations-comedy"">The Bear</a></em> or <em>Bottoms</em>, you know Edebiri is a star who can play awkward better than anyone. It was this role that reminded me that she’s going to be around for a very long time. Going toe-to-toe with icon Roberts without flinching and sparring effortlessly with Oscar nominee Garfield, Edebiri in <em>After The Hunt</em> is one of those star-making performances that we’ll look back on in awe. </p>

<h2>David Jonsson, <em>The Long Walk</em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidjonsson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Jonsson</a> doesn’t get enough credit for being one of the most exciting and talented working actors of his generation. I officially fell in love with him in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/rye-lane-review-black-british-romcom"">Rye Lane</a></em>, one of the best rom-coms of the past decade, and this year, he showed versatility and depth in his choices. In <em>The Long Walk</em>, Jonsson anchors the film’s brutal premise: a near-future America where teenage boys volunteer for a televised endurance contest that demands they keep walking above the minimum speed or face lethal consequences. Jonsson’s performance is achingly vulnerable. As the miles stack up and the rules tighten (three warnings, then you’re shot), Jonsson charts the slow erosion of bravado into something far more fragile. </p>



<p>As realization sets in that survival isn’t just about strong legs, it’s about memory, friendship, and the will to keep choosing the next step, Jonsson is especially magnetic in the quieter stretches, trading jokes with fellow walkers (and delivering electric <a href=""https://www.gq.com/story/cooper-hoffman-and-david-jonsson-gq-hype"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">chemistry with Cooper Hoffman</a>) at dawn, bargaining with himself as the road narrows, and letting grief and resolve flicker across his face when the crowd’s cheers turn hollow. Rather than leaning into the spectacle of the contest, Jonsson makes the walk feel personal. With each warning comes a small heartbreak and each mile an excruciating decision. grounding the dystopia in intimacy and reminding us that the most powerful performances don’t outrun the story; they walk straight through it.</p>



<h2>Naomi Ackie, <em>Mickey 17</em></h2>



<p>It’s still baffling to me that Bong Joon Ho’s <em>Mickey 17</em> flopped because it’s so weird and wonderful, and the kind of original movie from one of the greatest living directors that we need more of. But I refuse to let people forget about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11864663/naomi-ackie-mickey-17-nasha-character-interview"">Naomi Ackie’s performance as Nasha</a>, the love interest to Pattinson’s aloof Mickey. Nasha is wild, extremely weird, and an enforcer in a futuristic universe where civilian space travel to another planet sets it apart from our current reality, but a psychotic tyrannical politician with a god complex (<a href=""https://screenrant.com/mickey-17-villain-donald-trump-parody/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mark Ruffalo’s Kenneth Marshall</a>) makes it feel eerily familiar. </p>



<p>Here’s what I wrote back in March: “While <em>Mickey 17</em> is, by all accounts, a showcase of Pattinson’s unquantifiable talent, it’s also a stunning display of how reliably formidable <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/naomi-ackie-actress-star-wars"">Naomi Ackie</a> is. She’s one of the brightest talents working right now, and the weirder she gets, the more wonderful it is to watch. Mickey is clueless, compliant, and a bit dense. Nasha is clever, confident, and fearless. Nasha could easily be relegated to a girlfriend-of-the-hero stereotype, a disposable plot device, but in Bong’s script, she’s assertive, motivated, and layered. And in Ackie’s hands, Nasha leaps off the page and dazzles on screen.”</p>



<h2>Damson Idris,<em> F1</em></h2>



<p>After captivating audiences as <a href=""https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/snowfall/cast/damson-idris-franklin-saint"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Franklin Saint in </a><em><a href=""https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/snowfall/cast/damson-idris-franklin-saint"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Snowfall</a></em>, Damson Idris had cemented himself as a young actor to watch in Hollywood. He shifted gears — literally — into high-octane territory with his leading role in <em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">F1</a></em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/movies/f1-movie-review-brad-pitt.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, the Formula 1 racing film</a> from director Joseph Kosinski and co-starring Brad Pitt. I didn’t love <em>F1</em>, but it was one of the biggest movies of the year and the things that do work about the film are thanks in large part to Idris, who brings charisma and surprising vulnerability to his portrayal of hotshot driver Joshua Pierce. </p>



<p>Whether he’s embodying a South Central kingpin or donning a racing suit opposite Hollywood heavyweights, Idris brings depth, precision, and a quiet confidence that continues to set him apart. And as Unbothered’s very own <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/author/christa-eduafo"">Christa Eduafo</a> found out when she sat down with him <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/06/11910300/damson-idris-f1-movie-interview"">earlier this year in New York City</a>, the actor is well aware that his Black female fanbase bet big on Damson Idris stock early. And with F1, it’s clear our investment has paid off. </p>

<h2>Chase Infiniti, Teyana Taylor &amp; Regina Hall, <em>One Battle After Another </em></h2>



<p>The Black women characters in <em>One Battle After Another </em>have elicited divisive responses. Some critics have written off Teyana Taylor’s Perfidia Beverly Hills as a sexualized stereotype with limited screen time and an underdeveloped character arc. In her <a href=""https://open.substack.com/pub/blackgirlwatching/p/one-battle-after-another-review?r=1mo59&amp;utm_medium=ios"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Black Girl Watching Substack</a>, Brooke Obie writes, “Black women are little more than props and plot devices” and that “[director Paul Thomas] Anderson isn’t commenting on the white male fetishization of Black women, he’s directly participating in it.” While <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/black-actresses-are-carrying-one-battle-after-another.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Angelica Jade Bastien for Vulture</a> says, “The Black women of the film are lightning rods for the most forceful conversations the film can bear, and it’s thrilling to watch them embody what Anderson’s script can only loosely hold.” </p>



<p>There’s a lot to say about how Paul Thomas Anderson depicts Perfidia, Chase Infiniti’s Willa, and Regina Hall’s Deandra (I agree mostly with both Obie and Bastien and their reviews are required supplementary reading material post-watch of <em>OBAA</em>), but of all the critiques of the execution of the lofty ideas of revolution that PTA puts forth in the film, nothing negative can be said about the performances given by these three enigmatic actors. Infiniti is the breakout of the film, playing an almost grown up Willa (the daughter of DiCaprio’s Pat and Taylor’s Perfidia) with quiet resolve and appropriate teen angst. It’s one of the most stunning breakout performances I’ve ever seen and Infiniti should have her pick of roles in the aftermath of this movie’s success. </p>



<p>As for Hall and Taylor, we knew how talented they were — though in different mediums: Taylor as an artist, dancer, and creative director and Hall as a comedic genius. In this film, even if I wish the material lived up to their efforts, both are able to showcase their abilities to give grounding, affecting, dramatic performances. Deandra and Perfidia are in conversation with each other, showing two sides of how to be a revolutionary, and Hall and Taylor’s performances are striking. While Perfidia is loud, brash, emotional, reckless, and boisterous, Deandra is methodical, focused, and intentional. <em>One Battle After Another </em>has been hailed as PTA’s greatest masterpiece and don’t get me wrong, I do think the movie is a triumph, but let’s be clear on <em>why</em> it’s great: Chase Infiniti, Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall. </p>

<h2>Edi Gathegi, <em>Superman</em></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-YcYmzgZI"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Superman</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY-YcYmzgZI"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> was</a> one of my favorite movies of the year. And while the main cast trio of David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, and Nicholas Hoult, Edi <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/news/superman-edi-gathegi-mister-terrific-credits-scene-x-men-1236460211/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gathegi’s Mister Terrific</a> was a surprising delight. Mister Terrific emerges as one of <em>Superman</em>’s smartest anchors, threading intellect through a story preoccupied with power, trust, and what the world expects its heroes to be. As the film tracks Clark Kent navigating a public increasingly skeptical of Superman’s unchecked strength — while Lex Luthor’s machinations test the limits of truth, tech, and influence — Gathegi’s Mister Terrific operates in the grey area where ethics meet engineering. He’s the one parsing data while everyone else argues optics, designing solutions as Superman wrestles with the cost of being a symbol. </p>



<p>Mister Terrific is decisive, grounding the film’s big ideals in method and consequence. Gathegi plays him as a moral mathematician, weighing outcomes with calm authority, so when the plot pivots from spectacle to strategy, his presence feels essential. It’s a performance that could have easily gone unnoticed, but Gathegi makes it unforgettable. </p>



<h2>Andre Holland, <em>Love, Brooklyn</em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andreholland/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Andre Holland</a> gives <a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-brooklyn-andre-holland-movie-review-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachael Abigail Holder’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-brooklyn-andre-holland-movie-review-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love, Brooklyn</a></em> its bruised, beating heart, turning a deceptively small story about dating in the city into something quietly expansive. As Roger, a writer drifting between relationships, neighborhoods, and versions of himself, Holland captures the ache of romantic limbo with a performance that’s all soft edges and sharp self-awareness. </p>



<p>The film unfolds across intimate Brooklyn spaces — apartments that feel borrowed, late-night conversations that blur into morning, chance encounters that reopen old wounds — as Roger navigates his lingering bond with his ex (Nicole Beharie) and a tentative new connection (DeWanda Wise). Holland plays these emotional crosscurrents with exquisite restraint, letting hesitation, guilt, and longing flicker across his face before a single word lands. What makes his work so compelling is how deeply he understands the film’s thesis: that love isn’t always about grand declarations, but about timing, honesty, and the courage to stop hiding in the in-between. In Holland’s hands, Roger is funny, charming, frustrating, and achingly recognizable; he’s a man learning, step by step, how to choose presence over comfort. Holland doesn’t get enough credit for consistently delivering devastating and entertaining performances. </p>



<h2>Susan Chardy, <em>On Becoming A Guinea Fowl </em></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/susan-chardy-on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Susan Chardy gives </a><em><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/susan-chardy-on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">On Becoming a Guinea Fowl</a></em> its emotional spine, guiding us through Rungano Nyoni’s darkly surreal reckoning with family silence and collective denial. As Shula, Chardy moves through the aftermath of her uncle’s sudden death — discovered on a roadside at night — and the elaborate funeral rituals that follow, where aunties organize, gossip circulates, and everyone seems determined to smooth over the past rather than confront it. </p>



<p>While the film slips between realism and dreamlike interludes (guinea fowl skittering through memory, musical detours that feel like pressure valves), Chardy remains piercingly grounded, registering the weight of long-buried truths about abuse and complicity without ever spelling them out. Watch how she listens at the kitchen table, how her stillness cuts through the noise of ceremony, how her face hardens almost imperceptibly as the cost of silence becomes clear. Chardy doesn’t just play a woman at a funeral, she embodies the exhaustion of being awake in a room determined to keep sleeping, making Shula’s quiet resistance the film’s most radical act.</p>



<h2>Da’Vine Joy Randolph, <em>Eternity</em></h2>



<p>After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/davine-joy-randolph-eternity-interview"">Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a> won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for <em>The Holdovers</em>, I was so excited to see her move into starring roles that were worthy of her talent. Playing secondary to Miles Teller in a rom-com starring Elizabeth Olsen wasn’t exactly what I had in mind. But <em>Eternity</em> surprised me, and Randolph is exceptional in it. This is what I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/davine-joy-randolph-eternity-interview"">wrote about the film</a> last month: “Anna, the character, could easily fall into the magical negro trope, a one-note sidekick there in service of the white lead, but in Randolph’s hands (and thanks to her hysterical dynamic with Joan’s AC Ryan played by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bejohnce/?hl=en"">John Early</a>), she’s more than that. Anna is the film’s constant comedic relief, and she’s also its moral center, a grounding force that’s there to remind Larry of the life he built with Joan for decades, while making us laugh repeatedly. That’s the power of Da’Vine Joy Randolph.”</p>

<h2>Delroy Lindo &amp; Miles Caton in <em>Sinners </em></h2>







<p>I couldn’t end this list without <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11884333/sinners-true-story-robert-johnson-ryan-coogler-box-office-success"">mentioning Delroy Lindo</a> and <a href=""https://screenrant.com/sinners-sammie-miles-caton-first-performance-great/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miles Caton in </a><em><a href=""https://screenrant.com/sinners-sammie-miles-caton-first-performance-great/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sinners</a></em>. These two performances — one by a seasoned actor who has a career full of riveting characters, and the other by a brand new talent whose future is so blindingly bright — are just as integral to the success of <em>Sinners</em> as Jordan’s portrayal of Smoke and Stack or Mosaku’s Annie. </p>



<p>Lindo plays Delta Slim, a boozy blues musician who reluctantly agrees to play at the twins new juke joint. Caton’s Sammie is an aspiring musician who is eager to join his cousin in their new business venture. Both are at opposite ends of their musical pursuits, just like Caton and Lindo are at very different moments in their careers. But both characters are bound by their love of the blues, and their allegiance to their communities. While Sammie is naive, impatient, and yearning for adulthood, Delta Slim is wise, heedless yeet unflappable, and the surprising steady voice when the juke joint descends into chaos. </p>



<p>In a perfect world, both Lindo and Caton would be swatting away awards for these performances, but whether or not they are showered with the praise and accolades they deserve, both actors gave two of the most exhilarating performances on screen in 2025. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to January 2026. And this isn’t just another new year…it’s a true reset. Numerologically, 2026 adds up to a 1, the number of beginnings, initiation, and fresh cycles. On a collective level, this is the kind of year astrologers talk about decades later. Saturn and Neptune both re-enter Aries this year — Saturn for two years, Neptune for over a decade. Aries is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">very first sign of the zodiac</a>. This is the ignition point. The spark. And by February, we’ll also enter the Year of the Fire Horse, amplifying this sense that something powerful is waking up in the collective.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing: this doesn’t automatically make 2026 “easy.” It makes it <em>potent</em>. Saturn is in the final moments of wrapping its long journey through Pisces, the final sign of the zodiac. That means every sign has completed a wisdom initiation. We’ve all been stretched, softened, disillusioned, and re-sensitized over the last few years. Even if things still look chaotic (and yes, they are — Uranus remains in Taurus until July, and Pluto is only just settling into Aquarius for its 20-year stay), what’s actually happening is a massive soil-turning. Old systems are breaking down so something more fertile, more alive, and more sustainable can grow.</p>



<p>That’s why one of the biggest themes of January, and honestly, all of 2026, is<em> tending to your own garden.</em> Focus your energy where it can actually grow something. This January begins emotionally, intentionally, and intuitively with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, a powerful culmination of everything we processed in the last six months of 2025. That chapter taught us that even our pain can be transmuted into power. It’s a tender, feeling-forward start to the year — one that invites us to listen more deeply to our intuition instead of overriding it.</p>



<p>At the same time, we’re firmly in Capricorn Season until January 19th, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Capricorn</a> for most of the month and Venus also moving through Capricorn. This grounds all that emotion into something practical. Every zodiac sign is being asked the same question: <em>What actually matters?</em> Financially, this is a strong month for getting yourself together: reviewing your budget, canceling subscriptions you don’t use, and daring to plan the next quarter from abundance rather than scarcity. This is boss energy, but the mature kind. The kind that builds something that lasts.</p>



<p>There’s also a noticeable shift in our collective healing story. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Chiron retrograde ends this month</a>, and that matters. The healing journey we’ve all been on isn’t disappearing… it’s becoming lighter, more creative, more joy-oriented. Healing doesn’t have to be endless excavation. It can be playful. It can be life-giving. And you’ll feel that shift early in the year.</p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy begins to pivot outward. Venus enters Aquarius on January 17th, reminding us that while Capricorn Season may have had us focused on survival and structure, we’re not meant to do this alone. Community matters — but Saturn has taught us discernment. Not everyone gets access to you. Venus in Aquarius isn’t about small talk or performative connection. It’s about people you can build new worlds with. Mutual care, mutual vision, mutual respect.</p>



<p>Then comes the full Aquarius activation. The sun enters Aquarius on January 19th, Mercury follows on January 20th, and Mars enters Aquarius on January 23rd. This is a powerful stellium for community-building, collective dreaming, and unconventional collaboration. If you’ve been thinking about starting a co-op, a startup, a mutual aid project, a community garden — this is your cosmic green light. The weirder, more innovative, and more future-focused, the better. This energy is preparing us for the Aquarius eclipse coming in February, which will further accelerate collective shifts toward equity and shared power. We’re already seeing the ripple effects of this Aquarius momentum worldwide, as communities demand systems that actually serve people.</p>



<p>And just when you think January couldn’t get any more electric, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th. This is huge. Neptune, the planet of dreams, ideals, and imagination, forming supportive connections with Mars and Mercury in Aquarius brings inspired action online. Vision meets movement and hope meets strategy.</p>



<p>Yes, Aquarius energy can bring stubbornness or power struggles if ego gets involved, but the deeper message of this month is simple and radical: <em>you don’t have to do everything alone anymore</em>. January asks us to breathe more easily, to let support circulate, and to extend that same relief to others — especially those with less access or privilege. That’s the real beginning. And that’s what makes this one of the most meaningful fresh starts of our lifetimes.  </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, January opens on an emotional note with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your home, family, and inner foundation. This is a deeply personal reset. You may feel more sensitive than usual, nostalgic even, as memories, family dynamics, or questions about where (and with whom) you truly feel safe come to the surface. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">This Full Moon</a> asks you to tend to your roots before charging ahead. You’re starting the year by acknowledging that strength doesn’t come from constant motion… it comes from having somewhere solid to land. Give yourself permission to feel it all, especially if the past six months stirred up emotions you didn’t have time to fully process.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars remains in Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your career, reputation, and long-term legacy sector. This creates an interesting contrast: emotional sensitivity at home, paired with serious ambition in public. You’re being asked to grow up in some way professionally: to take your goals more seriously, even if that means making tough, disciplined choices. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around your work life, leadership, and the mark you want to leave behind. This is about playing the long game. You’re not just chasing success, you’re defining what success actually means to you.</p>



<p>Then the energy shifts noticeably. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars entering Aquarius on the 23rd, moving your focus from individual achievement to collective impact. Suddenly, you’re energized by community, technology, collaboration, and future-facing ideas. You may feel called to host, organize, share your insights, or step into a more visible role within a group or network.</p>



<p>And just days later, Neptune enters your sign on January 26th, where it will remain for over a decade. This is huge. It marks the beginning of a new era of dreaming, creating, and becoming for you. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and your presence becomes magnetic. This is your time to shine — not by shrinking yourself to fit expectations, but by fully embodying the bold, visionary, brilliant Aries you were born to be. The dreams you begin to believe in now have the power to become real.  </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your communication, learning, and creative expression sector. This is a moment of culmination tied to the last six months, especially around how you speak up, share your ideas, write, teach, or tell your story. Conversations may come full circle, a message finally lands, or you realize how much your voice has evolved since mid-2025. At the start of the year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this Full Moon</a> invites you to honor your growth as a communicator and to trust that your words actually carry weight now. You’re not just talking… you’re transmitting something meaningful.</p>



<p>In the background, Mars moves steadily through Capricorn for most of the month, energizing your sector of higher learning, philosophy, long-distance travel, and big-picture thinking. This is productive, purposeful fire. You may feel motivated to commit to a course, apply for something abroad, plan a meaningful trip, or finally take an idea seriously that once felt too far off or impractical. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially supportive for setting intentions around expansion that’s sustainable; travel with purpose, learning that leads somewhere, or spiritual growth that’s actually integrated into daily life. This isn’t escapism; it’s evolution.</p>



<p>Then the tone shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, lighting up your career, public image, and long-term direction. Suddenly, visibility increases. People notice you. Opportunities arise that ask you to step up or stand out in a new way — especially through innovation, leadership, or unconventional paths. At the same time, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious realm. The magic of this month is learning how to merge both: ambition <em>and</em> inner alignment. You’re being asked to build a life that honors your calling without abandoning your soul. It’s an exciting shift… one that reminds you that success hits different when it’s rooted in meaning. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector. This is a culmination tied to the last six months around income, stability, and how you value your time, energy, and talents. You may receive clarity around what’s sustainable and what’s draining you financially or energetically. At the very start of the year, this Full Moon asks you to get emotionally honest about security — not just what you earn, but what actually makes you feel safe. There’s a strong message here: your worth is no longer negotiable.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, moving through your sector of shared resources, debts, investments, and deep emotional entanglements. This is intense but productive energy. You may be actively restructuring finances that involve other people: taxes, loans, inheritances, subscriptions, or business partnerships. Emotionally, this can also stir up questions about trust, power, and reciprocity. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is an ideal moment to set intentions around financial cleanup, long-term investments, or releasing attachments that feel too heavy to carry into this new cycle. This is about taking responsibility for your future… not fearfully, but strategically.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable lift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, with Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your sector of higher learning, travel, publishing, and expanded perspective. Your curiosity reignites. You may feel pulled toward teaching, studying, sharing your ideas publicly, or planning a trip that changes how you see the world.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, illuminating your community, friendships, and long-term dreams for the next decade. This is where hope returns. You’re reminded that you don’t have to figure everything out alone… your people, your collaborators, your future allies are finding you. January ultimately shifts you from survival mode into vision mode. And that’s a powerful way to begin a year of one.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, January is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your personal reset</a>. Your annual New Moon arrives early, on January 3rd, in your sign, marking one of the most important moments of your entire year. This is a rebirth point, emotionally, energetically, and intuitively. The past six months have likely asked you to release old identities, patterns, or versions of yourself that no longer felt safe or true. Now, you get to choose who you’re becoming. You may feel more sensitive, reflective, or inward at the start of the year, but that’s because your intuition is loud and clear. This New Moon asks you to trust your instincts and set intentions that honor <em>how you want to feel</em>, not just what you want to achieve.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, directly opposing your sign and activating your partnership sector. Relationships — romantic, professional, and personal — are front and center. This can bring clarity around commitment, boundaries, and shared responsibility. You may be asked to meet others halfway, even if that feels uncomfortable at first. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th deepens this theme, offering a moment to reset agreements, redefine expectations, or make a serious decision about who you’re building with long-term. This is about choosing relationships that can support the version of you that’s emerging now.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and expands in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your focus toward intimacy, healing, and shared resources. You’re encouraged to have honest conversations about money, trust, and emotional exchange. Then, on January 26th, Neptune enters Aries, beginning a long-term chapter in your career and public life. Over the next decade, you’re learning how to align your work with your intuition and compassion. January ends by reminding you that when you honor your emotional truth, you don’t just feel safer… you become more powerful. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, January begins quietly with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of rest, healing, and subconscious processing. This is not your usual spotlight moment… and that’s intentional. The start of the year invites you to slow down, go inward, and release emotional weight you’ve been carrying since mid-2025. You may feel more introspective, more tired, or more aware of what needs to end rather than begin. This New Moon is about closure, forgiveness, and making peace with the past so you don’t drag it into the next chapter. Think of it as energetic decluttering before the glow up.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your work, health, and daily routine sector. While emotionally you’re in a reflective space, practically you’re being asked to get your life together. This is prime energy for committing to healthier habits, refining your schedule, or taking your responsibilities more seriously, especially if you’ve been running on autopilot. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th offers a powerful moment to reset your routines and make sustainable changes that support your long-term vitality. Small shifts now can have major ripple effects.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your partnership sector. Suddenly, other people matter more, romantically, creatively, and professionally. Conversations get real, and decisions about commitment, collaboration, or boundaries come into focus. And then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, opening a long-term chapter of spiritual growth, faith, and expanded perspective. January ends by reminding you that rest is not a retreat… it’s preparation. You’re clearing space so <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/being-boring-is-good"">your next era</a> can arrive fully formed.</p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, January opens with the Cancer New Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of friendships, community, and long-term goals.

You may feel a shift in your social circle, a renewed sense of belonging, or clarity about which visions you want to commit to in this new cycle. At the start of the year, this New Moon asks you to stop doing everything alone and to trust that aligned support exists.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of the month in Capricorn</a>, moving through your creativity, romance, and passion sector. This is productive, focused fire… less about fantasy, more about commitment. You’re being encouraged to take something you love seriously, whether that’s a creative project, a romantic connection, or your relationship with joy itself. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially potent for setting intentions around pleasure that’s sustainable, creative work that has structure, or dating with clearer standards. This is about showing up consistently for what lights you up.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a noticeable pivot. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, shifting your attention to work, wellness, and daily systems. You may feel motivated to streamline your schedule, adopt new tools or technologies, or rethink how you manage your time and energy.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of emotional healing and deeper intimacy. January ends by reminding you that when your routines support your passions — and your boundaries support your heart — you don’t just function better, you thrive.</p>

This is a culmination moment connected to the last six months of effort, especially around leadership, recognition, or a role you’ve been growing into since mid-2025. You may receive feedback, validation, or clarity about where you stand professionally and what no longer feels emotionally sustainable. Starting the year this way can feel intense, but it’s also empowering. You’re being asked to define success on your own terms, not just perform it for others.</p>



<p>At the same time, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars moves through Capricorn</a> for most of the month, activating your home, family, and inner foundation sector. While your outer life is visible, your inner life is under construction. You may be dealing with family responsibilities, a move, home projects, or emotional patterns rooted in the past. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful reset point for your private world, setting intentions around stability, boundaries with family, or creating a living situation that actually supports your nervous system. This is about building a base that can hold you as your ambitions grow.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings a shift toward joy and connection. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector. You’re reminded that pleasure, play, and inspiration are not distractions — they’re fuel. Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of spiritual growth through relationships. Over the next decade, partnerships become mirrors for healing, compassion, and deeper understanding. January ends by asking you to choose relationships and creative outlets that feel expansive, honest, and alive.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your sector of belief, higher learning, travel, and meaning. This is a culmination tied to the last six months of growth around your worldview: what you believe, what you stand for, and what feels worth your devotion.

Starting the year this way feels expansive and emotional at once. You’re being reminded that growth isn’t just about doing more… it’s about aligning with a truth that actually sustains you.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars spends most of January in Capricorn</a>, activating your communication, thinking, and daily movement sector. This is sharp, productive energy for writing, speaking, teaching, negotiating, or making concrete plans. Your mind is focused, strategic, and direct. Conversations carry weight now, especially ones you may have been avoiding. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is a powerful moment to set intentions around how you communicate, what you commit to mentally, and how you manage your time and energy day to day. This is about discipline in thought, not obsession — choosing clarity over noise.</p>



<p>The final third of the month brings an inward but grounding shift. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your home, family, and emotional foundation. You may feel called to reorganize your space, redefine family dynamics, or spend more time nesting and grounding yourself.</p>



<p>Then, Neptune enters Aries on January 26th, beginning a long-term chapter of healing through work, wellness, and daily rituals. Over the next decade, your relationship with your body, your labor, and your purpose evolves in a more intuitive, compassionate direction.

<p>Sag, January begins with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and energetic exchange.

You’re learning that vulnerability isn’t a loss of freedom… it’s a different kind of strength.</p>

This is about taking responsibility for your resources and recognizing your value in very real, tangible ways. You may feel motivated to increase income, tighten your budget, or commit to a long-term financial plan that supports your independence. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially powerful for setting intentions around earnings, pricing your work fairly, or building security without sacrificing joy. This is practical ambition that actually supports your freedom.</p>



<p>The energy lightens and speeds up in the final third of the month. Aquarius Season begins January 19th, followed by Mercury entering Aquarius on the 20th and Mars on the 23rd, activating your communication, learning, and local connection sector.

<p>Meanwhile, Mars spends most of January in your sign, giving you drive, momentum, and a sense of personal authority that’s hard to ignore. You’re more decisive, more visible, and more willing to take up space. This is a powerful time to initiate personal goals, redefine your identity, or step into leadership in a way that feels embodied rather than forced. The Capricorn New Moon around January 18th is especially important for you — it’s a personal reset. Set intentions around how you want to move through the world this year, what version of yourself you’re committing to, and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate.

<p>Pisces, January opens with the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, illuminating your creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression sector.

<p>December 31st is a time of mixed energies, due to the Gemini Moon, in which we may start the night with one idea in motion and end up at another party. Prepare yourself for the unexpected and go with the flow. Mercury shifts from Sagittarius to Capricorn on New Year’s Day, immediately aspecting the Nodes of Destiny. This cosmic change motivates us to get on track ASAP. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">Our goals for 2026</a> start faster than we can even process them, so let’s go!</p>

<h2>Aries</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Aries</a>, rather than doing the same thing you’ve always done, you’ll find you’re in the mood for different activities. Check if anyone in your circle is hosting a party and attend the gathering. It’ll be nice not to have to host and deal with the cleanup. Now, your primary focus is on socializing and having fun. </p>

<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Taurus</a>, the only thing holding you back from balling around town with friends is your lack of funds to support this endeavor. Even if it means having to live on a budget and cutting back for the next few weeks, you won’t want to miss out on the good vibes and times that New Year’s Day brings.</p>

<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini</a>, you’re feeling more like the social butterfly that you are, which means that you’ll be party hopping all night long. The caveat to this plan is that you might meet a stranger who will bring butterflies to your stomach, making you want to stay longer at one event than the others to connect with them.</p>

<h2>Cancer</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Cancer</a>, you’re longing for a low-key New Year’s Eve, which means spending time at home with a few close friends. Invite them over for a chilled out dinner and game night. You’ll have fun celebrating the new year, playing games that bring everyone together, and laughing all night long. The bond you create will bring you closer.</p>

<h2>Leo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo</a>, New Year’s Eve will definitely be one of those nights where you end up singing karaoke at a dive bar. You’ll be surrounded by your squad, who will encourage you to cut loose and sing your own rendition and remix of Taylor Swift’s songs. The results are iconic and worthy of a social media post.</p>

<h2>Virgo</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Virgo</a>, You might get caught up in some serious professional drama if you don’t log out of your email account. Even though it’s a holiday, there is a chance that an issue needs to be addressed before the year wraps up. Put the matter on ice before it consumes your evening. Don’t be in the work zone.</p>

<h2>Libra</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra</a>, heading out of town for a unique New Year’s Eve experience is the best choice you’ll ever make.

<h2>Scorpio</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, you may not be able to stay up until the ball drops, but you’ll try.

<h2>Sagittarius</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sag</a>, put your spirited ways aside this New Year’s Eve and focus on romance. Go out for an intimate dinner for two and come back to a warm, loving home. You’ll be glad that you took the time to be alone with your significant other on the momentous evening. Take photos to crystallize the night together. </p>

<h2>Capricorn</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn</a>, you might overdo it with the champagne on your leaving, resulting in an intense hangover the next day. If you’re abstaining from alcohol, then you might just be exhausted and in need of relaxation on New Year’s Day. All in all, try to keep the vibe cool and not take it to the extreme.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, we’ve made it to the final week of 2025, and the threshold of 2026. And honestly? This doesn’t feel like a light, glittery end-of-year moment. This week carries weight. We’re closing out a year of nine, a numerological cycle of completion, karmic closure, and spiritual awakening — often delivered through loss, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11382835/time-management-makeover-productivity-trap"">surrender, and rebirth</a>. On top of that, we’re nearing the end of the Year of the Snake, a long initiation marked by shedding skin slowly, deliberately, sometimes painfully. Even if the letting go happened in baby steps, it still counts. This is the end of a very long cycle, and the body knows it.</p>



<p>Astrologically, the seriousness is unmistakable. Capricorn Season dominates the sky, with a growing stellium that includes Mars, the sun, Venus, and soon Juno entering Capricorn on December 29th, followed by Mercury entering Capricorn on January 1st. This isn’t party energy — it’s legacy energy. Yes, festivities may still happen, especially early in the week, but the collective mood is more reflective than performative. What people really want right now is clarity around purpose, direction, and what they’re building next. And that clarity may not arrive instantly. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn teaches us</a> that some truths only come through patience, discipline, and showing up even when the answers aren’t fully formed yet.</p>



<p>This is also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">a Full Moon week</a>, with the emotional intensity building as early as December 29th, leading to the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd. A Capricorn stellium paired with a Cancer Full Moon is a powerful polarity: ambition versus emotion, structure versus sensitivity, duty versus care. This combination brings up deep questions about what we’re working toward, and <em>why</em>. It asks us to feel what we’ve been pushing through, to acknowledge the emotional cost of growth, and to decide what’s actually worth carrying forward. Adding to this intensity, Chiron, the asteroid of our core wounds and healing, stations direct on January 2nd at 9:38 a.m. EST, amplifying the emotional release of this lunation. We’re not just feeling things… we’re transmuting them.</p>



<p>When 2026 officially begins, there’s no room left for self-pity. With Mercury in Capricorn and Chiron moving forward in Aries, the message is clear: we rise again. We’re the warrior who gets back up after being knocked down — not because it’s easy, but because we’ve learned how. The Cancer Full Moon allows us to feel everything, fully and honestly, so we can move forward unburdened. And the fact that the week <em>after</em> this Full Moon is astrologically quiet is no accident. It’s an integration period, a sacred pause to embody the new version of ourselves stepping into a Year of One, the year of initiation and fresh beginnings. We end 2025 with emotional clarity, not illusions. And that, cosmic beings, is a blessing.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the year doesn’t end quietly for you… it ends with a résumé review and an existential pop quiz. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 are dominated by serious Capricorn energy in your career and legacy sector. This isn’t just about what you do for work, it’s about what you want to be <em>known</em> for. Reputation, impact, authority, and long-term influence are on your mind. You might catch yourself thinking less “what’s my next move?” and more “what am I building that actually matters?” It’s giving CEO energy, but also philosopher. The upside: you feel powerful, focused, and clear-eyed about your potential. The shadow? Taking yourself a little <em>too</em> seriously — overworking, micromanaging, or forgetting that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bed-rotting-trend-tiktok"">you’re allowed to rest</a>. The move here is to embody leadership without turning life into a performance review.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in your sign, and just one day later, the Cancer Full Moon lands in your home and foundation sector. This is big. After months of revisiting old wounds around identity, confidence, and self-trust, Chiron moving forward feels like a quiet but undeniable shift: <em>I’ve survived this, and I’m stronger for it.</em> The Cancer Full Moon invites you to feel everything you’ve been holding together with duct tape: family stuff, inner child stuff, the pressure of always having to be “the strong one.” Let it move through you. Cry if you need to. Clean your space. Have a real conversation. This isn’t weakness… it’s integration. You’re ending the year with emotional clarity and starting the next one grounded in who you actually are, not who you thought you had to be.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the year wraps up with big “zoom out” energy for you. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy dominates your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. You’re less interested in the day-to-day grind and more focused on the <em>why</em> behind it all. This can look like questioning old goals, rethinking a path you once assumed you’d take, or realizing you’ve outgrown a belief system that no longer reflects who you are. It’s giving “I need my life to make sense, actually.” The upside is clarity and maturity… your worldview is evolving. The shadow? Becoming a little rigid or self-righteous about what’s “right.” Stay open. Expansion doesn’t have to come with a superiority complex.</p>



<p>Then the emotional download hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your subconscious and communication sectors. You may feel old fears, insecurities, or unspoken truths rise to the surface, especially ones you’ve buried because they felt inconvenient or messy. This is a release moment. Conversations can be healing, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">journaling can be cathartic</a>, and rest is non-negotiable. Let yourself name what you’ve been avoiding. This full moon helps you clear mental clutter so you can step into 2026 lighter, calmer, and more emotionally honest. You’re not losing stability… you’re redefining it from the inside out.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the year ends with you doing emotional math you can’t spreadsheet your way out of. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, the final days of 2025 and the opening of 2026 activate your intimacy, shared resources, and power sector. This is about money you share, energy you exchange, and the unspoken contracts in your closest relationships. You may find yourself asking some very Capricorn-coded questions like: <em>Is this sustainable? Am I giving more than I’m getting? Who actually has access to me like this?</em> The upside is maturity and discernment. The shadow is overthinking or emotionally detaching instead of feeling what’s there. Just because you can intellectualize something doesn’t mean you should avoid processing it.</p>



<p>Then things get real in the best way. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Cancer Full Moon lights up your money and self-worth sector. Translation: the healing work around belonging, friendship, and feeling “chosen” starts moving forward, and it shows up in how you value yourself. This Full Moon asks you to stop underpricing your time, your labor, and your emotional availability. You may realize you’ve been saying yes out of habit or guilt instead of alignment. Let it go. This is a clearing moment that helps you step into 2026 knowing your worth without needing external validation to confirm it. Less explaining. More embodying.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the year ends with the spotlight firmly on your relationships and commitments. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your partnership sector, making the final days of 2025 and the first moments of 2026 feel serious, clarifying, and no-nonsense. This isn’t about romance alone… it’s about who you’re building life with, who shows up consistently, and who’s actually aligned with your long-term vision. You may find yourself thinking less “do I like this?” and more “can this last?” The upside is emotional maturity and clarity. The shadow is being overly guarded or testing people instead of trusting what you already know. Not every connection needs to prove itself under interrogation.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional crescendo. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, and on January 3rd, the Full Moon lands in your sign, opening 2026 with undeniable intensity. This is <em>your</em> annual Full Moon — an emotional release, a rebirth, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eat-pray-love-era-generational-appeal"">a reset all in one</a>. After months of pressure around visibility, responsibility, and proving yourself, you’re finally allowed to feel everything you’ve been holding together so gracefully. This Full Moon helps you shed old identities, outdated expectations, and emotional armor you no longer need. You’re not the same person you were at the start of the year… and that’s the point. You enter 2026 softer, clearer, and deeply grounded in what you need to thrive.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the year wraps up with a very unglamorous but extremely necessary reality check, and honestly, it’s doing you favors. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your work, health, and daily life sector. Translation: routines, responsibilities, and the systems holding your life together are under review. You might find yourself reflecting on how you actually spend your time versus how you <em>say</em> you do. Legacy questions come up, but in a grounded way: <em>What kind of life am I sustaining day after day? Is this pace even healthy?</em> The upside is clarity and discipline. The shadow is being overly critical of yourself or turning productivity into self-worth. You’re allowed to be human, not just efficient.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional release valve. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is a deep exhale moment. Old fears, grief, or exhaustion you’ve been pushing through finally surface so they can be released. You might feel more tired than usual, more introspective, or in need of solitude — and that’s not a flaw, it’s integration. Let yourself slow down. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">Cancel plans. Sleep. Journal</a>. This Full Moon is clearing emotional residue from 2025 so you don’t carry it into 2026. You’re not disappearing… you’re restoring. And that’s how the next chapter actually gets to shine.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the year closes with you taking joy seriously, and not in a cheesy way. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury (your ruler) enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector. This isn’t about chasing fun for fun’s sake; it’s about asking what actually nourishes you. You may find yourself reflecting on which passions are worth committing to, which relationships feel aligned with your future self, and where you’ve been treating pleasure like a reward instead of a necessity. The upside is clarity and devotion to what truly matters. The shadow? Over-curating your happiness or putting pressure on yourself to “optimize” joy. Let it be real, not perfect.</p>



<p>Then the emotional shift lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your community, friendships, and long-term goals sector. This is a release moment around belonging — who you feel safe dreaming with and where you’ve outgrown certain circles. You may realize that some connections were season-long, not lifetime ones, and that’s okay. The Full Moon helps you let go of people-pleasing and step into more emotionally honest alignment. You enter 2026 clearer about who’s on your team and what future you’re actually working toward. Less obligation, more intention.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the year closes with you getting extremely honest about what “home” actually means. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. This isn’t just about your physical space… it’s about what (and who) grounds you when no one’s watching. You may find yourself reflecting on family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns you’ve outgrown. It’s giving “I love you, but this setup no longer works for me.” The upside is maturity and self-respect. The shadow is feeling guilty for wanting stability on <em>your</em> terms. Reminder: prioritizing your nervous system is not selfish, it’s necessary.</p>



<p>Then comes the emotional peak. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your career and public life sector. This is a big moment around visibility and self-trust. Old wounds tied to approval, partnership dynamics, or fear of being judged may surface — especially if you’ve been shrinking yourself to keep the peace. Let it rise so it can release. This Full Moon helps you reclaim authority over your path and redefine success in a way that feels emotionally sustainable. You’re stepping into 2026 clearer about where you’re going, and more importantly, who you no longer need permission from to get there.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the year ends with your mind in full executive mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your communication, thinking, and decision-making sector. You’re not in the mood for vague plans, emotional spirals, or conversations that go nowhere. This is about clarity, boundaries, and saying exactly what you mean, with fewer disclaimers. You may find yourself reflecting on how you’ve been using your voice all year: what you’ve said, what you’ve withheld, and where silence was strategic versus self-sabotaging. The upside is sharp focus and authority. The shadow? Becoming overly blunt or emotionally armored. Precision doesn’t require coldness, just intention.</p>



<p>Then comes the perspective shift. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your beliefs, purpose, and long-term vision sector. This is a moment of emotional truth around what you actually believe in, and whether your life reflects it. Old wounds tied to burnout, over-responsibility, or “doing everything yourself” come up so they can finally move forward. The Full Moon may bring a realization that changes how you see your future, your faith, or your next chapter entirely. Let it land. You’re ending 2025 with mental clarity and entering 2026 with emotional alignment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">No drama… Just evolution.</a></p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the year closes with your attention firmly on money, value, and sustainability. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, Capricorn energy continues to activate your income and self-worth sector. This isn’t about restriction, it’s about reality. You’re taking a long, honest look at what you earn, what you spend, and what your time is actually worth. Legacy questions come up here too, but in a very tangible way: <em>How do I support the life I say I want?</em> The upside is clarity and empowerment. The shadow is spiraling into “ugh, capitalism” energy instead of making practical moves. You don’t have to sell your soul… you just have to stop winging it.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release lands. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, and intimacy sectors. This is a powerful moment around healing wounds tied to pleasure, romance, and feeling chosen, while also releasing emotional or financial entanglements that have felt heavy or unclear. You may realize you’ve been over-giving, over-merging, or carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours. Let it go. This Full Moon helps you reset boundaries around energy and trust so you can enter 2026 lighter, freer, and more emotionally honest. Stability doesn’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/being-boring-is-good"">have to feel boring</a>, and this week proves it.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this is your week… and you feel it. As Juno enters your sign on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the end of 2025 and the beginning of 2026 revolve squarely around <em>you</em>. Identity, commitments, boundaries, and self-definition are front and center. This isn’t about proving anything anymore — it’s about deciding who you’re willing to be accountable to, including yourself. You may feel more serious, more focused, and more intentional about how you show up in the world. The upside is authority and clarity. The shadow? Carrying the weight of the world like it’s your job. Reminder: leadership doesn’t mean self-erasure. You’re allowed to be powerful <em>and</em> human.</p>



<p>Then the emotional truth hits. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your home, family, and partnership axis. This brings deep feelings around belonging, emotional safety, and the roles you’ve played for others, sometimes at your own expense. Old wounds tied to family dynamics, vulnerability, or letting others support you may surface so they can finally move forward. Let yourself feel it without turning it into a to-do list. This Full Moon helps you soften the armor just enough to start 2026 emotionally aligned, not just externally successful. You’re not losing control… you’re gaining balance.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the year ends with you in low-battery-but-high-awareness mode. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury enters Capricorn on January 1st, the Capricorn pile-up activates your rest, retreat, and subconscious sector. Translation: you’re done explaining yourself, done overextending, and done pretending you’re not tired. This is a deeply reflective moment where legacy questions surface privately, not publicly. Instead of asking <em>what am I building?</em> You’re asking <em>what needs to end so I can build anything at all?</em> The upside is profound clarity and emotional maturity. The shadow is isolation or ghosting instead of communicating needs. You don’t have to disappear to protect your energy. Quiet boundaries work too.</p>



<p>Then the reset arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your work, wellness, and daily life sector. This is a release around burnout, obligation, and the pressure to always be useful. You may finally admit that a routine, job, or responsibility has been costing you more than it’s giving. Let that truth land. This Full Moon helps you clear emotional residue from 2025 so you can enter 2026 with healthier systems, and less resentment. You’re not here to martyr yourself for the future. You’re here to build it sustainably.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the year closes with you getting very selective about your future and the people in it. As Juno enters Capricorn on December 29th and Mercury follows suit on January 1st, Capricorn energy activates your community, friendships, and long-term vision sector. You’re not interested in vague dreams or feel-good group chats anymore. This is about asking real questions: <em>Who am I building with? Who actually shows up? What future do I want to commit to?</em> You may feel less tolerant of flaky dynamics and more drawn to people who match your effort and integrity. The upside is discernment and maturity. The shadow is cynicism and assuming no one can meet you where you are. Stay open, but stay real.</p>



<p>Then the emotional release arrives. On January 2nd, Chiron stations direct in Aries, followed by the Cancer Full Moon on January 3rd, activating your creativity, joy, romance, and inner child sector. This is a powerful moment of healing around worthiness, especially the belief that joy has to be earned or justified. Old wounds tied to money, self-esteem, or being chosen soften and begin to move forward. Let yourself feel happiness without overanalyzing it. Create something. Laugh. Rest. This Full Moon reminds you that pleasure is not a distraction from your purpose — it’s part of it. You enter 2026 lighter, clearer, and more emotionally aligned with what actually makes life feel worth living.</p>

<p>2026 is poised to be a highly productive year. Numerologically, 2026 is a number one year, promising <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11504131/practical-classic-outfits-styling-ideas"">a fresh start</a>, which is exactly the kind of energy we all need. The planets are bringing about significant changes that will transform lives. The kind that will give us the incentive to reach for the stars. There will be a few momentary setbacks, but nothing we can’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-are-not-an-empath"">overcome with empathy</a>, kindness, and TLC. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Here are the key astrological takeaways  </h3>



<p>Two out of the four eclipses occurring this year are a result of the Nodes of Destiny’s entrance into the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis on July 26th. This is a time of unique thought, charity, and compassion. The eclipses are:  </p>



<p><strong>February 17th:</strong> the annular solar eclipse in Aquarius </p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> a total lunar eclipse in Virgo  </p>



<p><strong>August 12th:</strong> a total solar eclipse in Leo </p>



<p><strong>August 28th:</strong> a partial lunar eclipse in Pisces </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>Mercury retrograde occurs three times this year. Since Mercury is moonwalking in the water signs, we will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/healed-too-much-self-work-romantic-relationships"">get reflective and heal</a>.  Take note of: </p>



<p><strong>February 26th to March 20th:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Pisces  </p>



<p><strong>June 29th to July 23rd:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Cancer  </p>



<p><strong>October 24th to November 13th:</strong> Mercury retrogrades in Scorpio  </p>



<p>Venus retrograde spin in Scorpio and Libra happens between October 3rd and November 13th. Relationships might stall and be full of theatrics and intensity. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>These are the main planetary ingresses of 2026:  </p>



<p><strong>January 26th:</strong> Neptune re-enters Aries, taking us back to the spring of 2025, pushing us to unconditionally love ourselves  </p>



<p><strong>February 13th:</strong> Saturn moves into Aries again, bring back the authoritative vibe from last spring  </p>



<p><strong>April 25th:</strong> Uranus flies into Gemini again, having transitioned into Gemini in the past summer, consuming the internet with questionable information  </p>



<p><strong>June 30th:</strong> Jupiter enters Leo, boosting our rizz  </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your willingness to learn, regardless of your age, is such an empowering and refreshing quality. Your dedication proves to be an undeniable asset that is quite admirable. The year ahead provides you with time to work on and consider your own emotional and mental wellness for the future. You’re trying to make wise decisions right now, with Saturn and Neptune connecting with your sun (they form an exact conjunction on February 20th). Uranus in Gemini gives you the confidence to take action, even if you are unsure of the full effect it will have. The impact that Uranus will have on your chart is exhilarating. Because of your passionate nature, you’ve picked up multiple skills, making Jupiter’s time in Leo a critical time to take part in hobbies that speak to you. Mark your iCal for June 30th to celebrate your gifts, even if the eclipses on Friday, August 17th, aren’t making you feel like the vibrant ram you are. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, there has been a lot of changes in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-comfortable-in-relationship"">your intimate relationships</a>, resulting in a feeling of unpredictability, which you’re not a fan of. As the planets move forward, you’ll feel a sense of calm and relief on April 25th, when Uranus releases you from the seven-year topsy-turvy transit on your sun. As a result, being more structured in your life will result in a chain of beneficial events, like an expansion of your home on June 30th, when Jupiter enters Leo. The only thing that weighs on your shoulders is that Venus’s backward spring, which commences on October 3rd and lasts until November 13th in Scorpio and Libra, plus Mercury retrograde from October 24th to November 13th in Scorpio, might bring the drama back into your orb by reigniting a former flame. Do not make the same mistakes and recreate similar patterns you’ve evolved from — no more recycling exes. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Uranus’s seven-year switch is serving as rebranding for your aura, when it begins its epic transit on your sun. You had a little taste of its change last year, when Uranus first entered Gemini in the summer. Now, as the wild planet moves forward, you’re having a spring awakening that begins on April 25th. The revolutionary planet is allowing you to take a new stance on older views. You’ll feel that everything that you once believed in is now evolving, which is a wonderful thing. The retrogrades of 2026, particularly February 26th’s Mercury rewind in Pisces, will prompt you to revitalize your goals to get a step ahead. In the process of achieving success, you will need to reassess your plan and make adjustments to refine your vision. At times, life can become chaotic, but it is a natural part of the journey. This is your moment to ignite your truth and become the real version of yourself. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this is your year to shine. Jupiter is riding high on your sign until June 30th, bringing success in your endeavors. Your social life will be thriving as a result. However, Saturn and Neptune’s conjunction on February 20th is going to make you question your goals. Don’t stress because you’ll be able to figure out your path by reflecting over the summer when Mercury backstrokes on your sun from June 29th to July 23rd. A new version of a former dream is going to stimulate your mind. It could be professional, romantic, or travel coded. You should go for it and not look back. Embrace the notion and rise to the occasion, wherever it takes you. July 26th’s nodal ingress into Aquarius and Leo is going to help you boss up to be the strongest and most efficient version of yourself. Overall, 2026 is the year of the crab. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, intimacy stems from the willingness to express vulnerabilities. As someone who has a prideful demeanor, this can be challenging. Fortunately, 2026 urges you to lean into relationships. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th, combined with Jupiter’s entrance into your sun sign on June 30th and Pluto’s continuing transit through your seventh house of personal connections, glow up your vibe and desire to commit. Even if you’re in a partnership, you’ll want to work through the insecurities and vulnerabilities you encounter. Being open and honest with your partner and friends when Uranus swings into Gemini on August 25th can help create a better dynamic and ease your daily stresses. The ability to trust your significant other during Venus and Mercury retrograde in the fall, when you’re not around, will prove crucial and beneficial for the future. You won’t have to worry about them doing the right thing — you’ll know that they are. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the eclipses of 2025 straddled between your first and seventh house. The juxtaposition in these sectors prompted you to take a closer look at the people you’re drawing near to you. They are mirroring your actions and reflecting the energy you’re projecting. As 2026 begins, you are going through similar eclipses and experiences on March 3rd and August 28th. The silver lining is that you are wiser to the game and are going to be vigilant about who has access to your energy to ensure you’re not losing in love. You will never let yourself be put in similar situations. However, you might be tested during Mercury’s moonwalk in Pisces from February 25th to March 20th. The key is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">to create boundaries</a> to ensure that they don’t find their way back into your heart. The good news is that your team is going to support you throughout the year and offer you valuable advice.  </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, the Saturn and Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th centers around partnerships and contracts for you. Before signing any documents, ensure that you have a third-party review the contracts. You don’t want to give anyone authority over you, especially when it comes to financial decisions. The flip side is that it could be a time when you DTR. The Nodes of Destiny move into the Aquarius and Leo axis on August 26th, starting a new year and a half cycle, encouraging you to be free from the artistic constraints that have been holding you back. The caveat is that Pluto’s presence in your fifth house of creativity is going to make you more competitive in your field. Venus’s retrograde in Scorpio and Libra from October 3rd to November 13th escalates the desire to be number one; it doesn’t matter how the world views you, but what matters is how you feel about yourself. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, just when you thought things were beginning to quiet down a plot twist occurs. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th, along with Pluto’s transit in the ancestral and foundational sector of your chart, urge you to maintain a healthy balance between your career and home life. With the Nodes of Destiny moving into Aquarius and Leo on July 26th for the next 18 months, you’re going to have to make professional sacrifices to assist your family. The frustration begins to weigh on you when Venus and Mercury retrograde, starting on October 3rd and October 24th. Both planets clear their moonwalk on November 13th, giving you a sigh of relief and the ability to transcend, as you shed your energy and integrate newness into your thinking and living. Shutting down the past will be easier to do at this time because you’ll have a clear direction about where you’re meant to be in the year. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the Saturn and Neptune alliance on February 20th in Aries, is going to have a sobering effect on you. It’s not that you’re not going to want to go out and have fun, but you’re going to change your approach to what constitutes a good time. Instead of drinking or engaging in frivolous conversations, you will focus your energy on activities that are meaningful and enriching to your life. Your planetary ruler, Jupiter, switches signs from Cancer to Leo on June 30th, urging you to transform your innermost philosophies. While this is something you usually do, you’ll find that the focus is more on spiritual endeavors, since the South Node of Destiny triggers Jupiter. You may even feel called to take a class on a topic that you previously excelled in to gain a different understanding and appreciation of the subject. Broaden your mind in 2026 to enhance your knowledge and world. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, 2026 is a year for you to take a step back from the daily grind. With Saturn and Neptune joining forces in your fourth house of home and family on February 20th, you’ll have a patient attitude that allows you to focus on the here and now. Of course, you might get caught up in your emotions and drift away into fantasies every so often, but for most of the year, you’re going to be redefining your value system. Uranus’s re-entrance into Gemini on April 25th will help you to really see progress if you allow yourself to slow down. Appreciating the little things can lead to new ideas. Taking a playful approach to life, for once, will keep you motivated. These ventures will be fortuitous, especially since Jupiter in Cancer is lighting up your relationships and bringing fabulous people into your sphere for the first six months of the year. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, have you put others’ needs before your own? This is a year when you reclaim your authority and vigor. The North Node of Destiny links up with your sun sign on July 26th, heightening your sense of self and admiration from others. The eclipses on February 17th and August 12th offer you a chance to diversify your success by helping others. However, they may not accept it, since Jupiter in Leo is making them prideful. Pay close attention to who exits your life because they may be a secret hater. Pluto’s allegiance with your sun sign reveals your shadow side and allows you to choose a different story for yourself. If you’ve been accepting the lower form of the package, you have no choice but to confront your passions right now. There is no more settling for the lesser of the deal during this time. This is a life-changing metamorphosis at an exponential rate. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Neptune’s reemergence in Aries on January 26th gives a false sense of confidence, making you appear braver than you are or need to be. You’ll need to temper your ego to avoid coming across as arrogant and strive to remain grounded. The eclipses on March 3rd and August 28th are pushing you into the spotlight and giving you a chance to reflect on how your actions are affecting others. It’s terrific to be popular and liked. Still, you shouldn’t take the people who have been with you from the beginning for granted. Mercury’s backward spin on your sign, which commences between February 26th and March 20th, is going to let you see just that; however, with Uranus in Gemini rolling into your fourth house on April 25th, you may get sidetracked by home renovations and familial issues. Likely, you might not see the big picture until Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951927.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>2025 was a standout year for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-skincare-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare trends</a>. In the spring, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/autumn-winter-skincare-trends-2024"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">polynucleotides — DNA derived from salmon</a> or trout — took off, with experts using them in facial treatments to repair skin and boost hydration. By summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED face masks</a> were everywhere, praised for their ability to reduce acne and stimulate collagen. Fall then marked the megawatt return of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pat-mcgrath-glass-skin-fetish-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glass skin</a>. But with another year on the horizon, you can bet that it’ll be packed with even more skincare innovations to try. </p>



<p>Whether your main goal is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-sulfur-10-powder-to-cream-concentrate-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearing up your skin</a> or investing in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-beauty-led-face-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare tech</a>, here are the five trends experts say will reign supreme in 2026 — and there’s something for everyone, no matter your skin type or budget. </p>



<h2>The next wave of Korean skincare </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miamiapark/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mia Park</a>, founder of New York–based K-beauty brand <a href=""https://stay-lazy.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lazy Skincare</a>, says we’ve only seen the beginning of what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare</a> can achieve. “The next wave of innovation is already emerging as Korean labs push boundaries in texture science, botanicals, and multifunctional formulas,” says Park. Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty</a> — a serum-moisturizer duo — is an example of how brands are combining effective plant-based ingredients (think red camellia and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bakuchiol-natural-retinol-alternative"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bakuchiol to target uneven skin tone</a>, and silver ear mushroom to boost moisture) with skin-strengthening, fast-healing peptides and oil-controlling niacinamide.  </p>



<p>K-beauty treatments are set to make their way into skincare clinics, too. Local Dynamic Micro-Massage, or LDM, utilizes dual-frequency ultrasound to stimulate collagen and elastin — key proteins that provide skin with structure and strength. A 20-minute session can also reduce inflammation and support the skin barrier, the outermost layer that locks in moisture and keeps out bacteria. LDM should always be performed by a qualified dermatologist or esthetician. </p>



<h2>Slow-release skincare </h2>



<p>If you’ve fallen into the “more is more” trap — overloading your skin with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high concentrations of retinoids</a>, exfoliating acids, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">antioxidants like vitamin C</a> — advanced facialist <a href=""https://mariamabbas.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mariam Abbas</a> says that the slow-release skincare trend is for you. She points out that many brands are now “encapsulating” their formulas, wrapping potent ingredients in tiny moisturizing capsules for controlled release. They reach the skin a little more slowly but still deliver results — without irritation. </p>



<p>Take <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fstarter-retinol"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a>, which features encapsulated retinol. The encapsulated ingredient acts like a cushion, targeting uneven skin tone, texture, and fine lines while minimizing the risk of sore, sensitive, dry, or flaky skin. If you’re a seasoned retinoid user, try the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinkeylist.com%2Fproducts%2Fadvanced-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal Serum</a>. Not to be confused with retinol, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">retin<em>al</em> works faster</a> because it requires fewer steps to convert into retinoic acid on the skin — the active ingredient that actually gets to work. The retinal in this product is also encapsulated, which helps make dry, sensitive skin much less of a concern. </p>



<p>If you prefer exfoliating acids, opt for a leave-on formula that works gradually, rather than a high-strength flash mask that can leave skin feeling parched. Try <a href=""https://www.timeline.com/skincare/products/resurfacing-exfoliator"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare’s Mito-Biotic Resurfacing Exfoliator</a>, which uses a balanced trifecta of acids — including gentle salicylic, lactic, and mandelic acids — to help prevent breakouts while improving skin texture and tone.</p>





<h2>Skin wellbeing </h2>



<p>“A cultural shift is underway, and living well is replacing the need to appear busy,” says Park, adding, “This mindset is reshaping beauty,” specifically, skincare. Bloomberg recently proclaimed that “<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/wellness-is-the-new-nightlife-as-young-people-drink-less"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wellness is the new nightlife</a>,” Park points out, and she says that in 2026, the skincare products that will succeed are those that support “calm, recovery, and low-stress routines.”  </p>



<p>Lazy’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstay-lazy.com%2Fproducts%2Fdouble-duty"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Double Duty Serum Moisturizer Duo</a> features squalane, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and peptides to hydrate, moisturize, and support the skin’s natural healing response. Skincare packed with vitamins is another option — like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdermalogica-biolumin-c-night-restore-serum-with-pro-vitamin-d-complex-P512961%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dermalogica Biolumin-C Night Restore Serum with Pro-Vitamin D Complex</a>, which brightens and strengthens the skin barrier overnight. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455365"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Vitamin B, C, and E Moisturizer</a> helps control excess oil, shields against environmental aggressors such as pollution, and provides deep hydration in one go. </p>



<p>We’ll also see more products spotlighting matcha and green tea as hero ingredients, helping to protect skin from urban stressors thanks to their antioxidant properties. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeline.com%2Fskincare%2Fproducts%2Ffirming-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Timeline Skincare Mito-Biotic Firming Serum</a>, infused with green tea, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fmatcha-calming-cream-pimprod2055952%3Fsku%3D2651317"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TirTir Matcha Calming Cream</a> to help quell redness. Park makes a great point: “You can’t out-serum an exhausted nervous system, but beauty products that make space for rest is the future.” </p>





<h2>Underspending on the basics </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://www.dropheliaveraitch.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> has noticed that many patients assume the more expensive a product, the better the results. “That’s rarely true,” she says. In fact, she recommends sticking to the basics for cleansers and moisturizers. There are plenty of excellent, affordable options for all skin types, including <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP505274"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glucoside Foaming Cleanser</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydrating-facial-cleanser-xlsImpprod4190255%3Fsku%3D2241933"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser</a>, and <a href=""https://www.target.com/p/byoma-blemish-acne-clearing-creamy-cleanser-5-91-fl-oz/-/A-94468810"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Clearing Creamy Cleanser</a>.  </p>



<p>When it comes to moisturizers, simple is often best, especially if you’re layering serums with active ingredients like retinol, vitamin C, or exfoliating acids. Our favorites include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-water-gel-moisturizer-xlsImpprod12041835%3Fsku%3D2284291"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fholy-hydration-daily-moisturizer-xlsImpprod14481069%3Fsku%3D2500311"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Holy Hydration Moisturizer</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCetaphil-Daily-Oil-Free-Hydrating-Lotion-with-Hyaluronic-Acid-3-fl-oz%2F55092626"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion</a>. </p>



<p>Dr. Veraitch recommends investing in high-quality active ingredients suited to your skin type and concerns, for example, niacinamide for oily or acne-prone skin, or hyaluronic acid for dry, dehydrated skin, along with a reliable, high-factor broad-spectrum sunscreen. “This matters far more than price,” she says. </p>







<h2>Minimalism is the new luxury </h2>



<p>“In 2026, the most desirable routines won’t be the longest,” says Park, “they’ll be the smartest.” With budgets tightening and dermatologists noting that multi-step skincare routines can sometimes be counterproductive, Park predicts we’ll favor fewer products, clearer choices, and formulas that truly multitask. </p>



<p>Think moisturizers packed with active ingredients that can replace toners and serums. R29 recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmajor-fade-active-seal-dark-spot-vitamin-c-gel-moisturizer-P510561"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Idriss Major Fade Active Seal Moisturizer</a>, which features brightening vitamin C and eliminates the need for a dedicated serum. Also worth trying are <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuperactive-mattifying-oil-pore-control-moisturizer-spf-50-pimprod2050402%3Fsku%3D2635510"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Murad Superactive Mattifying Oil + Pore Control Moisturizer SPF 50</a>, a high-factor SPF with oil-reducing niacinamide, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbyoma-blemish-acne-control-moisturizer-1-69-fl-oz%2F-%2FA-94468812"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Byoma Blemish Acne Control Moisturizer</a>, which uses salicylic acid to prevent new breakouts while providing deep hydration. </p>



<p>Park says that minimalism isn’t about doing less for your skin. “It’s about guiltlessly skipping what doesn’t matter and prioritizing what does.”  </p>

<p>Winter is usually a time for hunkering down and doing the least, but not for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/05/11889465/hair-colour-money-saving-tips"">hair colorists </a>of the world, who have clearly been busy dreaming up all manner of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-color-trends-2025"">delicious shades</a> to see us through the cold spell in style. </p>

<p>In his recent cold-weather trend report, hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> predicted that muted mid — essentially “soft, neutral-warm shades that sit between blonde, brunette, and copper” — will reign supreme. “It’s a fusion of all the recent trends, but intentionally subtle and noncommittal,” says Smith. Think Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Madelaine Petsch — or content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsFPXUNEPd/?hl=en"">Zoe Hayes</a> here. Shades like this are low-maintenance, versatile, and chic, adds Smith. “Simply ask for a natural earthy undertone to your shade of choice and maintain it with glossing treatments to keep the finish refined and the color looking shiny and intentional.” We swear by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss"">Glaze’s Supergloss</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"">Sean Michael</a>, a Boston-based balayage specialist and owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, identifies “cherry cola brunette” as the brooding shade to watch this winter. “It’s all thanks to the rich depth and understated hint of cherry tone,” explains Michael, much like this shade on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMYY3uhofIy/?img_index=1"">Alice x T</a>. “It gives dark hair a moody, polished glow without tipping into a full red, making it a great choice for brunettes who want something new.” Fortunately, cherry cola brunette suits everyone. “Ask your stylist for a deep brunette base enhanced with soft violet-red lowlights or a cherry-toned gloss to create that cola-inspired richness,” advises Michael.</p>

<p>“Honey butter blonde is poised to dominate winter because warm, creamy shades are finally taking the spotlight again,” says Michael. This shade is defined by a “soft candlelit glow” that adds brightness and shine to hair during an otherwise moody season. “To get the look, ask your colorist for a warm-neutral blonde with subtle golden dimension and a glossy finish to enhance that buttery warmth,” Michael says.

<p>In his trend report, Smith describes gothic brunette as an “ultra-dark, almost inky brunette with intense depth and shine,” like this color posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DROY7h_Ebg4/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a>. This shade works best for those with a naturally dark base, he explains, suggesting you ask your colorist for an espresso- or black cherry-toned gloss to take your natural color a shade or two deeper. The darker the hair, the glossier it appears as it catches the light. Look to Margaret Qualley, Kendall Jenner, and Nicola Peltz Beckham for inspiration.</p>

<p>Gonzalez pinpoints golden strawberry blonde as the hair color to watch, thanks to its luminosity and sunshine vibes — something we seriously lack in the drab winter months. “This shade combines the brightness of blonde with copper warmth, creating a glowing look that feels fresh,” explains Gonzalez, adding that it’s great for blondes who want warmth and depth, or brunettes ready to go a little lighter. “Just ask for a warm honey base with golden copper undertones or face-framing pieces,” says Gonzalez.

<p>“This hair color technique involves low-commitment demi-permanent glosses that deepen your natural base by one or two levels, while keeping your existing highlights visible,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treehousehair/?hl=en"">Travis Ogletree</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.moroccanoil.com%2F"">Moroccanoil</a> colorist ambassador. He notes that many of his clients flirt with the idea of going darker but don’t want to lose the effortless, lived-in dimension they’ve built. “An all-over gloss is the perfect middle ground,” says Ogletree. “It adds shine, tone, and depth without feeling heavy.” In the salon, Ogletree reaches for the <a href=""https://moroccanoilprofessionals.com/products/color-calypso-demi-permanent-gloss-cream/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Moroccanoil Color Calypso Demi-Permanent Color</a>. “The Gloss and Cream options are both perfect for this.” Look to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-ytYcDZbg/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rachel Redd</a>’s post on Instagram for inspiration. </p>

<p>“At some point, most of us have said that our hair looked its best when we were kids,” says Ogletree, “so ‘born blonde’ is more of an ideology than a trend because it’s based on what naturally suited you — whether that was bright blonde, sandy tones, or soft pops on the ends.” All you need to do? Bring in a photo of yourself as a child. “Those small details help your stylist recreate a version that feels authentic and flattering,” says Ogletree, who turns to Moroccanoil’s Blonde Voyage portfolio of lighteners, specifically Clay and Cream, to lighten clients’ hair. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPo9gyigrgF/?hl=en"">Marco Gilento</a> nails this shade here.</p>

<p>Schwartz describes light suede blonde as a “luminous,” bright shade that frames the face and adds soft depth through the lengths — think of the way a suede bag subtly glistens in winter sun. “It’s setting the tone for one of the season’s most coveted blondes,” he says.

<p>Michael touts this earthier shade as a “cool-neutral blend” that adds dimension and gives brunette hair an expensive look — much like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGuKJk4v6TN/"">this creation by @a_knack_yuna</a>. It’s all about the soft, smoky gradient, Michael says. “This flatters a wide range of skin tones and grows out seamlessly, making it perfect for anyone who wants low-maintenance color that still feels modern.” Michael recommends asking your colorist for a neutral brunette base with ashy balayage throughout. “This will create that seamless mocha-toned transition,” he says.</p>

<p>This hair color trend draws from eras past. “It’s a honeyed but muted blonde that feels retro and nostalgic, yet still fresh,” says Smith in his trend report. Perfect for colder months, it adds a subtle warmth. “This works best for natural blondes or brunettes looking to add warmth in a mature, elegant way while keeping depth and medium contrast,” he explains. Smith recommends asking your colorist for a “muted golden balayage” or a warm gloss after highlights to bring richness back into your strands.

<p>Greige occupies a cozy space between grey and beige, says Smith, adding, “It honors natural silver while brightening and warming the complexion.” Greige is a perfect middle ground for those who want to embrace, rather than cover, their natural hair, he notes, while the added richness from blonde highlights keeps it feeling fresh and dimensional.

<p>“Muted blonde sits between bright blonde and light brunette,” says Gonzalez. “Think soft beige, sandy, or mushroom shades of blonde rather than high-lift platinum. It balances warm and cool undertones for a gentle ‘lived-in’ effect.” If you have light-to-medium blonde hair or light brown lengths and want to soften your color a bit, Gonzalez says a simple salon gloss can get you there. This color by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFehTNpzQbw/?hl=en"">Diane Gorgievski</a> is stunning.</p>

When the leaves have left the trees, the air turns cold and misty, and the temperature stays 50 degrees (or below), there’s only one thing to do. Tuck yourself under a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-season-essentials-editors-picks"">toasty blanket</a> for as long as socially acceptable with a collection of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">comfort movies</a> right by your side.<br /><br />There’s no shortage of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/217808/christmas-movie-tropes"">good Christmas films</a>. Classics like <em>Elf </em>or <em>Rudolph: Red Nose Reindeer </em>are perfect comedies and low-stakes dramas to watch with your friends and families. But they’re not the most snug and soul-warming flicks out there. Yes, they’re all about the holiday cheer (which is an element of coziness), but they’re more funny and entertaining than anything. <br /><br />No, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/163987/best-feel-good-movies"">perfect cozy film</a> has a story that’ll tug at your heartstrings but will also make you ugly laugh. <br /><br />To ease your quest for the coziest film, we searched far and wide (aka the libraries of most major streaming services) for the best cozy movies the internet has to offer this holiday season. Some are new, some are oldies but goodies; some have absolutely nothing to do with the holidays at all. Regardless, these are the most heartwarming films to watch by yourself (or with friends and family) on the sofa by the crackling fire with a cup of cocoa and a tray of Snickerdoodles.  Merry streaming.  <figure><figcaption><strong><em><h2>The Wrong Paris (2025)</h2></em></strong><em>The Wrong Paris</em> makes for the ultimate comfort movie when you’re over holiday movies but still want that feel-good buzz. On the surface, it’s a breezy Netflix rom-com about Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), an aspiring artist who joins a Bachelor-style reality show thinking she’s headed to Paris, France — only to land in Paris, Texas instead, thanks to an outrageous producer twist. What follows is a lighthearted mix of reality-show antics, cowboy charm (hello, Trey, played by Pierson Fodé), and the kind of predictable but satisfying romantic beats that make you sigh with relief rather than eye-roll with exhaustion.<br /><br /><strong>Stream it on <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81700163"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Netflix</a></strong>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><strong><em>The Best Man Holiday</em> (2013)</strong></h2><br /> <br />A rare sequel that’s better than the original, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sanaa-lathan-interview"">The Best Man Holiday</a> </em>is a must-watch every holiday season (though, we argue it’s a great film to watch all year round). Similar to its predecessor, it follows a group of college friends gathering again, this time for the holidays. But unlike the first film where secrets stayed hidden and buried, everything is out in the open this go-around and past hurts and old resentments threaten the holiday cheer. Watch this for the laughs, the cries, and the fuzzy feels. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.7f4b0fc9-c7e1-4ce2-8fd9-1f0239de8d27?autoplay=0&amp;ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Home Alone (1990)</em></h2><br /><br />John Hughes, the mind behind <em>Ferris Buller’s Day Off</em>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/breakfast-club-30th-anniversary"">The Breakfast Club</a></em>, <em>Pretty in Pin</em>k, etc., also did big with this 1990 flick. The classic holiday movie, which made Macaulay Culkin’s scream an iconic staple imitated by kids everywhere, may be more than 30 years old, but you’ll never get tired of it because it has *literally* everything you want from a cozy film.

There’s something nostalgic about watching little kids in their onesies, drinking cocoa, anxious to meet Saint Nick. It makes you think of simpler times, when you used to be that age full of wonder, innocence, and excitement. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.max.com/movies/f98c234d-660a-417e-9732-0d920d4b40f8""><strong>Max</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""https://www.hulu.com/watch/cfaafa9b-a8e0-4d0a-88bd-c3fecfbf695b""><strong>Hulu</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.71df62ca-d7a1-4626-aa07-27836d37e8d9""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Last Holiday (2006) </em></h2><br /><br />Who’d thought a film about a terminally ill woman jet-setting to Europe for one last hoorah would be one of the coziest films ever? (Lol, not us.) Sure, the movie’s synopsis doesn’t give warm and fuzzy vibes, but thanks to Queen Latifah’s performance as Georgia Byrd, and a witty screenplay, <em>Last Holiday</em> is a charming and sentimental tale about taking control of your own destiny and living life to its fullest.

In this 1989 film starring rom-com queen Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, we follow the titular Harry and Sally over a decade as they bounce from strangers to friends to enemies (it’s complicated, okay??) and finally lovers.

The movie, which was executive produced by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10660833/selena-gomez-only-murders-in-the-building-true-crime"">Selena Gomez</a>, is about a 20-something gallery assistant who turns people’s trinkets from past relationships into an art display. And it nails the heart-warming genre’s heart-warming formula without being an unpleasant copycat. Although you’ll likely be able to predict what happens, it’s well made, enjoyable to watch and there’s genuine chemistry between the two leads, Dacre Montgomery and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/195644/blockers-movie-oral-sex-scene-geraldine-viswanathan"">Geraldine Viswanathan</a>, who gives a star-making performance. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on <a href=""https://www.starz.com/us/en/movies/the-broken-hearts-gallery-61143?ref=googlewatch"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">STARZ</a>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Julie &amp; Julia</em> (2009)</h2><br /><br />There’s something about the powerhouse combo of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10220252/new-meryl-streep-movies-netflix-hbo"">Meryl Streep</a> and Stanley Tucci that is so damn comfy, because in any world they inhabit nothing bad could ever happen.

The flick is sweet, funny, has that old-school rom-com feel (but is still modern), and gets major bonus points for being inspired by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9580483/jane-austen-movies-streaming"">Jane Austen</a>’s <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. It may seem odd watching a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/06/110969/summer-love-romance-movies-ranked"">summery movie</a> during the holidays, but we promise it hits all the cozy flick criteria. <br /> <br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.hulu.com/movie/fire-island-c2abb64a-bf06-48fa-8465-c0958e2b8ecd""><strong>Hulu</strong></a><strong>. </strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><strong><em>Paddington 2</em></strong> (2017)</h2><br /><br /><em>Paddington 2</em> is one of the greatest and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sad-romantic-movies-that-make-you-cry"">coziest films</a> of all time — sorry, we don’t make the rules!

But it’s also beautifully enthralling and full of life; when the families bicker on screen, you’re transported to your own minor table-side <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/11/10186923/thanksgiving-family-drama-tips"">family drama</a>, and isn’t that what the holidays are about? <br /><br /><strong>Stream it </strong><a href=""https://www.showtime.com/#play/3516378""><strong>on Showtime</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=""https://www.hulu.com/movie/moonstruck-2bb44ed1-e4a5-4730-8c03-39efc39a0e47""><strong>Hulu with a Showtime subscription</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?
