<p>Cities bring together the best and worst of the human condition. They concentrate opportunities for work, social networks, and cultural production, but they also expose deep social inequalities. Among the many forms of urban exclusion are limited access to transportation, housing, leisure, or safety issues. One form that is rarely discussed is thermal inequality. In lower-income neighborhoods, where there are fewer trees, parks, and permeable surfaces, heat accumulates and thermal discomfort dominates, resulting in higher energy consumption and health risks. As concern about the climate crisis grows, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031146/heat-resilient-design-how-city-leaders-use-building-materials-to-fight-urban-heat"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">this discussion becomes more urgent</a>: extreme heat is no longer just a climatic phenomenon but also a spatial expression of inequality.</p>",

It is not a foreign object, but a fragment of the mountain, a inhabited sculpture that breathes with the same cadence as the forest.

Perhaps, just like me, you’ve searched the internet for different sources about the Gestalt principles and found that there are many, each slightly different from the others. That’s why I decided to bring several of them together, analyze and group them, and highlight the fundamental ones, the core laws that we, as designers, can confidently rely on when creating our work.</p><p>But let’s start from the beginning, where these principles came from, and why they are, in fact, more of a science than just an observation.</p><h3>The History of Gestalt Principles</h3><p>Gestalt psychology emerged in Germany at the very beginning of the 20th century as a response to the then-dominant, and in fact the first, school of psychology — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)"">Structuralism</a>. Structuralism viewed consciousness as something that could be deconstructed into individual elements: sensations, images, and feelings; to understand how the mind is built from its smallest parts.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with glasses, a full beard, and a serious expression, wearing a suit and white collar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/274/0*StoYieZSdCa2uo0p.jpg"" /><figcaption>Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927) is founder of Structuralism — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener#/media/File:Edward_B._Titchener.jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology"">Gestalt psychology</a>, on the other hand, saw perception as an inherently holistic process: our consciousness emerges from the organization of those parts into meaningful wholes, but unlike structuralism, it does not attempt to view perception as the sum of its parts.</p><p>Where structuralism tried to analyze the structure of experience, Gestalt focused on the patterns that give experience its unity and sense.</p><p>The Gestalt principles we use in design today were first studied in their earliest form by Gestalt psychology founders <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer"">Max Wertheimer</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_K%C3%B6hler"">Wolfgang Köhler</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka"">Kurt Koffka</a>. They explored and expanded upon each other’s work on how the human brain perceives visual images not as a collection of separate elements, but as unified, structured wholes. That’s where the term “Gestalt” comes from — the German word for “form” or “structure.”</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with a beard and receding hairline, wearing a dark coat and posing with arms crossed against a dark background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/0*-7bNwJ1VdkNU9UIm.jpg"" /><figcaption>Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer#/media/File:Max_Werheimer_(1880-1943).jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The main idea was that the mind automatically organizes sensory information into meaningful forms, even when parts of the data are missing or distorted. Because of the growing popularity of psychology in the early days of marketing, these principles quickly became the foundation for understanding composition, object grouping, and visual hierarchy, concepts we still actively apply in interface design today.</p><p>Over the past hundred years, countless interpretations and variations of these laws and principles have been written and discussed. Originally, Max Wertheimer identified only nine principles, which he didn’t even call <em>“principles”</em> at the time. He referred to them as <em>“factors”</em> that determine how humans perceive groups of objects. It was only later that these factors were reformulated and became known as the Gestalt principles.</p><h3><strong>Why Gestalt is more than just observation</strong></h3><p>What made Gestalt psychology truly revolutionary was that it proved its claims through controlled experiments, not just philosophical speculation or introspection.</p><p>Max Wertheimer’s study of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon"">phi phenomenon</a> was among the first to show that the mind can perceive movement where none exists: two still images flashing in sequence were seen as continuous motion. This finding demonstrated that perception is an active process of construction, not passive reception. And it is this principle that underlies animation and cinema, as well as, the transitions we create in design.</p><figure><img alt=""A sequence of twelve black-and-white photographs showing a horse and rider in motion, illustrating the phases of a gallop, with grid lines and the title “The Horse in Motion” by Eadweard Muybridge."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*70V1TnUbPL5pk-D1.jpg"" /><figcaption>The Horse in Motion by Eadweard Muybridge — <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57260211"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Wolfgang Köhler’s <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">experiments with apes</a> later reinforced the idea of grouping. Chimpanzees were placed in situations where food was visible but out of reach. Instead of relying on random trial and error, they would suddenly grasp how to combine available objects, for example stacking boxes or using a stick to solve the problem. Köhler called this moment of sudden understanding insight.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo showing chimpanzees in an enclosure, with one climbing onto boxes and reaching upward toward an object while others look on or raise their arms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/297/0*0Y1c0R3E0iZWFs0I.JPG"" /><figcaption>Photo from The Mentality of Apes — <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>That is precisely what happens in great UX. When an interface is well-designed, users don’t have to memorize steps or instructions; they see how things fit together. Their mental model of the system reorganizes itself into something coherent and intuitive. Good design, like Köhler’s insight, doesn’t teach but reveals.</p><p>Together, these and other first studies gave Gestalt psychology an empirical foundation, transforming it from a set of visual curiosities into one of the earliest scientifically validated theories of perception.</p><h3>Our focus for today</h3><p>For this article, we’ll focus on three modern interpretations of these principles, and original paper of Max Wertheimer, <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wertheimer/Forms/forms.htm""><em>Laws of Organization in Perceptual Forms</em></a>. Our other reference sources for today are:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles""><em>What are the Gestalt Principles?</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Interaction Design Foundation </strong>(12 principles)<strong> </strong>is an excellent and by far the most comprehensive list I’ve come across, complete with clear examples not only through abstract visuals but also real interface designs. The article presents these principles in a more academic yet design-focused way, linking them directly to design thinking and practical application.</li><li><a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/gestalt-principles/""><em>What are the Gestalt Principles?</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Figma </strong>(11 principles) offers a concise yet accurate definition of the principles, with a strong focus on their visual aspect, without delving deeply into how they’re applied in UX contexts.</li><li><a href=""https://maze.co/blog/gestalt-principles/""><em>Gestalt Principles: A Guide to the Psychology Behind Stellar UX</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Maze </strong>(10 principles)<strong> </strong>is a wonderful and engaging interpretation, featuring highly memorable abstract examples alongside a dedicated section that demonstrates how these principles manifest directly in interface design.</li></ul><p>I’ve noticed that the number of Gestalt principles often varies across different sources, ranging anywhere from six to twelve. By combining and comparing all four of the sources, I’ve distilled 16 Gestalt principles, which I’ve grouped into three distinct categories. It’s important to note that these are not all existing Gestalt principles interpretations but rather the ones most commonly found and applied within the information-driven UI/UX design context.</p><h3>Basic Gestalt principles of grouping</h3><p>These principles, in one form or another, appear across all four sources — with only minor variations in interpretation.</p><h4><strong>Proximity</strong></h4><p>Elements that are placed close to each other are perceived as related.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJjgVzM1J_PNh5PESqGlYA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles form a group because they are evenly spaced and positioned close to one another, while three other circles are set apart and do not visually belong to any group.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Two buttons in a modal window appear as one group, whereas a separate button stands visually independent from them. We can use this principle to categorize actions for example, the button on the left might <em>close</em> or <em>cancel</em> the modal, while the grouped buttons on the right could represent <em>Save</em> and <em>Delete</em>. In the first case, the user does not affect the content; in the second, either action directly modifies the information.</p><h4><strong>Similarity</strong></h4><p>Objects that share similar color, shape, or size are perceived as belonging to the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A9NOIvnyctmytyOMIqp8vg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles filled with a more saturated color stand out from the rest of the elements and are perceived as a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We apply this principle in UI design, for example, with CTAs in most apps or websites, all primary buttons share the same color and size, helping users instantly recognize them as elements of the same functional group.</p><h4><strong>Common fate</strong></h4><p>Elements that move in the same direction or manner are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BvA0wbiXYlDxtFQ3XugkKg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> If we imagine the circles in motion, the two central circles moving together would naturally be perceived as belonging to a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> A simple example of this is animated partner logos that automatically scroll in the same direction. They share a common movement, or quite literally, a common fate.</p><h4><strong>Continuity (or Continuation)</strong></h4><p>Our eyes naturally tend to follow a <strong>line or a directional flow</strong> when one is perceived.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0zYmJjKQlWQCk0rhmuuP7g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We don’t see ten separate circles placed on the image. We see a smooth curved line formed by those circles.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In this example, I removed the background from the navigation bar used in the <em>Similarity</em> example to show that we still perceive these elements as one continuous unit. Our visual system instinctively connects objects into lines or paths whenever possible.</p><h4><strong>Closure (Reification)</strong></h4><p>Our brain tends to perceive complete, unified shapes even when parts of them are missing.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4HwUUchtbiTxvOYDPOQGAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even if we “cut out” straight segments from a circle, we’ll still perceive it as a circle, our mind automatically fills in the gaps.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> This principle allows us to create elements using dotted or dashed outlines, such as drop zones for uploadsor outlined buttons, which the user still recognizes as complete, interactive shapes.</p><h4><strong>Symmetry and order</strong></h4><p>Symmetrical objects are naturally perceived as part of the same group. Symmetry also creates a sense of stability, balance, and harmony.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VLTiAhg5659nDeftcFR6Og.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two groups of elements are arranged symmetrically and are perceived as belonging together.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my example, we automatically perceive the symmetrically aligned navigation items as a unified group. Menu points that are all assumed to be clickable in this context.</p><h4><strong>Parallelism</strong></h4><p>Elements that are positioned parallel to each other are perceived as related or part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*llo-sPWpyVBYlnr8jwdMgQ.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four lines made up of circles are perceived as two distinct groups of objects. It’s partly due to this very principle.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Navigation menus often contain quite large elements with many items. In this case, we perceive three groups of elements within a dropdown menu because they’re arranged parallel to one another and perpendicular to the main navigation. This layout makes scanning much easier for the user than, for example, displaying one long list or aligning all items parallel to the main navigation, as often happens in secondary menus.</p><h4><strong>Common Region / Shared Area</strong></h4><p>Elements placed within the same visual container or area are perceived as a single group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hbTi5l2oLWebGotZjvcoA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even though all small circles are evenly spaced, we perceive them as two separate groups because they are enclosed within different areas.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Buttons inside a modal window are perceived as part of the same group, while a navigation button (even if it has the same visual weight and is positioned on the same level) is perceived as belonging to another group, simply because it’s outside that shared visual region.</p><h4><strong>Prägnanz (Simplicity)</strong></h4><p>The brain tends to perceive simple, concise, and stable forms first.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9m5_JWItTB5yhbkE9G1T6A.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the complex shape created using multiple circles and a glass-like effect, we primarily perceive it as one large circle.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We structure page content into blocks because it makes scanning easier for the user. Instead of focusing on individual letters or images, the user first perceives the overall block structure. In my example, you can see a schematic of a video streaming page, where we instinctively recognize the main sections: navigation, video, recommendations, and description.</p><h4><strong>Focal point</strong></h4><p>An element that contrasts with its surroundings is the first to capture attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyuSSw1LRepf8xfTLSuYsw.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A white circle stands out against the background of all other circles and becomes the primary focal element.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my example, there are two elements that contrast with the rest of the interface: the button and the hero image.</p><p>Contrast in UI isn’t defined by color alone; it’s important to remember that color itself has three attributes: Hue, Saturation, and Value/Brightness, each of which can influence perception differently. By adjusting any of these, you can shift the focal point of the design.</p><p>We can also create contrast through size and shape, as demonstrated by the hero image example.</p><h4><strong>Figure-Ground</strong></h4><p>We distinguish an object based on its contrast with the background.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uP7GsMzObz6J5VNISN7_kg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>Our brain constantly tries to interpret two-dimensional images as three-dimensional scenes. Almost all modern sources reference the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase""><em>Rubin’s Vase</em> </a>optical illusion since Edgar Rubin’s research greatly influenced Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka, who were working on similar visual phenomena at the time.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, however, I decided to use simpler shapes to illustrate how our perception tends to arrange objects spatially. For instance, in a <strong>reversible/unstable</strong> type example, two semi-transparent circles overlap and whichever one you focus on appears to be in the foreground. But when one of the shapes becomes opaque, the perception becomes <strong>stable</strong>, because we can clearly identify which element is in front and which is behind.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my interface example, you can see list items that share the same background color as the page itself but stand out due to shadows. We often apply this same principle in modal windows, where the background is darkened to visually separate the active layer from the rest of the interface.</p><h4><strong>Connectedness</strong></h4><p>Elements that are visually connected are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gIe7bK8PVsFwLiGyStiSEg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, you see sixteen circles and it’s easy to identify eight of them as belonging to the same group because they are physically connected by a line.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In design, we often apply this principle in steppers, forms, or as in my example in informational blocks that illustrate the stages of a process or present step-by-step instructions.</p><h3>How it actually works</h3><p>It’s also important to note that each of these principles can and often does work in combination with others. Even the simplest element, like a hyperlink, can serve as an example of a <strong>multimodal Gestalt</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Image demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CYrVDvlzy6LqCit1afzeUg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>In this example, several principles operate simultaneously, reinforcing one another:</p><ul><li><strong>Connectedness provides structure.</strong> The underline creates a visual link between all letters and elements.

Our gaze naturally flows from left to right, allowing us to read line by line.</li><li>A stable <strong>Figure–ground relationship ensures clear contrast</strong> between text and background, making the content both visible and readable.</li></ul><p>And you’ve probably also seen the classic example of guiding the user’s attention through the text.</p><figure><img alt=""Image demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vAJbUuzoxmSxBqhU2pEcUw.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>Even with a minimal set of tools, we can direct our user’s focus by applying the basic laws of Gestalt: Proximity, Continuity, Focal point and Simplicity.</p><h3>Gestalt psychology of perceptual interpretation</h3><p>You’ll find these three principles only in the Interaction Design Foundation’s list (out of our four main sources). And while they can be incredibly valuable and relevant for us as designers, they’re often left out of other summaries likely because they don’t deal with how we group elements, but rather with how we perceive and interpret entire visual compositions.</p><p>I’d also like to note that these principles partially overlap with some of the ones we’ve already discussed. Still, there are important differences between them though that’s probably a topic deserving its own separate article.</p><h4><strong>Emergence</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illusion demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gpK5M3OYrEt-Wrdc.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles""><em>© Interaction Design Foundation</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>We perceive the overall shape before noticing the details.

We often encounter this principle in typography: no matter which typeface we choose, we can usually still read and understand the characters, unless the font becomes extremely stylized or abstract.</p><h3>The archaic roots of Gestalt principles</h3><h4><strong>Familiarity / Past Experience</strong></h4><p>The brain groups or interprets elements because it remembers the context in which they were previously encountered.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that even Max Wertheimer mentioned this principle in a special context, emphasizing that it’s not a primary law of organization, but rather a secondary factor that <em>can </em>influence perception.</p><blockquote>In some cases, past experience or familiarity may influence the perception of organization, but the primary laws of grouping remain independent of experience.</blockquote><blockquote>— Wertheimer, 1923</blockquote><p>For us as designers, “Familiarity” is not really a law of perception in its simplest interpretation, it aligns more closely with one of Jakob Nielsen’s <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">heuristic design principles</a>. In more complex frameworks, it becomes part of cognitive psychology, connecting to concepts such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model""><em>Mental model</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance""><em>Affordance</em></a>.</p><h3>Gestalt principles as the grammar of visual design</h3><p>Let’s imagine interface design as a language. If color defines the tone of our message, Gestalt principles define its structure.</p><p>A designer who understands how the human brain groups, aligns, and interprets visual elements doesn’t just make things “look good” but builds meaning. Gestalt is what transforms shapes into hierarchy and flow.</p><p>These principles aren’t theories to debate. They became laws of perception we can rely on with confidence. But there’s always room to explore their interpretations and to experiment with how these principles interact, overlap, and sometimes even contradict one another.</p><p>That’s why I encourage everyone who cares about users and about design as a craft to keep experimenting with the old and exploring the new in the pursuit of creating truly delightful and unique design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c34d6772fc36"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/patterns-your-brain-cant-unsee-gestalt-psychology-in-design-c34d6772fc36"">Patterns your brain can’t unsee: Gestalt psychology in design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How to get production-ready code from AI by structuring Figma file, connecting your design system with Figma MCP, and writing better prompts.</h4><figure><img alt=""Overview of components like toggle, badges, buttons, data visualisation cards, forms and page header from Ivy Design System"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4ecR3i5SgK488SMg3drtIA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, overview of Ivy Design System components</figcaption></figure><p>Right, pull up a chair, grab your coffee. We need to talk about the new team member. They’re brilliant, frankly, work all hours and can write boilerplate code in their sleep. They’re also a bit… literal. This new team member is an AI agent, and it’s changing how we go from design to code.</p><p>But here’s the reality check as <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s recent AI report</a> ↗ found that while 68% of developers are using AI to write code, only 32% actually trust the output. The problem isn’t the AI’s ability to write code, it’s the AI’s ability to understand context.</p><p>Now, we could spend a whole other coffee chat talking about how brilliant AI is for spinning up quick interactive prototypes for stakeholders and testing. And, indeed, it’s a valid way to work. But to grow trust in AI to write real, production-ready code, we have to <strong>give it clean data with clear context to work with in the first place.</strong></p><p>So, how does this happen? Until recently, we could only give an AI a screenshot and hope for the best. That’s changing with something called the <a href=""https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> ↗. Think of the new Figma MCP server as an interpreter for your Figma files that sends rich, structured information to the LLM. The process looks simple: Figma file → Figma MCP → LLM. But for it to work, every step needs to be packed with meaning. <strong>Simply throwing a prompt and a Figma link at an AI agent and hoping for the best is not going to work.</strong></p><h3>Build foundation in Figma</h3><p>The foundation of any good design-to-code workflow, whether for a human or an AI, is a Figma file that clearly communicates its own intent. Every decision you make in how you structure your file can either bring clarity or create confusion.</p><p>First things first, master your <strong>structure hygiene</strong>. An AI reads your layer tree to understand your design’s structure, so a messy tree leads to a messy DOM. Name everything with purpose. Instead of <em>Frame 74</em>, use names that describe what something <em>is</em> or what it <em>does</em>, like <em>CreateProjectModal</em> or <em>ProjectForm</em>. This directly influences the names of the components and elements the AI generates. While you’re at it, try to keep your structure as flat as possible. Avoid deep, unnecessary nesting. If a group isn’t serving a specific layout purpose, get rid of it. A flatter hierarchy is simply easier for everyone to understand.</p><figure><img alt=""A before-and-after comparison of a Figma layers panel, showing a messy structure with generic names like ‘Frame 79’ being replaced by a clean, semantic structure with names like ‘ProjectForm’ and ‘Group-DateRange"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*81rdmmTMHIezX1y46fuLag.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, showing the improvement from generic layer structure to a clean, semantically-named one</figcaption></figure><p>Next<strong> think and build components like a developer </strong>defining their API. Your layer order should reflect the visual hierarchy or, for the web, the DOM order. This is a massive help for accessibility and logical code output.</p><ul><li>Use variants for states like <em>State: Default | Hover | Disabled</em>. This maps directly to CSS pseudo-classes or state props.</li><li>Use a boolean property (Icon: True | False) to show or hide an element. It’s cleaner than separate variants and translates perfectly to a prop like <em>showIcon={true}</em>.</li><li><strong>Use the </strong><a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35794667554839-What-s-new-from-Schema-2025#h_01K84PB569NTFMXBDS36C8DCPV""><strong>new slots</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗<strong> feature from Figma to define flexible content areas.</strong> This is a massive improvement over simple instance swaps because it directly maps to the concept of “slots” or the children prop in code.</li></ul><p>Let’s be honest, <strong>Auto Layout</strong> should be your default for almost everything. It’s the clearest way to communicate layout intent. Use absolute positioning sparingly, keeping it for specific cases like notification badges or modal overlays. We’ve all seen the mess that older design-to-code tools made by sprinkling <em>position: absolute</em> everywhere.</p><p>Move beyond primitive names like <em>blue-500</em> and embrace <strong>semantic tokens</strong> that describe purpose. For example, <em>color-button-background-brand</em> tells the AI not just what color this is, but <em>why</em> it exists. This tells the AI <em>why</em> this color exists. <strong>For a masterclass on this, check out t</strong><a href=""https://medium.com/design-systems-collective/when-semantic-tokens-are-no-longer-semantic-d65ef16fadd7""><strong>he article series by Nate Baldwin</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic explaining semantic design tokens.

An AI should consume your existing components, not generate new ones. Without a direct link to your codebase, the AI relies on inaccurate searches that result in redundant code. Tools like <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/code-connect-integration/"">Figma’s Code Connect </a>↗ or third-party integrations with Storybook create this essential link, turning your Figma components into pointers to the real components in your repository.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Code Connect UI feature linking a Figma component to its corresponding React code.

Image from the <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/code-connect/code-connect-ui-setup/"">official Figma developer documentation</a></figcaption></figure><h4>But what if you don’t have a codebase yet?</h4><p>You can absolutely use these tools without a connected codebase. The AI will analyze your Figma file and generate new code from scratch that is great for quick prototypes or iterating on ideas. However, understand the trade-offs: you get generated code, not system code; it’s less efficient; and it <strong>creates technical debt that a developer will have to refactor later</strong>.</p><p>A practical middle ground is to <strong>use the AI to create a “scaffold.</strong>” Let it generate the initial components, then treat that output as the first version of your design system’s codebase. From there, you refine it, connect it back to Figma, and build a sustainable system.</p><h3>Extra: The ultimate source of truth with components as data</h3><p>The ultimate source of truth is defining components as structured data (JSON), not as Figma drawings. For a deeper dive into this architectural approach, <a href=""https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis/components-as-data-2be178777f21""><strong>Nathan Curtis’ article “Components as Data”</strong></a> ↗ is an essential read. LLMs thrive on structured data, whereas the standard MCP workflow provides an <em>“incomplete and imprecise”</em> interpretation of your visual design. Tools like the <a href=""https://www.anova.design/""><strong>Anova plugin for Figma</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗ can help you get started. This data-first approach is the future of building AI-ready design systems.</p><h3>Give your AI a “cheat sheet”</h3><p>Whether you’re connecting to code or defining components as data, you still need to guide the AI’s behavior. This involves two skills: writing better prompts and creating a set of rules for the AI to follow. On more in-depth</p><h4>Write context-rich prompts</h4><p>Your prompt is your direct instruction. The more specific, the better.</p><ul><li><strong>Instead of:</strong> “Make this a component.”</li><li><strong>Try:</strong> “Generate a React component for the selected frame using our design system library. Place the new file in src/components/ui/ and name it PricingCard.tsx.”</li></ul><p><strong>Split your work into consumable bites</strong>: the nav bar, then the sidebar, then a content card. If you give them too much at once, AI agents can “choke” on the context and create a mess. Build your UI gradually.</p><h4>Set custom rules</h4><p>While one-off prompts are great for specific tasks, the real power comes from creating a permanent “cheat sheet” that the AI can reference every single time.</p><p>In your project root, create a dedicated folder like <em>.docs/</em> or <em>.ai/.</em> Inside, create your three core rules files: <em>README.md</em> file (for foundational rules), <em>design-system-rules.md</em> (for how to use our components), <em>figma-mcp-rules.md</em> (for the specific Figma MCP workflow).</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Cursor IDE with project structure and particularly dedicated folder for AI rules that incudes README.md, design-system-rules.md, figma-mcp-rules.md files.

It defines the core tech stack and file structure, and most importantly, it instructs the AI to use the other two files as part of its context.</p><pre># AI Coding Guidelines: <br />This repo uses Figma MCP. For instructions, for styles, mappings and design of components you MUST read and strictly apply the rules from all three of the following files:<br />1.  This `README.md` file (for foundational rules).<br />2.  `design-system-rules.md` (for how to use our components).<br />3.  `figma-mcp-rules.md` (for the specific Figma-to-code process).---<br />## Core Principles &amp; Best Practices<br />- Expert Persona: Act as an expert senior frontend developer writing clean, accessible, and maintainable TypeScript and React.<br />- Accessibility: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.<br />- Performance: Optimize for performance. Code should have linear time/space complexity where possible.<br />- Testing: Suggest testable code.<br />---<br />## Core Technologies (React &amp; Tailwind)<br />- Framework: React<br />- Language: TypeScript<br />- Styling:Tailwind CSS, configured via `tailwind.config.js`.<br />---<br />## File Structure &amp; Naming Conventions<br />- Components: Place all new components in `src/components/`.<br />  - Reusable UI Primitives:`src/components/ui/` (e.g., Button, Input).<br />  - Feature-Specific Components: `src/components/feature/` (e.g., `UserProfileCard`).<br />- Component Files: Use PascalCase for filenames. Each component must be in its own folder. (e.g., `src/components/ui/Button/Button.tsx`)<br />- Hooks: Custom hooks go in `src/hooks/` and should be named with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useUserData.ts`).</pre><p><strong>design-system-rules.md<br /></strong>This is the detailed guide on how to correctly use your custom components from your-design-system.</p><pre># Design System Usage Rules<br />This document outlines how to correctly implement components and styles from `your-design-system`.<br />---<br />## Component Architecture &amp; Styling<br />- Design System First: Always use existing components from the `your-design-system` package. Do not rebuild them.<br />- Layout Primitives: Always use layout components from `your-design-system` (e.g., ``, ``). Do not use raw `div`s with custom flexbox CSS.<br />- Styling with Tokens: Use Tailwind utility classes that are configured in our `tailwind.config.js`. Prefer our custom theme utilities (e.g., `bg-brand-primary`) over default Tailwind colors.<br />- Icons: Use the `` component from `your-design-system`, passing the appropriate icon name. Do not import raw SVGs.<br />- Props: Component props must be defined with a TypeScript `interface`.<br />---<br />## What to Avoid<br />- No Hardcoded Values: Do not use hardcoded strings (use translation files), URLs (use config files), or styling values (use tokens).<br />- No Inconsistent Naming: Follow the project's naming conventions.<br />- No Ignoring Errors: Do not ignore TypeScript errors.<br />- No Unnecessary DOM: Avoid unnecessary `div` wrappers.</pre><p><strong>figma-mcp-rules.md<br /></strong>This file is a specific, process-oriented set of instructions for the AI to follow whenever it’s translating a design from Figma.</p><pre># Figma to Code Workflow Rules<br />When generating code from a Figma design, follow this specific process:<br />1.  Get Context First: Run `get_design_context` to fetch the structured representation of the Figma node.<br />2.  Get Visual Reference: Run `get_screenshot` for a visual reference.<br />3.  Implement: Only after you have both, begin implementation.<br />4.  Translate the MCP output (React + Tailwind) into our project's conventions, strictly following the rules defined in `README.md` and `design-system-rules.md`.<br />5.  Validate: Ensure the final UI has 1:1 visual parity with the Figma screenshot before completing.</pre><p>For a technical starting point, Figma’s developer documentation provides an excellent guide on how to <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/add-custom-rules/#example-prompt-to-generate-your-own-custom-rules""><strong>add custom rules</strong></a> ↗, including example prompts you can use to generate a baseline for these files.</p><h3>Putting it all together</h3><p>Feeling overwhelmed? Don’t be. Start small. Pick one component and make it “agent-ready.”</p><ol><li><strong>Name everything semantically:</strong> Are your layers and components named for their purpose?</li><li><strong>Use auto layout and variables:</strong> Is your design intent baked into the file?</li><li><strong>Annotate:</strong> Have you documented behaviors and states?</li><li><strong>*Connect your components (if possible) :</strong> Link every system component to its code counterpart.</li><li><strong>Write a simple rules file:</strong> Can you create a basic README.md to guide the AI?</li><li><strong>Prompt with generous context</strong></li></ol><p>The teams that do this groundwork now are building the foundation for a future where design and development are in a constant, seamless loop. By treating our design systems as living sources of truth for both humans <em>and</em> machines, we can finally spend less time on tedious translation and more time building what matters.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

<h4>Turns out, the more feelings in your text, the weirder it feels to let AI touch it.</h4><figure><img alt=""The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where each wooden plank is replaced with a silicon chip"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MV2D6JbcFgdCKayve-w0rw.png"" /><figcaption>The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where wooden planks are being replaced with silicon chips. Generated in Sora.</figcaption></figure><p>I use AI writing tools the way most people use spellcheck: casually, constantly, almost without thought. A typo here, a phrasing fix there, a quick “make it flow better.” Over time, it’s become second nature that I write <em>through</em> the machine.</p><p>And that’s not unusual. Grammarly alone reports over <strong>40 million users</strong>, across <strong>50 thousand organizations</strong> and <strong>96 percent of the Fortune 500</strong> (<a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/about"">source: Grammarly.com</a>). The habit has gone mainstream, invisible, automatic, and everywhere.</p><p>But every so often, I pause over a polished paragraph and feel an odd flicker of detachment. The words look like mine, sound like mine, but they’ve passed through <strong>someone else’s hands</strong>. Or circuits. Or whatever metaphor fits. How many edits does it take before the voice that returns isn’t me anymore?</p><p>It’s the Ship of Theseus. Turns out Greek mythology still works in 2025. Swapping planks on a ship is just the new metaphor for rewriting yourself through syntax. Each replaced plank a synonym, each tightened sentence a substitution, until the vessel of thought sails on. The ship, and the writing, are familiar in shape butforeign in soul.</p><p>And this anxiety about “losing your voice” didn’t arrive with ChatGPT. As others have noted, the fear of writing identity slipping away has circulated for years, long before AI became a default tool (see <a href=""https://medium.com/emma-identity/why-loss-of-writing-identity-is-a-myth-and-other-writing-debacles-85fda0b4b046"">Emma Identity’s 2017 essay</a> on textual fingerprints). What’s different now is how automated the erosion feels.</p><h4>A Family-and-Friends Field Test</h4><p>I wanted to understand that uneasy drift between “me” and “machine,” so I ran a small, human-scale test. A handful of volunteers, friends, family, and a few generous redditors who gave five minutes of their lives to a Qualtrics link joined in.</p><figure><img alt=""Flowchart showing participants providing three types of writing (casual text, essay paragraph, code snippet), sending each through an AI tool for ten iterative rewrites, and rating on a 1–7 scale how much the output still felt like “theirs.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ut4rB0gbseUm7BDETSYkoQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of the study procedure: participants wrote a casual text, an essay paragraph, and a code snippet, then passed each piece through an AI tool ten times and rated how much the rewritten text still felt like their own. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Each person worked across three familiar modes: a casual text, a short essay paragraph, and a code snippet. They wrote something genuine, then passed it through an AI writer of their choice ten times in a row. After each iteration, they rated it on a 1–7 scale: <strong>“How much is this still mine?”</strong></p><p>The survey itself ran on Qualtrics; I cleaned and visualized the data in R, using a simple mixed-effects model to trace how that sense of ownership decayed over time. Everyone consented, all responses were anonymized, and what’s shown here reflects only the aggregate picture.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tsdSUozOICLkG9w_oCeT-w.png"" /><figcaption>Perceived ownership steadily declines with each AI rewrite, dropping fastest for texting and slowest for code.</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out, the ownership ratings <strong>fell off a cliff</strong> around the third or fourth rewrite for texting and essay writing, but held surprisingly steady in code. A spline model (R, lme4, three-knot natural spline) showed the steepest drop early on: texting collapsed fastest, essays followed, code barely flinched.</p><p>By the numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Texting:</strong> sharpest drop of –1.4 points around iteration 3.</li><li><strong>Essay:</strong> a slower, smaller decline (–1.25 points near iteration 5).</li><li><strong>Code:</strong> almost no falloff (–0.3 points around iteration 4).</li></ul><p>When asked when their text felt “more AI than me” (below a 4 on the 1–7 scale), people hit that midpoint at <strong>iteration 3 for texting</strong>, <strong>iteration 7 for essays</strong>, and <strong>never</strong> for code.</p><p>This aligns with a broader cultural confusion around what “human-written” even looks like. As <a href=""https://alpace.medium.com/unless-it-was-written-by-ryan-holiday-it-was-probably-written-by-ai-0b7099516d98"">Aaron Pace</a> recently wrote, the more polished a piece of writing is, the more likely AI detectors are to label it “machine-made.” Today we see a strange modern reversal where professionalism now reads as artificial. My data shows the inverse feeling: the messier and more intimate the writing, the more its owner wants to keep machines out.</p><h4>What the Humans Said</h4><p>After the survey, I spoke with a few participants again, some over Zoom, some across a kitchen table. Their reactions lined up quite cleanly with the numbers. <strong>The more personal the writing, the more wrong it felt to let an AI touch it.</strong></p><p>When it came to texting, everyone hesitated. That space is messy and intimate. You’d use lowercase shorthand, inside jokes, typos, emojis that say more than syntax ever could. Watching an AI rewrite that kind of message felt invasive, like handing your phone to someone else mid-conversation.</p><p>Essay writing was easier to surrender. Participants said it felt “professional,” “detached,” something meant to be polished anyway. The AI’s edits felt like a second pair of eyes rather than a replacement of self.</p><p>And code, unless you were a computer science student who lives in it, wasn’t personal at all. In fact, most people said they <em>needed</em> AI to even get started, describing the help as “welcome,” “expected,” or “honestly, a relief.” For them, authorship was more functional than emotional. The machine wasn’t rewriting their voice, it was scaffolding their logic.</p><p>One person linked their experience to the idea of <strong>vibe coding</strong><em>, </em>which, as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">an IBM article described</a>, is <em>the emerging practice of writing code by talking to AI using natural language prompts instead of lines of syntax</em>. They acknowledged that software engineers often dismiss it as unserious, even lazy, but for them, it was liberating. As a non–computer science student, they said vibe coding made the process less intimidating and more creative.</p><p>It echoed something <a href=""https://medium.com/contemplate/chatgpt-grammarly-and-hemingway-walked-into-a-bar-de2fa481022f"">Jasmine McCandless</a> captured: people don’t pick the “best” writing tool, they pick the one that demands the least effort. But effort can manifest in many ways. And one of them is emotional risk. In my study, the more personal the writing, the more people resisted AI intervention. Once the task shifted into professional or functional territory, the comfort gap widened and AI quietly became the low-effort choice.</p><figure><img alt=""A person giving a robot directions on what to write"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7PDMmFtdCzfA4b_6caHVuA.png"" /><figcaption>Collaboration between a human writer and an AI assistant. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Takeaways for UX Design</h4><p>The tension here is becoming infrastructural. <a href=""https://epiren.medium.com/trust-verify-and-write-using-grammarlys-authorship-in-the-age-of-ai-1778e015dea0"">René Najera</a> recently wrote about Grammarly’s new Authorship feature, which records your keystrokes and generates a replay of how a document came together. Their point is simple: in an age of ubiquitous AI tools, writers now feel pressure not only to produce authentic work, but to <em>prove</em> they made it. My findings speak to the same impulse from the user side: authorship isn’t just who typed the words, but how much of the process still feels human, intentional, and personally owned.</p><p>Maybe the real product insight here is that Grammarly should just buy Copilot and call it a day. One interface to smooth every sentence, human or machine. Beneath the joke, though, is a deeper cue for design: people’s comfort with AI assistance scales with emotional distance.</p><p>Texting felt intimate, messy, and human. That’s where participants pulled back. They didn’t want the machine polishing what was meant to be personal. Essay writing lived in the middle zone, where improvement feels professional rather than invasive. Code, on the other hand, was almost depersonalized; help there felt efficient, not existential.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t to build less AI assistance. It’s to build <strong>context-aware</strong> assistance. In spaces where expression carries identity (e.g., messages, creative writing, voice) AI needs to step lightly, amplifying rather than rewriting. In functional spaces such as emails, documentation, and code, it can take the wheel without moral friction.</p><p>Designing for this gradient of intimacy means giving users <strong>control over how much authorship they’re willing to trade</strong>. The future of AI writing UX isn’t about raw capability. It’s about sensitivity: knowing when to finish your sentence, and when to leave your typos alone.</p><p>In practice, this could look like:</p><ul><li><strong>Surface adjustable “AI intensity” controls directly in writing surfaces.</strong><br />Let users slide between light-touch suggestions (“fix punctuation only”) and heavier rewrites (“rewrite for clarity”).</li><li><strong>Use mode-aware defaults.</strong><br />If the system detects texting-like language (emojis, slang, rapid back-and-forth), default to minimal intervention. For structured writing (docs, reports, code blocks), default to more active assistance.</li><li><strong>Show the </strong>Δ<strong><em>delta</em> , not just the final rewrite.</strong><br />Display what was changed and why. Visible authorship boundaries reduce the feeling of being overwritten.</li><li><strong>Offer reversible, granular edits.</strong><br />Let users accept or reject changes at the sentence or phrase level, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing rewrite.</li><li><strong>Preserve voice automatically.</strong><br />Train style models on the user’s past writing and ensure AI edits mimic that tone rather than flattening it.</li><li><strong>Avoid “dominant tone” suggestions in intimate spaces.</strong><br />Don’t push “professional tone,” “confident tone,” or “assertive tone” suggestions inside chat or messaging contexts. It reads as intrusive.</li><li><strong>Let users lock sentences or paragraphs.</strong><br />If a line feels emotionally important or identity-revealing, users can mark it: “don’t rewrite this.”</li><li><strong>Respect the emotional labor of writing.</strong><br />When edits touch personal content, frame them as support (“Want help clarifying this?”) rather than replacement (“Here’s a better version”).</li></ul><p>There’s an <a href=""https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-your-niche-is-your-shield-the-types-of-writing-ai-struggles-to-replace-dad50e79a01c"">argument</a> that emotionally grounded writing acts as a kind of “shield” that AI can’t easily penetrate, the kind of work rooted in lived experience, personal history, or emotional nuance that resists mechanization by its very nature. And maybe that’s the point: the parts of writing that matter most aren’t the ones AI can smooth; they’re the ones only a human can feel.</p><p><em>Alice Ji is a PhD researcher at UIUC’s Institute of Communications Research, studying digital persuasion, attention, and interface design.

When Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) decided to run for City council in season 4, she does so with her friends running every aspect of her campaign (after being let go by “official” campaign managers), this gives her campaign an approachable, friendly and personal aspect that eventually led to her victory.</p><p>Although specific names of the entire Mamdani’s campaign team are not extensively detailed in publicly available sources, it is known that the campaign operated with a community-driven approach characterized by deep community roots, and a decentralized yet well-coordinated volunteer network, with digital and field teams working closely to listen, test, and refine the outreach based on real-time input from voters.</p><figure><img alt=""Photograph of Zohran Mamdani speaking at a Fix the MTA press conference.

The answer lies in principles every UX designer should understand but while keeping in mind questions of power, authenticity, and manipulation in digital spaces.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/user-experience-politics-how-ux-can-be-applied-to-political-campaigns-4efe25435846"">Brad O’Conner</a> who transitioned into UX design after 15 years in political consulting, discovered that he had been practicing UX design principles in political campaigns long before transitioning into the field, writes &quot;The voters whom you are trying to reach are the users. The goal is to provide the voter with relevant information so that their decision to vote for your candidate or cause is made more accessible.”</p><blockquote><strong><em>One key difference is that politics is also a lot more “manipulative” than UX.</em></strong></blockquote><p>A study carried out by the <a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report"">Oxford Internet Institute</a> that documented organized social media manipulation campaigns in 81 countries, found that “governments and political parties “produced misinformation on an industrial scale.” So as designers we must ask, <em>where does authentic transparency end and performance begin?</em></p><h3>1. Active listening as user testing</h3><p>Mamdani’s campaign broke from the traditional political playbook by engaging directly with both supporters and critics on social media.</p><h4>The “ultimately” moment: iteration made visible</h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DMBjabdOTPe/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I was given an ultimatum.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Zohran Mamdani catching himself mid-sentence about to say “ultimately” and self-correcting with humor</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram / Original creator</em></p><p>In one instance from July 2025, Zohran Mamdani, prompted by feedback from his communications team and voters, makes a conscious effort to stop himself from overusing the word “ultimately” during interviews and public appearances. In this light-hearted video, Mamdani acknowledges the feedback, shares clips illustrating his habit, and includes a segment where — mid-sentence — he catches himself about to say “ultimately” and quickly redirects his phrasing.</p><blockquote><em>“I am listening, I am learning. Please keep sending me your feedback because ultimately, I will get better.”<br />“In response to my team and supporters pointing out that I say ‘ultimately’ a lot, I caught myself on camera correcting the habit. Keep holding me accountable. This is how we improve, together.” (Zohran Mamdani)</em></blockquote><p>This approach mirrors what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/"">Nielsen Norman Group teaches about design thinking</a>: empathy mapping helps “distill and categorize your knowledge of the user into one place” and “discover gaps in your current knowledge.” Mamdani essentially created a public empathy map of his own communication style, inviting collective feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""The User-Centered Design Loop: Mamdani’s Campaign as a Design Process.

Building trust through transparency</h3><p>Mamdani’s response embraced feedback as a tool for self-improvement much like designers should seek out feedback and build on it in order to inspire trust in their designs. Furthermore, the transparency in documenting the process of listening and acknowledging the feedback is what inspired people’s trust in him. This moment, in equal parts humorous and earnest, embodies the essence of user-driven iteration.</p><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, a question we, as designers, must ask ourselves is, how do we distinguish genuine transparency from performed authenticity? The Mamdani campaign appears to represent authentic engagement, and although their strategies are effective, they can also easily be replicated by good actors with bad intentions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Find the line between authentic iteration and manipulative performance and listen to your users, show them you’re paying attention, and let the process of improvement happen in public view.</em></blockquote><h3>3. Small, agile teams win</h3><p>Mamdani did not have the funding for a large campaign nor was he backed by any billionaires. According to the official <a href=""https://www.nyccfb.info/vsapps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2899&amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;cand_name=Mamdani"">campaign finance summary</a> from the New York City Campaign Finance Board for the 2025 election cycle, Zohran Mamdani’s total campaign spending was $12,794,272. His campaign raised $17,159,487 in total receipts, with over $4 million coming from private funds and significant additional support from public funds through matching programs. This is relatively lean compared to Cuomo’s 40 million dollar budget which mostly came from super PACs and billionaire donors. Unlike Cuomo’s traditional campaign operation, Mamdani relied on volunteers and a handful of core personnel to constantly iterate and connect at the ground level.</p><h4>Here’s how an agile approach played out in practice:</h4><ul><li><strong>Culturally aware content</strong>: Mamdani’s team highlighted community through moments like salsa dancing in Bronx parks, sharing biryani with cabbies, or joining Tai Chi classes in Flushing. These resonated with the voters and quickly turned viral.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Collage of eight campaign photos showing Zohran Mamdani at diverse community events including large crowd gatherings, group photos with supporters on steps and on motorcycles, media appearances on MSNBC Weekend, indoor community meetings, a Congresswoman Yvette Clarke endorsement poster, and candid moments speaking with constituents in outdoor settings Source: https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l4oBSYa9PKgbsRxCViYHDg.png"" /><figcaption>Collage of Mamdani at community events. Source: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"">https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Collaborations born agile</strong>: Instead of focusing only on high-budget ad buys, Mamdani often teamed with social creators (like The Kid Mero and Subway Takes) and grassroots web series (“Are You Okay?,” “The People Gallery”). These partnerships came together quickly, built on DMs and group chats rather than formal contracts.</li><li><strong>Volunteer-led feedback loops</strong>: The campaign harnessed a decentralized WhatsApp-powered network of volunteers for canvassing, “friendraisers,” and “house parties.” First-time volunteers were rapidly trained and empowered to experiment, suggesting new neighborhoods to target, new stories to tell, and even filming spontaneous street interviews. This grassroots network was not only executing, but also feeding real-time insights and inspiration back to the campaign’s creative leads.</li><li><strong>Prototyping at campaign speed</strong>: from valentine’s day skits to a CTA in a box of chocolates, to working with rising and diverse artists like Aneesh Bhoopathy (whose branding drew from New York’s multicultural cityscapel), Wael Morcos of Morcos Key (who brought an Arabic inflection to the design for outreach in immigrant communities) and Rama Duwaji (Mamdani’s wife) a Syrian-American artist, all contributed creative input to the campaign’s bold color palette and storytelling style.

Social media engagement and message clarity</h3><p>If social media was meant for anything it was storytelling. This is exemplified in Mamdani’s social media campaigning, he didn’t just tell a story, he listened to other people’s stories.</p><h4><strong>Near real-time responsiveness</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQrrenCDtrg/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Thank you, New York City. Last night we made history. Now we get to work. Comment MayorElect to learn about the transition. Comment DonateNow to make a contribution.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani announcing transition plans the day after election victory</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s team developed a reputation for near real-time responsiveness, flooding platforms with multilingual and original content and directly engaging with voters, influencers and critics alike. When he won the mayoral race, influencers joked that Mamdani should “go to bed” as the very next day Mamdani posted a video announcing his plan for the transitional phase.</p><p>Digital experts credited his social media presence with fueling grassroots participation at levels rarely seen in local politics. Mamdani did not simply use social media he was intertwined in its roots through collaboration with influencers he knew would target his voters and his audience, that’s good user research: <em>know your audience</em>.</p><p>This engagement and real-time communication transcended boundaries and was embraced far beyond its original audience because it told a story and stories have no borders.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Storytelling as a tool in UX is often overlooked and under-appreciated, yet it is at the center of good UX and UI. Tell a story.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, how can we discuss social media political success without acknowledging that</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>the very techniques that made Mamdani’s campaign successful (rapid iteration, emotional storytelling, influencer partnerships) are the same ones </em><a href=""https://www.stimson.org/2022/social-media-misinformation-and-the-prevention-of-political-instability-and-mass-atrocities/""><em>identified by researchers</em></a><em> as enabling “organized social media misinformation campaigns” that threaten democracy globally.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>How do we as designers harness the power of emotional connection and rapid iteration without contributing to the erosion of truth and democratic norms?</em></blockquote><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1008/1*VKRUtjgehtRth1msGLA3uA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/1*-tz4fKlRT4hh13dnZ2z2gA.png"" /><figcaption>Two-panel screenshot of Instagram comments showing enthusiastic support for Mamdani’s campaign from users across the US and internationally, including Philadelphia, London, and Dublin, with comments praising the campaign’s content strategy, authenticity, and comparing it to Obama’s 2008 campaign.

Clarity as empowerment</h3><p>Other than the consistent and constant social media messaging and presence, the likes of which have never been seen in US political campaigning, Zohran Mamdani’s message was committed to clarity. On social media and in real life, whether he was explaining voting requirements, or his plans as mayor for the city, he was walking people step-by-step through the message and in multiple languages and settings thereby empowering first-time or previously disengaged voters.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Mamdani’s approach exemplified the core UX principle of affordance: making it immediately visible what action is possible and how to take it.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, the question then arises, </em>Why should anyone have to explain the ability and process of voting?<em> Doesn’t this then allow those with the explanation the power to weaponize this knowledge? </em><a href=""https://ask.edgarallan.com/blog/a-ux-perspective-on-the-us-election""><em>Edgar Allan’s UX team notes</em></a><em>, “If there was ever a thing that should be unquestionably clear, understandable and accessible, it is the ability to vote. Unfortunately, the U.S. voting system suffers from a distinct lack of user-centricity.”</em></blockquote><h3>6. Cultural pain points = empathy mapping</h3><p>One of the first steps in the design thinking process is to empathize. Empathy was the main message throughout Mamdani’s campaign, it “goes beyond what users explicitly state and manages to unearth hidden motivations, desires, and pain points.” (<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it"">Interaction Design Foundation</a>).</p><p><em>By focusing on lived experiences, cultural nuances and specific community needs his campaign resonated with voters in an unprecedented way.</em></p><p>In a historic move not seen before in American politics, Mamdani publicly asked his supporters to stop donating once the campaign reached its financial goals. He posted transparent breakdowns of fundraising progress and, upon reaching the spending cap, communicated directly:</p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DOOI8_Ijrm5/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I am once again asking you to stop sending us money. But we do need your time. Comment CanvassNow - one word, no spaces - to get a sign up link in your DMs.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani asking voters to stop donating money to his campaign. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><blockquote>“We have enough to win. Please…do not give more. Redirect your generosity to mutual aid, to neighbors, to other grassroots causes.” (Zohran Mamdani)</blockquote><h4><strong>Plain language, clear needs</strong></h4><p>There were no hidden motives or complicated political lingo, just a plain-language presentation of what he needed from his supporters at each moment. Voting instructions were step-by-step. Donation limits were openly discussed. When the campaign reached its fundraising goal, supporters were told explicitly and publicly that there was no need for more underlying the empathetic line that his campaign had been running “For a New York You Can Afford”.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: make empathy visible by listening, responding, and adapting your design to users’ actual lives and constraints.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Here again we must consider the power of manipulation and exploitation.</em></strong><em> When genuine empathy certainly bridges gaps, but when performed it can manipulate vulnerable populations. Our responsibility, as designers is to ensure empathy serves users’ interests, not just campaign goals, to quote </em><a href=""https://uxpamagazine.org/political-design/""><em>Lloyd Hervey writes about Political Design</em></a><em>, designers must consider “what is possible and what is ethical…the trade-offs of who will benefit from a particular solution versus who will be negatively affected.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Instagram post by Zohran Mamdani promoting a “Savings Calculator” tool for New York City residents.

Multilingual communication = inclusive design</h3><p>Some political opponents criticized Mamdani for “code switching”, shifting languages and communication styles to match his audience. But in UX terms, this is exactly right. Code switching isn’t diluting your message; it’s adapting it for different user contexts.</p><h4><strong>Authentic voices from communities</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQZrQz4jtFm/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Juntos vamos a construir la ciudad que merecemos! Y con tu ayuda, voy a seguir aprendiendo español 😉 ¡Puedes votar temprano hasta el Domingo y el día de las elecciones es el Martes 4 de Noviembre! ¡Comenta con la palabra VOTA y te enviaremos un enlace para ver dónde votar!&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Spanish with a local Spanish speaking voter. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQhue5vjlgj/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram‎: &quot;‏أنا اسمي زهران ممدان وعم رشّح حالي لأكون العمدة الجديد في مدينة نيويورك&quot;‎</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Arabic. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s socials are flooded with videos in Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, appealing to all the New York demographics and communities. He did so by enlisting the help of people from those communities, in other words he engaged with more diverse audiences thoughtfully and used locals to help make his message more authentic and relevant. This helped communities feel seen and heard and Mamdani was able to build trust with communities small and large.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: use language fluidity to engage broader, more diverse audiences thoughtfully and do not translate blindly, instead ellicit help from locals who speak the language. S</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Such help from local communities should go beyond translation and requires including the diverse communioties in the design process itself and not just in the final messaging. Language fluidity is not automatically inclusive and as designers we must be weary of what researchers call “</em>performative diversity<em>” which is looking inclusive without transferring actual power to marginalized communities</em></blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><h4>Hope through human-centered design</h4><p>Mamdani’s campaign gave people something special and new (perhaps also dangerous, it remains to be seen): Hope.</p><p>He did it by embodying core UX principles: <em>empathy</em>, <em>storytelling</em>, and <em>iteration</em>. His message was always empathetic, his statements clear and direct, and his “user requirements” (what he needed from his supporters) consistently open and accessible. This was a campaign led by the people, for the people, but more importantly, Mamdani didn’t position himself as someone observing New Yorkers from the outside. He is a New Yorker. He lived their stories alongside them, not above them.</p><h4>Remembering the human element and our responsibility as designers.</h4><p>As designers, it’s all too easy to get caught up in technical features or aesthetic appeal. While those things matter, the most meaningful work happens when we remember the element of humanity at the heart of every experience. As the UX world shifts rapidly, perhaps toward “Zero UI” where interfaces recede and experience comes to the foreground, we should focus on listening deeply, telling better stories, and designing platforms where users’ stories are welcomed, valued, and allowed to live and breathe.</p><p>But we must also remember our ethical responsibility; feelings give way to manipulation and exploitation, and the same techniques that built hope in Mamdani’s campaign can and are also used to to spread misinformation, manipulate vulnerable populations, and erode democratic institutions. Our work as designers is never neutral, after all design for everyone is design for no one, and the question is not whether our design has impact, but whether that impact serves democratic values, human dignity, and truth.</p><p>Mamdani’s campaign was a reminder that empathy, clarity, and authentic connection are what build hope and inspire change. But it’s also a reminder that these tools are powerful, and that with great power comes great responsibility.</p><blockquote>The future of design in democracy depends on our willingness to hold two simultaneous truths: that connection matters deeply, and that not all connection is created equal.</blockquote><p>Every design decision is a choice. Choose wisely.</p><h3>References and Additional Readings</h3><h4><strong>Campaign Coverage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Wikipedia. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_York_City_mayoral_election"">“2025 New York City mayoral election.”</a></li><li>Adweek. <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/meet-melted-solids-the-scrappy-agency-behind-zohran-mamdanis-primary-winning-campaign/"">“Meet Melted Solids, the Scrappy Agency Behind Zohran Mamdani’s Primary-Winning Campaign.”</a></li><li>New York Times. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/11/05/nyregion/nyc-mayor-mamdani"">“Mamdani, N.Y.C.

<h4>A guide to the extinction of user joy in the digital age.</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a crab over a phone, symbolizing the evolution of apps into ad machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Yarbt8n6ZoCN7HwRnRAJHg.png"" /><figcaption>An crap shaped ad, emerging from a cellphone.</figcaption></figure><p>I was halfway through doing the dishes while listening to a podcast when an ad cut through and interrupted one of the most interesting bits. My phone was a few meters away in the living room and I rushed over like I had forgotten a burning turkey in the oven to make sure that I got to the phone before the second ad started playing. I tapped that lower-right hand skip button and the tension in my body temporarily melted away as I made my way back to the chore and continued listening to my podcast, ironically about the slow decay of once useful apps, that was so rudely interrupted by a Nissan ad.</p><figure><img alt=""Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*qVaAxIWg4nrXMgaT.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://strangershow.com/how-to-buy-youtube-premium/"">Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience</a></figcaption></figure><p>As I pondered how possible it would be to find an ad blocker for my phone, the answer was slapped in my face in the form of a glorious popup! <strong>Try YouTube premium and you’ll be ad free</strong>… something that only a few years ago was standard had become a premium and I asked myself why? The term I happened to be learning about that day from <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2"">Cory Doctorow was <strong>enshittification</strong></a>, which can be loosely defined as the process by which platforms decay as they shift value away from users and toward themselves and their business customers. In other words, things start out good for us, then get worse as the companies optimize for profit. While we all have a collective <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/"">intuitive sense of platforms decaying</a> over the last few years, I wanted to look closer from a design perspective, specifically, at how that decay unfolds through the deliberate, incremental rollout of ads.</p><p>The key players in this <strong>enshittification</strong> race are the four major tech companies that dominate our digital lives: Google, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, and YouTube. But for the sake of this article, I’m going to focus on one in particular, because it’s where I spend the most time: YouTube.</p><p>These companies’ slow decay into ad infested dystopian nightmares reminded me of a conversation I had with my good friend and cofounder <a href=""https://charliegedeon.medium.com/"">Charlie Gedeon</a>. He told me about this theory, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation""><strong>carcinisation</strong></a>, which is the very hilarious scientific process which can be described as “<a href=""https://brill.com/view/journals/ctoz/67/2/article-p79_1.xml"">the many attempts of Nature to evolve [into] a crab</a>”. In simple terms, there is an evolutionary momentum that has slowly pushed a variety of unrelated species to evolve into the general behaviour pattern and shape of a crab. So given enough time and opportunity, every species will eventually become a crab. I couldn’t ignore the metaphorical parallel: in our technological ecosystem, the biggest species don’t turn into crabs, they turn into ads.</p><p>Before YouTube, there was TV. The TV was invented in 1939, and the <a href=""https://www.madhive.com/insights/history-of-tv-advertising"">first ads were shown in 1941</a>. In the early 1940s, ads were short, mild interruptions between programs then by the 1980s, they had become pretty much the reason every sitcom, news broadcast, and sports event existed at all. It was simply the packaging for the ad breaks that paid for it. Then streaming arrived and it felt like a breath of fresh air! A new, ad-free subspecies breaking free from its commercial ancestors. Netflix, YouTube, and early Hulu gave us hope of a new evolutionary path: content without interruption. But, it didn’t stay ad free for long.</p><p>So let’s look at YouTube, starting with the first signs of life to crawl out of the primordial soup, we have the humble <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/66159/"">InVideo overlays first launched in 2007</a>, these were thin, semi-transparent banners that floated over the bottom of a playing video, usually small text or a tiny ad image that you could close with a small “X.” These early ads didn’t stop the video, or call for too much attention. They quietly fed on our attention without killing us, like a parasitic symbiosis. While annoying, they didn’t destabilize the delicate environment of early to mid-2000’s YouTube.</p><figure><img alt=""The early dismissible youtube ad banner showing at the bottom 20% of the screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QMeV9fQYXmh-XYNo.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Early dismissible youtube ad banner taking up the bottom 20% of a video.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Then between 2010 and 2018 there’s an explosion of life, the ads grow legs, lungs, and teeth… YouTube launched <a href=""https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/trueview-video-ads-give-viewers-choice/"">TrueView ads</a>, those aforementioned and all too familiar skippable pre-rolls that appear before your chosen video. These ads demand visibility, they evolved to study their prey’s habits, tracking which openings held attention longest. At first, there was just one, small but intrusive, a 5-second interaction before you could skip and move on. But as we all know, evolution rewards persistence. Soon, a single ad became two, then a pair before and after your video, and finally in 2012, <a href=""https://blog.youtube/creator-and-artist-stories/mid-roll-ads-updates-explained"">mid-roll ads appeared</a>, splitting your entertainment in bite size chunks.</p><figure><img alt=""Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZSukJyjEmxwlLrTt.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video</a></figcaption></figure><p>With each mutation, they became harder and harder to ignore. The variety was overwhelming, displaying banners above, overlays below, and videos within videos. The content creators themselves now, mimicking the copy of the ads. By the end of this period, the once teeming with life content creator ecosystem had turned into a chewed through rotting swamp where every spare patch of attention was colonized with a swarm of ads.</p><p>Understandably, this environment was not the most pleasant so I, like many others, used an ad-block. To put in perspective how prevalent this problem is, here’s a quote from Cory Doctorow that really struck me: <a href=""https://youtu.be/P1EKQidRooc?si=W5D9-f7NSy8VVT3I&amp;t=1372"">“51% of web users have installed an ad blocker, it is literally the largest consumer boycott in human history.”</a> The majority of people, which I imagine probably encompasses people making these decisions in the first place, probably have an ad blocker installed. This was our one tool to try and avoid the onslaught of ads that we’d be subjected to on a daily basis, and while there weren’t as easily accessible tools on mobile, we’d at least have a reprieve on our computers… or so we thought.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups, showing that Ad Blockers aren’t allowed on the platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*zH9j2L6vBUyKB43D.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.brave.app/t/youtube-showing-popup-for-ad-blockers/511149"">YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups</a></figcaption></figure><p>In late <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-growing-3380809"">May of 2023</a>, YouTube began to mutate again, starting with a small subset of tests where they rolled out banners saying “Ad Blockers are not allowed on YouTube.” An easily dismissable popup asking you to uninstall your Ad Blocker. It was the early signs of a dominant species that was going to make it impossible for you to avoid ads. Eventually, making it an unfeasible arms race between ad-blockers and ad-blocker-blockers (that’s a mouthful). This persisted to where we’re at now where it’s more of a pain to find a way to circumvent ads then to just sit through the discomfort that we’ve been conditioned to endure.</p><p>This whole process has been a calculated and heavily studied rollout. In some ways it is a masterful example of how to slowly introduce a feature to users that doesn’t actually benefit the majority. At first users feel discomfort, but not enough to abandon the platform. The designers, researchers and tech CEO’s know that they’re pushing unpleasantness and that they have to go as far as they can without causing too much pain because they understand that it’s a delicate ecosystem of attention and people will find alternatives if pushed too far too quickly. If YouTube had not given notice of its intention to block ads for months prior to the rollout of the full ad-block extinction, what would have happened? I personally think the consequences would have been cataclysmic and in some ways hoped that they would have torn off the bandaid a little more violently to shock us into action.</p><p>So over the course of 25 years, they’ve increased the heat and now we’re in a pot of boiling water, but in truth it’s we actually don’t know how much hotter it might get. Many <strong>PAID</strong> platforms now include ads, such as Prime and you have to pay additional fees to exclude them. So what comes next in this grand evolutionary chain? Maybe ads that blend seamlessly into the content, AI-generated sponsorships that mimic the creator’s voice so perfectly we can’t tell where the video ends and the commercial begins. Maybe they’ll feel like features instead of intrusions. Either way, the species isn’t going extinct anytime soon. Like crabs, like capitalism, ads always find a way.</p><p>The hope is for the next disruption. YouTube once broke the cable monopoly with creativity, and community before slowly mutating into the very thing it replaced. It would seem, that’s the pattern of evolution, the old ecosystem collapses under its own weight, and something new crawls out of the primordial muck.</p><p>One can hope that there is a better answer gestating. Maybe it’s decentralized video, maybe it’s a new model of sharing that doesn’t depend on monetized attention, more than likely it’s something we haven’t imagined yet. The godfather of the term, <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/"">Cory Doctorow</a>, explores this in his new book <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222615930-enshittification""><em>Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It</em> </a>, with the most important part being that final clause: <strong>what to do about it.</strong></p><p>As citizens, we can advocate for antitrust laws, interoperability, and policies that prevent platforms from locking in both users and creators. As users, we can choose to support the smaller, values-driven platforms that still have a soul, ones that remind us the internet doesn’t have to be stinky pile of ads, but a place we actively connect. And lastly as designers, we can embed the values of portability, transparency, user control, and minimal hidden value extraction. Better than hoping for the next better thing is putting our efforts into actually designing it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9e6032ff2d20"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">The evolution of Youtube: How every platform evolves into an ad machine</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How to translate philosophical theory into practical design principles and responsibility.</h4><figure><img alt=""Colorful circular diagram titled “Ethical Interface Design” with sections: Inclusion, Privacy, Autonomy, Transparency, Well-Being, each linked to ethical theories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm8743DS4GxpcGXJdywN2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The following article introduces an evolving academic framework called <em>Ethical Interface Design</em>, which examines how moral philosophy can guide interface design in the era of emerging technologies. The working site, <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com""><strong>ethicalinterface.com</strong></a>, presents these ideas through a minimalist, text-focused layout that intentionally prioritizes thought over visuals — a meta-commentary on where design itself may be heading. The framework remains in active development, and thoughtful feedback is welcome.</p><p>Society is moving beyond screens into conversational, immersive, and neural experiences, placing designers at the center of the ethical landscape of human–technology interaction. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> helps designers understand not only the impact of their choices but also the ethical frameworks behind them, exploring:</p><ul><li>How interfaces influence behavior across visual, tactile, conversational, neural, and mixed-reality modalities</li><li>The philosophical roots of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> — inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, and well-being</li><li>The trade-offs between competing moral frameworks — such as egalitarianism versus meritocracy, or collectivism versus libertarianism — that determine how ethical priorities are balanced in design</li><li>Practical guidance for applying ethics to real-world projects</li></ul><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> equips designers to make intentional, responsible choices as they shape the digital world ahead.</p><h3>Interface Modalities</h3><p>Every interface mediates the relationship between humans and machines — translating intention into action, and in doing so, shaping how we perceive, decide, and connect. Emerging technologies such as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models"">large language models</a> and <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/"">neural chips</a> are expanding that relationship, blurring the boundary between user and system. As interfaces grow more adaptive and conversational, the very definition of “user interface design” begins to dissolve — replaced by fluid exchanges that merge cognition, language, and computation.</p><p>This evolution raises profound questions about agency, inclusion, and moral responsibility — questions explored further in the Ethical Foundations and <em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em> section of this article.</p><h4>From Command to Conversation</h4><p>Early computing relied on text-based <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp"">command-line interfaces</a> — precise but exclusive, accessible only to those fluent in code. The 1980s introduced the <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphical-user-interfaces?srsltid=AfmBOorkkBsRT2lPaE0zQed3OJt5HT3hCRkelHQF4-T-KQ_riqUiSau2"">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a>, popularized by Xerox PARC and Apple, replacing syntax with icons and windows. This visual paradigm made computing public but also aestheticized control — what you could see, you could do.</p><p>As technology spread beyond the desktop, new modalities emerged. Touchscreens redefined tactility. Voice assistants reintroduced conversation. Gesture and neural systems now blur the line between intention and execution. Each step expanded access while also raising new ethical questions about consent, surveillance, and cognitive autonomy.</p><h4>Types of Interfaces</h4><p>Interfaces are the boundaries between human intention and digital response. They manifest through the senses and combinations of them — and increasingly through language itself in conversational systems.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-design-in-ux-study-guide/""><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong></a> → Screens, icons, and layouts that communicate through sight. Examples include smartphone apps, operating systems, dashboards, and AI applications that blend visual and conversational interaction.</li><li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S2666998624001728""><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong></a> → Touchscreens, trackpads, haptic vibrations, and adaptive textures that make interaction physical. The iPhone’s multitouch screen (2007) made touch the dominant input for a generation.</li><li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103448""><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong></a> → Spoken interaction with assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. Generative AI extends this to conversational agents voice mode, emphasizing tone, intent, and context over fixed commands.</li><li><a href=""https://www.hci.org.uk/article/exploring-the-role-of-gestural-interaction-in-user-interface-design-challenges-and-opportunities/""><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong></a> → Motion-based control through cameras and sensors, from the Nintendo Wii (2006) and Microsoft Kinect (2010) to AR/VR hand tracking. They extend interface design into physical space and embodiment.</li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/""><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong></a> → Brain–computer links such as Neuralink or medical prosthetics that translate thought into action. These collapse the boundary between user and system, making ethics inseparable from cognition itself.</li><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/3/600""><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong></a> → Hybrid environments such as virtual and augmented reality that merge visual, tactile, and spatial interaction. Examples include Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, and AI-powered immersive design spaces.</li></ul><p>Every modality encodes a worldview — about who controls interaction, what is considered intuitive, and where agency resides. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> asks not only how interfaces function, but what kind of human they imagine.</p><h3>Ethical Foundations</h3><p>Ethics has always asked how we ought to act. From <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/"">Aristotle’s pursuit of virtue</a> to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kant’s universal duty</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/"">Mill’s utilitarian calculus</a>, moral philosophy has sought to balance intention, outcome, and character. In design, these same questions take form in pixels, code, and policies. Every layout, algorithm, and feedback loop implies an answer to an ethical question — sometimes implicitly, sometimes with intent.</p><p>Yet the foundations of ethics are not absolute. Thinkers like <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/"">Nietzsche</a>, <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/"">Foucault</a>, and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/"">Derrida</a> challenged the idea of universal morality, arguing that ethical systems are shaped by culture, power, and interpretation. From this view, ethics is not a fixed code but a living discourse — one that evolves with our technologies and values. What counts as “good design” may therefore reflect not timeless truth, but the shifting moral architectures of an age.</p><h4>Philosophical Frameworks</h4><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> draws from a range of philosophical frameworks that form the foundation of <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>. While ethics is contextual, these pillars rest on moral principles widely recognized across contemporary society.</p><p>These principles act as guiding coordinates rather than fixed rules, reflecting a shared yet evolving moral landscape. The <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> reveal how ethical tensions emerge when values intersect — the goal is not to eliminate these contradictions but to make them visible, allowing designers to act with clarity and intent.</p><p>History shows how one value can override another — privacy may yield to collective well-being during crises, or inclusion may challenge merit-based systems. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> highlights these trade-offs, guiding designers toward more transparent and deliberate choices.</p><h4>Core Ethical and Philosophical Principles</h4><p>The following list outlines major philosophical frameworks relevant to ethical design. While many other schools of thought exist, these principles form the foundational basis for <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism""><strong>Collectivism</strong></a> → A moral and political philosophy that prioritizes the needs, goals, and well-being of the group over individual interests. It emphasizes cooperation, shared responsibility, and social interdependence as essential to human flourishing.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/""><strong>Communitarianism</strong></a> → A perspective emphasizing community, shared values, and social responsibility in shaping moral and political life. It critiques excessive individualism in liberal thought.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/""><strong>Egalitarianism</strong></a> → The view that all individuals deserve equal moral consideration and that social and economic inequalities require justification. It emphasizes fairness, equal opportunity, and the reduction of arbitrary privilege.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/""><strong>Kantian Ethics</strong></a> → A deontological moral theory grounded in reason and autonomy. It holds that moral action arises from adherence to universal moral laws derived from rational duty.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/""><strong>Liberalism</strong></a> → A political and moral philosophy that upholds individual rights, freedom of choice, and consent as the basis of legitimacy. It limits interference by the state or others in personal domains.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/""><strong>Libertarianism</strong></a> → A philosophy centered on individual liberty and minimal external control. It values personal autonomy, voluntary exchange, and limited government intervention, often resisting collective mandates or welfare-oriented design.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/""><strong>Meritocracy</strong></a> → The belief that rewards and positions should reflect individual talent, effort, and achievement rather than social status or inherited privilege. It values ability and contribution as the basis for distribution.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/""><strong>Pragmatism</strong></a> → A philosophical movement that evaluates ideas and actions by their practical effects. It privileges usefulness and results over strict adherence to principles or absolute truth.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/""><strong>Utilitarianism</strong></a> → A consequentialist theory asserting that moral value depends on outcomes, with the best action being the one that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering for the greatest number.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/""><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong></a> → A moral framework emphasizing the cultivation of moral character and the pursuit of virtue. It focuses on traits such as honesty, integrity, and wisdom as the foundation of ethical behavior.</li></ul><h4>Toward an Ethical Interface</h4><p>As we move into an era defined by artificial intelligence, automation, and neural integration, ethics becomes both more complex and more urgent. Interfaces now operate at cognitive and emotional levels once considered private. The goal of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> is to preserve human dignity within this expanding field of influence.</p><h3>The Five Pillars of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em></h3><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a> are built on established <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/ethics.html"">ethical principles</a> and common and emerging <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/modalities.html"">interface modalities</a>. Together, they reveal how moral values manifest across different modes of interaction — and how every ethical choice involves trade-offs that designers must navigate responsibly.</p><p>To learn more, review the principles in detail below. For a concise overview, refer to the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/img/five-pillars-ethical-design-2025.pdf"">summary table</a>.</p><h4>Inclusion</h4><p>Inclusion ensures that interfaces welcome, represent, and empower people across abilities, cultures, and contexts. It rejects design that privileges one type of user at the expense of others and treats accessibility not as accommodation but as design integrity. An inclusive interface assumes difference as a constant, not an exception.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Support diverse visual and linguistic literacies through adjustable type scales, high-contrast modes, and culturally inclusive iconography.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Design haptic feedback and physical controls that accommodate varied dexterity and sensory abilities, ensuring equitable interaction.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Train recognition systems on global accents, dialects, and speech patterns to prevent bias toward dominant languages.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Calibrate motion detection for diverse ranges of movement, body types, and physical capabilities instead of a single “ideal” gesture model.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Build adaptive systems that account for neurodiversity, cognitive variation, and comfort levels in signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Configure AR and VR environments to support varied sensory sensitivities, spatial perception, and physical comfort across users.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Rooted in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/"">Egalitarianism</a>. The core claim is moral equality — like cases should be treated alike unless a relevant difference justifies unequal treatment. In design terms, capability differences, cultural background, and context are relevant inputs to equalize effective opportunity, not reasons to exclude.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/"">Meritocracy</a> links reward to demonstrated talent, effort, or productivity, appealing to fairness through performance. In design, this logic supports optimizing for “power users” or “high-value segments” to maximize efficiency and impact.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Equality vs. Merit</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Design for accessibility and difference as defaults while recognizing merit, balancing equality with performance.</p><ul><li>Adopt accessibility guidelines (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">WCAG</a>, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"">WAI-ARIA</a>) as creative constraints.</li><li>Use participatory methods to include marginalized users in testing and feedback.</li><li>Offer personalization — contrast, input method, motion sensitivity, voice settings — without stigma.</li><li>Audit datasets, prompts, and imagery for cultural or algorithmic bias.</li><li>Frame inclusivity as an innovation driver that benefits all users.</li><li>Provide “power features” as additive layers, not the default path.</li><li>Evaluate efficiency metrics for the whole user base, not just the fastest quartile.</li></ul><h4>Autonomy</h4><p>Autonomy protects the user’s capacity to think, choose, and act without manipulation or coercion. In interface design, it means preserving agency — giving users real control over what they see, share, and decide.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Empower users to manage visibility and consent through clear privacy controls, opt-in dialogs, and transparent data-use indicators.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide physical controls, such as undo buttons and emergency stops, that let users reverse or interrupt actions on their own terms.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Require explicit verbal control over actions, ensuring conscious intent over automated interpretation.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Design gestures that distinguish deliberate intent from incidental movement, preventing unintended triggers.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Secure informed consent and allow opt-out before interpreting or predicting user intent from neural signals.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Give users control over spatial permissions, tracking boundaries, and data sharing within AR and VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Grounded in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kantian Ethics</a>. People must be treated as ends in themselves, not as means to collective goals. Ethical action respects rational self-rule, even when doing so conflicts with collective well-being. Favor transparent choices, meaningful consent, and reversibility over efficiency or mass benefit.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/"">Utilitarianism</a> values the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach may favor streamlined decisions, the removal of risky options, or persuasive defaults to maximize collective well-being and system efficiency.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Freedom vs. Welfare</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Preserve informed choice while allowing limited, transparent guidance that prevents harm without coercion.</p><ul><li>Treat informed consent as ongoing and contextual.</li><li>Provide granular settings for automation and data sharing.</li><li>Default to privacy-preserving choices.</li><li>State clearly where automation begins and ends.</li><li>Eliminate dark patterns and manipulative urgency cues.</li><li>When nudging for welfare, disclose the nudge, show the rationale, and offer a one-tap opt-out.</li><li>Provide escape hatches (undo, exit, manual override).</li></ul><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Transparency concerns the integrity of information shared between humans and systems. It requires honesty, disclosure, and authenticity so that what is shown aligns with what is real. It provides the truthful foundation necessary for understanding, accountability, and rational choice.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Present data truthfully through accurate charts, clear sponsorship labels, and visible indicators of AI-generated or manipulated media.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide feedback that reflects the true system state, distinguishing between successful actions, errors, and pending responses.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Disclose when users are interacting with non-human agents and summarize what information is recorded or retained.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Notify users when motion data is being tracked, interpreted, or stored to maintain awareness of system observation.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Distinguish which neural signals can be measured versus which should be, clarifying how thought-related data is interpreted and used.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Display clear boundaries between simulated and real elements, including visibility into what is recorded, shared, or AI-generated within AR/VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Draws on <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"">Virtue Ethics</a>. Honesty and truthfulness appear as reliable presentation, avoidance of deception, and willingness to disclose limits. Interfaces operationalize these traits via faithful visualizations, provenance signals, and candid explanation of uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/"">Pragmatism</a> values what works over what is strictly true. It treats clarity and usefulness as higher goods than full disclosure, accepting that some truths may be simplified or deferred when they hinder progress.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Truth vs. Utility</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Reveal truth and uncertainty clearly and in context, maintaining usability and trust.</p><ul><li>Disclose algorithmic involvement in rankings and outputs.</li><li>Make consent and data flows comprehensible in context.</li><li>Expose uncertainty and known limitations.</li><li>Align copy and feedback with actual system behavior.</li><li>Design clarity as a user benefit, not just compliance.</li><li>Use layered explanations: short, then expandable detail — never hide conflicts of interest.</li><li>Avoid “spin” — simplify presentation without sacrificing truth.</li></ul><h4>Privacy</h4><p>Privacy safeguards the boundary between the individual and the system. It upholds user control over information, attention, and identity — defining the conditions under which data is observed, shared, or stored.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Provide clear permission settings, visible tracking indicators, and accessible private modes that let users manage visibility and data exposure.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Incorporate hardware shutters, physical switches, and tactile indicators to give users direct control over sensors and device activity.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Include audible or visual cues when recording begins, and enable quick, in-flow deletion or redaction of captured speech.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Capture movement data only upon explicit initiation, ensuring gestures are recorded intentionally rather than passively monitored.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Protect sensitive neural data through local processing, encryption, and consent-based access to signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Allow users to define spatial privacy zones and control when spatial mapping, camera feeds, or biometric data are shared.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Informed by <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/"">Liberalism</a>. Individuals possess rights to personal domain and consent that constrain collective or commercial interests. Privacy functions as a precondition of autonomy by preserving mental space for deliberation, identity formation, and dissent.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/"">Communitarianism</a> prioritizes common goods and may endorse broader sharing for safety, coordination, or solidarity. Legitimate community aims must be balanced against the standing claim of individuals to control access and use of their data.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Autonomy vs. Solidarity</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Protect dignity through consent and control while permitting ethical data sharing for genuine collective benefit.</p><ul><li>Practice data minimization.</li><li>Show what’s shared, why, and for how long — without fatigue.</li><li>Make controls accessible, contextual, and reversible.</li><li>Process data on the user’s device whenever possible — use cloud storage or computation only when essential and clearly justified.</li><li>Frame privacy as trust that enables participation.</li><li>For “common good” uses, require aggregation, anonymization, purpose binding, and expiry by default.</li><li>Provide opt-out mechanisms for any data pooling or sharing when feasible — document non-optional cases.</li></ul><h4>Well-Being</h4><p>Well-being asks whether technology supports human and ecological flourishing — psychological, social, physical, and environmental. It favors sustained clarity, balance, and restoration over compulsive engagement, overuse, or unsustainable resource demand.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Design calm visual hierarchies, offer dark or focus modes, and adjust color temperature or brightness over time to reduce eye strain and fatigue.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Use haptic cues to encourage rest, posture shifts, or mindful breaks, supporting physical comfort and recovery.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Employ tone and pacing that convey calm support without emotional manipulation or artificial empathy.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Encourage healthy movement through interaction patterns that counter sedentary use and promote active engagement.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Adapt cognitive pacing and information density to match user comprehension and prevent overload or fatigue.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Balance immersion with grounding cues, allowing users to pause, recalibrate, or exit experiences to protect mental and physical well-being.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Anchored in <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism"">Collectivism</a><strong>.</strong> Well-being is measured by the health of the collective — how design supports shared welfare, mutual dependence, and the long-term sustainability of both human and ecological systems. Design choices emphasize cooperation, community benefit, and responsibility for collective outcomes over purely individual gain.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"">Libertarianism</a> prioritizes individual freedom and self-determination, often resisting design constraints that guide or limit user behavior for the sake of collective good. From this view, interventions that promote well-being — such as limiting usage or prompting rest — can be seen as paternalistic, infringing on personal autonomy even when intended for protection or benefit.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Welfare vs. Freedom</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Foster flourishing and reduce harm without violating autonomy or moral boundaries.</p><ul><li>Replace engagement KPIs with well-being metrics: satisfaction, balance, trust, recovery.</li><li>Use persuasion for healthy habits, not compulsion.</li><li>Add protective friction: time limits, focus modes, optional pauses.</li><li>Assess long-term emotional and cognitive effects of tone, color, and loops.</li><li>Test for calm, clarity, and self-perception, not only task completion.</li><li>Offer well-being prompts as configurable aids with clear off switches.</li><li>Decouple core utility from compulsive loops (infinite scroll, variable rewards).</li></ul><h3>Design for the Future</h3><p>Design for the future means translating moral philosophy into tangible choices that shape how people live, work, and connect. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> and the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> framework were developed by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/micbuckcreative/"">Michael Buckley</a> to help designers approach emerging technologies with awareness and accountability.

<p>Every year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-clothes-accessories-2025"">winter fashion</a> is defined by a handful of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">specific prints</a>. Lighthearted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-gingham"">gingham gives way</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-midi-dresses"">complex plaid</a>, with its crisscross of graphic lines and harmonious colours, while playful florals are replaced by more serious herringbone and houndstooth. This winter, however, one print is taking over everything. Enter: argyle — and it’s coming for your manicure, too.</p>



<h2>What are argyle sweater nails?</h2>



<p>With overlapping diamonds and clever use of negative space, argyle occupies a cozy space between harlqruin and plaid. Inspired by the tartan of Scotland’s Clan Campbell, it’s a classic winter knit, but this season it’s bigger than ever, popping up everywhere from Zara to Sandro. It was only a matter of time before manicurists drew from the pattern. Head to Instagram, and you’ll see that the biggest nail art trend this winter is, in fact, argyle. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/chummy.nails/?hl=en"">Oksana Zavora</a>, a Milan-based creative nail artist, is one professional who has been inundated with client requests for argyle nail art since creating <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFHfNbDK5h/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this set</a> for content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sarahbrezel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Stasi</a>. “Trendy nail designs are definitely influenced by fashion trends,” she tells Refinery29, “so this one already felt like an obvious success from the start.”</p>



<p>She adds, “No matter the season, my color palette often naturally leans toward browns and those cozy ‘fall’ shades, so when my client came in with screenshots of argyle sweaters, I instantly knew it would turn into something amazing.”</p>

<h2>How do you create the argyle sweater nail trend?</h2>



<p>Unless you consider yourself a dab hand with a nail art brush, this one is best left to the professionals. “When you create designs completely from scratch, the most important part is trusting the process,” says Zavora. In other words, you just have to let your nail tech wing it. Oh, and gel polish — cured after each step — is your best bet to keep the colours crisp and long-lasting. </p>



<p>The graphic lines are probably the trickiest detail to perfect. To create the black and white stripes on her clients’ nails, Zavora says she first drew a dark line across the nail, then hand-painted the white stitches on top to mimic the fuzzy texture of a sweater. </p>

<p>On her recent argyle manicure, Zavora says, “I’m super nerdy about details, and I’m always focused on perfecting the final result, so this set was definitely a fun challenge! A lot of lines, layering of colors and shapes, some patience, and voilà — argyle nails.”</p>



<p>If Instagram is anything to go by, the argyle nail trend is set to blow up this winter. Here’s all the inspiration you’ll need for your next salon visit.</p>

<p>This indigo argyle pattern, complete with golden threads, looks so good on a nude base with a classic almond-shaped nail. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">From haircuts</a> to skincare, I change my mind as often as the wind — but one thing that’s stayed constant in my beauty routine over the past few years is my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nails-gel-acrylic-manicure-burning-pain"">biweekly manicure</a>, where I always opt for builder in a bottle gel (aka BIAB).</p>



<p>As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">former nail-biter,</a> I never imagined I could have <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/short-nail-beds-beauty-standards"">elegant nail beds</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latina-girlhood-acrylic-nail-art"">long nails</a> worthy of compliments, but BIAB, specifically <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/biabtm-shop-all"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The GelBottle’s builder gel</a>, has made it entirely possible. And while BIAB is far more durable than other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">gel polishes</a>, it doesn’t make me immune to the occasional <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">chip, bend, or break </a>once my nails grow past a certain point — especially since I insist on using them as tools. How else is a lazy girl supposed to open her packages?</p>



<p>It’s as if the nail gods heard my dilemma, though, because this month The GelBottle unveiled <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/hard-biabtm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hard BIAB</a>, its strongest builder gel formula yet. I was among the first beauty journalists to try it, and here’s why I’m recommending it to everyone I meet.</p>

<h3>What is Hard BIAB and what are the benefits?</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daisykalnina/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Daisy Kalnina</a>, founder of The GelBottle Inc., says Hard BIAB boasts the same easy application and self-leveling formula (for a professional-looking, smooth, and even finish), but is designed to be much more rigid and durable. “It’s a hybrid gel that combines the strength of a traditional hard gel with the simplicity of BIAB,” adds Kalnina, “so if you want serious length, whether that’s growing out your natural nails or doing sculpted extensions, this is what you need.”</p>



<h3>What’s the difference between BIAB and Hard BIAB?</h3>



<p>While regular BIAB is stronger than your standard gel polish, it still allows short- to medium-length nails some flexibility. Hard BIAB does exactly what it says on the tin; it’s tougher and more solid, perfect if you want to grow your nails long but find they just keep breaking. “It’s for clients with a really hands-on lifestyle or anyone who wants to push their nail length further than they’ve been able to before,” says Kalnina.</p>



<p>The application process is exactly the same. I went to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lunaandwilde/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luna and Wilde</a> in London, where pro nail artist Georgia applied a bond base straight to my natural nails, followed by a thin slip layer of the shade Bonnie before curing. To create an apex for strength and shape, she then applied another bead of Bonnie, building structure while forming the perfect curve. We both remarked on how good my nails looked afterward!</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943177.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Happily, Hard BIAB is available in twelve shades to suit all skin tones, including tried-and-true favorites like Dolly (a demi-sheer baby pink), Teddy (a rose taupe), and Bonnie (a strawberry milkshake pink), which is what I chose.</p>



<p>Just like regular BIAB, Hard BIAB can be filled. One key difference is the removal process: while regular BIAB can be soaked off in ten minutes, Hard BIAB must be filed off, either with a rough emery board or an e-file, thanks to its more durable structure. If you ask me, it’s more like a hard gel, which also requires filing. When I went to have mine removed at my local salon, they tried soaking it off with acetone, to no avail. You’d just be wasting your time. Kalnina recommends booking a fresh set every three to four appointments to keep an eye on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-greenies-pseudomonas-infection-biab-gel"">health of your natural nails</a> underneath.</p>

<h3>Is Hard BIAB better than traditional BIAB?</h3>



<p>I usually get my nails filled every two weeks to prevent BIAB from lifting or my nails from growing so long that they chip or split at the sides. With Hard BIAB, though, I stretched it out to three and a half weeks. Honestly, I’ve never had longer or stronger nails. Even when they softened in the shower, I didn’t have to worry about bending them backward — a truly cringe-worthy feeling. I could also swear that, applied in layers, this new formula caused fewer — if any—heat spikes, where your nails feel uncomfortably hot under the UV lamp.</p>



<p>To be doubly sure, I went back to regular BIAB to compare, and my nails feel a little more pliable in comparison. Don’t get me wrong — they’re still strong, but nothing beats the comfort blanket of Hard BIAB. I’m sold and have already DM’d my salon to call in the entire range of Hard BIAB shades to keep me in nails.</p>



<h3>Where can I get Hard BIAB and how much does it cost?</h3>



<p>If your current nail salon already offers The GelBottle’s BIAB range, just give them a nudge to upgrade to the Hard versions. One-shade BIAB manicures on natural nails typically start at $40 to $60, though prices vary from salon to salon.</p>

<p>With Turkey Day just around the corner, I’ve been busy saving the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-nail-manicure-trends"">cutest fall nail designs</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"">trending textures</a> that will lend themselves perfectly to the occasion. Whether it’s a colorblock manicure in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/guava-nails-manicure-trend"">shades of the season</a> or a more intricate design to honor the holiday itself, these 13 ideas are festive without feeling cheesy. </p>



<p>And most importantly, whether you’re dressing up in your finest or chilling in your sweatpants, there’s a nail design to vibe with whatever Thanksgiving you’re having this year. </p>

<p>Thanksgiving is officially the start of the holiday season and, for me, that means any excuse for a little shimmer. This cat-eye manicure created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/beautybyelee/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor Szejner</a> is packed with perfect fall tones, from deep copper and burnished brown to pumpkin orange and rose gold. </p>

<p>Get ready to rock ‘n’ roll! The second <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-moon-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon of fall</a> occurs on November 19 Pacific time and November 20 Eastern time. The Scorpio New Moon is a rollercoaster of raw emotions and intensity. Prepare for the drama by meditating and cleaning our auras to ensure we aren’t negging 24/7. <br /><br />Hate to break it to you, but the New Moon in Scorpio is not going to be a walk in the park. It is a sensitive time that is asking us to mend our spirit through acts of self-acceptance. This lunation aspects seven planets, five of which are moonwalking in the sky — wowza! They are: the Sun, Moon, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Scorpio</a>, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn retrograde in Pisces</a>, Uranus retrograde in Taurus, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde in Pisces</a>. Before we freak out from the cosmos, let’s put this all together so we can understand what to expect. </p>



<p>Obviously, all these planets moonwalking in water signs will push us to be in our feelings and longing for the past. We may decide to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-back-together-relationship-ex-partner"">connect with exes </a>and old school friends to take a stroll down memory lane. Looking backward is ideal, if we are trying to heal. However, we must proceed with caution and care. Although our hearts will yearn for the chance to rekindle these relationships, we must protect ourselves to ensure we don’t get hurt again. There is a tenderness lingering in the air that requires gentleness. If people can’t give us that sentiment, we must focus on harnessing that emotion for ourselves. </p>



<p>Of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus’s retrograde</a> has a challenging vibe because it opposes the Sun, Moon, and Mercury retrograde. The Sun’s alignment to Mercury retrograde creates “cazimi,” bringing truths to light. We are going to be shaken to the core by a big reveal. It’s important to note that the clandestine information we receive could be about politics or pop culture — it doesn’t necessarily guarantee we’re the hot topic. Pay attention to the news cycle that begins under this new moon because it will make headlines in the next several weeks. Personally, the need for security might force us to look inward and meditate on what makes us happy. As the saying goes, “out with the old and in with the new.” The same applies to securing our financial bag — implement a budget, focus on necessities, and set limits. </p>



<p>Later, Uranus and Neptune retrograde dance, make a little love, and get down to our desires (when they formally link up). Significant shifts bring us closer to our innermost visions, helping us tune into our goals. Being that both of these planets are retrograde, we may want to reassess former aspirations that were left on the back burner to find our way. Revisit the hopes and objectives from years ago to firmly plant our feet in the ground and make plans (which will be subject to revision because of the retrogrades). Journaling the steps could be a great asset to ensure we remain on task. </p>



<p>The day before the New Moon, on November 19, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> harmonizes with the Nodes of Destiny, allowing us to comprehend the romantic and financial possibilities that lie ahead. As a result, we are deciding who and what we are thinking about committing to. It may be confusing and frustrating, but it gives us a sense of where we are heading. <br /><br />It would be remiss not to mention that the asteroid Lilith and Black Moon Lilith are in orbit with the degrees of the New Moon, adding fierceness to the events that will unfold. We are unleashing our darker and edgier sentiments, unapologetically letting our shadow selves be seen. We are tired of being swept to the sidelines and ignored. The upside of anger is that it can motivate us to take action that sparks change. So, be mad if you want to. Just use it to dismantle outdated institutions, practices, belief systems, and theories — not to cause irreparable harm to those we care about and ourselves. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Scorpio is going to be a wild ride. Be kind to yourself and others to swim through the deep and turbulent waters. Going with the flow could sweep us up in a sea of ambiguity, so keep one foot on the ground as an anchor. Remember, emotions and relationships are complex. Don’t hold yourself to a standard or mindset because everything is in a state of evolution.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the grand finale of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>… and it’s not going out quietly. This week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio</a> on the 18th, joining Venus and the Sun in this emotionally raw, fiercely transformative water sign. With so many planets swimming through the shadows, don’t be surprised if your inner world feels louder than usual. Conversations may rewind to long-forgotten truths, secrets might slip, and connections — especially romantic or financial — could deepen or dissolve. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> craves intimacy with a capital “I,” and Mercury’s return here suggests the Universe is giving us one last chance to revisit what was left unsaid. <br /><br />Meanwhile, from November 17 to 19, the Moon disappears from the sky. This is the dark moon phase: the quiet, liminal space before a new beginning. It’s a cosmic cocoon that invites stillness, surrender, and deep emotional excavation. Old insecurities, shadow selves, and fears may surface during this time, not to punish you, but to be witnessed, embraced, and alchemized. If you find yourself overthinking, oversleeping, or even crying unexpectedly this week, you’re not broken… you’re unraveling. This is the fertile soil where your next version takes root. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, offering us a powerful collective reset. This lunation is your chance to transmute pain into power. Scorpio teaches us that endings make space for beginnings, and this new moon is a portal to rise from the ashes.

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to intensity, Aries, but this week’s Scorpio cauldron is bubbling <em>extra hot</em>. With the Sun, Venus, and (starting the 18th) Mercury all activating your sector of emotional bonds, vulnerability, and energetic entanglements, you may feel like you’re walking around with a lie detector strapped to your chest. Under this Scorpionic haze, secrets get whispered through dreams, eye contact, or accidental texts. Venus is dialing up your sensual magnetism, but she’s also pulling you into deeper questions: who do you trust with your body, your story, your money, your fears? Mercury retrograde here isn’t subtle either… it’s a cosmic exorcism, and you’re being asked to <em>feel</em> your way through instead of force clarity. </p>



<p>Then comes the real underworld reset: the Scorpio New Moon on November 20. This one hits different because it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">ruled by </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning""> planetary boss Mars</a>, currently adventuring through Sagittarius and pumping you with courage, faith, and a hunger for reinvention. Between November 20 to 30, set intentions around transforming your relationship to intimacy, power, and truth. You’re not meant to stay bonded to people or patterns that drain your magic. Let yourself grieve, release, and then get free. This is your phoenix moment. Yes, it may sting. But you’ve outgrown your old ashes, babe, and Mars is guiding you to rise with humor, passion, and just the right amount of chaos. Trust that. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week’s Scorpio energy has you in a <em>deep soul gaze</em> with your connections, Taurus, and I mean <em>deep deep</em>, like “what are we really doing here?” levels. With the Sun, Venus (your cosmic ruler), and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> all highlighting your relationship sector, things are feeling both intense and deliciously mysterious. One minute you’re like, “I could marry them,” and the next, you’re spiral-texting your bestie like, “wait… do they even like me?” This week is asking you to look beneath the surface of your partnerships, your agreements, and even your patterns. Venus wants harmony, yes, but in Scorpio? She wants <em>honesty</em>. If it’s fake peace, she’ll burn it down. </p>



<p>And then there’s that epic Scorpio New Moon on November 20, activating your rebirth in love. Whether it’s a relationship with someone else or with yourself (or honestly, both), this is your chance to wipe the emotional slate clean and choose deeper alignment. Mars in Sag is pushing you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/living-for-the-plot-dating-adventure-travel"">stop playing it safe</a> — especially when it comes to how much you <em>really</em> share, how open you let yourself be, and how fearless you are in choosing passion over obligation. Set intentions this week that are rooted in <em>truth</em>, not fantasy. Trust that real love, whether romantic, platonic, or spiritual, can handle the heat. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This final week of Scorpio season is turning your daily life into a bit of a pressure cooker, Gemini, but like, in a “this is forcing me to grow” kind of way. With the Sun, Venus, and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) all spotlighting your sector of routine, health, and systems, you may feel hyper-aware of what’s draining you vs. what’s sustaining you. Little things you’ve been brushing aside (like that lingering cough, that glitchy calendar, or that coworker you secretly loathe) could suddenly feel like cosmic emergencies. This isn’t a punishment… it’s your chance to clean house. Venus wants you to fall back in love with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/self-care-ideas-rituals"">your rituals</a>, while retro Mercury is like, “btw, here’s the mess under the rug.” Own it. Rework it. You’re not behind — you’re in a period of profound refinement. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon hits on November 20, you’re being invited to completely reimagine how you tend to your mind, body, and spirit. What does it <em>actually</em> mean to feel balanced, energized, and emotionally clean? This lunation’s giving detox, but like, the soulful kind. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> (your opposite sign) is stirring up momentum through partnerships — whether romantic or professional — so accountability is key. Set intentions to create supportive rhythms, clear communication channels, and sacred boundaries. You don’t have to do everything alone, but you do need to do what’s <em>aligned</em>. Trust your gut — it’s louder than your mind this week. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the final week of Scorpio season is activating your pleasure sector with the intensity of a dramatic love letter, and yes, you’re both the writer <em>and</em> the muse. With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury all huddled together in your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, it’s giving sexy rebirth. That project you abandoned? The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">situationship</a> you thought was over? The artistic impulse that felt too indulgent? All of that’s back for review, but not for chaos… for refinement. Your inner child is knocking and your inner lover is whispering. Be true to your heart’s desires. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is a call to rise from the ashes of your old joy habits. What used to excite you but no longer fits? What desires feel dangerous but divine? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars</a> (the ruler of the new moon) currently in Sagittarius, fueling your sector of wellness and devotion, the next six months are about sustaining your pleasure, not just chasing it. Set intentions that let joy be your compass <em>and</em> your strategy. You don’t need to apologize for craving beauty, sensuality, or spotlight. You just need to trust the parts of you that want to shine. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is lighting a match in your roots sector and asking, “You sure you want to keep hiding that?” With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury digging into your inner world, you may find yourself unpacking long-held secrets, family patterns, or private memories that still hold weight. This isn’t about spiraling… it’s about seeing things clearly. Venus wants softness, retro Mercury brings the receipts, and the Scorpio Sun is like, “Let’s transmute this into art, therapy, or both.” You’re being asked to feel what you’d rather skip. Let the deeper emotions come up, and let them move through you. Healing isn’t always loud — but it is potent. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, you’re being handed a blank page for rewriting your roots. What do safety and home <em>actually</em> look like to you now — not just what you were taught? The next six months are about defining that for yourself and planting seeds that honor your emotional truth. With your ruler the Sun still in Scorpio for a final week and Mars in Sag blazing through your play zone, don’t be afraid to fight for joy, even in the shadows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> around reclaiming softness, embracing vulnerability, and building a sanctuary that reflects <em>your</em> soul. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re not imagining it, Virgo: conversations feel heavier, glances more loaded, and even silence carries meaning. That’s the final week of Scorpio season activating your sector of communication and perception, and with Venus and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) joining the Sun there, you’re being called to read between the lines <em>and</em> speak from the depths. You’re rewriting mental scripts that have kept you small or overly cautious. The way you talk to yourself? Under review. The way you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-communicate-argument-relationship"">let others speak to you</a>? Getting a major upgrade. This week isn’t about rushing to respond; it’s about finally <em>hearing</em> what your soul’s been trying to say. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, the pages of your inner journal feel charged with spells. What truths do you want to claim out loud? What ideas are begging for form? With Mars in Sag heating up your foundations sector, this isn’t about pretty words, but rather about anchoring them. You’re planting seeds in your voice, your mindset, and the way you connect to those closest to you. Speak like the future you is listening. Because they are. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Money, worth, and what you refuse to beg for are the themes this final week of Scorpio season is dredging up, Libra. And with retrograde Mercury and your ruler Venus both in Scorpio, activating your value sector, it’s time to examine not just your finances, but the deeper beliefs <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">fueling your sense of “enoughness.”</a> You’re being asked to shift from “What can I get?” to “What do I <em>deserve</em>?” This isn’t a week to undersell, overgive, or people-please your way into crumbs. Your magic is currency and your time is gold, so let that reframe how you ask, spend, save, and receive. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to reset your relationship with wealth and self-esteem alike. What new habits, rates, or rituals would help you feel more rooted in abundance? What old stories around scarcity are ready to be composted? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sag</a> now energizing your expression and visibility sector, the Universe wants you seen, compensated, and celebrated — but you have to claim it. Set intentions that treat your worth as non-negotiable. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve been walking through fire with grace, Scorpio, and this week the ashes start to shimmer. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is reaching its final chapter, and you’re no longer the version of you who whispered affirmations hoping they’d stick. You’re the one who <em>knows</em>. Who’s been watching yourself alchemize in real time. Who’s bled, cried, purged, stayed silent, screamed out loud — and still showed up. And now, the Universe wants to know: Are you ready to live like you survived it? Are you ready for your thriving era? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograding into your sign starting the 18th may stir the ghosts one last time, bringing up old lovers, doubts, “almosts” and “should haves.” But remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is here too, wrapping you in beauty, magnetism, and truth. You don’t have to armor up to feel worthy, and you don’t have to be ultra mysterious to be respected. You are worthy <em>now</em>, in your clarity, in your softness, in your voice that’s trembling but still choosing to speak. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is your personal renaissance. It’s a cosmic mirror asking: Who do you dare to become if you stop hiding from your own power? If you drop the need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8894550/why-dont-people-like-me"">control how others receive you</a>, and just embody your essence fully, audaciously, and unapologetically? This is Phoenix energy — pure rebirth. Shed the last of what you’ve outgrown. Grieve it, kiss it, release it, and then rise into your next timeline with a body that remembers, a spirit that’s wiser, and a gaze that sees beyond illusions. This is the week it all changes for the better, Scorpio. The week you’ve been ready for. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this final stretch of Scorpio season feels like a spiritual prelude… like the air right before a thunderstorm, thick with omens and revelations. With Mercury and Venus both moving through your sector of healing and closure, you’re being guided to listen to what you haven’t said out loud yet: the unspoken dreams, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/biggest-fears-zodiac-sign-8th-12th-house"">fears that still whisper</a> when you’re alone, the patterns you’ve outgrown but keep rehearsing. And while you usually prefer momentum over introspection, your ruling planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter is retrograde in Cancer</a> right now, pulling you into the emotional depths you’ve been skimming. This is less about solving everything, and more about sitting with what’s real. Let yourself grieve a version of you that’s ready to be laid to rest, because Sag season begins this weekend, and you deserve to greet it from a lighter perspective. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to set soul-deep intentions around trust, closure, and surrender. With Jupiter retrograde harmonizing with this moon in your intuitive sector, your dreams may feel unusually prophetic — pay attention. From now through November 30, ask yourself what quiet, restorative rituals you can commit to, not to get ahead, but to <em>come home</em> to yourself. This lunation isn’t about forcing breakthroughs — it’s about creating space for them. Think journaling, prayer, unposting, or even just letting yourself nap without guilt. The rebirth this moon brings may be invisible at first, but it’s happening beneath the surface. Trust that. The next chapter begins with a whisper, not a bang… and if you listen closely, you’ll hear your future calling your name. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Scorpio season’s final act could feel like the deep exhale you didn’t know you were holding. With the Sun, Mercury (starting the 18th), and Venus all swirling through your sector of social influence, tech, and legacy, you’re being asked to rethink how you show up in collective spaces, not just as a figure of power, but as a vulnerable human being with dreams, quirks, and stories that need to be told. <br /><br />Mercury’s retrograde in Scorpio may unearth old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"">group dynamics</a>, unprocessed feelings about friendships, or questions about the future you thought you were building. Don’t run from these insights. If certain people or platforms no longer feel aligned, you’re allowed to walk away. Venus softens the burn, helping you reconnect with kindred spirits who actually <em>get you</em>, especially as you re-evaluate your digital presence. The algorithm may be mysterious, but your intuition is clearer than ever — trust it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on the 20th offers a chance to rebirth your relationship with community, visibility, and your greater mission. What if the people you’re meant to lead or serve can only find you when you finally let go of playing small or being too “perfect”? Set intentions this week around the impact you want to leave behind, not just the results you want to achieve. With your ruler Saturn still retrograde in Pisces for another two weeks, activating your communication sector, this is also a prime time to assess the way you speak to yourself and others. The universe is preparing to hand you a mic in December, but right now, it’s checking your soul script. Edit it with care. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, it’s giving phoenix season, and this time, you’re the one shedding layers of “<em>shoulds</em>” and “<em>not yet</em>” to embrace what your soul has <em>actually</em> been craving. With the Sun, Mercury (as of the 18th), and Venus all lighting up your career, visibility, and reputation sector, you’re entering a renewal portal that’s far less about performance and far more about <em>power</em>. Mercury retrograde in Scorpio might stir up past professional doubts, old bosses, former ambitions, or a version of you who once thought “success” looked a certain way. Let it all resurface without shame. This isn’t about rehashing old storylines… it’s about reclaiming the pen and writing your next era from a deeper, wiser place. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon lands on the 20th, you may feel a rush of divine clarity: <em>it’s time to stop playing it safe</em>. Let this lunation help you visualize what a bold, soul-aligned legacy could feel like — not just professionally, but energetically. What do you want to be known for? Whose lives do you want to change? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus (your modern ruler) still retrograde in Taurus</a>, activating your roots and home sector, you’re being reminded that real success starts with safety, grounding, and emotional truth. The applause may come later, but the alignment starts now. Say yes to your deeper mission. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s something ancient waking up inside of you, Pisces… and no, it’s not just Mercury retrograde nostalgia. With Scorpio season’s final week activating your adventure, travel, publishing, and philosophy sector, and Mercury swimming backward into that same realm on the 18th, you’re being asked to revisit long-lost dreams, studies, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/141240/spiritual-but-not-religious-meaning"">spiritual beliefs</a> that shaped the person you are today. Venus is there too, helping you fall back in love with the parts of your worldview you once doubted. Whether it’s a literal journey or an emotional pilgrimage, this week whispers: <em>What if your next breakthrough comes from remembering, not rushing? </em></p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on the 20th is your official cue to set intentions around expansion, publishing, higher learning, and sacred study. Whether you want to write your first book, travel to your ancestral lands, or simply explore a new spiritual truth, this lunation is a reminder that you don’t need to know how — it’s enough to <em>believe</em> you can. With your traditional ruler <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a>, still reviewing your creativity and joy sector, you’re learning how to feel your way into abundance instead of forcing it. Stay soft, but intentional. Stay mystical, but grounded. This week is proof that your dreams are still very much alive, and they’re waiting for you to say yes. </p>

<p>The world is both a literal and metaphorical hellscape right now, and no one knows that better than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10221298/natalie-portman-sexualized-as-child-in-movies"">Natalie Portman</a>. The actress, vegan, and longtime <a href=""https://www.green4ema.org/press/natalie-portman-reveals-what-she-does-to-combat-climate-change-including-not-buying-new-clothes"">climate</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9384364/natalie-portman-oscars-dress-cape-female-directors-names-dior"">activist</a> has been at the forefront of calls for climate change and awareness throughout her decades-long career. And now, she’s using animation to further the cause. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUkW6ywV-c""><em>Arco</em></a>, a newly-released animated film from French director and illustrator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ugobienvenu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ugo Bienvenu </a>and produced by Portman, audiences are introduced to the not-so-distant future. Except in this version of Earth, in the year 2075, those tsunamis and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wildfire-eaton-california-lost-homes"">wild fires</a> that are becoming increasingly frequent and more devastating? They’re essentially the norm; with homes outfitted with glass domes that offer protection during bouts of extreme weather. It’s here that we meet Iris, an adventurous 10-year-old looking for adventure out of her day-to-day. When, one day, she rescues Arco, a time-travelling kid transported from the future, it becomes a story on the power and impact of friendship, in more ways than one. </p>



<p>Because with him, Arco brings realities of the future. Due to the impact of climate change, Arco and his family — along with their neighbours — no longer live on Earth, moving up to tree branch-like homes in the sky that allow for the planet to repair and regenerate without human interruption. It’s a surprising, albeit not so hard to imagine reality; and one made even more impactful through Bienvenu’s use of animation, which is able to engage viewers while presenting an impactful message. </p>



<p>“Animation to me is one of the best mediums for storytelling,” Bienvenu, whose other works includes short films <em>Dolly Zero </em>and 2019’s <em>L’entretien</em>, tells Refinery29. This is for a very particular reason, specifically, the way animated films resonate with viewers, often re-watching from when they’re kids all the way up to when they become adults, and choose to share their favourite movies, be it <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> or <em>Coco</em>, with their own children. “[You watch] animation movies all over your life, they accompany you all your life. And making a movie is long, so I wanted to do something that could have a [long] impact on the people that would watch it.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943042.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=577&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A577"" /></figure>



<p>And in many instances, it’s kids who are going to change the world — often in inventive ways. This is a truth made clear as Iris tries to help Arco get home, all while navigating changing environmental elements (Arco needs very specific weather — sunny with rain — to time travel) and a society that’s essentially run by drones. On the surface, it may seem like an engaging and earnest story about the bonds of friendship – and it is — but there’s something deeper to it, too. </p>



<p>As Iris and Arco try tirelessly to set up the perfect environmental conditions for him to return home, covering Iris’s front lawn in pillows and couch cushions for Arco to jump into and setting the sprinkler to go off at the exact right moment, there’s an underlying frustration with their inability to do so, and with the knowledge that those conditions, now in this current climate, are unlikely to come naturally. Arco’s stranded; a feeling probably akin to what many young people feel today when it comes to thinking about our planet. </p>



<p>But Arco and Iris don’t give up. Instead, continuing to press forward, determined that there’s a way to help Arco get home. </p>



<p>It was this optimistic way of looking at challenges, so inherent in Bienvenu’s story, and children in general, that drew Portman to the project in the first place. The actress recalls seeing early animatics of <em>Arco</em> and talking to director Bienvenu about his vision for the film — one in which creativity and imagination can be put towards a better future for our climate. “With environmental concerns, it was [usually] an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring,’” Portman says of this perspective. “There was hope and active participation in making the future through creativity. And I thought that was a very beautiful, activating way to look at a situation that we’re often kind of fatalistic about.” </p>

<p>And rightfully so. With climate change expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050, according to <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health"">data from The World Health Organization</a>(WHO), it can be easy to count ourselves – and our planet — out; resign ourselves to give up trying to change our behaviour in the present, knowing that we’re already so far gone. But, Arco — and the team behind the movie — wants us to forget about the future, or more specifically, think that they know how the future will play out. Which is why, when Iris tries to follow Arco home, he encourages her to stay in the present, stating: “No one should know the future — ever.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>With environmental concerns, it’s usually an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring… [In Arco] there’s hope and active participation in making the future through creativity.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It seems like a surprising sentiment, given the fact most young people have grown up being told that, when it comes to the environment and climate change, the future is the only thing we should be thinking about — and how our actions now will impact our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren long after we’re gone.     </p>



<p><strong>“</strong>If you know the future, it gives you no agency in the present. You think, ‘Oh, that’s how it’s gonna be, so [there’s] nothing I can do about it,’” Portman says. “If you accept that you don’t know what the future’s going to be like, then you have a part in changing it and affecting it.”</p>



<p>Which is what we, as viewers, eventually see. While we don’t see what happens to Arco after he travels home, audiences do get a glimpse into what Iris takes from her time with her new friend; primarily, inspiration to go forth and make a difference for her own future. Through small glimpses at photos and sketches in Iris’ room, audiences see that the curious, intelligent, vivacious 10-year-old we’re first introduced to will go on to  use that curiosity and vivaciousness to try and create a better future for the planet, going on to calculate, sketch and create the more sustainable world Arco will one day inhabit. </p>



<p>It’s a lesson on the impact one person can have for both kids and viewers who are coming to the film as adults already. While <em>Arco’</em>s main audience demographic may initially seem to be those under 12-years-old, “we want to speak to the kids that are still in ourselves,” Bienvenu adds,” because we still are kids in a way; a big part of me is still a kid and I want to feed that part of myself.”</p>

<p>On November 3, Condé Nast — the media company that owns <a href=""http://vogue.com/""><em>Vogue</em></a>, <a href=""http://vanityfair.com/""><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com""><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk""><em>GQ</em></a>, and <a href=""https://www.wired.com""><em>Wired</em></a>, amongst other outlets — announced that <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com"">Teen Vogue</a> would be absorbed into Vogue.com. The news came two months after the publication was awarded the <a href=""https://rooseveltinstitute.org/event/2025-four-freedoms-awards/"">Roosevelt Institute’s 2025 Freedom of Speech and Expression Award</a>, and followed nearly a decade’s worth of coverage of politics and other important cultural topics in a way that was relevant and accessible to a primarily Gen-Z audience. </p>



<p>Beyond its categorically political reporting, Teen Vogue was lauded for its dedication to intersectionality, and the way it approached issues impacting Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) and marginalized groups more generally across all its verticals. Whether that be a piece holding fashion brands to account for <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-fashion-leaders-carrying-the-diversity-push-2020-2025"">diversity promises made in 2020</a>, an <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/rfk-jrs-autism-cure-tylenol-oped"">op-ed on Robert F. Kennedy</a> and autism, or choosing transgender model and social media star, <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/vivian-jenna-wilson-elon-musk-trans-youth"">Vivian Wilson, as its digital cover star</a> — giving her the opportunity to publicly admonish both her estranged father, Elon Musk, and his bestie, Trump. </p>



<p>The publication’s reorganization came with several notable layoffs. Editor-In-Chief <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/versharma/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Versha Sharma</a> and seven staff members lost their jobs, leaving Teen Vogue with zero Black women or trans folks on its staff. </p>



<p>In a post to her <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpAqOwCZm5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">Instagram</a>, former Editor-In-Chief Elaine Welteroth, who presided over the magazine during its dedicated shift to political coverage circa 2015 and 2016, said the magazine “was a once-in-a-generation experiment in what happens when you hand the mic to young people from diverse backgrounds and take their voices seriously.” </p>



<p>This, against the backdrop of an industry in which just 15% of reporters who cover social issues and policy are Black, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/04/us-journalists-beats-vary-widely-by-gender-and-other-factors/#journalists-beats-vary-somewhat-by-race-ethnicity"">according to a 2022 Pew Research study</a>. Those numbers drop to just 7% of entertainment and travel reporters, and 5% of those covering government and politics. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion gains are being clawed back or ignored completely in boardrooms and at a cultural level, the dismissal of such a talented newsroom begs the question: What necessary perspectives do we lose, and what questions go unasked and unanswered, when Black journalists are among the first to be seen as disposable on a masthead?</p>



<p>Among those let go at Teen Vogue last month was <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaitmcnab/"">Kaitlyn McNab</a>, an award-winning journalist and the outlet’s former Culture Editor. Her love for the outlet was homegrown, as it was one she regularly reached out to when she was a freelance writer, dating back to early winter 2020 when she first pitched a story for Valentine’s Day about diverse young adult love stories. </p>

<p>“[I was pitching Black stories] every single day. That has always been at the forefront of my beat and perspective as a journalist,” says McNab, who had also overseen writing and editing for Teen Vogue’s Identity section and served as its Entertainment Editor during her five-year tenure. “A lot of the work that I’m most proud of from my time at Teen Vogue are features and interviews that allowed Black women specifically, to feel safe enough to talk about their careers, lives, and experiences and also to trust me with asking harder questions.”</p>



<p>That included an<a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ice-spice-teen-vogue-cover-story-june-2023""> interview with rapper Ice Spice</a>, marking “one of the first where she talked to another Black woman and I think we were able to talk about things that she hadn’t touched on in other stories,” McNab explains. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/layoffs-2025-highest-level-since-2020-labor-market-jobs-report/"">layoffs are quite common</a> — 40% of workers will experience it at least once in their career.  But this current moment feels different, like it’s about more than just dollars and cents. In a year that has seen the president and his top advisors <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/27/trump-free-speech-charlie-kirk"">openly attack free speech</a> and slash funding for public broadcasting, the silencing, stifling, and degradation of diverse voices via trustworthy platforms is a harbinger of a larger, more sinister cultural shift. All of this is happening at a time where companies are <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/04/11/ibm-reportedly-walks-back-diversity-policies-citing-inherent-tensions-here-are-all-the-companies-rolling-back-dei-programs/"">rolling back DEI initiatives</a> and the administration <a href=""https://time.com/7261857/us-companies-keep-dei-initiatives-list-trump-diversity-order-crackdown/"">threatens others</a> to do the same. At a time where harmful <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/11/07/how-anti-black-ai-videos-harm-black-women-at-work/"">AI-generated videos</a> of Black women using SNAP benefits continuously show up online. At a time where <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/black-women-unemployment-rate/"">Black women overall lost the most number of jobs this year</a>.   </p>



<p>“When there are economic downturns, Black workers who are the so-called professional class — which just basically means people with a college degree — actually do worse in terms of wage downturns [than their white counterparts],” says Dr. Ofronama Biu, Chief Economist and Senior Research Director at <a href=""https://www.mavencollaborative.org/"">The Maven Collaborative</a>, a Black and brown woman-led organization working to create a new, inclusive economy. </p>



<p>Black women, historically, are cultural and economic indicators. Despite participating in the workforce at a higher rate than any other demographic, unemployment rates amongst Black women have been rising at twice the rate of white and Asian women, according to the <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/07/black-women-unemployment-jobs-warning-sign/"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. And after losing a job, Black women tend to remain unemployed for longer than other workers — a worrying trend that dates back to the <a href=""https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackadultunemploymenttwoyearsrecovery_-_august201.pdf"">Great Recession.</a> “The hit that the economy [takes] gets turned on Black workers more than their white counterparts, and even more so when they’re in the professional class,” Biu explains. </p>



<p>Yet in spite of the hardship, Black women continue to shift the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/"">economy</a> and culture. And we care deeply: about our communities, and the people in them, and the problems they face. In my opinion, writers often feel similarly because many of us entered this profession believing that it’s an honor to be entrusted with other people’s stories. And we feel a burden to handle those stories justly. But as a Black journalist, I sometimes find myself wondering: Why do we dedicate ourselves to an industry that seems so irreverent about us?</p>

<p>This isn’t just a Condé Nast problem. Changing winds are being felt all across the industry. Earlier this year, MSNBC (owned by NBCUniversal) did its own “reshuffling,” ultimately firing Joy Reid, a prominent Black political commentator and outspoken Trump critic, and canceling her <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/g-s1-50551/joy-reid-msnbc-fired"">award-winning primetime show</a>. NBCUniversal struck again in October, gutting 150 staffers from NBC News and announcing it would eliminate the teams dedicated to covering <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-layoffs-number-versant-split/"">marginalized issues</a>. That same month, VIBE, the long-running music magazine focused on rap, hip-hop, and R&amp;B coverage launched by music mogul Quincy Jones <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/vibe-rolling-stone-joining-forces-1236090544/"">announced that it would merge with Rolling Stone</a>. The statement speaks of plans to re-establish the magazine as a driving force for music reporting and amplify its presence across all platforms. It did not, however, say this: it all comes at the expense of VIBE’s almost entirely Black newsroom.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942983.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I didn’t know it was coming,” says former VIBE staffer and R&amp;B reporter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/myabriabe/"">Mya Abraham</a>. “I woke up one day and had a meeting on my calendar I thought was weird.” In that meeting, a human resources representative told Abraham that the company’s decision to restructure was not based on performance. Almost all of her colleagues, she says, got a similar call.</p>



<p>Also in October, CBS News laid off about 100 employees, including eight on-air correspondents and hosts — <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-layoffs-eight-women-b2855655.html"">all women, half of whom are people of color</a>. Under the newly-minted leadership of Bari Weiss — a former opinion columnist who has <a href=""https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/end-dei-bari-weiss-jews"">openly called for the end of DEI programs</a> – the network also axed its Race and Culture Unit, which was created in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd and ensuing surge of Black Lives Matter protests. Established newsrooms at <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/"">Pitchfork</a> and <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-layoffs-january-2025/"">HuffPost</a> also saw substantial layoffs this year.</p>



<p>Are we noticing the pattern yet? This is not just economic anxiety — it’s cultural erasure, a rollback of DEI promises, and loss of platforms where Black and underrepresented voices are heard. The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p>



<p>Inclusion begets diversity. And diversity encourages accountability. That’s what makes these media layoffs especially troubling. As one of the most visible pathways for trusted information, the gutting of dedicated newsrooms represents the erasure of dozens of voices who can speak to BIPOC, queer, and underrepresented issues from a place of authority. Without a newsroom of writers and editors like Abraham and McNab, coverage loses its luster. What was once a kaleidoscope of perspectives runs the risk of suddenly becoming very dull. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I asked [Ice Spice] directly about the discourse around her success, colorism, and comparisons to other female rap artists, namely Flo Milli,” McNab points out. Her cultural awareness and sensitivity made the interview better. It also reignited a necessary conversation about the music industry’s more harmful beliefs and stereotypes.</p>



<p>While publications like <a href=""https://www.essence.com"">Essence</a>, <a href=""https://www.ebony.com"">Ebony</a>, <a href=""https://www.bustle.com"">Bustle</a>, and, of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Unbothered</a> still exist, full-time staff jobs are fewer and far between. In response to the increasing precarity of their chosen profession, many writers are choosing to put fate into their own hands. A recent <a href=""https://muckrack.com/research/state-of-creator-journalism"">study by Muck Rack</a> found that out of 1,515 surveyed journalists, more than a third of respondents independently publish their own content. Abraham will soon be one of them — she’s launching a podcast and Substack called “Play The B Sides”, dedicated to covering all things R&amp;B. McNab, though, isn’t sure the independent creator life is for her. </p>



<p>For all its flaws, the media industry “does, in a sense, give us stability,” she says. “Even though it’s so precarious, it gives us health insurance. It gives us a safety net.” For now, her immediate priority is to recuperate. “My therapist already dragged me for trying to think too far ahead. She was like, ‘You were dangerously burnt out and you need to take this time to rest right now.’”</p>



<p>Any work (no matter how glamorous the ‘00s rom-com makes it seem) is a job. It can be stressful, but it also provides a steady source of income. When that suddenly vanishes, there’s so much to practically consider: severance packages, contracts, figuring out how — or if — you’re going to be able to afford your life moving forward. Given the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/disparities-for-women-and-minorities-in-retirement-saving/"">disparities for Black women</a> and other minorities regarding savings accounts and other safety nets, the loss of even one paycheck can feel catastrophic. After all, it’s hard to save money for the future when you’re being paid significantly less than your white counterparts to begin with. </p>



<p>For her part, Abraham started a <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-vibe-staff-after-layoffs"">GoFundMe</a> for herself and her ex-colleagues as they begin to figure out next steps. Despite receiving more than 21,000 views on X (formerly Twitter), the effort has only raised $1,100 of a $35,000 total goal. When I asked if she’s disappointed by that, she admits she is. “I’m just like, ‘OK, how hard do I have to fight to get this goal met?’,” she says. “There is still a whole team of Black journalists who don’t have a job anymore.” </p>



<p>But as a self-described optimist, Abraham remains hopeful — for her future, for the industry she loves, and most importantly, for her community. </p>



<p>“I’m just here to support everybody Black,” she says, invoking a now-famous Issa Rae quote. “That’s all I want to do — support Black things because we deserve it. We are the driving force of the culture. And I just want the world to remember that.”</p>
