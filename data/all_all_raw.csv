She grew up surrounded by tutors, books and expectations that her intellect would remain a private accomplishment. When she took to history, philosophy and mathematics with a seriousness that made her parents uneasy, well, that wasn’t the goal they were going for. Knowledge, in their view, was for refinement (or so they’d hoped).</p><p>By her late teens, she had begun pushing against the edges of what society considered acceptable for someone of her background. Nursing, at the time, was not an esteemed profession. It was closer to domestic labor, associated with poverty, poor training and conditions that respectable families wanted nothing to do with. The thought of Florence entering that world was, to her parents, pretty unthinkable.</p><p>Beyond her house, Europe was shifting.</p><p>The British Army was expanding its presence abroad. Hospitals weren’t prepared for the scale or severity of the injuries they received. Medical infrastructure was inconsistent, oversight was minimal, and record-keeping existed but didn’t translate into updated policy or changes in care.</p><figure><img alt=""A detailed nineteenth-century illustration of the Battle of Balaklava showing chaotic close-quarters fighting between cavalry and artillery units. Soldiers in blue and green uniforms clash with sabers and lances while horses rear and fall amid smoke and overturned equipment. A damaged cannon sits in the foreground beside wounded men on the ground, highlighting the intensity and confusion of the scene."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*epha6k7rC1KcB8iN8kl-Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Battle of Balaklava — Encyclopædia Britannica</figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Crimean-War"">Crimean War</a> began in 1853, Britain assumed its existing systems would be enough. They weren’t. Reports of catastrophic conditions reached London. Overcrowded wards, contaminated water, shortages of supplies, and mortality rates that dwarfed expectations. Public pressure mounted, and the government needed a response that looked decisive.</p><p>Nightingale was asked to lead a team of nurses to the military hospital in Scutari.</p><p>She accepted, arriving to find a system overwhelmed not only by the war, but by a number of hard to overcome assumptions.</p><p>This is where most accounts of Florence Nightingale begin to lean on the familiar imagery. The lamp, the night rounds, the comforting presence in a place defined by suffering.</p><p>While that version is true enough to persist, it leaves out the part that gives her work its lasting impression, and why it’s the subject of this week’s unquoted.</p><p>The moment she stepped into Scutari, she realized the crisis was much more than medical.</p><p>She had entered an information crisis.</p><p>The hospital produced records, but the records concealed more than they revealed. Deaths were counted, but not categorized. Conditions were noted, but not analyzed. The data existed, but it carried no structure that could lead anyone toward responsibility.</p><p>And this is where the story takes a turn.</p><p><strong>The Florence Nightingale we’re here for is the woman who recognized that the health of an institution depends on the clarity of the information that shapes its decisions.</strong></p><h3>No decision strategy = hope</h3><p>When Nightingale began working through records at Scutari, her goal was to understand how a hospital this large could operate with so many people and have so little sense of direction. Ledgers were full (supplies, patient counts, daily notes) but nothing in them hinted at anything actionable. The information described activities being completed, but not anything about that activity’s implication.</p><p>Over time, this problem persisted. Reports were produced because that was the routine. No one had agreed on what those reports were meant to surface, which scenarios mattered, which changes signaled risk, or which patterns required action. Without that understanding, documentation became a ritual — evidence that work had occurred, not evidence that anything had been understood.</p><p>This pushed Nightingale to stop reading the reports as documentation and start reading them as evidence of how little the institution understood itself. The hospital was active… busy, even… but that activity had no correlation.</p><p>Here’s what’s interesting. Decisions weren’t necessarily being avoided. People in power didn’t know what decisions they’d make if the right information presented itself. Their entire operation was basing itself on activity, optimism and ‘God’s will’ (which is a form of fate that requires no responsibility because it assumes none is possible).</p><p>Nightingale knew the only way forward was to be clear about the goal and then to look for the signals that would tell her whether that goal was getting closer or slipping further away. If the aim was fewer deaths, then she needed to understand what conditions made death more likely, and which of those conditions could be influenced by decisions inside the hospital. That meant defining the kind of evidence that would force a change in course, and then arranging the information so those inflection points (signals) could be seen.</p><p>She worked through the records with that question in mind. Not “what happened?” but “what would have made us act sooner?” Once she separated preventable deaths from battle wounds, organized the accounts in intervals that revealed trends, and drew distinctions that had never been documented with any seriousness, the crisis took on a shape the institution couldn’t look past. The patterns had been buried under routine, but they were unmistakable.</p><figure><img alt=""A polar-area chart showing monthly mortality in the British Army from April 1854 to March 1855. Each wedge represents a month, with green areas indicating deaths from nonbattle causes and orange areas showing deaths from battle. The green segments dominate most months, especially in winter, illustrating that disease and poor conditions caused far more deaths than combat. The chart is based on Florence Nightingale’s 1858 statistical work."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XJpZCcrZmsuWeJnVEiAEYA.png"" /><figcaption>Coxcomb Chart: The English nurse Florence Nightingale was an innovator in displaying statistical data through graphs. In 1858 she devised the type depicted here, which she named Coxcomb. Like pie charts, the Coxcomb indicates frequency by relative area, but it differs in its use of fixed angles and variable radii.</figcaption></figure><p>Her work made the responsibility clear. She identified the decisions that mattered and then arranged the information around those decisions so the institution could no longer look away from its own role in the outcomes. Once the data showed the hospital was contributing to the deaths, the excuses fell apart. Their work had to change.</p><h3>Where organizations lose the plot</h3><p>The pattern Nightingale uncovered isn’t confined to a nineteenth-century hospital. We produce so much information, yet struggle with the same absence of direction. Metrics pile up. Dashboards expand. Data becomes a security blanket for activity. Ask a team what decisions any one of their numbers is meant to influence, and the answer may disappoint you. But hey, the dashboard looks compelling, right?</p><p>The problem starts early. Most organizations begin with the data they have, or the data they want, and work backward into meaning. Nightingale did the opposite. She started with the decision. She asked what needed to be understood, what changes mattered, and what signals would make a different course unavoidable.</p><p>There’s a simple discipline in that sequence.</p><p><strong>Start with decisions</strong><br />Instead of asking what additional data might be useful, ask which decisions need to be made more quickly, more confidently or with greater precision. A metric only matters if it changes a decision.</p><p><strong>Translate decisions into signals</strong><br />Once decisions are clear, the next step is to name the behaviors or conditions that would trigger movement. These signals tie to action, connecting behavior to strategy.</p><p><strong>Then map signals to the data</strong><br />Only after the signals are understood does the question of data come into play. Which information reflects those signals? Which is reliable? Which is unnecessary? This prevents teams from collecting numbers for their own sake and turns data into something closer to what Nightingale built (which was a structure that makes responsibility visible).</p><figure><img alt=""A historic photograph of Florence Nightingale standing in a dark dress with lace details, wearing a white bonnet.

There’s a gap between what’s happening and what’s being said. The choice is to either declare the situation unfair and leave the responsibility where you found it… or you can step closer, notice what isn’t being noticed, and take on the work the institution isn’t prepared to do.</p><p>When Nightingale chose the second path and saw that conditions at Scutari were overwhelming, every excuse was available to her… war, fate, limited resources, the failures of others. Instead of accepting them, she studied what didn’t add up, verifying what the reports wouldn’t show. None of it was convenient. None of it was glamorous, and nearly all of it was thankless.</p><p>But as with every unquoted, that’s the work the greats take on.</p><p>Nightingale was trying to see the situation clearly enough that responsibility had somewhere to ‘land’. Her nighttime rounds weren’t mythology or symbolism. This was the work of a woman who understood that improvement begins where convenience ends.</p><p>It takes someone great to take on that kind of work.<br />She did, and it was about a lot more than a lamp.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3705e128c123"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/florence-nightingale-on-vanity-metrics-3705e128c123"">Florence Nightingale on vanity metrics</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

A thoughtful designer in an era of loud personalities… it’s a tidy version of him, and it’s true, but it leaves out important details that earn him a place in this series.</p><p>Madison spent his early career watching a country lose its footing. Under the Articles of Confederation, states behaved like independent rivals. New York taxed goods coming in from New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland fought over navigation rights. Each state was convinced it saw the situation correctly and expected the rest of the country to comply. Of course, it didn’t work that way, and what emerged instead was a tangled mess of competing systems that produced exactly the kind of chaos Madison feared.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved illustration of Shays’ Rebellion showing armed state militia firing a volley in winter snow, with smoke rising from their muskets. Several rebels lie on the ground while others retreat or fall back, and additional militia stand in formation near buildings and leafless trees in the background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/691/1*qrQ_rJl66qKb1vFVpye-iA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Shays Rebellion — America in class</figcaption></figure><p>Then came Shays’ Rebellion. A small group of farmers in Massachusetts pushed the state close to collapse over debt policy. Madison noticed how little it took to shake the whole system, and that moment told him more about the country’s stability than any debate ever had.</p><p>He saw the same instability inside Virginia. Religious groups (Anglicans, Baptists, Presbyterians) each fought to define public life according to their own doctrine. Each new majority produced a new attempt to legislate ‘certainty’ (a topic we’ll tackle another day). It convinced Madison that no group, no matter how principled, can be trusted with the whole system.</p><p>These observations led to a very important insight:</p><p><strong>People don’t balance themselves. Their interests need to be balanced for them.</strong></p><p>His education was important in helping him articulate this.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu""><strong>Montesquieu</strong></a> warned about <strong>concentrated power</strong>.</li><li><a href=""https://lawliberty.org/why-we-need-humes-wisdom-on-factions/""><strong>Hume</strong></a> explained why <strong>factions form and why they don’t disappear</strong>.</li><li>The <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/event/Scottish-Enlightenment""><strong>Scottish Enlightenment</strong> </a>taught him that <strong>complexity survives by</strong> <strong>distributing conflict rather than suppressing it</strong>.</li></ul><p>So Madison built a republic that relied on a balanced system.</p><ul><li>A large republic makes it harder for any one group to dominate.</li><li>Layered governments force negotiation instead of obedience.</li><li>Separate branches introduce friction (deliberate, sometimes frustrating friction) to keep hardline views from turning into authority.</li><li>Even procedural delays weren’t accidents; they acted as insulation.</li></ul><p>Building and planning for durability, however, meant he could build for unity.</p><p>And this is the part of Madison worth remembering: <strong>he understood that certainty is a destabilizer.</strong> Once a group believes it sees the whole picture, it stops feeling like it needs to listen. Once listening stops, balance goes with it. And after balance, legitimacy is a fast follow.</p><p>The system he designed survives because this heavy load is ‘distributed’. We only really notice his work when someone tries to remove that balance.</p><p>*Cough cough*</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling Elinor Ostrom with gray hair and glasses, wearing a brightly patterned red and multicolor top, standing against a solid orange background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1cuc5roaBnJwiz2pf1bEew.png"" /><figcaption>Elinor Ostrom</figcaption></figure><h3>Elinor Ostrom: The proof that balance can be built</h3><p>Elinor Ostrom usually appears in the public imagination as the first woman to win the <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2009/ostrom/facts/"">Nobel Prize in Economics</a>. She spent her career far from academic models and closer to the places where cooperation was something people needed in order to eat, drink, farm and survive.</p><p>Her research took her into forests in Nepal, irrigation systems in Spain, fishing communities in Turkey and water boards in Los Angeles. Each place had the same problem in a different scenery: a shared resource, a mix of competing interests and the constant possibility that one group might push its agenda far enough to throw everything off balance.</p><p><a href=""https://sesmad.dartmouth.edu/theories/54#:~:text=In%201990%20Elinor%20Ostrom%20published,Self%2DMonitoring%3B%20Self%20Sanctions%3B"">Ostrom watched closely at how these communities behaved.</a> She noticed that the systems that worked well weren’t run by a single leader or by a perfectly unified community. Instead, they relied on rules that spread responsibility across the people who depended on the resource(s). Boundaries were clear. Rules were shaped by the people who had to live with them. Monitoring was handled locally (because outsiders didn’t understand). Disputes were settled quickly and without big ceremony. And when conditions changed, the rules changed with them.</p><p>These were places built by people who understood imbalance because they felt it the moment it appeared. That’s the heart of Ostrom’s contribution: <strong>Balance works when it’s shaped by the people closest to the problem.</strong></p><p>She saw that when decision-makers were at a distance from the decisions they were making, they had a confidence they hadn’t earned. The closer they were to the problem, the more careful they were with the solution.</p><p>Ostrom also paid attention to the early signs that signaled a system was in trouble. For instance, if a single group found ways to steer the rules in its favor, and the system lost its ability to balance out. The worst failures happened when outsiders stepped in with a single fix and applied it everywhere. Solutions that looked great from a distance often unraveled the arrangements that had kept the community stable in the first place.</p><p>This is important and confirmed something Madison understood intuitively: balance doesn’t maintain itself. It has to be built. And it’s built best through local negotiation, small adjustments, and shared constraints that prevent any one perspective from becoming the entire truth.</p><p>For her, balance was more resilience than a moral posture. And the places she studied didn’t have the luxury of ignoring that. They depended on it.</p><figure><img alt=""Mahmood Mamdani with gray hair, glasses, and a short beard sits on an outdoor bench, smiling gently.

He saw that societies fall apart because people get sorted into identities so rigid that disagreement stops being part of politics and starts becoming the whole point of it.</p><p>His work in East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East all circled the same problem: W<strong>hen politics harden around identity categories, balance becomes impossible. The categories do the thinking for you.</strong></p><p>What he found was more unsettling than ideological and was baked into the structure itself.</p><p>He showed how colonial administrations divided people into “natives” and “settlers,” assigning rights and responsibilities based on identity rather than citizenship. Once those categories were in place, everything that followed (representation, punishment, land access, even the definition of violence) was shaped by the category, not the behavior.</p><p><strong>The pattern was brutally consistent:</strong></p><ul><li>People stopped seeing each other as individuals and started treating each other as types.</li><li>Arguments became personal because they were tied to who someone <em>was</em>, not what they said or did.</li><li>And instead of working within the same rules, every group insisted its own view set the rules.</li></ul><p>Once a political system runs on identity rather than structure, the entire framework begins to tilt to one side. Laws formalize conflict rather than stabilize it and public life stops being about negotiation and becomes a contest to control the category that sits closest to power.</p><p>This is the core of Mamdani’s warning: <strong>once a group can define categories, it no longer needs to define the argument.</strong> The system starts carrying their weight for them.</p><p>Here are some of his examples:</p><ul><li>In Rwanda, colonial administrators turned fluid social identities into fixed racial categories, replacing political negotiation with inherited status. This was a shift that left the society permanently off-balance.</li><li>In Sudan, laws distinguished “tribes” in ways that reshaped land rights and obligations, guaranteeing that every political conflict would be read as ethnic rather than structural.</li><li>In Uganda, colonial policy created systems where citizenship and identity pulled in opposite directions, ensuring that no debate stayed a debate for long.</li></ul><p>Different places, same mechanics: C<strong>ertainty, hardened into identity becomes a destabilizer.</strong></p><p>And this is where Mamdani plugs directly into the argument I’m making.</p><ul><li>Madison feared the dominance of one single group.</li><li>Ostrom showed how to prevent it through shared rules and distributed responsibility.</li><li>Mamdani shows what happens when none of that holds true. When people collapse a complex political world into a few fixed categories and then defend those categories as if their survival depends on it.</li></ul><p>He explains the modern reflex where expanding someone’s frame feels like an attack. Nuance becomes betrayal, and balance? Well, that looks an awful lot like disloyalty.</p><p>I’m not saying people are unreasonable. I’m saying <strong>their political identity is doing too much work. </strong>Once that identity carries the whole argument, the whole thing starts to slide.</p><h3>Where All Three Collide</h3><p>You don’t need to be a political theorist to feel when a system is off-balance. People sense it in small ways before they can articulate it. A policy feels rushed. A rule changes too quickly. Decisions start to look engineered for someone else’s benefit.</p><p>What Madison understood, Ostrom proved, and Mamdani diagnosed is that imbalance isn’t dramatic… at first. It appears in places where one idea or one identity starts carrying more weight than it should. And once that happens, people react the same way they do when you widen their argument: they retreat into the part they understand and defend it like it’s the whole story.</p><p>You see this in every procedural fight we pretend is about ideology. Gerrymandering is a fight about boundaries. The filibuster is a fight about friction. Court expansions, emergency powers, rule changes, executive orders … each one chips away at the balances that were designed to slow certainty down.</p><p>What we don’t see is people panicking because of any specific outcome. The reason? Things change. Just wait a bit and balance should bring things back in order if it was a bad decision.</p><p>Don’t you think it’s interesting that panic actually comes from people reacting to systems when it’s those systems that feel like they’re being manipulated or unbalanced?</p><p>Madison would recognize the pattern immediately.<br />Ostrom would see the loss of shared constraint.<br />Mamdani would see identity doing more work than structure.</p><p>When a system becomes too easy to take advantage of, the people inside it start holding their positions tighter. Balance stops feeling like a responsibility and starts feeling like a betrayal. There’s an irony there that’s hard to miss.</p><p>The thing a plural society needs most is the first thing people abandon when they feel the least bit of instability.</p><p>And once identity becomes the primary way people organize themselves, even small adjustments feel like attacks. You’re not disagreeing with their idea; you’re threatening the category that idea is supposed to protect. The politics stops being about governance and becomes about defending a sense of self.</p><h3>Reflection</h3><p>This essay took me a while, but the longer I read about these three, the clearer the pattern becomes.</p><p>People cling to their ideas because the alternatives feel unsafe. Balance threatens certainty, and certainty is where people place their moral grounding.</p><p>But every system that survives (every republic, every community, every shared resource) survives for the same reason: it never lets one idea, one identity, or one group do all the work.</p><p>Madison designed for that.<br />Ostrom documented it.<br />Mamdani warns what happens when we lose it.</p><p>If the world feels louder or angrier than it used to, I don’t think it’s because we’re more divided. I think it’s because our desire for balance is getting weaker and it’s become a risk instead of a responsibility.</p><p>It doesn’t have to stay that way.</p><p>It just requires something we aren’t great at right now: looking at the bigger picture.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b14effc622b4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-one-idea-does-all-the-work-b14effc622b4"">When one idea does all the work</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Doing the right thing should be easy.</h4><figure><img alt=""Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*APj-7duB_TuT3mOR.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man</figcaption></figure><p>Human engineering isn’t what you might think. It’s not a eugenic nightmare of bioengineering and gene selection. Thank goodness, it’s much more benign. Instead, human engineering is a multi-disciplinary field that brings together psychologists, engineers, cognitive scientists, organizational behavioral specialists, and designers. Their goal is to make it easy for people to do the right thing. [Redacted: High brow <em>“A Clockwork Orange” </em>joke] Sometimes referred to as interaction design or cognitive ergonomics, the aim of <a href=""https://www.dau.edu/glossary/human-engineering"">human engineering</a> is to improve human performance by looking at <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860"">systems</a>.</p><p>Simply put, human engineering tries to make it easier to do the right thing and harder to do the wrong thing for any task or activity. This aim is achieved through the design (and alteration of existing designs) of the technology, systems, and environments that individuals interact with. Immediately we see the application of human engineering into the paradigm of system dynamics and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-architecture-of-human-error-ae69c732eb79"">human error</a>.</p><p>There are many principles of human engineering, but one of the most important is the importance of designing the interactions of humans and objects to <a href=""https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/human-compatible-engineering-value-alignment-in-artificial-intelligence-3ebb39222104"">align function with action</a>. To demonstrate, consider the very common scenario of turning on a burner on the kitchen stove.</p><h4>The Mysterious Case of the Wrong Burner</h4><p>Has it ever happened that you’ve gone to turn on the stove and lit the wrong burner? It’s not just you. It’s a very common problem and one of the most studied topics in the field of human engineering. Stoves are not advanced technology and lighting the stove only requires one turn of the knob. So how come we’re so prone to these simple mistakes?</p><p>The answer has to do with the way the alignment of form and function. Stovetops are tremendously bad at this alignment. Consider two popular configurations of commercial stoves:</p><figure><img alt=""Two stovetop configurations. One with knobs grouped, the other with them evenly spaced and linear."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/466/0*W7NsBm1XLq4jfD-G.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>In typical stove designs (let’s call them Configuration A and Configuration B), we see that the burners are aligned as a 2x2 rectangle, whereas the knobs are aligned linearly along the front. The knobs and the burners are configured differently. To use a technical term, we could say that these configurations have poor <a href=""https://uxplanet.org/designing-for-spatial-ux-in-ar-vr-a-beginner-to-advanced-guide-to-immersive-interface-design-c55f092deb0b?gi=debcdfcae8a8"">spatial compatibility</a>.</p><p>Configuration B is slightly better than Configuration A, because there is a natural grouping between the two burners and knobs on the left and the two burners and knobs on the right. Nevertheless, in this configuration errors will be common and proper use will rely on reading the labels on the knobs or trial and error. In short, it takes some level of cognitive effort, beyond intuition to ensure consistent proper use of the stove.</p><h4>The Better Way</h4><p>Now consider two slightly different configurations. In Configuration C the burners are still arranged in a 2x2 rectangle, but now, the knobs are also arranged in a similar way. There is a natural alignment between the controls and the device. No labels are needed.</p><figure><img alt=""Two (different) stovetop configurations. One forming a dimaond the other an arch shape"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/457/0*RxPGxuDmbpJLxyB2.png"" /><figcaption>Source: Design of Everyday Things</figcaption></figure><p>Configuration D provides another natural and intuitive layout, but this time maintains the linear arrangement of the knobs. Simply by bringing the two back burners closer together to align with the knobs, the stovetop has gone from an inscrutable, error-prone appliance to something that is intuitive and easy to use.</p><p>Without objection, we can see why the stovetop configurations in Configuration C and Configuration D are better. Not only will these configurations produce fewer errors and lead to more consistent and effective operation of the stove but they also rely on intuition and require less cognitive processing to achieve the greater result! A win-win!</p><p>Oh by the way, how much did the change cost? We used the same space, the same controls, and the same materials. We can decrease errors, build resiliency, and decrease the cognitive load without sizable investments! Win-Win-Win!</p><h4>The Principle of Spatial Compatibility</h4><p>What we’ve just witnessed is the principle of <strong>spatial compatibility </strong>in action. This principle states that controls should be arranged to correspond naturally with the devices they control. When there’s a clear, intuitive mapping between control and function, people simply know what to do. No thinking required. No labels needed. No errors made.</p><p>This might seem obvious when pointed out, but look around your environment. How many poorly designed interfaces do you interact with daily? How many times do you have to stop and think about which button does what? How often do you make “simple mistakes” that are actually design failures?</p><p>The stove example illustrates a profound truth:<strong> </strong><a href=""https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/humanvsdesignerror.html""><strong>most of what we attribute to human error is actually design error</strong></a><strong>. </strong>We blame ourselves for our mistakes when we should be blaming the systems we’re forced to work within.</p><h4>When Design Betrays You</h4><p>Stovetops are not the only place where we encounter human engineering in our daily lives. Even something as simple as a door can pose significant challenges to human-technology interaction (Yes, a door is technology). We’ve all been in that embarrassing situation where we push a door that should’ve been pulled and vice versa. But have you ever stopped to ask why you made an error? Take solace in knowing that it was the door’s fault and not your own.</p><p>These doors did you wrong. They betrayed you. They gave a signal that was incorrect, and your only fault was that you trusted them. Who knew that doors could be so deceitful? Take heart, this is a very common problem. One person who this has happened to a lot is <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/don-norman?srsltid=AfmBOop_maSfXFhLO5D93jNZZmHJpS8CVHLz0C-TGvc5aMKE9f66dhEk"">Don Norman</a>. Don knows a lot about these sorts of doors. Don has studied these doors so much that these species of doors are actually called “Norman Doors.”</p><p>In his book “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654"">The Design of Everyday Things</a>” he explains:</p><blockquote><em>“How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it…The design of the door should indicate how to work it without the needs of signs or trial and error.”</em></blockquote><h4>The Principle of Discoverability</h4><p>The chief way these doors betray the user is by abandoning another fundamental and important design principle, the principle of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/discoverability?srsltid=AfmBOoqcveYvH3s_TDQKAhmw5xqskniMY4RXp_QEpwXDtVGn9s-Pr4yW"">discoverability</a>. The principle of discoverability simply states that any designed object should make it clear to the user how to correctly use that object. In the case of the Norman door, not only did the door make it unclear, but it probably sent the exact opposite signal than what was required.</p><p>Consider a door with a horizontal push bar on it. That bar screams “PUSH ME!” to anyone who sees it. It’s a clear affordance — a visual cue about how the object should be used. Now imagine that same door with a “PULL” sign on it. The sign contradicts everything the door is telling you with its design. The horizontal bar is still there, still suggesting you should push, but now you’re supposed to ignore that signal and pull instead.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of a Norman door. A horizontal bar with a “Pull” label"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sw9GFNd08qM_ojY8.png"" /><figcaption>A Norman Door. Source: 99percentinvisible.org</figcaption></figure><p>This is fundamentally bad design. A well-designed pull door should have a vertical handle that you can grip. A well-designed push door should have a flat plate or push bar. The design itself should communicate the proper use without requiring any labels or explanations.</p><h4>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h4><p>The Norman door is an important example of human engineering in daily life because it showcases how the alignment of human action and the environment impacts our propensity to make mistakes. If something as simple, ordinary, and untechnical as a door can impact the decisions, efficiency, and productivity of individuals than how much more will this be true for complex systems.</p><p>Indeed, the inefficiencies of these everyday objects may seem trivial and insignificant but the underlying principles they demonstrate are anything but, especially when applied to industry. What these vignettes demonstrate is important and powerful. Using the same space and the same equipment for the stove, we nearly <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/mistake-proofing?srsltid=AfmBOoovPTOqO74WKlYiOk5XOyz1QlaFdxyiu7kEPCBfftUkOWoouHvx"">eliminated the possibility for error</a>. No rework, no guess and check, no errors, no need for labels, less thinking, no need to stop and think about the result of our actions and all for no money.</p><p>Human engineering is potent and powerful.</p><h4>The Core Principles of Human Engineering</h4><p>While there are many principles of human engineering, several stand out as particularly important for designing better systems:</p><p><strong>1. Spatial Compatibility:</strong> Controls should be arranged to naturally correspond with the things they control. The layout should be intuitive and obvious.</p><p><strong>2. Discoverability:</strong> The design should clearly communicate how something is meant to be used. Users shouldn’t have to guess or rely on labels and instructions.</p><p><strong>3. Feedback:</strong> The system should provide clear, immediate feedback about what’s happening. When you press a button, something should happen that confirms your action was received.</p><p><strong>4. Constraints:</strong> Good design constrains behavior in ways that prevent errors. If something can only be done one way, and that way is the correct way, errors become impossible.</p><p><strong>5. Mapping:</strong> There should be a clear relationship between controls and their effects. Natural mappings leverage existing knowledge and expectations. (I even created <a href=""http://sixsigma-consulting.com/tetris"">a fun Tetris game</a> you can to play to demonstrate this principle)</p><p><strong>6. Affordances:</strong> The design should suggest its own use. A handle affords pulling. A button affords pressing. A flat surface affords pushing.</p><h4>The Human-Centered Design Philosophy</h4><p>At its core, human engineering embodies a fundamental philosophy: when a person makes an error while using a system, it’s the system that failed, not the person. This perspective shift is revolutionary. Instead of training people harder, writing more procedures, or adding more warnings, we redesign the system so that errors become difficult or impossible to make.</p><p>This doesn’t mean humans are absolved of all responsibility. It means we recognize the reality of human limitations and capabilities, and we design accordingly. We accept that people will be distracted, tired, stressed, and forgetful. We acknowledge that people will sometimes be in a hurry, sometimes be interrupted, sometimes misremember.</p><p>Rather than fighting against human nature, human engineering works with it. Rather than demanding superhuman perfection, it creates systems where ordinary human performance is sufficient for excellent results.</p><h4>The Cognitive Load Consideration</h4><p>One of the most important benefits of good human engineering is the reduction of cognitive load. Every poorly designed interface, every ambiguous control, every unclear instruction adds to the mental burden people must carry. When you have to stop and think about which burner is which, or whether to push or pull a door, you’re <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">using cognitive resources that could be applied elsewhere</a>.</p><p>Good design frees up mental capacity. It allows you to focus on what matters rather than wrestling with interfaces. It reduces <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/decision-fatigue"">decision fatigue</a>. It makes the right choice the obvious choice, the easy choice, the path of least resistance.</p><p>Think about how exhausting it is to navigate a poorly designed website, a confusing form, or a cluttered workspace. Now think about how effortless it is to use a well-designed tool. That difference, that feeling of friction versus flow, is human engineering in action.</p><h4>Application Beyond Physical Objects</h4><p>While we’ve focused on physical examples like stoves and doors, human engineering principles apply to every system you interact with:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital interfaces:</strong> Are your most-used apps and tools intuitive, or do they require constant mental translation?</li><li><strong>Work processes:</strong> Do your workflows naturally guide you toward the right actions, or do they create opportunities for confusion?</li><li><strong>Personal routines:</strong> Are your habits supported by environmental design, or do they require constant willpower to maintain?</li><li><strong>Communication systems:</strong> Do your methods of staying informed and responsive flow naturally, or do they create constant friction?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A man’s hand inserting a card into an ATM"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mvMu1gqWP7PHccug.jpg"" /><figcaption>A pime example of good work processes, ATMs require you to take your card before your cash, making it unlikely you error (forget your card) Source: bankrate.com/</figcaption></figure><p>In each of these domains, the principles remain the same. Make the right thing easy. Make the wrong thing hard. Provide clear feedback. Create natural mappings. Reduce cognitive load.</p><h4>The Power of Environmental Design</h4><p>Human engineering reminds us that we don’t need to become better people to perform better. We need to create better systems. We don’t need more discipline, more willpower, more training. We need environments that support us rather than fight us.</p><p>This is liberating. It means improvement doesn’t require becoming someone you’re not. It requires thoughtfully designing the systems and environments you operate within. It means recognizing that when you consistently make the same “mistake,” it’s probably not your fault — it’s a design failure waiting to be fixed.</p><p>The question isn’t “How can I be more careful?” The question is “How can I redesign this system so being careful isn’t necessary?”</p><p>That’s the promise and power of human engineering.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=65e59d9ac6d8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/human-engineering-65e59d9ac6d8"">Human engineering</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

You can probably think of ten Christmas movies off the top of your head, but when it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/180821/thanksgiving-movies-on-netflix"">Thanksgiving movies</a>, that's not so easy. Even though, like Christmas, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/11/10172292/thanksgiving-alone"">Thanksgiving is a holiday when people spend hours</a> sitting around doing nothing but eating, but there aren't many feel-good Thanksgiving-specific movies to watch while you're doing all that sitting around. Make us some genuine Turkey Day rom-coms, Hollywood!<br /><br />Until that happens, there are actually <em>some</em> Thanksgiving movies out there. We've rounded up 14 of them, ranging from movies that are actually Thanksgiving-focused to good movies that that merely contain Thanksgiving scenes, to one that is definitively <em>not</em> about Thanksgiving because it definitively <em>is</em> about the mob. We have our reasons; just hear us out.<br /><br />But don't expect to get too many of the warm and cozy feelings with these Thanksgiving movies, like you do with Christmas films. A lot of them are about estranged family members and fights at the dinner table, whether they're dramas or comedies or some mix of the two. But, hey, maybe something a little emotional and relatable is what you need during this stressful time of year. <br /><br />If not, there's also a superhero movie on this list. In case you didn't know, Spider-Man eats Thanksgiving dinner, too. <figure><figcaption><h2><em>Addams Family Values</em></h2>Hear us out. Sure, <em>Addams Family Values </em>isn't fully about Thanksgiving, but it does have one of the most <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We_Ztqv9FJU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">iconic Thanksgiving scenes</a> in movie history. During a Thanksgiving play at Camp Chippewa, Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and her friends go rogue and decide to adapt their counselor's script to more accurately depict the real events that led to Thanksgiving and in true Wednesday fashion, mayhem ensues. If you love Wednesday on Netflix, this season is the perfect time to revisit this classic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Pieces of April</h3></em><br />Let's start with a movie that is explicitly about Thanksgiving. Katie Holmes stars in 2003's <em>Pieces of April</em>, a dramedy about a young woman who invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner in her New York City apartment. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Holidate </h3></em><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">Holidate</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">, which was dropped on Netflix</a> this year, is a Thanksgiving movie because it's an every holiday movie. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey star as two people who pretend to be dating at every holiday gathering that they're invited to in order to avoid questions about being single. Of course, they start to actually have feelings for each other. It's not great, but it's the closest we've got to a Thanksgiving rom-com right now.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sweet November</em></h2><br />Who doesn't love some romance and emotional manipulation over the holidays? <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/60004446"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sweet November</a></em>, starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, may have been panned by critics when it came out in 2001, but it's got a cult following of fans who love the sweet story of an overworked, selfish workaholic (Reeves) who falls for a free spirit (Theron) after moving in together for the month of November. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Oath</h3></em><br /><em>The Oath</em> is a comedy about a family who gets together for Thanksgiving just as the U.S. asks residents to sign a ""Patriot's Oath."" Things get more unhinged from there. Ike  Barinholtz, who also wrote and directed, and Tiffany Haddish star.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Home for the Holidays</h3></em><br /><em>Home for the Holidays</em> stars Holly Hunter as a single mom who visits her family for Thanksgiving after losing her job. Her wacky relatives include Robert Downey Jr. as her brother and Anne Bancroft as her mother. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Friendsgiving</h3></em><br />A group of friends — and a sassy mom played by Jane Seymour — get together at a big, gorgeous house for a Thanksgiving full of drinking and innuendos. Malin Åkerman, Aisha Tyler, Kat Dennings, Chelsea Peretti, and more make up the ensemble cast. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Miracle on 34th Street </h3></em><br />Yes, <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is a classic Christmas movie, but it's also technically a Thanksgiving movie since it starts with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The story about the parade's Santa (Edmund Gwenn) claiming to actually be the real Santa continues from there.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</h3></em><br />Steve Martin stars in <em>Planes,</em> <em>Trains and Automobiles</em> as a man who is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving, but due to a flight issue, ends up stuck with a traveling salesman (John Candy). They set off on an adventure filled with hijinks as they try to make their way to Chicago.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Krisha</h3></em><br />If you're in the mood for something dark this Thanksgiving, look no further than <em>Krisha</em>. It stars director Trey Edward Shults actual aunt Krisha Fairchild as a woman suffering from addiction, who visits her family for Thanksgiving after years of being estranged.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Ice Storm</h3></em><br />1995's <em>The Ice Storm </em>features all sorts of drama taking place during one family's Thanksgiving weekend in 1973. There's young love, an affair, a key party, and more.

<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">editor-favorite skincare brand Medik8</a> is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C serums</a> leave skin feeling itchy and red, but <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8’s C-Tetra</a> is built differently. It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>

<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>

<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>

So crave-worthy, Stegemann says this “foodie fragrance” sold out in 48 hours in more than 60 Sephora stores and immediately became the number two fragrance on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2F7-virtues"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sephora.com</a>. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>



<p>You might also like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fher-elixir-de-parfum-pimprod2034780%3Fsku%3D2599353"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry Her Elixir de Parfum</a>, which features strawberry, warm amber, and earthy sandalwood. Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>

<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: the best Black Friday deals.</p>



<p>All of your favorite retailers have rolled out all their Black Friday deals, making now the time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p>The rivalry between Puerto Ricans and Dominicans goes back decades. The neighboring islands, and their diasporas in the United States, compete over just about everything. The question of who’s better at baseball is settled nearly every year with a new headline matchup. <a href=""https://www.mlb.com/news/dominican-republic-beats-puerto-rico-at-citi-field-in-exhibition-game"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DR won an exhibition game</a> in New York on November 15, but <a href=""https://www.espn.com/world-baseball-classic/game/_/gameId/401500669/puerto-rico-dominican-republic"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Puerto Rico defeated them in the 2023</a> World Baseball Classic. In the kitchen, the feud is between Puerto Rico’s mofongo and the Dominican Republic’s mangú, two garlicky plantain staples. And in music, there’s the debates about who has more rhythm on the dancefloor and who makes more hits. An outsider might see these hilarious, albeit pointed, jabs thrown at each other on the Internet and think the two are really enemies, but Bad Bunny’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS World Tour</a> opening in Santo Domingo displayed what we have always known: It’s all playful love entre familia.</p>



<p>On November 21, the Puerto Rican three-time Grammy winner, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, kicked off his anticipated stadium world tour with two sold-out shows in the Dominican Republic’s capital. On night one, Bad Bunny, who Billboard named the <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/lists/bad-bunny-number-1-top-latin-artists-21st-century-chart/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top Latin artist of the 21st century</a>, greeted the crowd of about 50,000 people at Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez, saying, “I’ve really enjoyed being a tourist here, though I don’t know if ‘tourist’ is the right word, because when I’m here, I feel at home.” And everything about the show celebrated the shared heritage and close relationship the two islands have built together.</p>



<p>In the audience, Dominican women completed their concert outfits with Puerto Rican pava hats — or, as shouting street vendors throughout la Zona Colonial have renamed them, “el sombrero de Bad Bunny.” Meanwhile, Puerto Rican fans who missed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-residency-puerto-rico-what-to-do"">Bad Bunny’s historic 31-show residency</a> at San Juan’s El Choli made the short trip west to Santo Domingo, snapping photos in front of wall-length Dominican flags. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944803.jpeg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.hennessy.com/en-int/stories/hennessy-joins-forces-global-phenomenon-bad-bunny-his-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-world-tour"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hennessy</a>, the global presenting sponsor of the tour, created experiences that blended both cultures seamlessly right outside of the stadium and in Downtown Santo Domingo. In a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRX4E1okTpK/?hl=en&amp;img_index=4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hennessy-branded casita</a> by the show, Boris like model Joan Smalls y Domis like actress Dascha Polanco sat down to play dominoes, the two flags in the home, while Alex Sensation spun ’70s salsa and merengue típico. Fans refreshed from the Caribbean humidity with Hennessy De Coco, a spin on Pitorro de Coco that blends coconut, tropical fruits, and Hennessy, and Hennessy Pasión, a mix of passionfruit, lemonade, and Hennessy — two cocktails that will be available throughout the tour. At the activations, there was also a piragua stand serving cognac-infused versions of the shaved ice treat popular on Viejo San Juan’s cobblestone streets and classic Dominican chimis. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944800.jpeg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The blend made sense because most of us, those with roots in Borikén or Kiskeya, have known it our entire lives.</p>



<p>While our shared history can be traced back to the Taínos, the Indigenous people who once inhabited the islands of the Greater Antilles, and the Spanish conquest that brought violent genocide and African enslavement, less discussed is the solidarity that emerged from this joint struggle. For generations, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans have stood together, lending support and fighting alongside each other in anti-colonial and social justice movements. </p>



<p>To start, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10334054/dominican-republic-independence-day-history-haiti"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Dominican Republic’s fight for sovereignty</a>, first in 1821 and then in 1844, served as a symbolic and inspirational model for Puerto Rican nationalists. During their bids for independence in the nineteenth century, Puerto Rican revolutionaries often took refuge in Santo Domingo, where they could safely organize, network with nationalists across the Caribbean, and publish anti-colonial materials. In 1868, when Puerto Ricans first revolted against Spanish rule during <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/collections/puerto-rico-books-and-pamphlets/articles-and-essays/nineteenth-century-puerto-rico/rebellion-of-1868/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">el Grito de Lares</a>, they stitched a revolutionary flag featuring a white cross that divided the flag into four rectangles, a tribute to the Dominican flag and to the trans-Caribbean revolutionary network.</p>



<p>Decades later, now as a U.S. colony, the people of Puerto Rico are using the political power they do have to push back against the federal government’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">anti-immigrant policies in Puerto Rico</a>, which have predominantly targeted Dominican migrants. Boricuas regularly take to the streets to protest raids, deportations, and anti-immigrant legislation; organize food, clothing, and medical brigades to help Dominican families affected economically by the immigration crackdowns; and even shelter Dominican migrants in churches and community halls that have become safe havens.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Everything about the show celebrated the shared heritage and close relationship the two islands have built together.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A similar solidarity exists within the diaspora. In New York, where the playful rivalry between Puerto Ricans and Dominicans began in the 1970s — when Dominicans moved in large numbers to historically Boricua neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Washington Heights, and the Lower East Side — new forms of alliances emerged. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ice-targeting-latine-activists"">The Young Lords</a>, a Puerto Rican revolutionary group born out of Chicago that later expanded to New York, included many Dominican women and men who, together, fought for housing rights, education access, and community health programs that impacted both communities. At the same time, El Museo del Barrio in East Harlem served as one of a few hubs where Puerto Rican and Dominican youth collaborated on arts, education, and cultural projects.</p>



<p>Living side by side in housing projects throughout the city, both groups did what they, arguably, do better than anyone else: crack jokes. As my Puerto Rican dad who grew up in New York in the ‘70s tells me, no one was safe and everything was ripe for teasing: accents, who had slicker game with girls, and who had better rum. Over the years, those neighborhood quips carried on, with Puerto Rican men now laughing at how tight their Dominican friends wear their pants and Dominicans teasing their Puerto Rican brothers for dressing like they are in an early-2000s Peedi Crakk music video. </p>



<p>A comedic skit called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV0zpqnnGD4"">“Puerto Ricans vs. Dominicans,”</a> published by Flama in 2015, captures the playful beef perfectly. In the five-minute clip, two men go back and forth, hilariously debating which culture has better style, music, and food, only to have a mom in rolos intervene, revealing that the two are actually brothers, each both Puerto Rican and Dominican.</p>







<p>And that’s the other reality: In the diaspora, Puerto Rican and Dominican communities often intermingle, forming families that bond us even closer. Are you even Puerto Rican if you don’t have a Dominican tío? Are you even Dominican if you don’t have a prima who’s half-Bori and a few other distant relatives who have lived in Puerto Rico for decades? We are, quite literally, family. During Bad Bunny’s second show in Santo Domingo this weekend, he brought out <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/romeo-santos-bad-bunny-bokete-bachata-performance-dr-1236120631/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Romeo Santos</a>, who is of both Dominican and Puerto Rican descent, to perform a bachata version of “BOKeTE.” And so many of our favorite stars in music, film, TV, and social media share the same mix, too. Our identities are braided together like the knotted fibers of Taíno baskets, a shared ancestral practice I only just learned about during my recent visit to <a href=""https://casadelcordon.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Centro Cultural Taíno Casa del Cordón</a> in Santo Domingo.</p>



<p>A guy I used to date, who just so happens to be Dominican, used to always tell me, “Where there is a Puerto Rican, there is a Dominican nearby.” And he wasn’t wrong. From New York and New Jersey down through Worcester, Allentown, and Orlando, there are entirely blended neighborhoods. We coalesce because we know that, despite all the jokes and competition, we see and understand each other. Our food and music are seasoned with the same stuff. Our accents and slang may be different, but we understand each other’s dialects more easily than anyone else’s. We feel safe together. We feel at home. And like siblings who play-fight but will throw hands at anyone who really comes for their family, we tease each other relentlessly, and hilariously, con amor y respeto.   </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We are two cultures, two nations, and two islands that have fought conquest, injustice, and generations of marginalization in the Caribbean and in the States — y todavía estamos aquí, juntos, teasing each other, y bien cabrón.”</p><cite>Raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that’s why, when I threw my hands in the air and bounced euphorically at Bad Bunny’s show in DR this weekend, screaming, “Puerto Rico,” mi tierrita, “está bien cabrón,” there were tens of thousands of Dominicans around me leaping and yelling it, too — and meaning it. </p>



<p>It’s also why I teared up when Benito ended that performance declaring, “la República Dominicana está cabrón también.” Because we are two cultures, two nations, and two islands that have fought conquest, injustice, and generations of marginalization in the Caribbean and in the States — y todavía estamos aquí, juntos, teasing each other, y bien cabrón.<br /></p>
