<p>""We know we are not born to die,"" often said Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. ""We are born to continue."" In architecture, this idea of continuity lies at the heart of heritage, not as a static inheritance, but as something that endures, transforms, and is constantly reinterpreted. Yet what continues, and what is allowed to disappear, is never neutral. Decisions about preservation are shaped by power, memory, and value, raising a fundamental question for contemporary practice: who defines what is worth carrying forward, and for whom?</p>",

<p>""In various regions of the planet, nature imposes adverse conditions on the human body. In these places, designing a building is almost like creating a garment: an artifact that protects and offers comfort. This challenge requires technological performance that must be combined with aesthetics. Making human beings feel good involves more than just meeting notions of comfort and safety; it's also a question of working with spaces in their symbolic and perceptual dimensions."" This is the beginning of the description for the design of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/946070/comandante-ferraz-antarctic-station-studio-41"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brazilian Antarctic Station in Antarctica, by Estúdio 41</a>, located on the Keller Peninsula, where the surrounding sea freezes for around six to seven months of the year, where everything and everyone arrives by plane or ship and the nearest hardware store is days away. If designing a building in normal circumstances already presents numerous complexities, it's not hard to imagine the additional challenges when developing something in an extreme environment, such as locations with very high or low temperatures, or in places susceptible to corrosion, radiation, and more. In this article, we will explore the difficulties, the main solutions and the materials used in these contexts.</p>",

<p>""The Memory of the River"" is a project located at the intersection of public art and ephemeral architecture, conceived as a transitory infrastructure capable of reactivating urban spaces in the city of Bogot&aacute; through cultural uses. The initiative arises from the Secretariat of Culture, Recreation and Sports (SCRD) with Secretary Santiago Trujillo, the Director of Art, Culture, and Heritage Diego Parra, and structured by the Subdirectorate of Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage of the Secretariat, led by Edgar Figueroa, with a team composed of: Edgar Bernal, Emmanuel Guerra, Juliana Mendoza, Diego Rodr&iacute;guez, and Juan Sebasti&aacute;n Robayo. <strong>They advocate for a temporary intervention&mdash;instead of a permanent one&mdash;as a strategy to decentralize cultural uses and allow different neighborhoods in the city to host their activities.</strong></p>",

When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event.

This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop.

<h4>The one with React, Tailwind and the separation of concerns</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZN4DxRu31nQssMHRuFCTg.png"" /></figure><p>When I started learning about web development I learned clean HTML, vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, which are three different ways of saying: “No Frameworks”.</p><p>That’s the way most developers learned to code, at least in my age group, since we didn’t have any framework other than jQuery back then, and AI coding assistants weren’t a thing yet.</p><p>Years later I did learn React (a JavaScript framework) and I did had to get to know Tailwind (a CSS framework) for work projects so everyone in the development team would be on the same page.</p><p>For years I didn’t understand why React or Tailwind worked in the way they did, I felt frustrated because every little thing seemed to require more work then in plain JavaScript or CSS.</p><p>I didn’t think those frameworks save me much time or work in the long run and I was annoyed that I had to use them every day.</p><p>When I asked other developers about that, they often cited the concept of “separation of concerns” as a reason that makes React simpler to use or more suitable for team projects.</p><p>At the time I didn’t get it. But now — after years of working with React and Tailwind I think I’m finally getting it. If you’re anything like I was, confused or frustrated about it, please keep reading.</p><h3>What is separation of concerns</h3><p>Separation of concerns is a programming term that means that any “problem” can be separated into smaller and easier to deal with “concerns”.</p><p>In our example the “concerns” are just long code that is hard to grasp all at once. HTML has a few ways of dealing with code that is too complex already built-in to the technology.</p><p>One way we can handle code that’s too long is to separate it into different files — HTML for the content, CSS for the styles and JavaScript (js files) for functions.</p><p>This way you can more easily separate the different areas you’re dealing with: HTML for the structure, CSS when you handle the design and JavaScript when you handle the hardcore programming stuff.</p><figure><img alt=""The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0KoD-Ccdg_1Qg2R3p4b1qA.png"" /><figcaption>The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course in real projects every file will be in multiples, multiple HTML files for different pages (or parts of pages), multiple CSS files for different aspects of the design and multiple JavaScript files for different kinds of functions.</p><p>As the project goes up in complexity the pile of files gets bigger and it is murky at best where is the line to split the files.</p><p>If we’ll take for example CSS files, as it is closest to the design aspect and so easier to explain, we have multiple options how to slice it:</p><ol><li>Maybe just to work with one huge file</li><li>Slicing it to smaller files by platform: Desktop.css, Mobile.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by components: Header.css, Footer.css, Button.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by pages: Index.css, About.css, Contact.css … General.css</li><li>Slicing it by function: Common.css, Breakpoints.css, Vars.css etc.</li></ol><p>It isn’t clear at all where to draw the line of separation and I’ve seen many teams do it in very different ways, sometimes even combining more than one option unintentionally.</p><p>So how can React and Tailwind help us to decide?</p><h3>The component based approach</h3><p>Let me preface what I’m about to say with that, like HTML, there’s lots of ways of making a React app.</p><p>The most common way is to separate each component into its own file, so we’ll end up with files named Button.jsx, Checkbox.jsx, Avatar.jsx, Card.jsx etc.</p><p>These components get imported into different screens with different configurations (via props) so the code inside the components will potentially get replicated an infinite amount of times.</p><p>Unlike HTML, we don’t need to manually copy the code to different places and different files, we just import the component and React will swap its code into every place we’ve called it from.</p><p>If we’re thinking about the separation of concerns, what React does is very different from HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript .</p><figure><img alt=""React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*7qEbNSNibMNpTJg7SqU1PA.png"" /><figcaption>React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file</figcaption></figure><p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript separate our concerns into multiple areas of responsibility, while React takes a different approach.</p><p>React separates our concerns based on component structure, so different developers can work on different components without bumping into one another.</p><p>But they’re all React developers, no longer a CSS specialist or an HTML architect, everyone is doing the same kind of work but on different building blocks.</p><p>The distinction here is major since it slices the work for optimization rather than for specialization, which is almost the opposite approach.</p><h3>Entering Tailwind CSS</h3><p>Tailwind is a very popular CSS framework that works as a utility framework meaning all styles are done with inline classes instead of a big giant stylesheet.</p><p>This way you can copy and paste components from different layouts and ensure they will look exactly the same, of course when working with React components, the component gets imported into many layouts, pages or screens so consistency is key — and Tailwind enables just that.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*huR5zgz0VL57FIMgfHXKlA.png"" /><figcaption>The same button 3 times (left to right): Pure HTML/CSS, Tailwind, rendered result.</figcaption></figure><p>If this is your first time seeing Tailwind code, I implore you to go and try it out, it’s not as strange to work with as it might seem at first glance and it is much better than making inline styles.</p><p>Now that every codebase is in some degree written with AI I can’t stress this enough — Tailwind is much better than regular inline styles, if you’re a CSS purist working with a stylesheet file or files that’s great, even a simple inline style here and there is mostly fine.</p><p>But never let the AI just make lots and lots of inline styles for everything, always ask to convert them to another file or just to work with Tailwind, inline styles are unmaintainable in the long run.</p><p>I know what you must be thinking when encountering Tailwind, and it’s the title of the next section.</p><figure><img alt=""Now we don’t have any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx, jsx or js file)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*ps_lonYDcBT14XsvgL6TVw.png"" /><figcaption>When working with Tailwind we don’t need any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx or jsx file)</figcaption></figure><h3>What happened to separation of concerns?</h3><p>I know that at first it looks like our separation of concerns is gone, React already implements all the HTML (via JSX) and the JavaScript in the same files.</p><p>Tailwind CSS takes it even further and it pulls the CSS utility classes into the JSX as well, instead of leaving them on separate files.</p><p>That way we don’t get any separation by areas anymore, the functions, design and structure all live together.</p><p>What we DO get, however, is separation by component, which can be more useful for big teams who work on the same system or same project together.</p><p>Separation by component means that even though a developer might be working on all the different areas of an Avatar component, the same developer doesn’t need to be concerned about the Button component while doing it.</p><p>Tailwind CSS ensures that all components will be designed as planned, even if they were designed in isolation, outside the system itself, since its utility classes are all deterministic by design and no style should ever leak outside its intended scope.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Separation of concerns is subjective and it is done differently in different systems, React and Tailwind do it component-based while pure HTML and CSS are more area-based.</p><p>There is no right answer to how you should do it, but consistency is key, especially when working in a team.</p><p>Guidelines and best practices are great, but a separation that is inherit to the technology itself will always be better since everyone in the team can agree on it.</p><p>When we consider a separation of concerns based on areas of expertise we can also consider to hire a CSS specialist, for example, but a Button specialist is not currently a job title, and maybe it should be as React and Tailwind becomes more popular.</p><p>I didn’t touch on all the ways to separate CSS into multiple files and achieve something similar to component-based separation of concerns in pure HTML and CSS because I don’t believe it’s the right way to go when working in large teams.</p><p>There are a million technologies out there and a million ways to solve this issue, but I picked React and Tailwind as an example since it’s a very popular solution.</p><p>This article only scratched the surface.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed it, thanks

<h4>What we can learn from Linear about trusting judgement without ignoring evidence</h4><figure><img alt=""Migrating flock of birds, silhoutte on a sunset sky."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nUcS3dsfo9Mw2Xgu"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@the_ova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Otinov</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Data feels objective, defensible, and safe. In many product teams, it has quietly become the most powerful decision-maker in the room — not because it consistently leads to better outcomes, but because it removes personal accountability. When a decision can be justified with numbers, no one has to truly own it.</p><blockquote>“Although you may think that people instinctively want to make the best possible decision, there is a stronger force that animates business decision-making: the desire not to get blamed or fired.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><p>‘Data-driven design’ is often framed as maturity. In practice, it can become a way to defer judgement, smooth over disagreement, and default to the option that will attract the least resistance. The result isn’t better products — it’s safer ones. Incremental improvements which optimise what already exists, while bolder ideas are quietly filtered out because they can’t yet be proven.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that data doesn’t make decisions, people do. Data can inform, challenge, and validate — but it can’t decide what <em>should</em> exist, only describe what <em>has</em> happened before. When teams hide behind metrics, they’re not being rigorous; they’re avoiding the risk that comes with choosing a direction and standing behind it.</p><blockquote>“It’s important to remember that big data all comes from the same place — the past.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><h3>How Linear balances judgement and evidence</h3><p>In an interview reflecting on Linear’s design philosophy, co-founder and designer Karri Saarinen speaks directly about the limits of “<a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=wTvMaV6-txFSlIa4"">hiding behind data</a>” and the harder work of judgement. <a href=""https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1706745692965027994"">He describes how teams often lean on quantitative signals because they’re afraid of making the wrong choice — and how data becomes a comforting shield.</a> But that safety is an illusion. Data doesn’t make choices for you; it only reports what has already happened.</p><p>Too much deference to metrics doesn’t just slow teams down — it actively pushes them toward incrementalism. When evidence is treated as a prerequisite for action rather than an input into judgement, bold ideas struggle to survive long enough to be tested.</p><p>What’s striking in Saarinen’s thinking is his insistence that product teams should feel empowered to decide based on a deep understanding of the problem, and rich context gained from direct engagement with users and the product — not just dashboards or scoreboard metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Linear product management platform, showing the sleek, clean interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*acTrxuSLfk04FWlNXWH6Jg.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Linear is a product development tool built with an unusually strong emphasis on craft, clarity, and focus — designed by people who believe good software should feel deliberate.</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://linear.app/now/why-is-quality-so-rare"">At Linear, design isn’t something you outsource to analytics — it’s a product philosophy.</a> They pursue quality not as a growth tactic or a differentiator, but because they believe good software should be well made. Craft isn’t justified by metrics; it’s a responsibility the team chooses to take seriously.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-linear-builds-product"">Rather than waiting for perfect metrics before acting, Linear routinely builds features and ships them to internal users or small opt-in groups early — even when the experience is rough.</a> This accelerates learning, sharpens judgement, and creates real feedback long before broad exposure. Engineers and designers are encouraged to own problems end-to-end, including small inefficiencies that may not yet register in analytics, but materially affect the lived experience of users.</p><h4>Data is a tool, not a crutch</h4><p>Saarinen points out that teams often invoke data when they’re afraid to own a decision. At Linear, they don’t rely on exhaustive ranking exercises or metric-driven roadmaps to determine direction. Instead, decisions emerge from a blend of:</p><ul><li>Direct customer conversations and qualitative feedback</li><li>Founders’ and team intuition, shaped by deep product familiarity</li><li>Contextual signals from real usage</li></ul><p>Data is still present, but it becomes one signal in a broader conversation, not the authority that ends it.</p><blockquote>“Data isn’t bad — it’s just not the decision-maker.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Build with confidence, fail fast, and fix things</h4><p>Linear treats mistakes as an expected part of building good products. This flips the narrative from fear to responsibility. Designers and product leads aren’t protected by metrics; they’re accountable for choices — and expected to correct them quickly when they’re wrong.</p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes we make the wrong choice, and then we just fix it — but at least </em>we<em> made the choice, and the data didn’t make the choice for us.”</em></blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Safe decisions are rarely transformative</h4><p>Safe decisions are rarely transformative — and transformative decisions are rarely safe. Direction at Linear is chosen through judgement informed by deep engagement with users, even when the metrics haven’t caught up yet.</p><p>By combining context, craft, judgement, and fast feedback loops, teams can avoid both extremes: blind intuition on one side, and the paralysis of waiting for perfect data on the other.</p><h3>What we can learn from Linear</h3><h4><strong>Ship early and often</strong></h4><p>Don’t wait for perfect analytics before releasing. Internal launches and small cohorts create faster, richer learning than prolonged analysis ever will.</p><h4>Build shared product understanding</h4><p>Distribute customer stories, recordings, and qualitative insights. When context is shared, judgement becomes defensible without needing a dashboard to prove every choice.</p><h4>Treat data as input, not authority</h4><p>Use metrics to inform and challenge intuition, not replace it. Data should contribute to decisions — not make them by default.</p><h4>Give designers space to pursue craft</h4><p>Quality isn’t always measurable upfront, but it’s immediately felt.

<h4>AI can conjure photorealistic faces and dreamy landscapes in seconds, but ask it to write “Happy Birthday” on a cake and things get weird fast. The culprit is how these models learn to read, and the solution is trickier than it seems.</h4><p>Imagine you’ve just prompted your chosen AI image generator to create a stunning fashion advertisement for a major platform. The colours are gorgeous, the composition is beautifully balanced, and the lighting would make any photographer jealous. There’s just one small problem: the text reads “SHOP NUG.” Close, but not quite.</p><figure><img alt=""Four identical fashion ads with increasingly garbled AI-generated text, showing errors like ‘SHUP NOY,’ ‘DISGVER YUR SFYLE,’ and ‘SUMMILER COLLECION’ instead of proper words."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JpH8f3y4pOZpYh5Mlbg1iQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>If this sounds familiar, you’re certainly not alone. Despite remarkable leaps in AI-generated imagery over the past few years, text rendering remains the Achilles’ heel of even the most sophisticated models. And here’s the kicker: whilst generation has been steadily improving, <em>editing</em> that garbled text after the fact is proving to be an even thornier challenge.</p><p>So, what gives?</p><h3><strong>The fundamental mismatch</strong></h3><p>The truth is, AI image generators don’t actually “read” text. At all. When you ask <a href=""https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/"">DALL-E</a> or <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com/"">Midjourney</a> to include words in an image, the model isn’t processing language. It’s simply pattern-matching shapes it has seen before in training data.</p><p>Traditional text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion perceive text as a collection of pixels and visual elements to composite into the scene, not as meaning-conveying strings of characters. The model has seen millions of images containing billboards, book covers, and street signs, but it was never explicitly taught what those squiggles <em>mean</em> or how they follow strict rules of spelling and grammar.</p><p>This creates a fundamental mismatch. Text is precise and unforgiving: one wrong letter changes everything (“STOP” versus “ST0P”, anyone?). Images, by contrast, are fluid and interpretive. A face can be slightly asymmetrical and still look human. A landscape can have unusual lighting and still feel real. But misspell a single word? The illusion shatters.</p><h3><strong>How diffusion actually works (in broad strokes)</strong></h3><p>To understand why text is such a headache, it helps to peek behind the curtain at how these models generate images in the first place.</p><p>Most modern AI image generators use something called <a href=""https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/"">diffusion models</a>. The basic idea is surprisingly elegant. During training, the model learns to gradually add noise to images until they become pure static, then reverses this process by removing noise step-by-step to recover coherent pictures.</p><p>When you type a prompt, it gets processed through a text encoder (typically <a href=""https://openai.com/index/clip/"">CLIP</a>) that converts your words into numerical representations. These embeddings then guide the denoising process, steering the random noise towards something resembling your description.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI image generation workflow in five steps: 1) Prompt (text input), 2) Encode (AI processes text), 3) Denoise (removes visual noise shown as dots), 4) Refine (improves image composition), 5) Output (final image). Illustrated with simple icons connected by arrows flowing left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q2BzL8FhuLaDKns0UbFJ5g.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>The problem? Fine details like individual letters are treated as low-priority during the early denoising steps. Errors get “baked in” early and become <a href=""https://dev.to/tracywhodoesnot/why-ai-struggles-with-text-in-image-generation-n69"">incredibly difficult to correct later in the process</a>. The model is essentially guessing letter shapes with no feedback loop to verify whether its guess makes any linguistic sense.</p><p>There’s also the tokenisation issue. When CLIP processes text, it splits words into tokens, and sometimes those splits break apart the very concepts it’s trying to understand. “Deep focus,” for instance, gets tokenised into separate pieces, losing the photographic meaning entirely. The same fragmentation happens with the text <em>in</em> your images, making coherent words harder to reconstruct.</p><h3><strong>Generation is getting better — editing, not so much</strong></h3><p>Now for some good news: text generation in AI images has improved dramatically. Newer models are making genuine strides, and the gap between “absolutely wrong” and “actually usable” has narrowed considerably over the past year or so.</p><p>The improvement isn’t accidental. Companies have specifically invested in solving this problem, recognising that text accuracy is a dealbreaker for commercial applications. After all, nobody wants to hand a client an otherwise perfect AI-generated mockup with “BSET PRCIES” plastered across it.</p><p><a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a>, a platform built specifically with typography in mind, is said to be achieving now roughly <a href=""https://pxz.ai/blog/ideogram-vs-midjourney-2026"">95% accuracy on text prompts</a>, a remarkable leap compared to Midjourney’s approximately 40%. The company claims its latest model reduces text error rates by <a href=""https://the-decoder.com/ideogram-1-0-outshines-midjourney-and-dall-e-3-with-impressive-text-rendering/"">nearly half compared to DALL-E 3</a>. For designers who need readable words on posters, logos, and social media graphics, this could be genuinely transformative.</p><p>But does it really stand up to scrutiny? In the first example below, I asked it to generate a bookshelf with popular titles on product design, with the text clearly visible. The results showed significant errors (“Don’t Make Me Think” became “DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK,”) and other titles were similarly garbled. Next, I provided a specific list of books and authors. The outcome? Still riddled with text errors, suggesting that Ideogram’s touted 95% accuracy claim falls short in actual use cases that require heavy text generation. It may fare better with simpler, single-text prompts, but complex scenarios remain problematic.</p><figure><img alt=""Two AI-generated images of design book bookshelves side by side. Left image shows books with text errors including ‘DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK’ and garbled versions of titles like ‘The Design of Everyday Things,’ ‘About Face,’ ‘Lean UX,’ and ‘Atomic Design.’ Right image shows even more severely garbled text with ‘DO ON’ OK ME THIK,’ ‘ROOK LE,’ ‘DEUNNEWE UMBI BOULE,’ and ‘LEZCEDR’ demonstrating AI’s failure to render accurate book spine text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ieWpXulhkEfhTa5bjnVPw.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.recraft.ai/blog/comparing-popular-and-high-performing-text-to-image-models-and-providers"">Recraft V3</a>, another newcomer, has also positioned itself as a leader in accurate text rendering, claiming “flawless results with every prompt.” A bold assertion, but the benchmarks suggest it’s not far off.</p><p>So if generation is improving, why is editing still such a mess?</p><h3><strong>The short answer: context preservation</strong></h3><p>When generating an image from scratch, the model has complete creative freedom. It can place text wherever it likes, choose fonts that play nicely with its capabilities, and build the entire composition around what it knows it can render well.</p><p>Editing is a different beast entirely. When you ask an AI to fix garbled text on an existing image (through inpainting or other techniques) the model must preserve everything <em>around</em> the text whilst only modifying the specific region you’ve highlighted. This is where things get complicated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1614608/full"">Research on latent diffusion models for inpainting</a> shows that when applied to large or irregular regions, these models “tend to generate blurry or contextually ambiguous reconstructions.” The model fills in details based on surrounding context and learned patterns, which simply isn’t precise enough for the exact letter shapes that text requires.</p><p>In practical terms? The AI might successfully remove your gibberish text, but when it tries to paint new letters into that space, it struggles to match the exact style, lighting, and perspective of the original image. The result often looks patched rather than seamless.</p><h3><strong>Why you’re not imagining things</strong></h3><p>If editing feels harder than generating, the data backs you up. A <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">2025 benchmark study published in MDPI</a> evaluated multiple AI models across text accuracy metrics and found that all major platforms (including DALL-E 3, Ideogram, and Stable Diffusion) face “significant challenges with text accuracy” across domains like code, chemical diagrams, and multi-line text.</p><p>The scores are telling. For code-related text, Stable Diffusion scored just 1.25 out of 5 for text accuracy. Even Ideogram, the supposed text champion, managed only 1.75 in the same category. When it comes to complex, structured text requiring precise formatting, all models struggle.</p><p>Platform comparisons in 2025 reflect this reality. <a href=""https://apatero.com/blog/image-to-image-ai-transformation-comparison-2025"">Image-to-image tools vary significantly</a>, with Midjourney notably lacking “true inpainting and transformation controls.” For users who do heavy editing work, local Stable Diffusion with ControlNet remains the go-to option. However, that requires technical expertise most casual users might simply not have.</p><h3><strong>The workarounds (for now)</strong></h3><p>Until AI cracks this particular nut, what’s a designer to do? A few strategies have emerged, each with their own trade-offs.</p><p><strong>Use text-first generators.</strong> If you know you’ll need accurate typography, start with <a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a> or similar text-focused tools rather than trying to force words into Midjourney’s artistic outputs. It’s a case of picking the right tool for the job; you wouldn’t edit a feature film in PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Dual monitor setup showing AI workflow: left screen displays AI-generated coffee shop interior without text, right screen shows the same image in Photoshop with ‘Daily Brew Co.’ text overlay being added. Design tool logos (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, Affinity Designer) surround the monitors on the right side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_KEoHpKYJ9mBavQCGm33XA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Generate first, add text later.</strong> Many professionals now create their AI imagery text-free, then overlay typography using traditional design tools like Photoshop, Canva, or Figma. It’s an extra step, but the results are far more reliable. This approach also gives you complete control over font selection, kerning, and placement; things AI still handles clumsily at best.</p><p><strong>Try dedicated fix-it tools.</strong> Platforms like <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-gibberish-text-in-ai-generated-images/"">Storia Lab’s Textify</a> or Canva’s Grab Text tool can identify gibberish text and attempt to replace it. Results vary (patience is required) but for simple corrections, they can save considerable headaches. Just don’t expect miracles with complex multi-line text or heavily stylised typography.</p><p><strong>Embrace the hybrid workflow.</strong> As one industry comparison put it, “many professionals use both platforms,” generating artistic foundations in Midjourney, then handling typography in Ideogram. It’s not elegant, and it requires subscriptions to multiple services, but it works. Think of it as assembling a toolkit rather than searching for a single magic wand.</p><p><strong>Keep expectations realistic.</strong> Perhaps the most important strategy is simply managing client and stakeholder expectations. AI-generated imagery is powerful, but it has clear limitations. Flagging potential text issues upfront saves awkward conversations down the line.</p><h3><strong>What this means for designers and UX professionals</strong></h3><p>Beyond the technical challenges, there’s a broader conversation here about workflow and expectations. As AI tools become more embedded in creative processes, understanding their limitations isn’t just nice-to-have knowledge; it’s essential professional competence.</p><p>For UX writers and content designers, this has particular relevance. If you’re working with teams that use AI-generated imagery, you need to factor text limitations into your content strategy. That punchy headline might look great in a mockup, but will it survive the AI rendering process intact? Sometimes the answer is simply: maybe not.</p><p>And let’s be honest, there’s something almost poetic about AI mastering the creation of human faces whilst fumbling with human writing. It’s a reminder that these tools, however impressive, aren’t magic. They’re sophisticated pattern-matching systems with specific strengths and equally specific blind spots.</p><h3><strong>What’s on the horizon?</strong></h3><p>The research community hasn’t given up. Several promising approaches are in development:</p><ul><li><strong>Hybrid AI systems</strong> that generate a base image through one model, then overlay text using a separate, specialist module designed specifically for accurate placement. Think of it as mimicking how human designers work: creating the visual first, then adding captions as a final step.</li><li><strong>Better training data.</strong> Most current datasets lack properly labelled, structured text within images. Training on annotated text data could help models understand not just where text appears, but what it actually says and how words are properly formed.</li><li><strong>Vector-based rendering.</strong> Some teams are exploring ways to separate text from raster imagery entirely, treating typography as a discrete, editable layer rather than baking it into pixels. This would fundamentally change how text is handled, moving from pattern-matching to something closer to actual typesetting.</li><li><strong>OCR feedback loops.</strong> Imagine a model that generates text, runs optical character recognition to check its own work, and iterates until the spelling is correct. This kind of self-correction mechanism could dramatically reduce errors, though it would add computational overhead.</li></ul><h3><strong>Spelling it out</strong></h3><p>AI image generation has come a long way in a remarkably short time. Photorealistic faces, impossible architecture, dreamlike landscapes — all conjured from a few words typed into a prompt box. But text, that most human of visual elements, remains stubbornly resistant.</p><p>The core issue isn’t laziness or neglect. It’s architectural. Diffusion models were designed to see images holistically, not to parse the precise, rule-bound structures that make written language work. Generation is improving because researchers are training dedicated models for the task. Editing lags behind because preserving context whilst fixing details is a fundamentally harder problem.</p><p>For now, the practical advice is straightforward: plan for text limitations, use the right tool for the job, and don’t be afraid to bring in traditional design software for the finishing touches.

<h4><em>Why data tables are an accessibility blind-spot (and how WCAG helps)</em></h4><p>Data tables are used in many different products and contexts. They are used in dashboards, product comparisons, or even internal finance reports. They help users make decisions, spot data patterns, and take action where needed.</p><p><strong>But when it comes to accessibility, data tables are often skipped.</strong> They’re assumed to be handled by default HTML or put off until the development stage.</p><p>Visually, the tables look easy to read with clear columns and rows, as well as distinct headers. But for many users (like those using screen readers or keyboard navigation), these tables can become confusing or even unusable.</p><figure><img alt=""Example data tables from IBM Carbon and Salesforce Lightning design systems"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V2pdiWu3IGVeuqcTJI_yRw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Many open-source data tables are available via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-datatable-basic--overview""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--base""><em>Salesforce Lightning</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Just to be clear; WCAG doesn’t prohibit data tables, it just requires that the table’s information, relationships, and functionality are available to all users.</strong> Not only that, you don’t need complex solutions to have both data tables and WCAG-compliant designs.</p><p>Let’s break down why data tables are frequently overlooked, what WCAG requires of them, and how designers and product teams can create accessible data tables.</p><h3>Why are tables an accessibility blind-spot?</h3><p>To be fair, data tables sit in an awkward spot between design and development. They feel too technical to be a pure design problem, but also feel too visual to be treated as just code. As a result, accessibility issues slip through the cracks.</p><p>But what specific issues come from neither design or dev taking full ownership of tables?</p><h4>Tables lack semantic structure</h4><p>Visually, most tables appear easy to scan with aligned column headers and distinguished rows. But when this same structure isn’t communicated properly in the code, assistive technologies lose the context that sighted users get visually.</p><p><strong>Without proper header associations, a screen reader (like Voiceover or NVDA) may announce a value without indicating which column or row it belongs to.</strong></p><p>For instance, let’s say there is a data table depicting the concerts you attended last year. A sighted user can easily understand when and where each concert was, but a screen reader announces “12 February” without the associated concert it corresponds to.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table example with header cells named Date, Event, Venue in the top row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m6eIsbk0X6ngwuwkpiQeAQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table example with header cells in the top row via </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/#table-with-header-cells-in-the-top-row-only""><em>W3 WAI tutorials</em></a></figcaption></figure><pre>&lt;table&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Venue&lt;/th&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;12 February&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Waltz with Strauss&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Main Hall&lt;/td&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  […]<br />&lt;/table&gt;</pre><h4>Design Systems with information gaps</h4><p><strong>Many Design Systems include a table component, but sometimes they don’t clarify how the component should be used in the wild.</strong> The guidance leaves open questions about accessibility, like:</p><ul><li>When should a table be used instead of a list?</li><li>How should sorting behave?</li><li>What happens when data is empty, truncated, or loading?</li></ul><p>Without explicit standards, tables used by different teams behave differently, and accessibility becomes inconsistent.</p><h4>Added interactions without accessibility</h4><p>Modern tables are typically dynamic with sortable columns, selectable rows, and inline actions. But these interaction patterns are layered on top of the table without clear guidance on keyboard behavior, focus order, or screen reader announcements.</p><p><strong>When accessibility is addressed late in development, teams might add impromptu ARIA attributes instead of designing inclusively from the start.</strong> This results in a table that “functions,” but feels unpredictable or exhausting to navigate with only a keyboard.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table with batch actions as an example from IBM Carbon Storybook"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gxIqfbG4PyAO04wG_Sk3WA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table with batch actions via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable-batch-actions--default""><em>IBM Carbon Storybook</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>Anatomy of an accessible data table</h3><h4>Overall structure</h4><ul><li>Rows and columns reflect the data’s relationships (not just visual alignment)</li><li>Headers clearly describe the content they correspond to</li><li>Reading order matches how the data is meant to be understood</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Okr49IcRO2jl9hwhoNUSdA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row; via </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/""><em>Google Sheets</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Data relationships</h4><ul><li>Individual values connect to both their column and their row headers (even in multi-dimensional tables)</li><li>Context is communicated through programmatic associations (not only by visual means like spacing or alignment)</li><li>Users navigate cell by cell and understand the data as a whole</li></ul><h4>Predictable navigation</h4><ul><li>Filters, column headers, and actions have clear labels</li><li>Keyboard focus is always visible on the data table</li><li>Focus (tab) order aligns with the visual and logical layout of the table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Dell’s Design System includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CEFgqCp5UFOJYITDRfLxJg.gif"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://react.delldesignsystem.com/2.21.0/index.html?path=/story/components-table--bulk-actions""><em>Dell’s Design System</em></a><em> includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Proper interactions</h4><ul><li>Interactive tables have clear affordances, accessible labels, and visible states</li><li>Users know when a column is sortable and which direction it’s sorted in</li><li>Users know what happens when they activate a control with a keyboard or mouse</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: This anatomy allows assistive technologies to answer basic questions like: What column am I in? What does this value represent? Without it, users are forced to guess.</em></blockquote><h3>WCAG criteria that matter most for data tables</h3><p>WCAG doesn’t treat data tables as a special case. There’s no guideline that says “make tables accessible.” Instead, WCAG is more concerned with whether users can perceive relationships, operate functionality, and understand content within the table.</p><p><strong>WCAG provides a framework, but it’s up to designers and teams to meet the expectations.</strong></p><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html#brief"">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</a></h4><p>This criteria asks that all users can understand how headers relate to data cells, regardless of how the table looks visually. When header relationships are missing, assistive technologies can’t provide meaningful context.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Use table markup to present tabular information (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51"">Technique H51</a>)</li><li>Use caption elements to associate the data table’s title or heading with the table (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39"">Technique H39</a>)</li><li>Use the scope attribute to associate header cells with cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H63"">Technique H63</a>)</li><li>Use id and headers attributes to associate cells with header cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H43"">Technique H43</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href"">https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard"">SC 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</a></h4><p>Any interaction included in a table must be operable using only a keyboard. This includes not only navigating the table itself, but also using features like filtering, pagination, and row-level actions.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure keyboard control for all functionality (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202"">Technique G202</a>)</li><li>Provide keyboard-triggered event handlers (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G90"">Technique G90</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order#brief"">SC 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)</a></h4><p>Users navigating with a keyboard need to know where they are at all times. WCAG requires visible focus indicators and clear communication of state changes.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Place the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G59"">Technique G59</a>)</li><li>Make the DOM order match the visual order (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27"">Technique C27</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels"">SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that controls and content have clear, descriptive labels. In data tables, this applies to the table’s title, column headers, and its interactive controls.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide descriptive headings (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130"">Technique G130</a>)</li><li>Provide descriptive labels (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131"">Technique G131</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href"">https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value#brief"">SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that content work reliably with assistive technologies now and in the future. For data tables, this means relying on semantic structure and predictable behavior rather than visually driven solutions.</p><p>Example techniques to pass:</p><ul><li>Use aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA14"">Technique ARIA14</a>)</li><li>Use aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA16"">Technique ARIA16</a>)</li></ul><h3>What designers should do before dev touches code</h3><p>Accessible data tables start with design decisions. Designers are responsible for preventing accessibility issues long before a developer ever starts coding. This includes defining design decisions like table structure, interactions, and data complexity.</p><h4>Use real structure, not just layout</h4><p>Before thinking about visual styling, designers should answer the following:</p><ul><li>What are the rows?</li><li>What are the columns?</li><li>What relationships matter most?</li></ul><p>If these answers aren’t obvious in the design, they won’t be obvious to assistive technologies. You need clear column headers, meaningful row labels, and consistent data structure.</p><h4>Have intentional interactions</h4><p>Not every table needs sorting, filtering, or inline actions. Each interaction adds cognitive load and accessibility complexity. When interactions are necessary, designers should define:</p><ul><li>Which columns are sortable</li><li>What happens when sorting is applied</li><li>How users move between table content and controls</li><li>If actions apply to a row, a cell, or the entire table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Atlassian’s Design System includes interactions when it makes sense with the data relationships"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pplXXuqgTPxTXbCCSO0EqA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atlassian.design/components/dynamic-table/examples#uncontrolled""><em>Atlassian’s Design System</em></a><em> includes interactions, like sorting, when it makes sense with the data relationships</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Design for keyboard users</h4><p>Using a keyboard is a primary input method for many users. Designers need to ensure that tables can be navigated in a logical, predictable order by asking:</p><ul><li>Can every interactive element be reached without a mouse/ trackpad?</li><li>Does keyboard focus move in a way that matches the table’s structure?</li><li>Are hover-only actions also doable via keyboard?</li></ul><h4>Consider various screen sizes</h4><p>Designers need to explicitly define how table structure and relationships are preserved across breakpoints. As the screen size shrinks, it’s simple to collapse and hide content, but designers should document:</p><ul><li>How labels remain associated with their values</li><li>How users can navigate between the data</li><li>How accessible interactions are maintained</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Lightning Design System’s data table responding to mobile screen size"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8s-b_ImlOvrMbOwmyYkvvg.png"" /><figcaption>Data tables need to respond when presented on mobile devices; via <a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--with-sorting"">Lightning Design System</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Document table expectations in Design Systems</h4><p>Data tables scale and remain consistent when they’re a shared standard. Documenting how tables behave is just as important as documenting how they look.</p><p>Helpful documentation includes:</p><ul><li>When to use a table (and when to other components like a list)</li><li>Required semantics with structure, headers, and labels</li><li>Keyboard and interaction behavior (like focus and pagination)</li><li>Interaction states and edge cases (like empty, loading, or error states)</li><li>Any known accessibility considerations or constraints</li></ul><p>Data tables are treated as containers for information, but they’re some of the most complex elements users interact with. Without incorporating accessibility into tables, users lose context, navigation becomes frustrating, and critical data becomes hard to understand.</p><p><strong>Complying with WCAG criteria helps all users no matter their ability.</strong> Accessible tables are easier to scan, more predictable to navigate, and clearly communicate meaning. They benefit screen reader users, keyboard users, and anyone working with dense data. When tables are designed with the same care as any other interface, accessibility follows naturally.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6a13533a6fde"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/data-tables-need-to-be-accessible-too-6a13533a6fde"">Data tables need to be accessible, too</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>In a sea of steamers, so-called TV slop, and endless options, <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/?itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;itscg=MC_20000&amp;mttn3pid=Google+AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019801_1-774134829080-c&amp;mttnsubkw=75222244984_kwd-67743848_idXQ476O_&amp;mttnsubplmnt=_adext_"">Apple TV</a> has quietly emerged as the service that provides quality over quantity. When other streaming services are rumored to be <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/matt-damon-netflix-movies-restate-plot-viewers-on-phones-1236633939/"">churning out content that (allegedly)</a> intentionally caters to people who are playing shows in the background while they do chores or are <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/matt-damon-netflix-plots-reiterated-distracted-viewers-1236477116/"">on their phones</a>, Apple TV is respecting audiences that actually, you know, <em>pay attention </em>during the movies and TV shows they watch. </p>



<p>At a splashy press day in LA where they flew in press and influencers from around the world and trotted out their best talent to showcase first-look teaser trailers, Apple TV unveiled their packed 2026 slate, and we’re already <em>seated</em>. Multiple women-led series are front and center, and each feel engineered for the post-antihero era: shows about how it feels to live inside messy systems — capitalism, patriarchy, desire, family, fame — and still want more. More pleasure. More honesty. More money. More luck.</p>



<p>Apple TV already has a slate of great shows, and the casts of some of my personal faves (<em>Shrinking</em>, <em>The Last Thing He Told Me,</em> <em>Pluribus</em>, <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>) were in attendance to hype up their new seasons.<em> </em>As for the new shows, from chaotic motherhood and money woes to the messy realities of female friendship, Apple’ TVs latest offerings are giving us the kind of complex, flawed, deeply relatable characters we’ve been craving. Forget your typical glossy prestige dramas, these shows promise to be raw, funny, uncomfortable, and exactly what we need right now.</p>



<p>From a darkly funny meditation on female gratification to a glossy moral thriller about wealth and consequence, Apple’s latest slate signals a clear creative thesis: women don’t need to be likable, tidy, or redeemed, they just need to be <em>interesting</em>. </p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about Apple TV’s four new women-led shows that defined the day and are about to become your entire personality.</p>



<h2><strong><em>Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Tatiana Maslany, Jake Johnson, Brandon Flynn<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> May 20, 2026 </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957813.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>If the title alone doesn’t have you immediately intrigued, let me paint you a picture: What happens when a woman decides to take control of her pleasure and it backfires, badly? <em><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-apple-tv-premiere-date-photos-1236706239/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> follows newly divorced mom Paula (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/04/84634/tatiana-maslany-orphan-black-interview"">Tatiana Maslany</a>) as conversing with a cam boy leads her down a destructive path of murder, blackmail and… youth soccer. I sat through a whole panel about this show and I still don’t get where the soccer comes into play, but rest assured if Maslany is there, so will I. </p>



<p>Convinced she witnessed a crime, Maslany’s Paula begins her own investigation that unravels a bigger conspiracy as she looks to rebuild her family and regain her self identity. <em><a href=""https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2026/02/apple-tvs-darkly-comedic-thriller-maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-starring-emmy-award-winner-tatiana-maslany-and-jake-johnson-to-make-global-debut-may-20/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> is a full-throated (pun absolutely intended) exploration of desire, agency, and what it means to prioritize your own happiness in a society that low-key punishes women for doing exactly that.</p>



<h2><em>Imperfect Women</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elisabeth Moss, Kerry Washington, and Kate Mara<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> March 18, 2026</p>







<p>Think <em>Big Little Lies </em>meets <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> meets <em>Little Fires Everywhere </em>except there is nothing “little” about these women. After a possible murder shatters shatters the lives of three women in a decades-long friendship,<em> <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/imperfect-women/umc.cmc.1w2rmpbqzt24879bt7109zgi6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imperfect Women</a></em> kicks off into a high-octane thriller that is sure to keep us guessing until its final minute. I was holding my breath during the entire teaser trailer. </p>



<p>According to Apple TV, “The unconventional thriller explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that irrevocably alter our lives. As the investigation unfolds, so does the truth about how even the closest friendships may not be what they seem.” That does sound intriguing but they had me at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kerry-washington"">Kerry Washington,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9481023/elizabeth-moss-invisible-man-performance-scary"">Elisabeth Moss</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/08/121778/kate-mara-movies-morgan-2016"">Kate Mara.</a> </p>



<h2><em>Lucky</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Anya Taylor-Joy, Annette Bening, Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and Drew Starkey<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> July 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957807.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anya-taylor-joy-mad-max-furiosa-interview"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> plays a fugitive con artist. You’re sold, right? Same. Written by Jonathan Tropper and Cassie Pappas and based on <a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Stapley’s bestselling novel, </a><em><a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lucky</a></em> centers on a young woman (Taylor-Joy) who was raised in a life of crime but is trying to leave that life behind. Now, she “must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past,” so says the show’s official synopis. </p>



<p>Taylor-Joy also serves as an exective producer on the project and it marks her first TV series since 2020’s smash hit (and pandemic savior), <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy"">The Queen’s Gambit.</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy""> </a></p>



<p>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Timothy Olyphant also star. </p>



<h2>Margo’s Got Money Troubles </h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer, Nick Offerman<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> April 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957816.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p><em><a href=""https://deadline.com/feature/margos-got-money-troubles-show-news-updates-1236412988/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Margo’s Got Money Troubles</a></em> is a “bold, heartwarming and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229557/teen-spirit-movie-review-elle-fanning-max-minghella"">Elle Fanning</a>), the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/michellepfeifferofficial/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) and ex-pro wrestler (<a href=""https://nickofferman.co/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nick Offerman</a>), as she’s forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them.”</p>



<p>I wanted to get that synopsis right because I didn’t think you’d believe me if I said Michelle Pfeiffer is playing an ex-Hooters waitess and Nick Offerman would be playing a wrestler. These aren’t the roles they typically play but I’ve seen some of the show, and whew, they are such pros, you’d going to be blown away. I imagine that series creator David E. Kelly wanted to surrounde Pfeiffer with the absolute best to match her star power. And, of course, Elle Fanning did just that. Aside from the storyline that sounds that a perfect premise for a realistic, messy, and absurd look at motherhood, Fanning proves she is one of the best working young actresses in Hollywood.</p>

<p>They say you can’t beat a classic, but if my Instagram feed is anything to go by, the humble <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-tip-nail-manicure-autumn-color-trends"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> is undergoing something of a makeover. It began with the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-fade-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French fade</a>”, a look that blends the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a>’s signature white tip into the nail’s neutral base for a soft, melted ombré effect. Another recent favorite is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“deep” French</a>: a chunkier take on the traditional tip that pays homage to the early ’00s. Fast forward to February and another trend has entered our radar — what we’re coining the “phantom” French — and it’s one for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> <em>and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye nail</a> obsessives alike. </p>



<h2>What is the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye French tips</a> are nothing new, relying on a magnet to maneuver metal particles into formation, creating a reflective, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11185958/velvet-nails-trend-magentic-gel-manicure"">velvety effect</a> — much like a cat’s eye in the dark. In that instance, however, the cat-eye polish is usually painted as a French tip over a neutral gel base. The “phantom” French is a little different. This time, the entire nail is coated in cat-eye polish, but the magnet is used in a way that draws only some — not all — of the particles to the tip, creating a French tip effect. Depending on the light or the movement of your fingers, the French tip seems to appear and disappear, hence the “phantom” part. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, has a theory about why we’re gravitating toward a more subtle take on the French manicure: “There’s definitely a renewed interest in softer, more understated French tips,” says Mercedes, “but at the same time, bold and graphic French designs are just as relevant.” Its recent popularity stems from its subtlety, Mercedes adds. “It’s a modern evolution of a classic that feels especially sleek right now,” she says, “but it’s less about one trend replacing another. Instead, it’s about the range of expression people are embracing.” </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>The “phantom” French manicure requires a skilled hand, and everyone seems to do it a little differently. On Instagram, digital creator and nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-fZFgvAF4c/?hl=en"">Melanie Graves</a> paints her nails with silver cat-eye polish, then places a magnet on either side of the nail to draw the particles inward into a reflective formation. Before curing, she positions a longer magnet at the center of the nail, pushing the magnetic pigments toward the tip to create negative space. The result? A cat-eye French tip that’s only visible at certain angles. </p>

<p>Mercedes has her own method. “The ‘phantom’ effect in cat-eye French tips comes down to both layering and magnet technique,” she says, adding, “It’s about guiding the magnetic particles with intention, then letting light do the rest.” As the nail catches different angles, Mercedes explains, the design appears to shift, fade, and re-emerge. “This creates an illusion of movement.” </p>



<p>While it might sound a little complicated, a qualified nail tech will know exactly what to do. If in doubt, arrive armed with plenty of reference images. The phantom French manicure works on all nail shapes, from almond, like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFS-YdrNbzD/?hl=en"">these by Koleva,</a> to squoval, like this set posted to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CvgVDy0oGIc/?hl=en"">Instagram by @Nai__Spa</a>.</p>

February is the month we mostly associate with love and our heart’s deepest desires. While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a> can be performative and capitalistic, Spirit is asking you to drop what’s surface level and get more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-practice-self-love-yourself"">intimate with yourself</a>. This month, center the relationship you have with your inner knowing. Your heart has been holding the truth this whole time. It knows what needs to shift, what you've been avoiding, and what you actually want but haven't let yourself say out loud. You've been overriding it with logic, drowning it out with productivity, and silencing it because what it's asking for feels too vulnerable, too big, and too real. <br /><br />With that, this month's Tarotscopes goes straight to the point, cuts through the noise, and gives you direct access to what your heart has been trying to tell you about 2026. This is the year you get to reconnect to your own innate wisdom and allow that to lead you.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising, let your heart respond, and then be brave enough to listen.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957504.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) Three of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that the grief you've been intellectualizing needs to be felt. Chances are you are still energetically carrying remnants of 2025, and as we pivot onto the new Chinese year and, soon, the new astrological year, it’s time to fully release these bonds. You've processed it in therapy, journaled about it, and understood the lesson, but you haven't let yourself actually break open and weep. This year, your heart is asking you to stop analyzing your pain and start moving it through your body. You're brilliant at making sense of things, but some wounds don't heal through understanding. They heal through release. Through letting your nervous system discharge what it's been holding. Trust that falling apart won't destroy you. Instead, it will regulate you. Your heart knows that what's on the other side of that grief is the kind of clarity and creative power you've been searching for. Feel it and let it move.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957505.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>PISCES (February 19 - March 20) The Star</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your sensitivity is your spiritual technology, and not something to fix. You've been trying to build thicker skin, set firmer boundaries, and be less affected by the energy around you. Energetic boundaries are a must in your book, but this year, your heart is reminding you that your porousness is your gift. Yes, still maintain a healthy routine of spiritual hygiene, just don’t disregard the fact that you can feel everything because you’re meant to. It's how you receive information, how you read energy, and how you serve. The work isn't to become less sensitive. It's to get so clear in your energetic sovereignty that you can stay open without losing yourself. You're not too much. You're tuned to a frequency most people can't access and you’re able to travel within many realms. Your heart wants you to stop apologizing for it and start leveraging it. Your sensitivity is your superpower. Use it intentionally.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957506.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>ARIES (March 21 - April 19) Queen of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your ambition is sacred, not selfish. You've been treating your desire for more like it's something to apologize for, scared that if you expand too much or too fast, you’ll leave others behind. This year, you will put an end to that. There are those that are anticipating such rapid growth and conquest from you and others who will never understand what it’s like to have such hunger for the attainment of your own expansion. Leave them behind. Your heart is asking you to lead from your fire, so don’t dare contract your energy to make others comfortable. The Creator is waiting for you to embody your full authority and stop performing humility. Trust that your body knows the difference between ego and divine assignment. Propel forward with what burns in you. These are not random impulses; it is purposeful direction. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957507.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) Four of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that safety isn't the same as sovereignty. It’s time to step out of the safety structures you’ve built, the same routines and patterns that keep you bound to the same old energies. These structures are here to protect you; however, they’re also keeping you small. This year is asking you to examine what you're gripping so tightly that you can't receive what's actually trying to reach you. Your body has been holding patterns of scarcity that your current reality doesn't even reflect anymore. You've outgrown survival programming, but your nervous system hasn't caught up yet. Your heart knows you're ready for the next level of wealth, but your hands are still clenched around what you already have: in your body, mind, and soul. This is the year you stretch your energetic container beyond its current standards. Not by thinking your way through it, but by embodying the frequency of the woman who has already arrived. Let your heart lead you into the softness of true security.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957508.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>GEMINI (May 21 - June 20) The Lovers</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you don't have to choose between your spiritual path and your human desires; both can co-exist. You've been treating pleasure like it's separate from your purpose, like wanting love or partnership or sensual fulfillment somehow makes you less committed to your work. That's a lie that you have programmed as the truth. This is not the year of compromise. This year, your heart is calling you into integration: the marriage of your spiritual gifts with your very real need for connection, intimacy, and being met. You can be devoted to your spiritual practice and still want someone to come home to. You can channel divine wisdom and still crave physical touch. Stop splitting yourself in half and having to choose breadcrumbs. Your heart knows the truth: devotion to Spirit includes devotion to your whole self. What is for you will find you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957509.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CANCER (June 21 - July 22) Six of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that healing your lineage doesn't mean carrying it alone. You've been doing the ancestral work, clearing the patterns, and walking through the timelines, but somewhere in there, you started believing that being the cycle-breaker means you can't ask for support. Practice calling in support from all areas: from your spirit allies, friends, the Creator, etc. Healing happens best in community, whether it is physical or non-physical. This year, you get to have things handled for you, which speeds up your development. At the same time, you might discover some potent medicine within you that is ready to be shared with your community. If you’ve been accustomed to supporting everyone else, flip the switch this year. Your lineage doesn't need another martyr. It needs you whole, resourced, and connected. Let your heart show you what it feels like to heal in the presence of love and be the first to receive before pouring out onto others.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957510.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LEO (July 23 - August 22) Ace of Wands</strong><br /><br />That creative fire building inside you isn't just inspiration; it's revelation. It’s your green light to shine. You've been treating your ideas like hobbies and side projects you'll get to when everything else is handled. But your heart knows that what's wanting to be born through you right now is the main event. This is your year to stop relegating your creative genius to the margins of your life and start centering it. The project, the offering, the vision you've been refining, it has been ready. You've been studying the masters, learning the craft, and absorbing the wisdom. Now it's your turn to create from that place and implement what you’ve learned. Stop preparing and start building. Your heart knows the world is waiting for what only you can deliver. A little goes a long way. Pace yourself but start now. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957511.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) The Hermit</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that rest is not a reward for productivity; rather, it's the foundation of it. You've been running on excellence and determination, optimizing every area of your life while ignoring the quiet voice that keeps asking you to slow down. Slowing down is the key to wealth in all forms. Learning how to embody your desires and listen to the wisdom within you will be a game changer for you. You have nothing to prove. This year, your heart is calling you into sacred withdrawal. Not burnout. The kind of intentional solitude where your nervous system can finally regulate, where the downloads can land, and where you remember who you are without the performance of achievement. You're doing such important work in the world, but you can't pour from a depleted well. This is the year where you normalize being in overflow and you stay there. Your heart knows that the next level of your impact requires you to be full first. Give yourself permission to disappear for a while and, most importantly, to be selfish.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957512.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) Two of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that indecision is just you avoiding listening to your own intuition. You've been sitting at the crossroads, weighing options, gathering more information, waiting for absolute certainty before you make the move. But how many more signs do you need before you act on what you already know? Your heart already knows the answer. The choice you're avoiding isn't actually between two equal paths. Chances are it's between the life you know and the life you're being called into. This year demands that you trust your inner knowing over everyone else's opinions. You already do the inner work. You journal, you pray, and you listen. You have access to your intuition. Stop pretending you don't know how to access what your heart is telling you. The answer is already there. Choose it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957513.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) Knight of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you're allowed to want love without having to nearly sabotage yourself to deserve it. You've made intimacy a spiritual test, turned every relationship into an initiation, convinced yourself that real love only counts if it brings you to your knees first. You don’t have to abandon yourself in order to have your desire. You can ascend, be your best self, and still be blessed. This year, your heart is asking you to open to a different frequency, the kind of love that doesn't require you to prove your worth through suffering. You've done the shadow work in abundance, and 2025 has led you through the darkness and back to the light again. You've faced your depths, walked through the fire, and you survived. Now let your heart show you what it's like to be chosen softly, met consistently, and loved without the chaos. Or better yet, you decide to do the choosing. Choose yourself and then make an informed and elevated decision to choose another from a space of autonomy and clarity. Don’t burn yourself down because you think you’re lacking something.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957514.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) King of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your vision is too big for you to keep playing small in the execution. You may have the mindset down, what action steps you need to take, the essential energetics that will propel you forward, and yet there’s still a gap between what you preach and what you’re actually building. This year calls for you to stop consuming inspiration and simply embody it. You are meant to push yourself into leadership and action. You don’t need any more encouragement, examples, or steps. What you need is to trust that you know what you’re doing and to do it. Individuals will be astonished with your bold energy and growth. It’s less talk and more walk. You have nothing to prove to anyone and ample time to execute excellence. There are people around you who need to see you at your highest level, so they have permission to operate on their own. Your heart knows you're capable of the vision you keep downloading. Now build it like you mean it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957515.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) Nine of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you've already earned the right to enjoy your life — now, live it to the fullest. You have expanded your sense of self-worth, stayed committed to your goals, strengthened your foundation and stability, but yet you’re still moving from a space of scarcity, and like everything can crumble at any minute. This year, your heart is asking you to practice receiving pleasure without attaching it to productivity. Buy the thing without justifying it. Rest without earning it first. Let yourself be luxurious, not as a future reward but as a present reality. This is the standard now. As you’re expanding your capacity to do more, be more, and hold more energy, you can also attract more. So you should enjoy it! You're an energetic match for wealth in all forms, but your nervous system is still running the old program. Your heart wants you in your opulence now. Not when you hit the next milestone. Now. Let yourself live like the abundant person you already are.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",

<p><em>Sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Emmeka and Dr. Gupta were compensated by Novartis.</em></p>



<p>A tingle that turns into an itch that only becomes worse as you scratch it. A feeling that may resemble mosquito bites all over your body. Trouble sleeping, work disruptions, and skipped social events spurred by the anxiety of the hives returning. That’s what flare-ups can be like for people living with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) — an immune-mediated disease characterized by hives and/or deep swelling for more than 6 weeks without a known allergy or external triggers.</p>



<p>When Emmeka, an Iowa-based social media manager and beauty content creator, first noticed itchy, red, welt-like bumps across her back, she worried she was experiencing an allergic reaction. For months, she tried to rule out what might be causing symptoms and considered everything from laundry detergent and beauty products to the food she was eating. “I was continuously trying to figure out what was happening to me and editing my lifestyle to avoid potential triggers; it was a burden,” Emmeka recalls. After a long journey of trying to get to the root cause of her persistent hives, she finally got a diagnosis of CSU.</p>



<p>Living with CSU can feel like being in a bad relationship: compromising, downplaying your needs, and feeling stuck in a cycle of discomfort and frustration.</p>



<p>Dr. Payel Gupta, a New York City–based allergist who treats people with CSU, is working to raise awareness of this condition and empower patients to find solutions that work for them. “Living with CSU shouldn’t mean settling for discomfort,” says Dr. Gupta. “CSU is something you and your doctor can work on together. It’s a partnership, and that means good communication about what’s working, what’s not working, so we can find the right management plan.”</p>



<p>Dr. Gupta and Emmeka recently sat down together to discuss what it means to  be proactive in taking more control of your life with CSU and shared key tips for improving your “relationship” with this chronic condition.</p>







<p>Keep reading for Dr. Gupta’s advice on how to get a better sense of control in your journey with CSU. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938046.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>It took Emmeka 2 years to receive her CSU diagnosis — a delay that’s all too common, as the average time to diagnosis for CSU is over 2 years. Dr. Gupta recommends that patients presenting with symptoms of CSU connect with a specialist, such as an allergist or dermatologist, who is familiar with CSU and the standard diagnostic and treatment protocols for this condition.</p>



<p>“They’ll help you develop a concrete plan of action for when you’re having an acute episode, so that you don’t feel lost or confused and end up needing to seek urgent care,” Dr. Gupta continues. “Seeing a specialist can be a really important step toward getting the help you need to manage this condition in the long term.” </p>



<p>It’s also important that you feel like you can fully open up to your health care provider. “You want to have good communication on both sides. So, if you feel like you’re not being heard or like you’re unable to express yourself, then it’s important to get a second opinion to make sure your concerns can be addressed,” Dr. Gupta says.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938049.png?width=1024&amp;height=485&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A485"" /></figure>



<p>After coming to terms with her CSU, Emmeka decided to share her journey online and was met with support and stories from her online community, empowering her to use her platform as a content creator to raise awareness. </p>



<p>“Community is really important because it reminds you that you’re not alone,” says Dr. Gupta. “Seeing your lived experience mirrored in others helps you feel validated and understood.” </p>



<p>Social media, in particular, can be a valuable space for connection. But Dr. Gupta warns about relying too heavily on advice from non-medical sources: “Use social media for community, but when seeking information, turn to qualified medical professionals and resources based on reputable references, like <em><a href=""https://www.neverjusthives.com/?utm_source=sponsored-content&amp;utm_mlr=fa-11460132&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=sponsored-content_unbranded_r29-sponsored-content_nov-2025&amp;utm_content=rha_csu_patient-story_link-in-article"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Never Just Hives</a>.”</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938048.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>“The biggest misconception is that there’s an allergic trigger,” Dr. Gupta explains. “Some patients blame themselves, thinking their actions caused the symptoms. But the truth is, you’ve done nothing wrong.”</p>



<p>CSU isn’t triggered by external factors like allergies, foods, or environmental irritants. Instead, it’s caused by an overactive immune system. For many patients like Emmeka, the spontaneous nature of this condition can be hard to come to terms with. But listening to your body is a powerful first step. </p>



<p>If you can’t identify a specific trigger, it could be a sign that something else deeper is going on, like CSU. </p>



<p>Dr. Gupta encourages patients to stay connected to their bodies by tracking symptoms and taking photos during flare-ups. This can help facilitate productive conversations with your doctor, and enable you both to work together to find a path forward.</p>

<p>Bieber swapped her signature blush for a hazelnut-americano-inspired hue, carefully mixed by her longtime friend and LA-based nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nailsbyzola/?hl=en"">Zola Ganzorigt</a>. While appointments with Ganzorigt are rare, she took to Instagram to reveal the exact color combination for those who don’t mind performing a little nail alchemy.  </p>

<p>Once <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Ftop-base-coats-gel-like-base-coat%3FobjectID%3D46147089039593%26queryID%3Dafe9d3d38d1adc9fdddbeb8a228c394a"">a base coat</a> was applied (a must for boosting wear and protecting nails from stains), Ganzorigt mixed no less than four shades — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Fnail-lacquer-cliffside-karaoke"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OPI’s Cliffside Karaoke</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-big-apple-red"">Big Apple Red</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-barefoot-in-barcelona"">Barefoot In Barcelona</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-you-dont-know-jacques"">You Don’t Know Jacques!</a> — a few drops at a time to create this chocolatey, hazelnut-inspired shade, perfectly matched to Bieber’s lipstick. “[We] felt like we were in chemistry class while we were mixing the colors to create the perfect shade,” Ganzorigt said on Instagram. Of course, a generous slick of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Ftop-base-coats-gel-like-top-coat"">OPI top coat</a> was the final step. </p>





<p>While Ganzorigt used OPI’s professional GelColor shades for Bieber’s Grammy Awards manicure — a system found in most nail salons — all three shades are also available for at-home use in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">OPI’s Nail Lacquer</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">Infinite Shine</a> ranges online. </p>

<p>The likes of Big Apple Red and You Don’t Know Jacques! are considered classics among manicurists, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-barefoot-in-barcelona"">Barefoot In Barcelona</a> is one of those shades that has slipped under the radar until now. It occupies a cozy space between blush pink and hazelnut, and its neutral finish suits all skin tones equally.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens loud. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st is not subtle, not chill, and definitely not interested in you playing it cool. This is the kind of Full Moon that asks, “Are you actually proud of your life right now, or are you just busy?” Emotions are heightened, egos are tender, and everyone suddenly has a realization they <em>cannot </em>keep to themselves. The challenge is not letting every feeling turn into a performance. The gift is clarity. Something reaches a peak, a reveal, or a moment of truth that says, this matters more than you’ve been admitting. </p>



<p>Adding to the shake-up, Uranus stations direct in Taurus this week, and while it may not come with fireworks, it does come with a sense of momentum finally clicking into place. Think less chaos, more “oh… this is actually happening.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">Changes around money</a>, stability, values, or long-term plans may feel more real and less theoretical now. If something has been brewing quietly for months, this is when it starts to move forward without asking for permission. The key is flexibility. Taurus energy loves comfort, Uranus loves disruption, and this week asks you to find a middle ground between clinging and completely blowing things up. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, the vibe softens as Mercury enters Pisces, giving the collective permission to stop over-explaining and start feeling things again. Logic takes a backseat to intuition, creativity, and emotional nuance. Communication becomes less about facts and more about tone, timing, and what’s <em>not </em>being said. This is a great week for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">dreaming, journaling, art</a>, and letting yourself be a little delusional in a hopeful way. Just remember, Mercury in Pisces can blur lines, so double-check details and be gentle with misunderstandings. Not everything needs an immediate answer. Some things just need space to unfold.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, are you ready to admit what actually lights you up instead of reacting to every spark that comes your way? This week starts with the Leo Full Moon, and for you it feels like a creative or emotional mic drop. Something you’ve been working on, flirting with, or quietly hoping for hits a peak, and suddenly you can’t pretend you don’t care anymore. This could be about love, joy, passion, or a project that feels very <em>you</em>. The temptation is to go full “all eyes on me” and burn yourself out trying to prove a point. The smarter move is choosing what deserves your energy instead of reacting to every feeling that shows up. Not every spark needs to become a wildfire. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus finally stations direct in Taurus, and you may notice a subtle but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">real shift around money</a>, confidence, or how secure you feel in your choices. This isn’t a lottery-ticket moment, it’s more like realizing you trust yourself again. Financial ideas or plans that felt unstable now feel workable, and you’re less interested in proving your worth to anyone. If something clicks this week, follow it, but don’t rush it. Momentum doesn’t need chaos to be powerful. </p>



<p>On Friday, Mercury enters Pisces, which is basically your cue to stop explaining yourself so much. Your intuition is louder than logic right now, and forcing clarity will only slow things down. You may feel more introspective, tired, or oddly nostalgic, even as big things are unfolding. Let that happen. This is a behind-the-scenes processing week, not a launch week. Trust that what you’re integrating now is quietly preparing you for a much louder chapter ahead.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, something you’ve been emotionally sitting with is ready to move and this week makes it impossible to keep pretending otherwise. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, and for you it lands right in your feelings. Home, family, living situations, and emotional safety are all under a bright spotlight. Something reaches a turning point, a realization, a boundary, or even a decision you’ve been avoiding because it felt “too much.” The temptation here is to dig your heels in or react defensively. The growth comes from being honest about what no longer feels supportive. You don’t need to blow anything up, but you do need to stop pretending everything is fine if it’s not. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus finally stations direct in your sign, and this is big, even if it feels quiet at first. After months of internal recalibration, identity shifts, and stop-start momentum, things begin to move forward with more confidence. You may feel clearer about who you are becoming, less reactive to other people’s expectations, and more willing to choose yourself without over-explaining. This isn’t about instant transformation. It’s about finally trusting the changes you’ve already made. If you’ve been waiting for permission to move differently, consider this it. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your mental pace and turning your attention toward friends, community, and shared dreams. Conversations feel more intuitive than logical, and you may crave emotional resonance over surface-level chatter. This is a great time to reconnect with people who <em>get </em>you or to daydream about the future without locking yourself into a plan yet. Just be mindful of mixed signals or vague commitments. You’re allowed to dream big this week, just don’t promise more than you’re ready to deliver. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, a conversation, realization, or idea is reaching a point where thinking about it is no longer enough. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and day-to-day interactions. Expect a conversation, realization, or announcement that feels bigger than you anticipated. Something you’ve been thinking about for a while finally needs to be said, shared, or decided. The danger here is talking just to fill the silence or reacting emotionally before you’ve processed the full picture. Choose intention over impulse. Your words carry extra weight right now, so make sure they reflect what you actually mean. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, intuition, and behind-the-scenes sector. This is less about external change and more about internal clarity. Insights may arrive in strange ways, dreams, random thoughts, or sudden emotional realizations that explain why you’ve been feeling restless or distracted lately. Instead of trying to logic your way through everything, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust what your intuition</a> is revealing. Something you’ve quietly outgrown becomes undeniable this week. </p>



<p>Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces on February 6th, shifting your focus toward career, reputation, and long-term goals. The vibe becomes less linear and more imaginative. You may feel inspired about your future but slightly fuzzy on the details. That’s okay. This isn’t the moment to lock in a five-year plan. It’s about letting yourself envision what success could look like without immediately editing yourself. Just double-check emails and expectations. Mercury in Pisces prefers poetry over bullet points, and misunderstandings are easier if you’re not paying attention.  </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this week asks you to get honest about what feels truly secure versus what you’ve been holding onto out of habit. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">activating your money</a>, self-worth, and stability sector. As a moon-ruled sign, you’ll feel this one deeply. Emotions around finances, value, or what you’re giving versus receiving may rise to the surface. A purchase, payment, or realization could force you to ask, “Is this actually worth my energy?” The temptation is emotional spending or overreacting to temporary insecurity. The growth comes from recognizing how far you’ve come and choosing confidence over fear, even if things don’t feel perfectly settled yet. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. If social dynamics have felt unpredictable or exhausting over the past few months, this shift helps things stabilize in a new way. You may feel clearer about who belongs in your inner circle and which group spaces feel aligned with your future. Unexpected opportunities through friends or networks could also reappear, this time with more follow-through. Stay open, but don’t overcommit. You’re learning discernment, not withdrawal. </p>



<p>Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, harmonizing beautifully with your Cancer energy. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and you may feel drawn to dream, plan, or reflect rather than act. Conversations take on a more emotional tone, and you may feel inspired to think about travel, education, or spiritual growth. Just be mindful of assumptions. Mercury in Pisces is poetic, but not always precise. Let yourself dream big this week, but keep one foot on solid ground. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the spotlight is on you and the real question is whether you want to perform or actually be seen. This is <em>your </em>week, Leo, and it starts exactly how you’d expect with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st lighting up your identity, confidence, and “this is who I am now” sector. Emotions are big, visibility is unavoidable, and something about you comes into full view, whether that’s a personal decision, a creative reveal, or a moment where you realize you’ve outgrown an old version of yourself. The shadow here is overreacting or taking everything personally. Not every spotlight moment requires a dramatic speech. Sometimes the power move is quiet confidence. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shaking things up in your career and public image zone, but in a way that feels more intentional than chaotic. If work, reputation, or long-term goals have felt unpredictable, this shift brings clarity around what’s actually worth building. You may realize you want something diﬀerent than you did a year ago, or that success doesn’t need to look the way you were taught it should. Expect subtle momentum rather than instant results. The key is staying flexible instead of clinging to a title or plan just because it once felt secure. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, shifting your focus toward intimacy, trust, and emotional honesty. Conversations go deeper, feelings get softer, and you may crave connection over applause. This is a good time to talk about what’s <em>really </em>going on beneath the confidence, but be mindful of assumptions or mixed signals. Mercury in Pisces speaks in vibes, not bullet points. Let yourself feel without needing to define everything immediately. You don’t have to have all the answers this week. Being present is more than enough.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, the universe is quietly asking you to slow down long enough to notice what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your body and intuition</a> have been trying to say. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is one of those Full Moons that doesn’t shout, it whispers… and then refuses to be ignored. You may feel more tired than usual, emotionally sensitive, or suddenly aware of something you’ve been pushing down. The temptation is to analyze the feeling away or stay busy to avoid it. The better move is rest. Seriously. Something needs closure, and clarity comes faster when you stop trying to control the process. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your expansion, learning, and belief sector. This brings forward momentum around plans involving travel, education, publishing, or a shift in perspective you’ve been circling for months. An idea that once felt too risky may now feel oddly doable. This isn’t about leaping without looking, but about trusting that growth doesn’t always come with a spreadsheet. Let curiosity guide you a little more than certainty this week. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces, putting relationships and one-on-one dynamics into focus. Conversations feel more emotional and less linear, which can be… uncomfortable for you. You may need to read between the lines or sit with ambiguity instead of demanding immediate clarity. Misunderstandings are possible, but so is deeper connection. Listen with empathy, not just logic. This week reminds you that not everything needs fixing. Some things just need to be felt. </p>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week reveals who and what actually belongs in the future you’re trying to build. The week kicks oﬀ with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, spotlighting your friendships, community, and long-term goals. A social dynamic, group project, or vision for your future reaches a turning point, and you may suddenly feel clear about who’s actually aligned with where you’re headed. The temptation is people-pleasing or trying to keep everyone happy. The growth comes from choosing authenticity over harmony-for-harmony’s-sake. Not every bridge is meant to be maintained. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. This brings a subtle but meaningful shift around trust, vulnerability, or finances tied to others. If certain emotional patterns or entanglements have felt unpredictable, this direct motion helps you regain balance and perspective. You’re less reactive and more grounded in what you’re willing to share and what you’re not. That clarity is powerful, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. </p>



<p>As the weekend kicks off, Mercury enters Pisces, turning your attention toward work, routines, and well-being. The vibe becomes softer and less structured, which may test your desire for balance and order. You may feel inspired to care for yourself in more intuitive ways, but it’s also easy to overcommit or blur boundaries. Be gentle with yourself. This is a week for adjusting rhythms, not perfecting them. Balance isn’t about doing everything, it’s about doing what actually supports you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready for things to finally click in your professional life without you having to overly control the process? The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your career, reputation, and visibility sector. Something comes to a head professionally, recognition, a decision, or a moment where you realize how you’re being perceived. You may feel pressure to perform or to prove yourself, but the real question is whether the path you’re on actually feels aligned. The shadow here is overworking or staying quiet about your needs. The power move is owning your accomplishments <em>and </em>your boundaries. You don’t need to downplay your talents to stay in control. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shifting the energy in your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. If dynamics with a partner, collaborator, or close friend have felt unpredictable, this direct motion brings a sense of recalibration. Not everything is suddenly stable, but you’re clearer about what you want and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate. Conversations may feel more honest, even if they’re a little uncomfortable. This is about progress, not perfection. </p>



<p>Then on Friday the 6th Mercury enters Pisces, harmonizing with your Scorpio energy and softening the pace. Creativity, romance, and emotional expression take center stage, and you may feel more open than usual about what you want and feel. This is a great time to reconnect with pleasure, play, or a passion project, but be mindful of mixed signals or idealizing situations too quickly. Let things unfold naturally. This week reminds you that intensity doesn’t always need armor. Sometimes it just needs space. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to say yes to a bigger vision even if you don’t have all the details figured out yet? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your sector of growth, travel, learning, and belief systems, pushing a long-standing idea, plan, or desire to reach a moment of truth. You may feel inspired, restless, or eager to expand your world, but the shadow here is overpromising or assuming enthusiasm alone will carry you through. Let this Full Moon remind you that belief is powerful, but commitment is what makes it real. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing forward momentum in your work and daily routine sector. If your schedule, responsibilities, or job dynamics have felt inconsistent, this shift helps you regain traction. A new rhythm begins to form, one that asks you to work smarter, not harder. Small changes in how you manage your time or energy can have a big impact now. Stay flexible. The more open you are to doing things differently, the more freedom you actually gain.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Then Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, drawing your attention toward home, emotional grounding, and personal space. You may crave comfort, nostalgia, or quiet reflection after a mentally busy week. Conversations with family or about living situations may feel more emotional than logical, so listen carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions. This is a good moment to slow down, recharge, and let your intuition guide you. Not every adventure requires movement. Some growth happens when you let yourself settle. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to stop carrying everything like it’s your personal responsibility to hold the world together? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st activates your intimacy, trust, and shared-resources sector, bringing a moment of truth around emotional or financial entanglements. This could look like a boundary conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or finally acknowledging where you’ve been over-giving. The shadow is shutting down or trying to control the outcome. The growth is letting yourself be supported without guilt. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, energizing your creativity, joy, and self-expression sector. If you’ve felt blocked, uninspired, or hesitant to take a risk with something you love, momentum starts returning. This isn’t about reckless leaps, but about remembering that pleasure and play are not distractions from success. They’re fuel. Let yourself experiment without needing a perfect plan. </p>



<p>As the weekend hits, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your communication style and inviting more emotional nuance into conversations. You may find yourself speaking from the heart rather than the spreadsheet, which is a shift, but a healthy one. Just double-check details and expectations. Not everything needs to be finalized this week. Some ideas just need room to breathe. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, yes, this week is about you, but not in the way you’re used to. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your relationship sector, bringing clarity around partnerships, situationships, or close collaborations. Something reaches a peak, a decision, a realization, or an emotional moment you can’t intellectualize your way out of. The shadow is detachment or defensiveness. The lesson is presence. You don’t lose your independence by being emotionally available. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus, your modern ruler, stations direct in Taurus, shifting energy around home, family, and emotional foundations. Things that felt unstable or uncertain start making more sense, even if they’re still evolving. You may feel clearer about where you belong or what kind of support you actually need. This isn’t about locking things down. It’s about choosing stability on your own terms. </p>



<p>As Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">your focus turns toward money</a>, values, and self-worth. Conversations around finances or priorities may feel less logical and more emotional. Trust your intuition, but don’t ignore practical details. This week asks you to align your values with your choices, not just your ideas. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week asks you to be honest about what’s draining you versus what’s actually sustaining you. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st illuminates your work, health, and daily routine sector, bringing a realization about habits, obligations, or responsibilities that need adjusting. You may feel called to do less, not more. The shadow is martyrdom. The growth is choosing yourself without needing permission. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your communication, mindset, and learning sector. If conversations have felt stuck or plans unclear, things begin moving forward with more confidence. Ideas land diﬀerently now. You may feel more willing to speak up or share something you’ve been sitting on. Trust that your voice matters, even if it shakes a little. </p>



<p>As the weekend arrives, Mercury enters your sign, putting your thoughts, feelings, and intuition front and center. You’re more expressive, imaginative, and emotionally tuned in, but also more sensitive to tone and energy. This is a great time to journal, create, or talk things through with someone you trust. Just remember, not every feeling needs immediate action. Some insights unfold when you give them space. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956402.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=681&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A681"" /><figcaption>Full moon at midnight and dark blue sky with clouds. Spooky dark night sky view. The moon was covered with clouds and its reflection was on the water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Get ready to roar! The Full Snow Moon in Leo on February 1st demands that we take charge. How? By fighting for fairness and equality, while simultaneously asking us to care for others with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-are-not-an-empath"">compassion and empathy</a> (sharing this with our frenemies and nemeses will be hard, but valuable in teaching them to be kind). The remedy for upsets is to be sympathetic and fierce, making tough love the best approach. If we are going from a pure position, we can make the world and our lives a more magical and tender place to be. First, we have to be aggressive and loud to be effective in getting the word out about the causes we believe in to ensure people are listening. </p>



<p>The Snow Moon marks a time of renewal in the depths of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to the weather, the world slows down, allowing us to be more introspective and mindful of the world around us — particularly how we feel on the inside about partnerships and life. By tapping into our internal resources, we can find the strength to make the necessary changes and the stamina to carry them through the season. Centering our energy on what’s important helps us realize that a lot of what we focus on isn’t. Clearing our minds gives us the clarity we need to grow and evolve. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo is a divine time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifesting-magical-thinking-control-reality-goals"">set intentions and manifest</a>. If we are illuminating and honoring the repressed parts of ourselves that want to come out, we are on track. We can move forward and soldier on after we release the hidden aspects of our personality and creativity by putting them into play. We’re deciding not to back down and to strive for happiness — no matter how messy the journey is to get there. The destination is going to be bumpy, but worth it in the end.  </p>



<p>With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> opposing the Full Moon in Leo, it will be easy to get caught up in drama. Mars is known to instigate affairs, particularly by bringing up past situations. As a result, a line will be drawn in the sand, asking us to fight or take flight. We will be able to choose who is a friend or foe, and how we wish to participate in the matter. We might be pulled into a dynamic that pushes us to exert our frustrations or take the higher ground. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> quarrels for what it’s most passionate about — particularly social injustice. If we feel that there is something that isn’t right for the community at large or even for ourselves in personal relationships, then we will get on our soapbox and take a stand.  </p>



<p>The truth is coming out, allowing us to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. Our perception of others may change — not necessarily for the better. Knowing that we have been misled or need to step up protective measures might feel like a dagger to the heart, since we’ve been open and genuine with those who aren’t. Rather than dwell, use it as a learning curve. The lesson is to put a boundary on the relationship to ensure it never transpires again. Fool us once, shame on them; fool us twice, it’s not ever happening. Words of advice: Do not feel bad about your part; understand that you can and will overcome anything in time. Never dwell on matters that are in the rearview mirror. </p>



<p>Reflect on the matter at hand and conclude what or who deserves our attention and affection. Even though the Snow Moon is slightly chaotic, Leo energy focuses on our heartfelt sensations. Yes, there are letdowns, but the reason we’re feeling them so intensely is that we are hot-blooded creatures, full of emotions and passions. Our desires guide our actions, and our sentiments dictate our reactions. Do not hold back. Say what’s on your mind. Vocalizing the voice within is a great way to be heard and seen. If you’re using it, that is what counts most.  </p>
