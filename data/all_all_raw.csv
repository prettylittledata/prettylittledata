<p>Cabin Fever is an international summer school and festival launched by the Hungarian architecture studio Hello Wood, known for its design-build approach and community-focused, sustainable projects. Since its founding in 2010, Hello Wood has become a global platform merging hands-on education with socially engaged architecture. The 2025 edition, powered by VELUX, explored how light and space shape human experience — placing presence, intimacy, and connection at the centre of architecture. This dialogue with VELUX reflects a shared conviction: that the future of building lies in responsibility — in creating spaces with care, with awareness, and with light — offering meaningful alternatives in an overstimulated world. 2025 Concept, Location, Participants. From 23–31 July 2025, the festival took place in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ceska-kamenice"">Česká Kamenice</a>, Czech Republic, on the grounds of a former textile factory and wartime labour camp — a place that embodies both the weight of memory and the potential for transformation.

<p>What matters more: looking to the past or to the future? Recognizing established trajectories or fostering paths still under construction? Perhaps this is not a question with a single answer. Traditionally, architecture awards have operated as devices of consecration, recognizing completed works, established careers, and already tested solutions, most often through a retrospective lens. But what would happen if recognition ceased to be an end in itself and instead began to operate as a catalytic agent, investing less in what has already been done and more in what is still yet to unfold?</p>",

<p>Across history, the relocation of capital <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cities"">cities</a> has often been associated with moments of political rupture, regime change, or symbolic nation-building. From Brasília to <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/islamabad/page/1"">Islamabad</a>, new capitals were frequently conceived as instruments of centralized power, territorial control, or ideological projection. In recent decades, however, a different set of drivers has begun to shape these decisions. Rather than security or representation alone, contemporary capital <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/relocation"">relocations</a> are increasingly tied to structural pressures such as demographic concentration, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/infrastructure"">infrastructural</a> saturation, environmental risk, and long-term resource management.

<p>For decades, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1038348/rethinking-heritage-archdailys-february-editorial-focus"">heritage</a> has been easiest to recognize from the street. We protect <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1029051/beyond-the-walls-21-contemporary-interventions-in-castles-and-fortresses?ad_campaign=normal-tag"">facades, skylines, and monuments</a> because they are visible, stable, and legible as cultural assets. Yet most of what we remember about living is how we eat together, withdraw, argue, care, and rest, which happen far from view. It happens inside rooms. As open plans quietly give way to thresholds, corridors, and enclosures, a deeper question emerges: what if cultural memory survives not in what architecture shows, but in how it is lived? </p>",

<p>1. Context – The Stable and the Orange Barn is a residential project located on a narrow flag-shaped plot in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/toyohashi"">Toyohashi</a>, Japan, surrounded by factories, nursing facilities, and suburban houses. Rather than asserting a strong formal gesture, the design began by closely observing the everyday rhythms of a young family and their relationship with the surrounding environment.</p>",

<p>Gunawarman 35 stands at a corner in the heart of Jakarta's Gunawarman district — a meeting point of residential calm and urban vibrancy, of heritage textures and contemporary life. The design embraces this duality, creating a dialogue between scale, material, and light.</p>",

As a Product Manager in healthcare, I was taught that “habit formation” was the holy grail. We ask: <em>Can our product change people’s habits?</em> But after analyzing 83 artifacts spanning from 7000 BC to 2024, I’ve realized habits are just the symptoms. The “Vibe” is the cause. We treat breakthroughs in fasting, sleep, and gut health as “disruptions.” They aren’t. They are <strong>translations</strong> of ancient practices rendered acceptable through contemporary measurement, automation, and a very specific kind of storytelling.</p><h3>The methodology: vibe coding</h3><p>Archaeologists read pottery shards to understand ancient civilizations — why this glaze, why this shape, why buried here? <strong>Vibe coding</strong> reads product design patterns to decode the invisible architecture of our moment.</p><p>I examined 83 artifacts across four domains (fasting, movement, sleep, gut health) spanning 9,000 years. Each artifact — from <a href=""https://www.worldhistory.org/Neolithic_Period/"">Neolithic globular fermentation jars (7000 BC)</a> to <a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/"">Eight Sleep Pods (2019)</a> — contains encoded information: What anxieties did it address? What authorities legitimized it? What previous solutions had failed? What I found wasn’t innovation. It was translation: the product is just the container for the story.</p><h3>The pattern: four triggers, one cycle</h3><p>Products don’t create trends; they arrive at the exact moment a convergence of triggers makes a practice culturally acceptable again. I identified four triggers that activate every preventive health resurgence:</p><ol><li><strong>Crisis (Creates Urgency):</strong> A widespread problem makes the status quo unacceptable (e.g., <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"">1970s obesity epidemic</a> or 2020 pandemic isolation).</li><li><strong>Technology (Removes Barriers):</strong> New tools make a practice frictionless or measurable (e.g., smartphone apps or <a href=""https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data"">DNA sequencing cost collapse</a>).</li><li><strong>Authority (Reframes Legitimacy):</strong> Scientific validation or aspirational figures reframe the practice (e.g., a <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2016/ohsumi/facts/"">Nobel Prize for autophagy</a>).</li><li><strong>Disappointment (The Vacuum):</strong> The previous “innovation” (diet pills, gym memberships) fails.</li></ol><h3>Why timing matters more than quality</h3><p>The <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/zeo-sleep-manager-obituary/"">Zeo Sleep Headband (2009)</a> had better technology than the <a href=""https://ouraring.com/"">Oura Ring (2015)</a> — clinical-grade EEG vs. optical sensors. It failed. Oura succeeded. Why? In 2009, only 1 trigger was present (Technology).

Fermentation took 9,000 years to move from survival to science. Fasting took only four years to move from “hacker” app to a pharmaceutical injection (GLP-1s). We are approaching a <strong>pattern saturation point</strong> where cycles turn so fast that “new” products launch into immediate consumer skepticism.</p><h3>The future: 2026–2035 predictions</h3><p>Where is the “Vibe” moving next? Based on the pattern recognition from the last 83 artifacts, here is what I predict for the next decade of preventive health:</p><h4>1. The current wave crashes (2026–2028)</h4><p>We are approaching “Optimization Fatigue.” The resale market will soon flood with $2,000 bikes and $300 rings. Subscription resistance will peak — consumers will reject paying “rent” on their own health data. We will see the collapse of several “personalized nutrition” startups as users realize 40-page algorithmic reports rarely lead to actionable change.</p><h4>2. The pharmaceutical end-game (2025–2032)</h4><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.novonordisk.com/our-products/obesity-care/ozempic.html"">GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic)</a> represent the Final Extraction. We have extracted the biological mechanism so thoroughly that we no longer need the practice of discipline. Expect this to follow in other domains:</p><ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Orexin antagonists replacing the need for “sleep hygiene.”</li><li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Myostatin inhibitors or “exercise mimetics” — pills that mimic the metabolic benefits of a workout without the sweat.</li><li><strong>The Backlash:</strong> By 2030, a counter-movement will emerge that views this pharmaceutical path as “synthetic living,” leading to a massive resurgence in the “Authentic” phase.</li></ul><h4>3. The resurgence of dismissed practices (2027–2035)</h4><p>Whatever we currently consider “outdated” or “inefficient” is a candidate for rediscovery. Watch for:</p><ul><li><strong>Biphasic Sleep:</strong> A return to the pre-industrial “midnight awakening” as a time for meditation or creativity.</li><li><strong>Communal Labor:</strong> Movement that serves a purpose.

We build containers for stories that convince each generation to do what has always worked. But the most valuable “innovation” for the next decade won’t be a better sensor.

<h4>The redesign tested well. Users hate it anyway. Welcome to the paradox that costs companies millions and leaves everyone baffled.</h4><p>When Sonos released its <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">redesigned app in May 2024</a>, the backlash was immediate and brutal. Users couldn’t access basic features like volume control and alarms. Systems became unusable. The company’s stock plummeted 25%. Eventually, the CEO was replaced, and <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">lawsuits claimed over $5 million in damages</a> from customers who’d lost functionality they’d paid for.</p><p>But here’s the part that makes this story particularly fascinating: Sonos hadn’t just thrown darts at a wall and hoped for the best. The redesign came after extensive testing and development. They genuinely believed it was an improvement. And they’re far from alone in discovering that what looks good on paper can feel terrible in practice.</p><figure><img alt=""Netflix homepage featuring Black Mirror as the hero title under “Only on Netflix,” with badges for New Season and Emmy Award Winner, alongside thumbnails for You and Cobra Kai."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q5vFJIgoFU_OFt2GrIEQAg.png"" /><figcaption>Netflix’s redesigned TV interface. Image source: <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-new-tv-layout"">Netflix</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even something as small as <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Google Photos changing its crop tool</a> from square corners to rounded ones in July 2025 triggered enough complaints that Google eventually reversed the change. <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">Netflix faced similar fury</a> when it rolled out its TV app redesign later that year. They claimed months of testing showed improved user satisfaction. Yet Reddit threads exploded with users reporting the new layout as a bug, convinced something had gone catastrophically wrong. Then in October, <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Instagram reorganised its bottom navigation bar</a>, and users immediately started accidentally swiping between sections when they meant to browse photos.</p><p>The pattern repeats itself with almost mathematical precision: the company announces a redesign, users revolt, comment sections fill with rage, and everyone involved feels misunderstood. So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3>Your brain on autopilot</h3><p>Every time you open an app you use regularly, your brain isn’t really thinking about what you’re doing. You’ve developed what cognitive psychologists call automaticity: the ability to perform tasks without conscious attention. Your thumb knows exactly where that button sits. Your eyes scan the screen following a pattern you’ve rehearsed thousands of times. You’re operating almost entirely on muscle memory.</p><p>This isn’t laziness. It’s efficiency. Our brains are designed to convert frequently repeated actions into automatic processes, freeing up mental resources for more demanding tasks. <strong>When you can navigate your favourite app without thinking, that’s your brain working exactly as intended.</strong></p><p>Then comes the redesign.</p><p>Suddenly, that button you could tap with your eyes closed has moved. The menu you accessed with a quick gesture now requires three taps through nested options. Everything that was once automatic now demands active focus. You’re forced back into deliberate, effortful thinking… and it feels exhausting.</p><figure><img alt=""Before-and-after comparison of Duolingo’s learning path redesign on a green background: the old grid layout with circular skill icons (Basics, Phrases, Animals, Food, Family) on the left, and the new linear path with sequential nodes and the Duo owl mascot on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/992/1*DfLmJS5Q1DE4y1rjP6reGw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s home screen redesign. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/new-duolingo-home-screen-design/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">Duolingo redesigned its app in 2022</a>, switching from a branching tree structure to a single linear path, longtime users were livid. The company’s CEO, Luis von Ahn, acknowledged the backlash but stood firm: “People are change averse,” he said, refusing to offer users a way to revert. What he framed as resistance to change was actually something more specific. <strong>Users had built sophisticated mental models of how to navigate the app, and those models had just become obsolete overnight.</strong></p><p>The cognitive load of relearning isn’t trivial. Research into cognitive fluency shows that when information feels difficult to process, we experience it as unpleasant, regardless of whether the end result is objectively better. Your brain genuinely registers the increased effort, and it doesn’t particularly care that the new design tested well with fresh users who never had to unlearn anything.</p><h3>Loss aversion and the endowment effect</h3><p>Even if a redesign objectively offers improvements, we fixate on what’s been taken away. This isn’t just psychological stubbornness. It’s a well-documented cognitive bias called <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">loss aversion</a>. We feel losses roughly twice as intensely as equivalent gains.</p><p>The Sonos disaster illustrates this perfectly. Yes, the new app had a sleeker interface. But users couldn’t adjust their volume or set alarms — functions they’d relied on daily. No amount of visual polish could compensate for losing tools that had become part of their routines. One user’s complaint, shared thousands of times across social media, captured the sentiment: “I’ve spent over £10,000 on a complete home Sonos system. Even if you fix this app, the damage is done.”</p><p>There’s another psychological force at play here: the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">endowment effect</a>. We overvalue things we already possess. <strong>That old interface isn’t just a collection of buttons and menus–it’s ours. We’ve invested time learning it, built workflows around it, developed preferences and shortcuts.</strong> The new design might be objectively superior in controlled testing, but it requires us to surrender something we’ve claimed as our own.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups of a meal planning app showing a daily calorie tracker with macronutrient breakdown, a “3 Week Weight Loss” meal plan with a rocket illustration, and a daily meal planner with swappable breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*71XrxVq75pOPEAWdex70tA.png"" /><figcaption>Lifesum’s old UI.

It had taken something from them without permission.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional banner for the Lifesum app with the logo on the left and two iPhone mockups showing diet plan categories and a daily food diary with calorie tracking, macronutrient breakdowns, and meal logging."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uKD3b0zC7vjSxV9S_y6Ygg.png"" /><figcaption>Lifesum’s new UI. Image source: <a href=""https://yulife.com/blog/lifesum-partnership/"">YuLife</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The familiarity principle</h3><p>Here’s where things get interesting: the design you hate today might be the design you prefer in three months.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">mere exposure effect</a> is one of psychology’s most robust findings. <strong>We develop preferences simply through repeated exposure.</strong> The old design wasn’t necessarily better, it was just familiar. And familiarity feels good. It feels safe. It feels right.</p><p>This creates a paradox for designers. The Netflix redesign that users called “horrible” and “confusing” when it launched? Netflix’s own data suggested that user satisfaction actually improved over time as people adjusted. Von Ahn made the same claim about Duolingo’s controversial path update, pointing to positive engagement metrics even as the Reddit community devoted to the app erupted in fury.</p><p><strong>The question becomes: how long do users need before familiarity catches up? And how much short-term pain is acceptable for long-term gain?</strong></p><p>Instagram’s October 2025 navigation changes demonstrate the friction period. The same swipe gesture now switches between sections and browses multi-photo posts, a decision that likely made sense in design reviews but feels confusing in practice. Will users eventually develop new muscle memory? Almost certainly. But in the meantime, each accidental section switch reinforces the feeling that something is broken.</p><h3>When good design feels wrong</h3><p>This is perhaps the most frustrating part for designers: even genuine improvements can feel worse during the transition.</p><p>Change blindness (our difficulty noticing even significant alterations when we’re not specifically looking for them) means users often can’t articulate what’s different. They just know something feels off. <strong>The cognitive load of adjusting creates a general sense of friction that colours the entire experience negatively.</strong></p><p>Google Photos’ removal of the perspective correction tool in July 2025 showcases another dimension. Google buried manual editing tools deeper to highlight their new AI features, transforming what used to be a two-tap process into a three-tap journey through nested menus. From Google’s perspective, this made sense: guide users toward powerful AI assistance. From the users’ perspective: “where did my tools go?”</p><p>The backlash was significant enough that Google eventually reversed course, restoring both the perspective tool and those familiar square-cornered crop brackets that they’d changed to rounded ones. Sometimes the smallest visual details matter most, especially when they affect the tools people use daily.</p><h3>The AI complication</h3><p>Duolingo’s story adds another layer that’s increasingly relevant: what happens when redesigns coincide with fundamental shifts in how work gets done?</p><p>The 2022 interface redesign was contentious enough. But then in late 2023, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">Duolingo laid off 10% of its contractors</a>: translators whose work was being handed to AI. Another round of cuts followed in October 2024, this time affecting writers. Then in April 2025, <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">von Ahn sent an internal memo</a> (which he also shared publicly on LinkedIn) declaring Duolingo would become “AI-first.” The company would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.”</p><p>For users, this created a toxic combination. <strong>The redesign had already disrupted their experience and removed choice. Now they were watching human expertise being replaced by AI-generated content, with remaining contractors reduced to reviewing machine output for basic acceptability.</strong> The redesign wasn’t just annoying. It felt like evidence of a company prioritising cost-cutting over quality.</p><p>This matters because trust is fragile. When users are already frustrated with interface changes that make their experience worse, discovering that those changes might be driven by a desire to reduce reliance on human workers compounds the sense of betrayal. You’re not just fighting with unfamiliar buttons. You’re questioning whether the company still cares about delivering the experience that made you loyal in the first place.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups showcasing Duolingo Max’s AI features: the subscription page with the owl mascot, an “Explain My Answer” French grammar breakdown, and a “Roleplay” scenario helping a lost tourist in Paris."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DokQmHXtC4s5MbXkL7Wpgw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s AI-focus has received significant backlash from their users. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><h3>What designers can (and can’t) control</h3><p>So what’s a designer to do? The paradox is real: you can’t improve products without changing them, but users will resist change even when it’s beneficial.</p><p>First, accept that the initial backlash isn’t necessarily a sign you’ve failed. Almost every major redesign faces resistance, even ones that ultimately succeed. The Snapchat redesign of 2018 was so unpopular that over a million users signed a petition demanding they undo it. Kylie Jenner’s tweet criticising it temporarily tanked the company’s stock. Yet Snapchat didn’t revert, and the platform survived.</p><p>There is a transitioning problem at play, too. <strong>During that adjustment period, even improvements create cognitive load.</strong> This doesn’t mean your metrics are lying or your users don’t know what they want. It means change has an inherent cost that takes time to recoup.</p><p>Second, how you roll out changes matters enormously. Sonos’ biggest mistake wasn’t just removing features; it was forcing every user into the new app without offering a beta period or a graceful transition. Users reported that the app was “obviously unfinished” and full of critical bugs.

Netflix tested their redesign extensively. But even sophisticated rollout strategies can’t eliminate the fundamental challenge: people who’ve built workflows around your old interface need time and support to adjust.</p><p>Third, communication can help, but only if it’s honest. <strong>Telling users “we tested this, and it’s better” when they’re actively experiencing it as worse creates a disconnect.</strong> Acknowledging that change is difficult, explaining what you’re trying to achieve, and being responsive to legitimate concerns about lost functionality builds more goodwill than insisting everything is fine when it clearly isn’t.</p><p>Google’s decision to eventually restore the perspective correction tool after months of complaints shows that sometimes listening to users means admitting you got it wrong. Duolingo’s refusal to maintain two versions because “it’s difficult” prioritises engineering convenience over user experience.</p><p>Finally, consider whether you’re inadvertently training users to distrust you. <strong>When redesigns coincide with AI integration, workforce reductions, or other changes that suggest cost-cutting over quality, users notice.</strong> They’re not just reacting to the interface. They’re reacting to what the interface represents.</p><figure><img alt=""A staged desk scene contrasting old and new technology.

The automatic processes that make change feel painful are the same ones that make daily tasks effortless. We evolved to build efficient mental models and resist disruptions to them, because in most contexts, that stability serves us well.</p><p>For designers, this creates a genuine dilemma. Products need to evolve. Interfaces that never change become outdated and lose competitive ground. But every change carries a cost that shows up in user frustration, support tickets, and angry Reddit threads, no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>The gap between objective improvement and subjective experience cannot be ignored. Metrics can show increased engagement while users are simultaneously threatening to cancel their subscriptions. Both things can be true at once.</p><p>Perhaps the real insight is that redesigns aren’t just about interface improvements. They’re about relationship management. <strong>Users who feel heard, who understand why changes are happening, and who trust that the company has their interests at heart are far more likely to weather the transition period.</strong> Users who feel forced into changes they didn’t ask for, who lose functionality they depended on, and who suspect the redesign is really about cutting costs will revolt — no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>Not all that changes, improves. But that which does improve often needs to change. The trick is knowing the difference and having the humility to admit when you’ve got it wrong. Sometimes, the most important feature you can build is an undo button.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits:</h3><ul><li>Sonos App Redesign Backlash: <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">CMSWire coverage of customer outrage and falling stock prices</a></li><li>Sonos App Arbitration: <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">ClassAction.org lawsuit details</a></li><li>Netflix 2025 TV App UI Redesign: <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">WebProNews analysis of user backlash</a></li><li>Instagram Update: <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Profile News coverage of interface redesign</a></li><li>Google Photos Tool Restoration: <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Android Gadget Hacks on perspective tool reversal</a></li><li>Duolingo Redesign: <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">NBC News interview with CEO Luis von Ahn</a></li><li>Lifesum User Reviews: <a href=""https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lifesum.com"">Trustpilot customer feedback</a></li><li>Loss Aversion: <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">Behavioral Economics explanation</a></li><li>Endowment Effect: <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">The Decision Lab overview</a></li><li>Mere Exposure Effect: <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">Verywell Mind definition</a></li><li>Duolingo Layoffs: <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">TechCrunch coverage of contractor cuts</a></li><li>Duolingo AI-First Strategy: <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">Tech Republic on replacing contractors</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=263a75915c86"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-your-brain-rebels-against-redesigns-even-good-ones-263a75915c86"">Why your brain rebels against redesigns — even good ones</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Stay relevant by honing your intuition, not your process</h4><figure><img alt=""A person holding a lightbulb surrounded by gears"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZE5eeDaCBXTna7g9GMm5gA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Hannah James</figcaption></figure><p>You likely know, or at the very least know of, a designer who just gets it. I’m talking about the designer who solves complex problems with elegant, user-centred, buildable solutions without breaking a sweat. Or maybe that designer who turns everything they touch into something genuinely beautiful. Or even the one who gets up on a stage and says what we’re all thinking more clearly and eloquently than we can. Maybe all three. Love or irrationally hate them, there they are, making the things that you struggle with daily look easy. You look skyward and wonder, “what is it they have that I don’t?”</p><p>The answer is intuition. They inherently understand what you don’t, and it’s the thing that separates good from great in every field. Paul McCartney just “gets” music. Einstein just “got” Physics. Chumbawamba just “gets” knocked down (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc"">and they get up again</a>).</p><p>But what do we really mean when we say intuition when it comes to design, and why is it resurfacing so vehemently as AI comes into our practice, guns a-blazin’? And importantly, if you’re not feeling particularly intuitive today, how do you fix that? Can you even? The answer is everyone’s favourite “yes, but…”.</p><h4><strong>Intuition and Design</strong></h4><p>If you unpack the concept of intuition, what is it really? For psychologist Daniel Kahneman*, “intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do.” People who intuit correct solutions easily have trouble explaining their process in reaching them. (Zulz)</p><p>Cognitively, intuition is explained by unconscious processes, and might also be called “expertise”. The brain is very good at learning implicitly, and can compare stored memories, patterns, and even emotions with a current scenario without “thinking”. Your brain is even capable of activating what are called <em>mental schemas</em>, complex “chunks” of information, which is how I suddenly still know how to drive whenever I (rarely) find myself behind the wheel of a car. (Cockcroft et al.)</p><p>This figures into design as a practice more than other disciplines, because design trades in what are called “wicked problems”; those that are ill-defined, and lack a single “correct” solution. Design thinking pioneer Nigel Cross, writing in his landmark <em>Designerly ways of knowing</em>, separates design as a discipline, by the fact that it is solution, and not problem-focussed. (Cross 223). For Cross:</p><blockquote>“What designers know about their own problem solving processes remains largely tacit knowledge — ie they know it in the same way that a skilled person ‘knows’ how to perform that skill. They find it difficult to externalize their knowledge, and hence design education is forced to rely so heavily on an apprenticeship system of learning.”(224)</blockquote><p>Design-god Paul Rand, himself possessing a triumphant sense of intuition, stressed its importance, as a sense beyond instructions that can be followed, writing;</p><blockquote>“No system of proportion, color, or space can possibly insure meaningful results. A system can be applied either intuitively or consciously, interestingly or boringly. There is always an element of choice, sometimes called good judgment, at other times good taste. Aside from practical considerations, in matters of form the typographer, for example, must rely on intuition.”</blockquote><p>Intuition in design comes in many forms. For some, it’s finding harmonious visual balance– a nearly automatic application of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOorMb2L-KAfUCTrxzXSvboGPJfw73wM13Zk12rlL_yzBmTRDVzhV"">Gestalt principles</a>. For others, it’s an immediate jump to a solution that just works, or an immediate pivot from one that won’t. Maybe it’s that you connect the dots on where things are going naturally, without doomscrolling <em>Medium</em>. If you’re intuitive, you get to skip the steps. Within every superstar designer, you’ll find a refined intuition in some form or another.</p><p><em>(Note: Kahneman spends a large portion of Thinking Fast and Slow identifying breakdowns in intuition that we routinely make. So when I talk about intuition, it’s really intuition that turns out to be right. “Good intuition”. Lots of people trust their intuition and come to wrong answers, which is why it’s important to be critical of any idea that comes too easily. Gut-check your gut-check.)</em></p><h4><strong>Design’s Skill Cycle, AI’s Tornado</strong></h4><p>If you’re a student of history, or at the very least old, you know that change, when it comes to technology and work, follows a cycle. To begin, a small number of skilled workers produce a product or service that meets a need (demand). As that need expands, skilled labour runs short (supply), which triggers a process called de-skilling, which is exactly what you think it is; taking the skill out of the process in order to meet demand. This involves breaking down the process into small parts that can be done by anyone with training (think of the assembly line). Once a process has become as de-skilled as it can be, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment"">technology steps in and automates the process</a> (once the cost of automation sinks below the cost of labour). <em>This is classical economic theory, you’ll find it in both Adam Smith and Karl Marx.</em></p><figure><img alt=""factory workers assembling a car on an assembly line"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2SGCLKLyKVG3F24Yg6dopw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ford assembly line, 1913 (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure><p>Design has been through this cycle more than once. The creation of movable type in the 1450s gave swathes of scribes the heave-ho, and launched the careers of typesetters, and printers. The need for more printed materials launched type foundries, and improved printing presses, de-skilling the printing process, and making it easier and cheaper to do. Eventually printing automated many of its processes, and the cycle began again.</p><figure><img alt=""Workers at the Chicago tribune office setting type using machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyklq4aGPVsvZZFSIr5WKQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Linotype machines at the Chicago Tribune in the 1960s. InDesign sort of does the job of this entire room of people today (Illinois State Historical library)</figcaption></figure><p>By the time the personal computer started entering households in the 1980s, it brought with it desktop publishing, which wiped out the typesetting industry save for a small cottage industry. A new set of skilled designers emerged using those programs, the glut of materials produced expanded, and again automated.</p><p>Even product design (or UX, or whatever you call it) has been through this cycle before. Before UX software existed, designers used Photoshop (or maybe InDesign), slicing up assets, and redlining pdfs to hand to developers. As the demand for UX design has grown (thanks to the internet and an explosion of digital products), technical solutions have made it easier to do more with less.</p><p>UX today is well inside its de-skilling phase. With sky-high demand over the last decade, Human Computer Interaction, a field once reserved for artsy computer scientists, has ballooned into the field we know today. To meet the needs, it was imperative to de-skill the job. That began with the expansion of design education, and the creation of the “design process” in a formal way. UI kits, design systems, best practice resources, heuristics, playbooks, as well as the absolute dominance of easy-to-use Figma in the field has made it easier than ever for someone with minimal training to “trust the process” and expect that the outcome will be good. A conglomeration of a slim few tech companies that steer the look and feel of virtually all digital products means that they set “best practices”, and those are easy to copy. Even the separation of the production process into product, design, and engineering is itself a breakdown of a very complex system into more isolated parts. Not quite the assembly line, although sometimes it might feel that way.</p><p>But what’s the next step after de-skilling? Automation. We’re seeing it happen live, right now. When Jakob Nielsen posts about Gemini potentially <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/generative-ui-google"">producing better UI than humans</a>, you might feel a bit like a blacksmith pounding a horseshoe while a car rolls by. AI brings with it an automation of the parts of the information economy (and just the economy at large) that have de-skilled. UX design as we know it is most certainly in that category.</p><p><em>(A side note about progress: Do we care if it’s bad? No! As much as we like to grump about how things were better back when ______(insert thing here), fortune typically favours the cheap over the good. Hooray for Capitalism! Will AI-generated UI initially suck? Yes. Will that stop it from becoming the default? No, not if you believe that history rhymes. Early assembly line produced products were horribly bad, but here we are.)</em></p><h4><strong>The re-rise of the intuitive designer</strong></h4><p>Don’t call it a comeback. But let’s look at the facts. AI can produce UI today. And tomorrow it’ll be a little better at it. Generative AI uses both training and models of inference to produce results. And it’s capable of producing multiple solutions at once, very quickly. Any principles or best practices or research that you’re working from can be ingested. So if your design skillset is centred around your diligence in following a process, or your ability to operate design software, well, things don’t look great for you.</p><p>Claude designer Jenny Wen, speaking at last year’s HATCH conference, said the quiet thing loud. In her talk “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM"">Don’t trust the process</a>,” Wen observes that the good design work she’s seen happen is rarely a product of process, and instead born from intuition and play. The reality is that the pace of work has accelerated, and the “discover” phase of the design process is increasingly seen as extraneous, given that an automated solution can come quickly (to be clear I don’t personally love that this is happening, but it IS happening).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href"">https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href</a><p>Not that they were unsuccessful before, but here is where the intuitive designer proves themselves to be more relevant than ever, perhaps exclusively relevant. Intuition provides the things that AI can’t do better– it can bring novel solutions to the table, and make judgments about potential solutions without certainty. Design intuition can also interrogate the problem, and the requirements set to ensure that they truly align. Recall the quote (apocryphally) attributed to Henry Ford, that goes: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”. AI can think of faster horses, intuition can think of cars. This has prompted some thinkers to posit the move from a knowledge-economy, to an <a href=""https://singularity2030.ch/the-power-of-intuition-in-scientific-discovery-and-ai/#:~:text=According%20to%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winner,without%20logical%20arguments%20or%20evidence"">intuition economy</a>. (Rudin)</p><p>If the future of design involves democratising skills through automation by wielding AI tools, Wen says it best: <strong>“In a world where anyone can make anything– what matters is your ability to choose and curate what you make.”</strong> (Wen)</p><h4><strong>Let’s get intuit(ive)</strong></h4><p>Just as following a recipe doesn’t make you a great chef and learning dance steps doesn’t make you a great choreographer, flawlessly executing every step of the design process doesn’t make you a great designer. Bridging the gap requires using your intuition to elide processes, and to make correct decisions hundreds of times as you design.</p><p>If you’re feeling a little glum, and not particularly intuitive today, fear not. Intuition is like a muscle, and just about anyone is capable of building it.</p><p>One way is simply, experience. That’s not to say job experience, but it certainly helps. The more design you experience, the more you’ll build mental schemas and memories around design. Look at design, lots and lots of design. Think about it. Think about why things look the way they do, why this solution has been chosen. If it resonates with you, think about why that is. Develop your sense of taste. Have an opinion!</p><p>Understanding how something actually works might give you more perspective on the problems present, and the solutions available, and might allow you to make connections others can’t see. The great artist Michelangelo spent a creepy amount of time watching dissections, and even performing some. He was able to apply that knowledge to painting and sculpting in ways that showed the true dynamism of the human figure. If you’re a car designer, you should know how metal works. If you’re a digital designer, you should understand code.</p><p>Of course, design is not all about the artefacts, it’s about the people who use them. It’s not surprising that many a great designer, musician, artist, etc. turn out to be either charismatic or provocative. What resonates with people in the work is intuitive to the maker. You need to understand people. For UX designers, there’s a lot to know about how <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/this-is-your-brain-on-design-using-cognitive-science-to-design-effective-experiences-fb6b402047a5"">humans notice, perceive, understand, and generally think</a> that should impact your decision making. Humans also <a href=""http://growth.design/psychology"">exhibit biases, and while we can’t avoid them, we can study and understand them</a>. Ultimately, you can turn all of this information back on yourself, and understand how and why you might be drawing conclusions.</p><p>Finally, design. And collaborate with others who do. With each problem you solve, the more you have to draw on for the next one. Collaboration and play, and time spent with peers and mentors are amazing ways to broaden your horizons. These are the reasons artistic movements, “schools” of thought and practice, musical scenes, and even elite sports dynasties succeed. Even a little healthy competition sparks the need to be creative and intuitive (<em>consider men’s tennis’ “big three,” who collectively spent 900 weeks at number 1, who all claim that competition pushed them to new heights</em>). While no one can teach you actual intuition, you can learn it “from” others.</p><p>Of course, none of your intuition matters if you ignore it. It’s time to listen to that perhaps quiet but still persistent voice in your head that tells you when you’ve really nailed it. Trying to be more like a machine is a losing battle. Might I suggest leaning into the whole “being human” thing.</p><p><strong>*** </strong><br /><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4>Once the QA Engineer enters the room, everyone expects that quality issues will be magically solved.</h4><p>Throughout my career in software testing, I’ve noticed dilemmas that affect the overall team’s dynamics and product outcomes. Believe it or not, these are the patterns that are quite common for every development team I worked with. These very patterns easily block the team’s goal, e.g. to develop a cutting-edge product that could help humanity... As a result, this amazing product exists only in the requirements or in the dreams of the product owner. The team builds something else instead.</p><p>Some teams praise visibility over value, forget about quality in hectic sprints and approach testing without a clear strategy. Sounds familiar? Welcome to the reality of a QA’s job.</p><h3>Visibility over value?</h3><p>In many teams, louder members get praised, even though their impact might be equal to that of more silent members. To find the typical example, just observe an average stand-up meeting. The ones who talk more get all the attention.</p><p>In her <a href=""https://code.likeagirl.io/not-all-great-work-is-loud-77874c554276"">article</a>, software engineer Priyanka Jain tells the story of two colleagues assigned the same task. One posted updates, asked questions, and collaborated loudly. The other stayed silent and shipped clean code. Both delivered. Yet only one was praised as a “great team player.”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl sees Woodpecker working on the tree. Owl asks Woodpecker: “Woody, it’s 6 AM. Why are you so loud?” Woodpecker answers: “Don’t you see? I’ve found a bug!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_G69Y-c0U7wGkeJHXt70iQ.png"" /></figure><p>In many work cultures, we mix visibility with value. If you talk often, people assume you’re contributing. If you’re quiet, they assume you’re not. That is why <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/extroversion"">extroverted personalities</a> get promoted more often than <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/introversion"">introverted ones</a>.</p><p>If you are the only QA person on board, you need to be visible and vocal. Otherwise, your contribution goes unnoticed, the major bugs get ignored, and nobody cares about the product’s quality. Some may even wonder what you are doing there because you don’t ship code.</p><p>If you are an introvert by nature and you don’t like to exhibit your opinion or updates on every corner, it may be a challenge for you. However, this is a reality of “fast-paced” environments: the more vocal and visible you are, the better it is for the team.</p><h3>Quality is the oracle, but is it really?</h3><p>Quality is meant to be the oracle for a product team; it is something that the product team should strive for and manage accordingly. Otherwise, are you sure your customers would tolerate all those bugs and inconsistencies they run into? No team wants to see their product abandoned by the users. Yet, is quality really an oracle?</p><p>Once, I had a debate with a developer about a feature. He argued that he would definitely make a toggle button instead of a drop-down menu because “it looked more fancy”. I asked him to visualise both versions in the prototype tool so we could test each option. In the context of our specific use case, the dropdown menu still looked like an appropriate choice.</p><p>After a brief testing session that we had done together, the developer gave up and agreed. We saved time on the potential rework. (Back then, AI wasn’t so powerful yet. Right now, I would use an AI-driven tool to visualise both cases for the development team. So, we could also save time on a debate.) Anyhow, everyone was happy, including the customers who got a polished version of the product promptly.</p><p>Here, the <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/making-product-quality-a-team-sport-35d94fc0a2cf"">quality mindset</a> is something that could be learned on the way. The role of a QA person is also to promote this mindset, so team members become aware of it. When realising the priority of quality, the development team will do more to prevent bugs in production. Afterall, quality is a team sport.</p><h3>Do we need a testing strategy?</h3><p>Before I joined a team, let’s call it X, it had no testing workflow, and the team wasn’t confident enough to go through the release cycle. There was a usual panic one day before the planned release. The team wasn’t yet conscious about quality. The overall feeling was like: “Testing? We just don’t have time for it. Aren’t you QA? You should figure out something!”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl is standing in front of the flipchart. “TESTING STRATEGY” is written on the flipchart."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VwRLjdR0gdBzcUFERApprA.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The whole situation reminded me of the logic of Hattifatteners from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins"">Tove Yansson’s book</a>, who were always on the move and wanted to reach the horizon at any price. Here, the price was quality.</p><p>In a month, I brought the team to the point where we had a hard talk about the current product quality and what we can do to release better. The team established a QA workflow that consisted of multiple testing techniques at various levels of the product (End-to-End, API, Unit). Agile Testing Quadrants, <a href=""https://lisacrispin.com/agile-testing-quadrants-version-3-from-agile-testing-condensed/"">a tool</a> first introduced by Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin, were our framework for selecting testing techniques that matched team X’s needs. The overall product quality improved a lot then.</p><p>Before a team starts building a quality assurance system for a product, it is smart to brainstorm on how quality assurance should function. It is important to define how the quality will be measured: which t<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/test-smart-how-to-select-testing-techniques-for-agile-team-ad6847eaa242"">esting techniques</a> will be applied to the product, and how overall testing coverage will be achieved.</p><p>It is vital to discuss the current testing status and how the team could prevent defects (which tests to use and at which level). After brainstorming sessions, the QA flow can be outlined by the team. Consequently, there will be less chaos and more peace of mind once the team ships the product.</p><p>If you are struggling with similar dilemmas, there is always a solution for each. In an agile team, get more vocal and communicate the issues clearly. If the team forgets about quality in the reality of speedy sprints, remind them about it and involve team members in testing sessions. And finally, if testing efforts look messy, talk to your team about the testing strategy and create it together. Afterall, aren’t you the one who can figure it out? 🙂</p><p><em>You may check my </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kocbek-001893128/""><em>LinkedIn page</em></a><em> if you feel like connecting with me or are curious about my background.

We mapped flows, removed steps, and optimized interactions — assuming the user would remain the primary actor.</p><p><strong>AI changes that assumption.</strong></p><p>Today, we find ourselves in a dangerous “messy middle.” We are building software that can act, decide, and synthesize, yet we are still designing it as if it were a simple tool. If we want to build products people actually love, we have to stop “sprinkling” AI onto our workflows. We have to answer one fundamental question:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Who holds the steering wheel at this specific moment, and what is the logic that justifies it?</em></strong></blockquote><p>We need a systematic way to move beyond “assistance everywhere.” We need to know when to step back and let the machine take the wheel entirely, and when to protect the human’s role as the accountable driver.</p><p>This article provides a practical framework that turns the “who does what” decision into a repeatable process.</p><h3>The Three Control Modes</h3><p>Every task maps to one of three modes.

AI’s role is to surface evidence, highlight tradeoffs, and structure the decision — but never to act. The human reads, weighs, chooses, and executes.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Improve decision quality and accountability by giving the human clear evidence, tradeoffs, and structured rationale support.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-stakes decisions requiring subjective judgment, empathy, or ethical nuance, or where the process itself creates value.</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Evidence packs (relevant facts, sources, prior cases, policies)</li><li>Tradeoff framing (pros/cons, risks, alternatives)</li><li>Structured decision templates (criteria + rationale capture)</li><li>“Second opinion” critique (counterarguments, failure modes)</li><li>Clear accountability cues (what is suggestion vs decision)</li></ul><h3>2) Assist</h3><p>AI does the heavy lifting — generating drafts, running calculations, scanning documents — but cannot commit consequential actions without explicit human approval.

It acts autonomously within defined boundaries. Humans don’t approve individual actions — they set constraints upfront and review outcomes after the fact.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Run on autopilot with guardrails — minimize user involvement while keeping traceability, monitoring, and rollback when needed.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-volume, low-stakes, predictable tasks with clear success criteria and easily detectable errors — where human review adds friction without adding value (e.g., data entry, spam filtering, meeting scheduling).</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Global constraints (allowlists, budgets, scopes, time windows)</li><li>Activity logs / timelines (what happened, when, and under which policy)</li><li>Monitoring by exception (alerts only on anomalies)</li><li>Rollback/undo where feasible (or compensating actions)</li><li>Audit views (sampling, QA workflows, policy compliance)</li></ul><h3>The Scoring Model</h3><p>Knowing the three modes isn’t enough.

Images made with Midjourney.</blockquote><p>Maybe this text will become outdated as quickly as all the changes we’ve seen happening in our field over the last few years. But even if I run that risk, I feel I need to write a bit about a feeling I’ve seen spreading more and more among designers who work with digital products: <strong>the crisis of professional identity</strong>.</p><p>It’s no longer recent that Artificial Intelligence has been popularized with the rise of LLMs accessible to all audiences on a global scale. Even if it started with large models focused on text, in a short time we saw the exponential growth of countless tools that create a bit of everything.</p><p>When this started to become increasingly evident in our field, I began to notice that people started to understand again that a return to the generalist designer was happening in the digital product space. <strong>NN Group</strong> even published an article talking about the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">return of the UX Generalist</a> as a possible — and also desirable — role due to AI’s advance in delivering so many different parts of our process.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">The Return of the UX Generalist</a></p><p>At first, I interpreted that as positive — even while aware of the ethical and social implications of AI (which won’t be the subject of this text). However, looking more closely at the current landscape, what I’ve been noticing is that:</p><blockquote>the return to generality, with the help of the LLM models available now, doesn’t necessarily have a positive effect and can generate superficiality and a reduction in innovation in the long run.</blockquote><p>In this space, I’ll explain more about this feeling — especially for those who have been feeling anxiety about how AI may affect their professional and personal identity in today’s world.</p><p>This text is not against the use of AI: it’s simply an article with reflections on this current moment of interaction between designers and LLMs.</p><h3>Hyper-specialization as a pain</h3><figure><img alt=""Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*kPUwUssmnobbeDYk"" /><figcaption>Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>In my master’s, one of the authors who helped me most in thinking about the way I liked to work was <a href=""https://www.psychaanalyse.com/pdf/EDGAR_MORIN_LES_7_SAVOIRS_A_L_EDUCATION_DU_FUTUR.pdf""><strong>Edgar Morin</strong></a>. He is a thinker who talks about how <strong>all modern knowledge</strong> (especially since the Renaissance revolution of scientific knowledge) <strong>has been guided by simplification through reductionist thinking</strong>. This reductionism pushes the individual from a broad basic education into higher education restricted to a single discipline, and then into progressively narrower specializations (until it’s expected they dedicate themselves to a single topic for the rest of their life).</p><p>I’ve always been averse to this kind of training, and I felt firsthand the effects of not following the expected path. It was only after many years that I realized doing that was very positive — especially seeing, in practice, this disjunction that Edgar Morin discusses so much in relation to twentieth-century education.</p><p>In these almost three decades that have passed in the twenty-first century, it’s possible to see that the field of digital product design specialized so much that it ended up opening internal fissures. I tend to see this as, at least, three major axes in which people specialize and navigate:</p><ol><li>a <strong>communicational axis</strong>, linked to branding, language, and art direction, where the artistic side of the interface matters a lot;</li><li>an <strong>empirical-scientific axis</strong>, linked to research, methods, data, validation, and decision-making — sometimes captured by ROI and return discourse, but not reducible to that; and</li><li>an <strong>exact and technical axis</strong>, tied to software engineering, where part of design remained close to front-end, components, systems, and implementation, as was already seen more strongly around 2010.</li></ol><p>Of course, this happened because of the size of the complexity of each major area — with only the digital product part relating to communication between humans and machines. But even if there’s a justification, what often happens is a production line between closed niches that don’t talk much to each other.</p><blockquote>Hyper-specialization leads to less communication, since each part understands only its own area and its own topic in depth, but can’t comprehend the issue that lives next door.</blockquote><p>And with that, information passes from area to area until it reaches the professionals at the end of the process: developers. I bet many of you have already witnessed this phenomenon, which creates noise around impediments or disagreements.</p><p>That’s why Morin talks so much about an <strong>education of the future</strong> in which complexity is embraced — in teaching that doesn’t funnel down but opens horizons — while maintaining depth of study. However, even if the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/1061-7361(92)90024-8""><strong>Complexity Paradigm</strong></a> exists in the educational field (and I believe in it and defend it whenever I can), it’s important to be cautious!</p><p>The effects of having professionals who can embrace so many different areas have always been desired by many sectors of the market. That’s why the idea (even if often imaginary) of the “unicorn designer” has always been so promising — a caricature name given to the imagination of a “do-it-all”: someone who, alone, produces a super artistic and interactive interface with decisions grounded scientifically and empirically, and can still make the solution tangible in front-end.</p><p>The “but” in this always-desired idea is that it isn’t humanly possible to make a single professional transmogrify into roles that demand such different cognitive training — especially if you want a product that is truly good in each aspect.</p><p>But this collective imaginary never stopped existing, and it has now been reborn with the emergence and popularization of Artificial Intelligence. By relegating activities to the machine — even without specialized knowledge in a given area — it would be possible to stimulate the existence of this professional who navigates every corner and can deliver well in any activity.</p><p>It’s at this specific point that a promise is born — but also countless risks that are not yet fully predictable.</p><h3>Generalization as a risk</h3><figure><img alt=""Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*5Z7JH1XqKcbrDedV"" /><figcaption>Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been reflecting a lot on this issue. And more and more, I feel the problem isn’t the promise of the return of the generalist in itself: <strong>the problem is the way this may emerge within the scenario we have</strong>.</p><p>Look: unlike a reformed education in which people don’t isolate themselves into niches, what can happen is:</p><blockquote>a professional who keeps the same aptitudes as before, but starts delegating to the machine responsibilities they don’t really know how to develop.</blockquote><p>As the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">NN/G article</a> approaches this issue, the professional can get an <strong>AI boost</strong> — that is, manage to produce outputs in areas they didn’t master before. The output is produced, but the user’s cognition may remain the same as before.</p><p><em>Okay, but what’s the problem with that?</em></p><p>The issue here is that we’re operating primarily with <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, created specifically by companies that operate on a global level. These models learn human language (whether textual or imagistic) from enormous amounts of data to generate, through statistics and probability, responses that are coherent to us, humans. In more technical words, they function as <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fthink%2Ftopics%2Flarge-language-models"">token “prediction” machines</a>: given an input text (prompt), the model estimates what the most likely next token will be and uses that to build the output. I know each AI will have a more specific functioning (with image and video models), but in general, they all operate with statistics from the training specific to the company that created them.</p><p>That’s why AI today is not an intelligence in the human sense of the word: it’s a super complex machine that can learn countless patterns across all areas for which data is digitally available. That’s why it (at least not yet) doesn’t have what some have been calling <strong>neuro-symbolic reasoning</strong>.</p><p>A didactic example given by <a href=""https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/technology-monitoring/techsonar/neuro-symbolic-artificial-intelligence_en"">Massimo Attoresi</a> is about reasoning in medicine: if a patient shows up with a rare symptom that has no report in previous studies, medical knowledge can be mobilized by a human to understand how to unravel that symptom. An LLM can’t do that: it can hallucinate and produce plausible answers or images, because its training prioritizes generating believable responses, even in the absence of sufficient knowledge to solve certain problems.</p><p>For most users, it’s more frustrating to receive an “I don’t know,” which is a questionable UX decision of these platforms. So when a designer who had a specialty starts producing any other specialty with LLMs, they will begin developing that only with the support of that machine that brings the probabilistic result most desired by the global average. And, even more importantly, that person will understand that their work is the output itself!</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>a professional identity is not defined only by what is delivered at the end, but by the cognitive and symbolic construction that allows one to cross complex processes </strong>— including those still unknown to the models or to humanity itself.</p><p>I’ve said so much here, and I wanted to add a parenthesis: yes, it’s possible to do a lot of design using LLMs today — in all instances of our work, including those we wouldn’t be able to do without AI due to training limitations. Now, it’s necessary to understand that when we train an agent to make the machine operate like a specialist in some part of the UX/UI process, we’re always generating probabilistic answers without a neuro-symbolic background to face new, unmapped situations.</p><p>And it’s exactly at this point that the risk lives. It’s a risk of homogenizing solutions, writing styles, innovation processes, visuals — and even code, in the case of massive reliance on LLMs. Unless the support comes from the professional identity path.</p><h3>The professional path as identity</h3><figure><img alt=""Professional and personal trajectory.

Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>Think with me through an example:</p><blockquote>We have a designer who works with digital products and who has always, since very young, fit into a more communicational axis.</blockquote><blockquote>She spent years going deep to create highly visual platforms with unique animations that create an impact that many brands want.</blockquote><blockquote>She also grew by feeding on aesthetic sensitivity, managing to blend branding with product design very well in digital platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, everything she does visually is guided by the feeling built throughout that professional trajectory. And that feeling is based on concepts and methods studied for years, which <strong>allow</strong> her to get through very different problems without impediment.</blockquote><p>That person today may look at the current scenario and begin to feel anxiety and an identity crisis: “<em>Maybe my work won’t be valued anymore in some time because of AI.</em>” With that, she might start using different LLMs, trying to deliver in research areas (both qualitative and quantitative) and also to produce Design Systems, creating already-coded components.</p><p>What will probably happen in the long run if this person doesn’t start studying those fields instead of only creating outputs with AI? <strong>We lose a talent in one area to create a generalist who produces a bit of everything — but only through the LLM</strong>. And because it’s only with the help of that kind of tool, her deliveries will tend to fit the globally expected statistical average.</p><p>Now, what happens if that same person starts using AI to deepen her work, but also to experiment with adjacent areas in order to learn how they work? It’s at this point that I think we gain more from the use of LLMs today.</p><p>Beyond automating manual and exhausting tasks, the AI boost can be applied to our training, enabling dialogues and cooperation with peers that used to be very difficult. And, returning to our dear Edgar Morin, collective thinking becomes more complex because, even though each person maintains their specialization, everyone can understand or do the basics of their teammates’ work — even if with less depth.</p><p>I think this is a very subtle difference, but fundamental for understanding the difference between production and innovation in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Want to talk more about this?<br /> Send me a message on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscervo/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><h3>References</h3><p>GIBBONS, Sarah; SUNWALL, Evan.

<h4><strong><em>Designing how models behave.</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a ux team working together building AI products using data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K1TUKUFPN-K327z9HhexYg.png"" /><figcaption>UX team using their new toolkit (Ilustration from Nothing Fancy)</figcaption></figure><p>We have entered a world where the experience is generated in the moment, and users react to it. The days when products rendered code that produced exactly what we designed are numbered. When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event. Summer 2025."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OQ2Ivg5nLHwYwePKGsXZSA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://youtu.be/RNJCfif1dPY?si=AQw-GonzEACloOCc""><em>Andrew Ng</em></a><em>: Building Faster with AI. Y Combinator.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A necessary mental shift for designers</strong></h4><p>For designers, this is a new space to conquer; it requires a mental shift away from deterministic systems and toward behavioral design. This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop. It is a hands-on training for designers shaping AI behavior through data, context, and evaluations. </em><a href=""https://www.nothingfancy.ai/#workshops""><em>Available now.</em></a></p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=""https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals?promoCode=google-ads&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=23489291219&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23489291219&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA_BlNfmeyjzZpPokar-f2TbcswODy&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAs4HMBhBJEiwACrfNZeYc3LBNOstL9BGqVwQJa6CCLJzI-rILCAMyapthniBV6dE5XAYZKRoCSHEQAvD_BwE"">AI Evals For Engineers &amp; PMs</a> Maven</p><p><a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/"">AI Design Field Guide</a></p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/8rABwKRsec4?si=-YJkHdgny9AuhjTI"">The New Code — Sean Grove, OpenAI</a></p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/SYisFbhR7xs?si=-s7RfH2fXJYodbQg"">No Priors Ep. 128 | With Andrew Ng</a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model designer</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9bd09fea466d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-new-ux-toolkit-data-context-and-evals-9bd09fea466d"">The new UX Toolkit: data, context, and evals</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>The latest text in a group chat with a few of my beauty editor peers reads: “Can we stop pretending that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sacheu-stayn-lip-liner-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lip liner stains</a> are good?” I get it. While TikTok’s beauty enthusiasts would have you believe they’re the best thing since sliced bread — sculpting and staying put for hours on end — those videos are often edited and carefully curated. From drugstore launches to luxury versions, most lip liner stains I’ve tried apply patchy, suck the moisture out of my lips, and flake off by midday. Not even the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/huda-beauty-lip-contour-stain-controversy"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Huda Beauty Lip Contour Stain</a> could convert <em>this </em>naysayer. </p>



<p>But I’ll eat my words, because a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">new launch from Summer Fridays</a> — my favorite lip care brand — is changing everything I thought I knew about this notoriously finicky product. </p>



<h2>What is Summer Fridays’ Flushed Lip Stain, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Just this week, Summer Fridays unveiled its <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Flushed Lip Stain</a>, a long-wear pen that works as both a lip liner and an all-over stain. The range includes six shades, from Almond, a soft neutral brown, to Plum, a deep berry hue.  </p>



<p>What immediately sets this liner apart is the angled felt-tip nib, which makes sculpting and defining lips a breeze. Unlike other pens, it’s not scratchy — you can even create a full lip look by applying it all over, then topping with a swipe of gloss. </p>



<p>Besides the unique shape, Summer Fridays claims that the formula is transfer-proof, buildable, and non-drying. The latter caught my eye, especially because most pen liners are so drying, they make my lips feel tight and itchy. But this one doesn’t, thanks to a handful of smart skincare ingredients. </p>



<p>First, aloe vera gel, which I’m convinced gives the pen more slip, preventing it from snagging. Then there’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">panthenol, a skincare ingredient</a> that dermatologists rate for boosting hydration and supporting the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin barrier</a>, essentially the outermost layer of skin that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Since lip skin is thinner than elsewhere, these plumping, moisture-locking ingredients are especially welcome. </p>

<h2>What makes the Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain special? </h2>



<p>This is the sort of product that makes me want to earn a degree in cosmetic chemistry to understand why it works so well. Unlike others, it’s not immediately soaking wet, so it doesn’t run, drip, or require a futile clean-up operation. Instead, it’s so precise that it feels almost like using a pencil liner to trace my lip line. That said, there are a few seconds of blending time. Some lip stains dry instantly, but I use my finger or a fluffy brush to blur this slightly for a natural, lived-in effect rather than harsh lines. </p>



<p>For a seamless lip look, I recommend pairing the stain with a gloss or balm in a similar shade. My favorite combos <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940476%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">are Almond</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsummerfridays.com%2Fproducts%2Flip-butter-balm-hot-cocoa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm in Hot Cocoa</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940385%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"">Rosette</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP515960%3FskuId%3D2874287"">Glow Recipe Glass Balm in Blackberry Bingsoo</a>. Adding a gloss or balm on top further blurs the lip line, making lips look naturally defined, not obviously drawn on. </p>



<p>I’m a big tea drinker, and the only thing that transfers onto the mug is the gloss. On me, this stain stays pretty much intact for around six hours before I even think about topping up, and I can still see the ghost of it at the end of the day. Happily, I never need to scrub to remove it; I use <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fskinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1-cleanser-makeup-remover-xlsImpprod13531031%3Fsku%3D2298445"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water</a> on a cotton round and swipe gently. The micelles — tiny molecules that act as surfactants — dissolve and lift the product away effortlessly. </p>

<h2>What to know about Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain </h2>



<p>• Available in six shades to suit all skin tones: Almond, Plum, Mocha, Maple, Rosette, and Slipper. </p>



<p>• The transfer-proof formula is buildable, depending on how opaque you want it. </p>



<p>• Features a soft, tapered felt-tip nib for precise application. </p>

<h2>Is the Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain worth it? </h2>



<p>My makeup bag is a dumping ground for lip liner stains that have disappointed me, but these have their own special jar. On days when I know I won’t have time to keep my lipstick topped up, I apply this all over and finish with a balm, which gives a satin-like lipstick effect. </p>



<p>To really get the most out of a lip liner stain like this, prep is key. My lips are always the last step in my makeup routine, so before I even start, I apply a thick layer of moisturizer (or eye cream — trust me, it works!) to soften them. When it’s time to line, I use a tissue to blot away as much as I can, and that’s when I go in with the product — applying it to lips that are naked but moisturized. (I’m a firm believer that moisturized lips hold onto pigments far better than parched ones.) Lip balm or gloss can be a little too thick, and in this case, the pigment might not cling as well.  </p>



<p>Lastly, I’ve found that these stains dry out far less quickly than others, but I like to store them upside down, so the formula is always ready when I go to line my lips. </p>

So, like a growing number of people around the country, I’m meal-prepping. Currently, I’m using Williams <a href=""https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/hold-everything-glass-containers-with-lids-14-piece-set/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sonoma’s Hold Everything Glass Food Storage Containers</a>, a 14-piece set with both rectangular and round containers that easily store full meals as well as core ingredients for salads, pastas, rice bowls, and more.

That said, I’m doing everything I can to make cooking at home as seamless as possible. And as a single girl who lives alone, that means using cookware that’s less daunting, pots and pans that are perfect for smaller meals and have easier cleanup. Right now, I’m loving <a href=""https://fromourplace.com/products/mini-cookware-duo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Our Place’s Mini Cookware Duo</a>, which includes a mini Always Pan and mini Perfect Pot.

This model saves me even more time because it cooks and bakes in a glass bowl that comes with an airtight lid, making storage and reheating as simple as moving it in and out of the refrigerator. But my absolute favorite part is how easy the non-toxic glass is to clean. I can simply remove the bowl and wash it in the sink, no need to scrub to remove grease from trapped crevices or coatings.

<h3><strong>What is Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection and what are the benefits?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty is a sustainable, Los Angeles-based, Latina-owned beauty and skincare brand using natural ingredients to nourish the skin and support self-care rituals. Its Milk &amp; Rose collection makes up the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fradiant-skin-trio&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"">Radiant Skin Trio.</a> It includes a luxurious <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fbody-scrub&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">body scrub </a>crafted from nourishing goat milk, hydrating coconut oil and shea butter, and calming roses that both exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and smooth. Next, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagnesium-salt-soak&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak</a>, which uses Epsom salts, pink himalayan salts, goat milk powder, flower oils, and rose petals to relax your body while also moisturizing your skin so you leave your bath feeling hydrated rather than dried out. And lastly, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fhair-and-body-mist&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hair &amp; Body Mist</a>, which uses rose extract, chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, and Pro Vitamin B5 to hydrate and revitalize your hair and body and leave you smelling as luxurious as the bath you just walked out of.</p>



<h3><strong>What makes Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection special? </strong></h3>





<p>The Milk &amp; Rose Collection blends soothing botanicals, skin-loving milks, and hydrating natural extracts. Many of the products share the same ingredients, like goat milk to hydrate the skin and rose extract, rich in antioxidants, to soothe and brighten the skin. Other ingredients work together to support the skin barrier and promote lasting moisture. For instance, gentle exfoliants like brown sugar and lactic acid smooth away dry skin so nourishing oils, shea butter, and vitamin E can absorb more deeply, while Pro-Vitamin B5 and calming botanicals help soften the skin, lock in hydration, and relax the senses.</p>



<h3><strong>How to use Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty recommends starting with a body scrub to gently exfoliate dead skin cells, rejuvenate dull areas, and support skin repair. When you’re done, draw a warm bath, sprinkle in about ¼ cup of the Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak, and immerse yourself in the milky water and delicate rose petals for about 15 minutes. I like to enhance the experience with a soft candle, light music, and maybe even a good read. When you’re out of the bath, your skin will feel hydrated (and look radiant!), but you’re not done yet. To complete the pampering ritual, spritz some of the Hair &amp; Body Mist all over to smell as softly floral and refreshed as you feel.</p>



<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>





<p>My favorite part of this collection is the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. While the floral petals can be a little annoying to clean up after a shower, I still try to use it once a week. It’s honestly the best scrub I’ve used at this price point because it doesn’t just remove dead skin, it also helps restore moisture and leaves my skin feeling velvety smooth when I step out of the shower. I save the full routine for special occasions, and by special occasions I mean whenever I feel like I need some extra pampering. It really is a treat for all of my senses. At $77, it’s a pretty powerful trio. But if you’re only going to choose one product, I’d absolutely recommend the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>The rumors are true: Fashion is transporting us back to 2016. For proof, look no further than the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">nostalgic shoe trends</a> making a comeback. After seasons and seasons of minimalism and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pierced-fashion-trend-tory-burch-shoes"">quiet luxury</a>, consumers are returning to a more expressive way of clothing themselves in 2026, and they’re starting from the feet up. <br /><br />“There’s a real appetite right now for dressing with more emotion and intention, and less interest in things that feel disposable,” says <a href=""https://www.miista.com/en-US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miista</a> CEO and founder Laura Villasenin. “It’s all about balance: Soft but strong, familiar yet a little unsettling, traditional but rebellious. That contrast feels very honest — it’s how people want to show up now. You can be refined and strange all at once.”<br /><br />There are a slew of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vibram-five-finger-ugly-shoe-trend"">shoe trends</a> making waves in the new year.

However, don’t just take our word for it. Keep reading for a list of subversive shoe trends that will make your outfits feel very now indeed.</p>

This includes goth-inspired footwear with buckles, grommets, studs, and witchy lace-up vamps. Margot Robbie recently donned a pair of edgy rosary sandals from the new <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/detail#3"">Alexander McQueen</a> collection during her expectedly epic press run, while <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/studio_constance/"">Studio Constance</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/copenhagen-fall-2026/skall-studio/slideshow/collection#3"">Skall Studio</a> embraced the edge with deconstructed ballet flats and lattice detailing during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">Copenhagen Fashion Week</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miista/p/DTN7rJXjBvV/"">Miista</a> showed a lineup of striking silhouettes for spring 2026 that certainly fit the bill — and come with New York City first lady Rama Duwaji’s seal of approval. <br /><br />“Our designs often sit outside traditional ideas of ‘prettiness,’ favoring strong, sculptural shapes and an outsider energy that resonates with people who see fashion as a form of self-expression rather than a way of fitting in,” says Villasenin. And while Miista shoes may be polarizing, she adds that is precisely the point: “The ‘ugly’ or ‘weird’ label is not just about provocation for its own sake but more about doing things differently –– challenging fashion’s business-as-usual practices and creating pieces with care, intention, and longevity.”</p>

<h2>A Cut That Fits Like a Glove<strong> </strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958015.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Glove pumps were initially popular during the 1980s, and earned an aughts-era revival thanks to the hipster set. Designers have since adapted that nostalgic V-cut silhouette to complement flats and strappy sandals, too. Brands of all sizes, including heritage fashion houses like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balenciaga/slideshow/detail#20"">Balenciaga</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/chanel/slideshow/collection#28"">Chanel</a>, are embracing a high vamp for 2026 to accentuate the shape of the wearer’s foot. Cool-girl labels like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/moschino/slideshow/detail#31"">Moschino</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/khaite/slideshow/collection#28"">Khaite</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/attico/slideshow/collection#47"">The Attico</a> took a bolder approach with playful animal prints and exaggerated features. The key to successfully pulling these shoes off IRL is wearing them with leg-baring hemlines like skirts and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">dresses</a>, allowing your footwear to really shine through. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Flat Sock Boots</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958001.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2025"">boxing boot trend</a> set the stage for a  more prim and polished throwback in 2026. Enter the sock boot. Perhaps you remember the 2016 version of this boot, and how the structureless silhouette looks great with pretty much anything. Opting for a leather or suede pair à la <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/courreges/slideshow/detail#2"">Courreges</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/christophe-lemaire/slideshow/collection#38"">Lemaire</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/ann-demeulemeester/slideshow/collection#17"">Ann Demeulemeester</a> will earn you plenty of sartorial mileage. Those looking for something playful should opt for a floppy moccasin style like the sock boots from the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/louis-vuitton/slideshow/detail?share=app#1"">Louis Vuitton</a> runway. Either way, layer these kicks under dresses or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">wide-leg pants</a> for well-balanced proportions.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Updated PVC</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958018.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you needed confirmation that 2026 is the new 2016, the resurgence of PVC footwear really seals the deal. It feels like just yesterday that see-through heels and boots were everywhere. They’re now back thanks to the likes of <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/chloe/slideshow/collection#22"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chloé</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/detail#10"">Maison Margiela</a> — the latter of whom updated their signature Tabi shoes with a nearly invisible outline. Take styling cues from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/detail#21"">Loewe</a> by layering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">colorful hosiery</a> underneath your PVC shoes for a dynamic look that you can customize again and again. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Sculptural Wedges</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958006.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Stilettos not your thing? Try sculptural <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-sneakers-trends"">wedges</a> as an equally glamorous alternative. This season, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/isabel-marant/slideshow/detail#78"">Isabel Marant</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/lanvin/slideshow/detail#86"">Lanvin</a> seamlessly blended practicality and style with discreet and manageable heel heights. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/detail#65"">Balmain</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection"">DSquared2</a>’s interpretations offer stark contrasts, with phantom heels and thigh-high shafts that are a lot more wearable than you may think. Subtle yet artful details bring a necessary update to an otherwise retro silhouette. Leverage your next pair of wedges to give <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">longline trousers</a> and floor-sweeping dresses an instant lift. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soft Sneakers</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958004.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Gone are the days of chunky, dad sneakers dominating the market. Their replacement is both <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">sleek and malleable</a> for the seasons ahead. Soft sneakers are having a huge moment, both on and off of the runway, with designers like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/dries-van-noten/slideshow/detail#76"">Dries Van Noten</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/prada/slideshow/detail#50"">Prada</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/jacquemus/slideshow/detail#75"">Jacquemus</a> leveraging stripes and satin to create a derby-like effect. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/miu-miu/slideshow/detail#155"">Miu Miu</a> has your next vacation covered with a canvas and jute style that will take you from beach to street with ease. Looking for a mid-range option? Alo’s retro-inspired Sunset sneaker has become a fan favorite among influencers and editors alike. The best part about these shoes is their versatility; wear them with everything from tailored trousers and flared leggings to an off-duty dress.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>3D Petals</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958008.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While Loewe and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a> have been producing floral heels for a few seasons, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11337030/floral-rosette-appliques-fashion-trend"">three-dimensional petals</a> are popping up all over the runway in a way that feels fresh for 2026. Replacing graphic prints, this modern take gives wearers a life-like look without the maintenance or mess that a real flower would require. Brands like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/proenza-schouler/slideshow/detail#53"">Proenza Schouler</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-couture/christian-dior/slideshow/collection"">Christian Dior</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/paco-rabanne/slideshow/collection#32"">Rabanne</a> incorporated colorful appliqués into their latest collections. Whether you pick giant blooms or tiny sequined posies, your outfit will be ready for spring.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Sharp-Toe Mules</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958020.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Slip-on shoes are timeless, but when designed with a prominent toe shape that protrudes from underneath pants and long dresses, they can feel a lot more of the moment. Statement mules from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/victoria-beckham/slideshow/collection"">Victoria Beckham</a> and<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection#47""> Acne Studio</a>’s respective collections from spring 2026 are prime examples of 2010s nostalgia with a modern twist.  </p>

<p>If you’re wondering whether the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">blurred makeup trend</a> is here to stay, let Charlotte Tilbury put those doubts to rest with its latest launch, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a>. You’ve likely heard of the Airbrush Flawless cinematic universe from the beloved <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-finish-setting-powder-P433526"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pressed powder</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-setting-spray-P461147"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">setting mist</a>, but the makeup artist’s newest launch is already emerging as an early favorite among R29 editors. </p>



<p>Ahead, get up close and personal with Charlotte Tilbury’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a>, and see how it looks on us. </p>



<h2><strong>What is Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and what are the benefits?  </strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a> is billed as a full-coverage concealer with a soft-matte finish. (In comparison, Charlotte Tilbury’s Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer has buildable, medium coverage.) In addition to claims of up to 24 hours of creaseless wear, it’s infused with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane. And let’s talk about the wand, because this isn’t your typical doe-foot applicator; it’s got a unique, diamond-like shape that allows it to get into precise spots (like around the eyes) but large enough to quickly dot all over in place of foundation. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957171.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What makes Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer special?  </strong></h2>



<p>Unlike some of our other favorite concealers from the brand (take <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-beautiful-skin-concealer-review"">Beautiful Skin</a>, for example, which has a creamy texture and natural coverage), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> lends a full-coverage, “filter-like” finish to the skin to minimize texture and imperfections. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and the matte finish (a rarity these days, in a sea of dewy, radiant products) makes my complexion look as smooth as a Vermeer portrait. “The coverage is incredible, which means you really only need a pin prick to tuck away breakouts, dark circles, or hyperpigmentation — any more than that accentuates my fine lines and dry patches,” adds Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957756.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>But don’t just take our word for it. “It didn’t feel heavy at all,” agreed Refinery29’s production and editorial coordinator Dawnie Jefferson. “It blended really easily, which is usually my issue with concealer. I also loved the soft matte finish, which looked great in photos.” </p>



<h2><strong>What to know about Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer:  </strong></h2>



<p>• Available in 34 shades. <br />• Provides lightweight full coverage with a blurred matte finish. <br />• Contains hyaluronic acid and squalane for hydration and comfort.</p>



<h2><strong><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a></strong><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"">, $36</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957776.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>How do you use Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and is it worth it? </strong></h2>



<p>Unlike other concealers that are lighter in coverage (and therefore more forgiving), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> is dependent on correct application. Both myself and Jackie were overenthusiastic the first time, only to realize that less is more with this formula. “I made the mistake of applying big swipes under my eyes (old habits die hard) and struggled to make it look natural,” she says. “The fact that so little goes a long way is actually a bonus — concealer is expensive, and it’s my most-used product, so this one is excellent value.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957783.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Since this is a matte, full-coverage formula, I lean into skin prep in order to create a hydrated, radiant base that will provide a comfortable canvas for makeup. Instead of my everyday technique of dotting concealer in place of foundation and blending, I ended up strategically placing tiny dots only where needed and buffing it out with my <a href=""https://roseandbenbeauty.com/products/de-buffing-concealer-complexion-brush"">Rose &amp; Ben D2 complexion brush</a>. In my experience, this delivers the natural coverage I typically prefer, while still evening out hyperpigmentation and breakouts. </p>



<p>The overall effect isn’t mask-like. Instead, it tucks away dark circles, breakouts, and hyperpigmentation in a way that doesn’t erase features. My skin still looks like skin.  </p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></h2>



<p>When Charlotte says “blur,” this truly does the job. As an oily, acne-prone girl, I personally love the diffused, matte finish, which I found made additional setting powder optional. (I do like a setting mist for added insurance, though.) Jackie agrees, adding that the coverage “really is second to none.” </p>

<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025. </em></p>



<p><strong>Editor’s note: After a short hiatus, we’re back once a week! Thank you for your patience. We’ll be honoring Money Diary submissions we received during our break by publishing them in the coming weeks. There’s more to come soon — stay tuned.</strong> </p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior director<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Healthcare<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 37<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Oregon<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $220,000<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> I’m recently divorced. I have the ability to bonus up to 20% annually as well. I’m not banking on that this year because it hinges on the profit margin for the hospital, and hospitals aren’t doing great right now.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> $65,815 in checking/savings (the majority is in a high yield savings account), $190,615 in investments/retirement accounts, house valued at $482,000, and SUV valued at $22,589. I spent my savings considerably over the last few months on a downpayment for my house and a kitchen/bath remodel. I still have one more check to fork over for the remodel and then I will be focused on building my savings back up. I keep a balance of $5,000 in my checking, $5,000 in a savings account at the same bank, and roll everything surplus into a high yield savings at an online bank. I keep $30,000 in an emergency fund and let the rest go towards whatever pops up. I like to have a good financial cushion, and it feels even more important now that I am on my own. I saved aggressively over the last few years to be able to comfortably exit a very bad marriage. My current job was a huge pay increase for me and required me to move away from my now-ex giving me a very fortunate exit pathway (thanks universe!).<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $411,913.38 on my mortgage.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Biweekly):</strong> $4,677.82<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/Her</p>



<p><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Monthly Housing Costs:</strong><br /><strong>Mortgage:</strong> $2,988.27. I recently purchased an ADORABLE 1940s colonial in my favorite neighborhood. It’s way too much house for me with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, but I fell in love with it. I had to upgrade the electrics and decided to sink the majority of my savings into a remodel of the kitchen (it was terrible), and the main floor bathroom, too. According to my expense tracking spreadsheet, the remodel will cost approx $85k. <strong>Monthly Loan Payments:</strong> $0. My car is paid off, and I didn’t have any student loans.<br /><strong>All Other Monthly Plan Expenses: </strong><br /><strong>Cell phone: </strong>$104<br /><strong>Streaming services:</strong> $68 <br /><strong>Utilities: </strong>$250<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $72.45 (AppleCare, Apple Music, ChatGPT, NYT and iCloud). <br /><br /><strong>Other: </strong><br /><strong>Beauty treatments:</strong> I spend around $400 every 12 weeks on botox, and $45 at a similar interval to get my hair cut. I don’t have the patience for getting my hair colored or maintaining my nails. (I did recently have someone compliment my highlights which are definitely grey hair.)<br /><strong>Savings: </strong>I receive a monthly stipend from the VA [Veterans Affairs] of $774.16 that goes directly into my savings. I pay off my credit cards every paycheck, and roll what’s left above the $5k I keep in my checking and savings at my brick and mortar bank into a high yield savings account. </p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />It was never expressly stated, but both of my parents went to college and it was assumed my brother and I would as well. I went to a state school for my undergrad, and an online state school for my Master’s degree. There were some detours in the bachelors process because I was a wild ass and partied way to much, nearly got kicked out, and then used the military to straighten myself out after my freshman year. I went back to school post deployment to finish my bachelors. I did have a college fund that my grandparents set up for me with around $20,000 in it. I spent it mostly on a car or to pay off credit cards when I overspent. It dwindled over time. I still have some of it in an investment account though. I had a scholarship in undergrad that covered books, and used a combo of tuition assistance through the national guard and my GI bill benefit to cover both my bachelors and Master’s degree.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />Money was openly discussed, partially because it was pretty tight when I was little. My dad was a cop and my mom is a medical technician and they were both early shift workers. They would pick up extra shifts when we needed to make ends meet. The core lesson was to not spend what you don’t have — my family has a very conservative view on debt which I have carried into adulthood. My grandfather also liked to educate my brother and I on finances by encouraging us to think about retirement early on in our lives, and to understand the value of investing and money growing over time. My brother is the better saver out of us, but after a few overspending situations when I was young I figured it out. I would say I’m the least fiscally conservative of my family. I pay for nice vacations and was willing to use my savings on a renovation — my brother thinks I am insane for it but it is within my means.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job was selling wild game summer sausage and hot sauce to tourists in a VERY niche retail store. I got that job the week I turned 16 and had transportation to reliably get to and from work. I was expected to earn my own spending money and babysitting gigs weren’t that lucrative. I traded up to selling rodeo tickets a few weeks later and worked in a cowboy hat shop on weekends during the school year for spending money. I have always had a job or been actively job hunting since then (I had a really miserable time finding a job after moving with my now-ex to New Mexico).<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes, I knew we were living paycheck to paycheck a lot of the time. However, that being said, my parents actively saved for retirement and we probably could have been a bit more comfortable if they were less responsible about that. We largely ate elk instead of store bought meat — it was considerably better financially to get an elk every autumn and live off of that than try and purchase meat from the grocery store. I thought beef was a total luxury. I did dance lessons and was acutely aware that extra on-call shifts paid for it. Around the time I was going into high school, my dad became the undersheriff and my mom was promoted into management, so money became less of a worry. My friends were definitely better off than I was but it was less acute.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. This year, I got a divorce and I let my ex-husband keep the house (which had about $200k in equity), a car, and gave up my rights to his pension and military retirement. So, I had to reevaluate my financial position (Life advice: don’t roll over in the divorce process like I did, but trauma can make you do dumb things). Luckily, I had saved very well to be able to walk away and my current job was a $70k pay increase. I feel a bit behind in retirement savings but I try to keep in mind that this income level is really fresh. Before I finished grad school I was making around $32k a year and have seen my income climb quite a bit over the last seven-ish years. My financial planner has assured me I’m fine, but I really want to rebuild my savings and continue to save aggressively for retirement.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible at 18, minus health insurance and my cell phone. I was on my parents’ insurance off and on until I aged out, and they paid for my phone until I met my ex-husband and got on his phone plan. I do know that I could fall back on my parents for help if I needed to, but I never want to need to ask for that. They did inherit, what is to our family a lot of money, last year when my grandmother passed away and would be able to help me out (thanks great grandparents for saving up a small nest egg!)<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />I receive a passive $774 monthly from the VA, and as of this year get an annual check for whatever the IRS gifting limit is. This year was $38,000 — basically the only reason I was able to buy the house and finance the remodel in the same year. My grandparents sat on the money while we struggled and my parents have decided to gift it away annually so my brother and I have it while we are young(ish). I’m going to put it into the house throughout 2027, and then my financial planner is going to do whatever he does with it, and eventually my brother’s kids will inherit it or I will be the ‘cool gift money aunt’ so they put me in one of the nice care homes.</p>

<h3>Day One: Saturday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I slept in until 6:30 a.m., got up and then fed my dog, C. Then I made coffee and ate half a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Carbs are a new luxury in my life, as of last May, when I moved here and stopped having to do whatever fad diet my ex-husband was insisting on. The bagels still feel like a rebellion. I don’t eat much for breakfast, breakfast is also somewhat new, because intermittent fasting was part of the pre-freedom regimen. I also have a glass of water with creatine — another new thing I’m trying.</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I’ve been cleaning the house all morning and I’m starving, so I make a big ass Caesar salad for lunch with romaine lettuce, parm, croutons, and pine nuts with BRIANNAS dressing. I have been living through a remodel since mid-June and the kitchen is mostly done, so I’m aggressively tackling the construction dust. I’m also anxious to have the house in good condition because a man I have been talking to is driving 2.5 hours today to have a first date with me, and somehow we both think it is reasonable for that first date to be him cooking dinner with me and staying over. This is made more unhinged by the fact that I have not had a single successful first date. I started dating in January for the first time since I was 23. I’m bad at it, as are generally all men.</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — Purchased two ribeye steaks from the local butcher shop for dinner tonight. The guy, we can call him H., has promised to impress me with his grilling ability. The butcher shop is super high quality and a local legend kind of place. I have run out of things to clean and am trying to be chill while I wait for H. to get into town. Also worth noting: my ex-husband, out of nowhere, shipped me a large package that arrived today containing my military dress uniform, five old stretched out ponytail holders, a chewed up pair of sneakers, travel shampoo/conditioner and travel deodorant, moisturizer, and a broken hair clip. So he seems to be doing great. I have cut off communication and this feels like a desperate play to get attention. I will not give him the satisfaction of acknowledging it. <strong>$38.67</strong></p>



<p>9:00 p.m. — Dinner consists of cold ribeye and broccolini. H. made it into town a lot later than anticipated. He was halfway here when he got an alert that a wildfire had started near his house and his neighborhood was being evacuated so he turned around. They got it under control after about an hour, so this man turned back around and still ended up coming to see me. Wild. He got here around 7:30 p.m., we started making dinner after I showed him around the house and introduced him to C. Somewhere between pulling the steaks from the grill and now, things got spicy. We’re enjoying cold steaks and having a good laugh about it. This continues to be the most inadvisable first date I can imagine. We watched a comedy special after dinner and then went to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $38.67</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Two: Sunday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — Breakfast is another half bagel and cream cheese with coffee. C. has his standard dog food and blueberries. H. left early this morning to get home and get ready for the workweek. I’m existing and trying to understand what on earth I’m doing. The plan for the day is doing some laundry and my Fantasy Football league draft. I get a text from H. when he makes it home to let me know he got there safely. Not ghosting me right away is good, right?</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I’m suddenly starving and DoorDash a chile relleno burrito, chips and guac, and “Mexican fries” from a local taco shop. I love this burrito. I have never tried the fries but they’re really good. I don’t eat very many of them, or really any of the chips and guacamole, because the burrito is enormous. Why I decided to get anything with it no longer makes sense to me. I’m currently couch rotting and waiting for the Fantasy draft to start. I end up taking a nap to make up for staying up late last night with H. I also end up autodrafting versus actively participating in the league draft. This is a good choice since I don’t actually follow football. <strong>$25.75</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftover chips and guacamole, with the addition of salsa. Benefit of living alone: no one can judge your eating habits. Freedom has its perks. After couch rotting all afternoon and eating like garbage, I head up to bed early and read until I fall asleep. I’m currently shamelessly vacillating between fantasy smut and traditional romance. Tomorrow I’m back to work so an early bedtime and a restful day are hopefully setting me up for success. I get a goodnight text from H., so that makes me smile. It freaks me out that I like him and that this weekend went reasonably well.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $25.75</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Three: Monday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — I wake up without snoozing my alarm, feed C., make coffee and eat the traditional half bagel. (I’m wild, I know.) There’s a good morning text from H. while I’m eating breakfast. I take mornings really slow — I like to listen to the <em>NYT’s The Headlines</em>, sit on the couch, work on a crossword and spelling bee, read email, and generally relax until about 7 a.m. It’s my morning dilly-dally routine and it gives me joy. At 7 a.m., I start to get ready for work and it’s back to reality.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — We have a new physician starting today and I happen to not have a meeting over the lunch hour, so I join him and the manager of the clinic for the new employee lunch. They have my favorite soup in the cafeteria today, chicken tortilla soup, so of course I get that. My assistant puts it on my Outlook calendar when it is ‘Tortilla Soup Day’. It kills me. She is for sure one of my favorite humans. Lunch is good, small talk is successful, and I spend a little time after in my office before the afternoon meeting marathon. <strong>$4.69</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I did a very bad job of planning my grocery pick-up last Friday and decide that instead of suffering for the week I will place another order, this time for delivery. I also give in to some cravings with this purchase. I get hot honey, chicken sausages, half a loaf of sourdough, hamburger buns, green onions, heirloom tomato, sliced cheese, cauliflower, a steak, ground beef, cilantro, jalapeños, Gatorade zero powder (I’m addicted to lemon lime Gatorade zero), Beecher’s cheddar, water crackers, and some fancy jam. <strong>$118.75</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — Dinner is also meal prep this evening. I sear some chicken thighs, add a ton of zucchini and yellow squash to the pan, along with dry riesling and some chicken stock, and let it simmer. I add cherry tomatoes and orzotto once the chicken is breaking down and pull the chicken apart, so it is more bite sized. I finish by adding ricotta and crushed red pepper. It’s frigging delicious. I made the recipe up so who knows if I can ever successfully repeat it. I eat and spoon the leftovers into Tupperware servings for lunches. I love to cook and I hate following a recipe. It has been such a luxury to be able to be fully creative in the kitchen again. Also: exactly why the kitchen remodel was worth it. I opted for an induction range and reaaaalllyy love it. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I’m still figuring out how to live in my new kitchen, and decide I need something to organize the spatulas etc in the drawer by the oven. I hop on Amazon and find an OXO organizer and add it to my cart. I also add another bag of multi-colored letter beads to fuel my current Taylor Swift friendship bracelet therapy. I make them for the songs that stick out to me for any given mood and usually wear a few every day. I pick them to go with my mood or how I want the day to go. It is a whole thing and I’m not ashamed. I also toss in better belly rawhides and check out. C. really likes them and we go through them frequently. I watch an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> with a glass of wine and head to bed. I get a goodnight text from H. before I fall asleep. <strong>$24.25</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $147.69</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Four: Tuesday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — As usual, I’m up at 5:40 a.m., feed C., make coffee, and eat half a bagel. No good morning text from H. today. I cave and text him good morning at 6:21 a.m. and get an immediate reply. I’m overthinking it. Luckily, I have an insane meeting schedule today and won’t be able to dwell on it. First meeting starts at 7 a.m., so the dilly dally is cut short this morning. I have essentially back-to-back meetings until 5 p.m. so the dread is real.</p>



<p>11:00 a.m. — I have a 15-minute gap between meetings to handle being a biological being. I scramble to the bathroom, toss my lunch in the microwave, take up temporary residence in the affectionately dubbed ‘squatters office’ (there is a tiny office in the executive suite directly adjacent to the toilet with the expected acoustics) and try and clear my email before the next meeting while eating my lunch (the prepped chicken pasta) and yapping with L., the executive team’s Administrative Assistant. I’m currently reeling from the last meeting where it was announced that we need to submit three financial improvement tactics per department by next Friday. I did the math: 51 strategies. I text H. that we need to make a plan to see each other, so I have something to look forward to and he responds quickly to see what is going on and we text but don’t make an actual plan. After responding to a few emails, I head to the boardroom to talk about marketing campaigns. The glamour.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — I’m home, makeup off, in my comfies, and C. has been fed. I’m very mentally wiped out from the day, and listening to an audiobook while I cook. Dinner was supposed to be frittata as per the plan, but I currently can’t use my oven (the vent fan is insanely loud, so I have a technician coming on Thursday to look at it). I make a veggie scramble instead. I used to essentially never eat eggs unless they were in frittata form, but I have evolved into someone who can eat them relatively reliably over the last year. H. has continued reliable communication, yay! I received an email from my ex-husband confirming that I received the package he sent… cry for attention again. It had tracking, bro, you know I got it. I call my mom and debrief about the package and email. </p>



<p>8:00 p.m. — I’m still hungry so I have a little bowl of skinny popcorn in bed and yet again, hop on Amazon. The first Huskers game of the season is Thursday and I have decided this means I can buy a Huskers shirt. I find a cute cropped option and add it to the cart. I also get a coffee grinder and an oil splatter guard for cooking. I accidentally bought whole bean coffee in my pick-up order, and I was annoyed by a lot of oil splatter recently, so maybe I can also justify these purchases. I have been dwelling on my marriage this evening. My ex-husband succeeded in disturbing my peace. I’m frustrated because I want to focus on what may or may not be happening with H. and not dwell on the regret of what I let myself live through. I eventually fall asleep and actually have good dreams. <strong>$75.64</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $75.64</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Five: Wednesday</h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at 5:40 a.m, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel. Dilly dally. It’s another relatively packed day. H. texts me to tell me to have a better day than yesterday which is sweet. We have the annual board retreat today and I have them touring one of my clinics that’s in the end stages of a remodel. I’m showing off a new mobile clinic we purchased this year which should be operational by mid September! I get a call from the property manager, R., alerting me to an issue with the mobile clinic. Apparently his boss, J., decided to get involved this morning and change the plan for how I wanted the mobile clinic displayed. I head in to the office for my first meeting.</p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — I have a gap between meetings and head down to see the mobile clinic. I’m immediately not happy. It is not hooked up to the truck, not level, blocking a fire hydrant, and the stairs are set up in possibly the worst way to access the clinic. I call R., who doesn’t answer, and then J. J. tells me the set up is fine. I disagree. After a pissing match, R. comes to help me redo the set up. I had to force J’s hand and he is not happy. I don’t care. I celebrate the victory with an iced coffee and head to my next meeting. <strong>$4.00</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — I don’t have a gap to eat in private so I heat up my lunch (the pasta/chicken sitch), snag some red pepper and eat in a meeting. I hate doing that, but I’m already in a mood thanks to J., and we don’t need to add an element of hangry, too. The meeting is good — easy ask. I get a text from my boss thanking me for fixing the mobile clinic situation before the board saw it. I feel vindicated. Next, I go to a staff huddle for a team that is not happy with a process change I’m making. I try to get in front of people if they are unhappy with me or a change, so they can get their feelings out to my face and we can talk about it. Not sure this is the best change management technique, but I don’t want to be the coward who hides in my office when I’m unpopular. It goes relatively well, their perspectives are valid, and it’s good to hear them out before we implement the change.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — I’m home. I survived an end-of-day-energy-suck-of-a-meeting with one of the more aggressive physicians. It was a wild ride. My boss and I are still texting about it. What a day. I’m making pasta again — tonight is orecchiette with Italian chicken sausage, zucchini, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. It turns out great. H. texts me to see how my day went by asking “did you kick some ass today”, and I can honestly reply in the affirmative. We catch up a bit via text. My friend K. calls and we gossip about my former workplace. I seem to pick up a work bestie every time I move to a new job. She’s the best. She helped me make the decision to leave my marriage. She is probably the only person I was fully honest with about what was happening while I was still in the relationship. After the gossip session, I clean up from dinner and try to decide on something to watch.</p>



<p>7:30 — I haven’t succeeded in selecting anything to watch. I’m now listening to an audiobook and having a snack of cheese and triscuits with a glass of wine. I text H. around 8 p.m. to see if he wants to talk on the phone to no response. I have a small spiral about it before I shake it off. I have a very helpful mantra when I spiral, thanks to K.: I’m not special and it’s not about me. In essence, I’m not the star of anyone else’s movie and people’s actions are about them, not me. It was very freeing to realize that people really aren’t thinking about me. That dumb thing I said in a meeting? They already forgot. H. will be H., if he wants to try he will. Lights out by 8:45 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $4.00</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Six: Thursday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at the usual time, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel with cream cheese. Dilly dally. I was able to condense all of my meetings into the morning today, and will have to come back and work from home this afternoon. I need to be here for having the range serviced. Not sad about it. Knowing I have a short day, I wear a really cute but really uncomfortable dress and heels. I wouldn’t want to wear this outfit if I had to suffer through a whole day, but I can put fashion first for five hours. H. texted first thing this morning apologizing for missing the text about a call and explaining he has his phone on Do Not Disturb after 8 p.m, was engrossed in a project etc., and I feel happy that he cared to explain.</p>



<p>12:00 — I’m home from the office now and heating up lunch — the same meal prepped chicken pasta. It’s really good, so it isn’t miserable having it on repeat. I’m glad to be home and can focus on developing the 51 strategies. The bright side: I can make a spreadsheet. That is the only upside I can think of so far. As I am working on it, I get another email adding reviewing the travel budgets for every department by the same deadline. F**k. H. texts to ask about my day. He is having a good one, so that’s great. My day improves when the range is fixed and I get an email from a clinician I interviewed and offered a job to saying that he is accepting the offer! Yay! Recruiting is going well.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m making a chicken sausage and veggie hash for dinner. Potatoes, bell peppers, onions, zucchini, and yellow squash with a spicy green chile chicken sausage. I really like spicy foods — I have a whole collection of hot sauce at home and in the office. I have my laptop in the kitchen to have Hulu on as the Huskers game is on ESPN. It turns out I do not have the ESPN add-on or the live ESPN add-on, so I spend the $14.65 to upgrade so I can watch the game. I finish making dinner and eat while the game kicks off. It ends up being a good one — competitive — and the Huskers clinch the win. Great way to start the season! H is sending me videos of the tinkering projects he’s working on. He’s very mechanically inclined and I’ve discovered is always working on some side project. I find this cute. I’m up later than normal to finish watching the game and can’t fall asleep right away after it, so I know I will be tired tomorrow, but tomorrow is Friday so I will survive. <strong>$14.65</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $14.65</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Seven: Friday </h3>



<p>6:45 a.m. — Up way later than normal, feed C., make coffee, go to eat an entire bagel but half has mold, so I make the questionable choice to eat the half with no visible mold. Text H. good morning. I realize everything today has a remote option minus a lunch. I’m taking a team that is getting hit by layoffs to lunch today to thank them for their work. I’m worried about it, it seems like it could be bad/flippant in the scheme of the layoffs and surrounding drama. I text H. about it and he shares my sentiment. I text my assistant that I’m planning to be remote today and happily work from my bed throughout the morning, keeping my camera off. </p>



<p>1:45 p.m. — The lunch ended up being relatively great. The team is really funny and has made peace with the situation. The conversation is excellent and we ended up at the restaurant for an hour and 45 minutes before we wrapped up. I took a group photo of everyone. That moment felt really sad. They get their severance next week, and then hopefully I will see them around town. I get in my car, happy the lunch went well but sad about the layoffs. <strong>$142.00</strong> <strong>(Expensed so not included)</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — After lunch I go to the grocery store to complete the weekly grocery pick up. I coupon and meal plan around the deals. This week I bought more than normal to take advantage of some really good coupon offers — so I’m now really well supplied with toilet paper and Cottonelle wipes. I also bought a decent amount of wine to stock the “wine cellar” (creepy basement closet with a vent fan). Groceries are a steak, chicken sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, lettuce, cheese, two bags of birdseed, coffee, peaches, lemons, limes, ice-cream sandwiches, tomatoes, spinach, broth, onions, and the aforementioned wine. I saved $108.21 by shopping sales and couponing. This is an all-time high for me. I’m jazzed and no one else in the world will ever care about it. I head home, put away the groceries and sit back down at the laptop to wrap up work. <strong>$193.67</strong></p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — My friend L. invites me to grab a beer to wrap up the week. She is solo this weekend as her husband is going hunting. We meet at a tap house and each grab a beer. I get a rye porter that has a low ABV. A dark beer with a low ABV will always get me. We nurse our beers for about two hours while we talk about work, trees, the remodel I’m doing, and the one she is planning on. It’s nice to have someone to just yammer with. A guy from work stops by our table and says hello and we make polite small talk. L. asks if I have had any decent dates lately and I tell her about H. I text him a ‘cheers’ photo. We wrap up around 5:45 p.m. and I head home to feed C. and make dinner. <strong>$7.43</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — It’s Friday so I let myself have a glass of wine while I make dinner. I am having pasta, again. I need to use the last of the Italian chicken sausage. It’s similar to the pasta I made earlier in the week, but I add ricotta at the end so it is super creamy. H. is texting me photos of getting ready to go camping on the coast with his daughter. I didn’t realize he had her this weekend, and it is WAY too early to ask about the custody arrangement. He is a super doting dad, which I think is a good sign he is a decent human. After dinner I put on <em>The Materialists</em> and head to bed before it’s finished, I’m so tired. I hear the ring of a goodnight text from H. while I am drifting off. Decent week.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>



<p>I impulse bought from Amazon a little more than I would’ve liked to. I really don’t like to support Amazon, but it’s so convenient. I’ve been trying to be budget conscious with the remodel, and actually think I did okay — minus the DoorDash order. I realized I’m not very exciting, at least not in my current phase of life. It was fun to write and reflect on how I’m spending. Hopefully, in the future there are a few more “fun” purchases.</p>

When other streaming services are rumored to be <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/matt-damon-netflix-movies-restate-plot-viewers-on-phones-1236633939/"">churning out content that (allegedly)</a> intentionally caters to people who are playing shows in the background while they do chores or are <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/matt-damon-netflix-plots-reiterated-distracted-viewers-1236477116/"">on their phones</a>, Apple TV is respecting audiences that actually, you know, <em>pay attention </em>during the movies and TV shows they watch. </p>



<p>At a splashy press day in LA where they flew in press and influencers from around the world and trotted out their best talent to showcase first-look teaser trailers, Apple TV unveiled their packed 2026 slate, and we’re already <em>seated</em>. Multiple women-led series are front and center, and each feel engineered for the post-antihero era: shows about how it feels to live inside messy systems — capitalism, patriarchy, desire, family, fame — and still want more. More pleasure. More honesty. More money. More luck.</p>



<p>Apple TV already has a slate of great shows, and the casts of some of my personal faves (<em>Shrinking</em>, <em>The Last Thing He Told Me,</em> <em>Pluribus</em>, <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>) were in attendance to hype up their new seasons.<em> </em>As for the new shows, from chaotic motherhood and money woes to the messy realities of female friendship, Apple’ TVs latest offerings are giving us the kind of complex, flawed, deeply relatable characters we’ve been craving. Forget your typical glossy prestige dramas, these shows promise to be raw, funny, uncomfortable, and exactly what we need right now.</p>



<p>From a darkly funny meditation on female gratification to a glossy moral thriller about wealth and consequence, Apple’s latest slate signals a clear creative thesis: women don’t need to be likable, tidy, or redeemed, they just need to be <em>interesting</em>. </p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about Apple TV’s four new women-led shows that defined the day and are about to become your entire personality.</p>



<h2><strong><em>Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Tatiana Maslany, Jake Johnson, Brandon Flynn<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> May 20, 2026 </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957813.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>If the title alone doesn’t have you immediately intrigued, let me paint you a picture: What happens when a woman decides to take control of her pleasure and it backfires, badly? <em><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-apple-tv-premiere-date-photos-1236706239/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> follows newly divorced mom Paula (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/04/84634/tatiana-maslany-orphan-black-interview"">Tatiana Maslany</a>) as conversing with a cam boy leads her down a destructive path of murder, blackmail and… youth soccer. I sat through a whole panel about this show and I still don’t get where the soccer comes into play, but rest assured if Maslany is there, so will I. </p>



<p>Convinced she witnessed a crime, Maslany’s Paula begins her own investigation that unravels a bigger conspiracy as she looks to rebuild her family and regain her self identity. <em><a href=""https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2026/02/apple-tvs-darkly-comedic-thriller-maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-starring-emmy-award-winner-tatiana-maslany-and-jake-johnson-to-make-global-debut-may-20/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> is a full-throated (pun absolutely intended) exploration of desire, agency, and what it means to prioritize your own happiness in a society that low-key punishes women for doing exactly that.</p>



<h2><em>Imperfect Women</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elisabeth Moss, Kerry Washington, and Kate Mara<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> March 18, 2026</p>







<p>Think <em>Big Little Lies </em>meets <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> meets <em>Little Fires Everywhere </em>except there is nothing “little” about these women. After a possible murder shatters the lives of three women in a decades-long friendship,<em> <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/imperfect-women/umc.cmc.1w2rmpbqzt24879bt7109zgi6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imperfect Women</a></em> kicks off into a high-octane thriller that is sure to keep us guessing until its final minute. I was holding my breath during the entire teaser trailer. </p>



<p>According to Apple TV, “The unconventional thriller explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that irrevocably alter our lives. As the investigation unfolds, so does the truth about how even the closest friendships may not be what they seem.” That does sound intriguing but they had me at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kerry-washington"">Kerry Washington,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9481023/elizabeth-moss-invisible-man-performance-scary"">Elisabeth Moss</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/08/121778/kate-mara-movies-morgan-2016"">Kate Mara.</a> </p>



<h2><em>Lucky</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Anya Taylor-Joy, Annette Bening, Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and Drew Starkey<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> July 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957807.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anya-taylor-joy-mad-max-furiosa-interview"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> plays a fugitive con artist. You’re sold, right? Same. Written by Jonathan Tropper and Cassie Pappas and based on <a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Stapley’s bestselling novel, </a><em><a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lucky</a></em> centers on a young woman (Taylor-Joy) who was raised in a life of crime but is trying to leave that life behind. Now, she “must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past,” so says the show’s official synopis. </p>



<p>Taylor-Joy also serves as an exective producer on the project and it marks her first TV series since 2020’s smash hit (and pandemic savior), <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy"">The Queen’s Gambit.</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy""> </a></p>



<p>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Timothy Olyphant also star. </p>



<h2>Margo’s Got Money Troubles </h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer, Nick Offerman<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> April 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957816.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p><em><a href=""https://deadline.com/feature/margos-got-money-troubles-show-news-updates-1236412988/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Margo’s Got Money Troubles</a></em> is a “bold, heartwarming and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229557/teen-spirit-movie-review-elle-fanning-max-minghella"">Elle Fanning</a>), the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/michellepfeifferofficial/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) and ex-pro wrestler (<a href=""https://nickofferman.co/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nick Offerman</a>), as she’s forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them.”</p>



<p>I wanted to get that synopsis right because I didn’t think you’d believe me if I said Michelle Pfeiffer is playing an ex-Hooters waitess and Nick Offerman would be tattooed-up wrestler. These aren’t the roles we’re used to from these two iconic performers, but I’ve seen some of the show, and, <em>whew</em>, they are such pros, you’re going to be blown away. I imagine that series creator David E. Kelly wanted to surround Pfeiffer with the absolute best to match her star power. And, of course, Elle Fanning did just that. Aside from the storyline that sounds like a perfect premise for a realistic, messy, and absurd look at motherhood, Fanning proves she is one of the best working young actresses in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",
