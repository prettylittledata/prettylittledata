In suburbs and on unpaved paths, irregular terrain is the norm. Inside buildings, by contrast, we pursue near-perfect horizontality—structural frames, slabs, and finishes are all disciplined to create level walking surfaces in the name of safety and accessibility.

<h4><em>How user-centered design principles transformed a grassroots political movement into a viral phenomenon and what it means for design practice.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""Logo with the words: Zohran for New York City in Orange with a blue background.

Mamdani’s campaign has inspired millions, many of whom not New Yorkers and, most impressively, not even American or located in America.</p><p>His campaign didn’t just change politics, i<em>t offered a masterclass in user-centered design</em>.</p><h3>A Parks and Recreation campaign come to life</h3><p>Mamdani’s campaign seemed (and continues to seem) something out of a Parks and Recreations episode. When Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) decided to run for City council in season 4, she does so with her friends running every aspect of her campaign (after being let go by “official” campaign managers), this gives her campaign an approachable, friendly and personal aspect that eventually led to her victory.</p><p>Although specific names of the entire Mamdani’s campaign team are not extensively detailed in publicly available sources, it is known that the campaign operated with a community-driven approach characterized by deep community roots, and a decentralized yet well-coordinated volunteer network, with digital and field teams working closely to listen, test, and refine the outreach based on real-time input from voters.</p><figure><img alt=""Photograph of Zohran Mamdani speaking at a Fix the MTA press conference.

The answer lies in principles every UX designer should understand but while keeping in mind questions of power, authenticity, and manipulation in digital spaces.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/user-experience-politics-how-ux-can-be-applied-to-political-campaigns-4efe25435846"">Brad O’Conner</a> who transitioned into UX design after 15 years in political consulting, discovered that he had been practicing UX design principles in political campaigns long before transitioning into the field, writes &quot;The voters whom you are trying to reach are the users. The goal is to provide the voter with relevant information so that their decision to vote for your candidate or cause is made more accessible.”</p><blockquote><strong><em>One key difference is that politics is also a lot more “manipulative” than UX.</em></strong></blockquote><p>A study carried out by the <a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report"">Oxford Internet Institute</a> that documented organized social media manipulation campaigns in 81 countries, found that “governments and political parties “produced misinformation on an industrial scale.” So as designers we must ask, <em>where does authentic transparency end and performance begin?</em></p><h3>1. Active listening as user testing</h3><p>Mamdani’s campaign broke from the traditional political playbook by engaging directly with both supporters and critics on social media.</p><h4>The “ultimately” moment: iteration made visible</h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DMBjabdOTPe/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I was given an ultimatum.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Zohran Mamdani catching himself mid-sentence about to say “ultimately” and self-correcting with humor</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram / Original creator</em></p><p>In one instance from July 2025, Zohran Mamdani, prompted by feedback from his communications team and voters, makes a conscious effort to stop himself from overusing the word “ultimately” during interviews and public appearances. In this light-hearted video, Mamdani acknowledges the feedback, shares clips illustrating his habit, and includes a segment where — mid-sentence — he catches himself about to say “ultimately” and quickly redirects his phrasing.</p><blockquote><em>“I am listening, I am learning. Please keep sending me your feedback because ultimately, I will get better.”<br />“In response to my team and supporters pointing out that I say ‘ultimately’ a lot, I caught myself on camera correcting the habit. Keep holding me accountable. This is how we improve, together.” (Zohran Mamdani)</em></blockquote><p>This approach mirrors what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/"">Nielsen Norman Group teaches about design thinking</a>: empathy mapping helps “distill and categorize your knowledge of the user into one place” and “discover gaps in your current knowledge.” Mamdani essentially created a public empathy map of his own communication style, inviting collective feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""The User-Centered Design Loop: Mamdani’s Campaign as a Design Process. It shows a four-step circular loop labeled 1. Listen, 2. Analyze, 3. Iterate, 4. Ship, with arrows connecting each step around a central circle labeled “Continuous Improvement.” Each step includes short examples from Mamdani’s campaign, such as gathering voter feedback, reviewing patterns, adjusting speaking habits, and posting public updates. A note at the bottom reads: “Key Insight: Making the feedback loop visible builds&quot;"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*N1HgMHBwGYY0TvewMGXqpg.png"" /><figcaption>The User-Centered Design Loop: Mamdani’s Campaign as a Design Process.</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Building trust through transparency</h3><p>Mamdani’s response embraced feedback as a tool for self-improvement much like designers should seek out feedback and build on it in order to inspire trust in their designs. Furthermore, the transparency in documenting the process of listening and acknowledging the feedback is what inspired people’s trust in him. This moment, in equal parts humorous and earnest, embodies the essence of user-driven iteration.</p><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, a question we, as designers, must ask ourselves is, how do we distinguish genuine transparency from performed authenticity? The Mamdani campaign appears to represent authentic engagement, and although their strategies are effective, they can also easily be replicated by good actors with bad intentions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Find the line between authentic iteration and manipulative performance and listen to your users, show them you’re paying attention, and let the process of improvement happen in public view.</em></blockquote><h3>3. Small, agile teams win</h3><p>Mamdani did not have the funding for a large campaign nor was he backed by any billionaires. According to the official <a href=""https://www.nyccfb.info/vsapps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2899&amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;cand_name=Mamdani"">campaign finance summary</a> from the New York City Campaign Finance Board for the 2025 election cycle, Zohran Mamdani’s total campaign spending was $12,794,272. His campaign raised $17,159,487 in total receipts, with over $4 million coming from private funds and significant additional support from public funds through matching programs. This is relatively lean compared to Cuomo’s 40 million dollar budget which mostly came from super PACs and billionaire donors. Unlike Cuomo’s traditional campaign operation, Mamdani relied on volunteers and a handful of core personnel to constantly iterate and connect at the ground level.</p><h4>Here’s how an agile approach played out in practice:</h4><ul><li><strong>Culturally aware content</strong>: Mamdani’s team highlighted community through moments like salsa dancing in Bronx parks, sharing biryani with cabbies, or joining Tai Chi classes in Flushing. These resonated with the voters and quickly turned viral.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Collage of eight campaign photos showing Zohran Mamdani at diverse community events including large crowd gatherings, group photos with supporters on steps and on motorcycles, media appearances on MSNBC Weekend, indoor community meetings, a Congresswoman Yvette Clarke endorsement poster, and candid moments speaking with constituents in outdoor settings Source: https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l4oBSYa9PKgbsRxCViYHDg.png"" /><figcaption>Collage of Mamdani at community events. Source: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"">https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Collaborations born agile</strong>: Instead of focusing only on high-budget ad buys, Mamdani often teamed with social creators (like The Kid Mero and Subway Takes) and grassroots web series (“Are You Okay?,” “The People Gallery”). These partnerships came together quickly, built on DMs and group chats rather than formal contracts.</li><li><strong>Volunteer-led feedback loops</strong>: The campaign harnessed a decentralized WhatsApp-powered network of volunteers for canvassing, “friendraisers,” and “house parties.” First-time volunteers were rapidly trained and empowered to experiment, suggesting new neighborhoods to target, new stories to tell, and even filming spontaneous street interviews. This grassroots network was not only executing, but also feeding real-time insights and inspiration back to the campaign’s creative leads.</li><li><strong>Prototyping at campaign speed</strong>: from valentine’s day skits to a CTA in a box of chocolates, to working with rising and diverse artists like Aneesh Bhoopathy (whose branding drew from New York’s multicultural cityscapel), Wael Morcos of Morcos Key (who brought an Arabic inflection to the design for outreach in immigrant communities) and Rama Duwaji (Mamdani’s wife) a Syrian-American artist, all contributed creative input to the campaign’s bold color palette and storytelling style. Together, these collaborators crafted a visual system that embodied the campaign’s ethos: energetic, multicultural, and community-rooted.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/554/1*-cHRq1W7oDToc9LlXLl85g.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qP_poKjabd5DdbvWcCKONg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/1*n8JGlCWyY_n831nkV_arRQ.png"" /><figcaption>Campaign poster designs.

Social media engagement and message clarity</h3><p>If social media was meant for anything it was storytelling. This is exemplified in Mamdani’s social media campaigning, he didn’t just tell a story, he listened to other people’s stories.</p><h4><strong>Near real-time responsiveness</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQrrenCDtrg/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Thank you, New York City. Last night we made history. Now we get to work. Comment MayorElect to learn about the transition. Comment DonateNow to make a contribution.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani announcing transition plans the day after election victory</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s team developed a reputation for near real-time responsiveness, flooding platforms with multilingual and original content and directly engaging with voters, influencers and critics alike. When he won the mayoral race, influencers joked that Mamdani should “go to bed” as the very next day Mamdani posted a video announcing his plan for the transitional phase.</p><p>Digital experts credited his social media presence with fueling grassroots participation at levels rarely seen in local politics. Mamdani did not simply use social media he was intertwined in its roots through collaboration with influencers he knew would target his voters and his audience, that’s good user research: <em>know your audience</em>.</p><p>This engagement and real-time communication transcended boundaries and was embraced far beyond its original audience because it told a story and stories have no borders.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Storytelling as a tool in UX is often overlooked and under-appreciated, yet it is at the center of good UX and UI. Tell a story.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, how can we discuss social media political success without acknowledging that</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>the very techniques that made Mamdani’s campaign successful (rapid iteration, emotional storytelling, influencer partnerships) are the same ones </em><a href=""https://www.stimson.org/2022/social-media-misinformation-and-the-prevention-of-political-instability-and-mass-atrocities/""><em>identified by researchers</em></a><em> as enabling “organized social media misinformation campaigns” that threaten democracy globally.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>How do we as designers harness the power of emotional connection and rapid iteration without contributing to the erosion of truth and democratic norms?</em></blockquote><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1008/1*VKRUtjgehtRth1msGLA3uA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/1*-tz4fKlRT4hh13dnZ2z2gA.png"" /><figcaption>Two-panel screenshot of Instagram comments showing enthusiastic support for Mamdani’s campaign from users across the US and internationally, including Philadelphia, London, and Dublin, with comments praising the campaign’s content strategy, authenticity, and comparing it to Obama’s 2008 campaign.

Clarity as empowerment</h3><p>Other than the consistent and constant social media messaging and presence, the likes of which have never been seen in US political campaigning, Zohran Mamdani’s message was committed to clarity. On social media and in real life, whether he was explaining voting requirements, or his plans as mayor for the city, he was walking people step-by-step through the message and in multiple languages and settings thereby empowering first-time or previously disengaged voters.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Mamdani’s approach exemplified the core UX principle of affordance: making it immediately visible what action is possible and how to take it.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, the question then arises, </em>Why should anyone have to explain the ability and process of voting?<em> Doesn’t this then allow those with the explanation the power to weaponize this knowledge? </em><a href=""https://ask.edgarallan.com/blog/a-ux-perspective-on-the-us-election""><em>Edgar Allan’s UX team notes</em></a><em>, “If there was ever a thing that should be unquestionably clear, understandable and accessible, it is the ability to vote. Unfortunately, the U.S. voting system suffers from a distinct lack of user-centricity.”</em></blockquote><h3>6. Cultural pain points = empathy mapping</h3><p>One of the first steps in the design thinking process is to empathize. Empathy was the main message throughout Mamdani’s campaign, it “goes beyond what users explicitly state and manages to unearth hidden motivations, desires, and pain points.” (<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it"">Interaction Design Foundation</a>).</p><p><em>By focusing on lived experiences, cultural nuances and specific community needs his campaign resonated with voters in an unprecedented way.</em></p><p>In a historic move not seen before in American politics, Mamdani publicly asked his supporters to stop donating once the campaign reached its financial goals. He posted transparent breakdowns of fundraising progress and, upon reaching the spending cap, communicated directly:</p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DOOI8_Ijrm5/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I am once again asking you to stop sending us money. But we do need your time. Comment CanvassNow - one word, no spaces - to get a sign up link in your DMs.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani asking voters to stop donating money to his campaign. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><blockquote>“We have enough to win. Please…do not give more. Redirect your generosity to mutual aid, to neighbors, to other grassroots causes.” (Zohran Mamdani)</blockquote><h4><strong>Plain language, clear needs</strong></h4><p>There were no hidden motives or complicated political lingo, just a plain-language presentation of what he needed from his supporters at each moment. Voting instructions were step-by-step. Donation limits were openly discussed. When the campaign reached its fundraising goal, supporters were told explicitly and publicly that there was no need for more underlying the empathetic line that his campaign had been running “For a New York You Can Afford”.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: make empathy visible by listening, responding, and adapting your design to users’ actual lives and constraints.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Here again we must consider the power of manipulation and exploitation.</em></strong><em> When genuine empathy certainly bridges gaps, but when performed it can manipulate vulnerable populations. Our responsibility, as designers is to ensure empathy serves users’ interests, not just campaign goals, to quote </em><a href=""https://uxpamagazine.org/political-design/""><em>Lloyd Hervey writes about Political Design</em></a><em>, designers must consider “what is possible and what is ethical…the trade-offs of who will benefit from a particular solution versus who will be negatively affected.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Instagram post by Zohran Mamdani promoting a “Savings Calculator” tool for New York City residents.

Multilingual communication = inclusive design</h3><p>Some political opponents criticized Mamdani for “code switching”, shifting languages and communication styles to match his audience. But in UX terms, this is exactly right. Code switching isn’t diluting your message; it’s adapting it for different user contexts.</p><h4><strong>Authentic voices from communities</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQZrQz4jtFm/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Juntos vamos a construir la ciudad que merecemos! Y con tu ayuda, voy a seguir aprendiendo español 😉 ¡Puedes votar temprano hasta el Domingo y el día de las elecciones es el Martes 4 de Noviembre! ¡Comenta con la palabra VOTA y te enviaremos un enlace para ver dónde votar!&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Spanish with a local Spanish speaking voter.

Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s socials are flooded with videos in Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, appealing to all the New York demographics and communities. He did so by enlisting the help of people from those communities, in other words he engaged with more diverse audiences thoughtfully and used locals to help make his message more authentic and relevant. This helped communities feel seen and heard and Mamdani was able to build trust with communities small and large.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: use language fluidity to engage broader, more diverse audiences thoughtfully and do not translate blindly, instead ellicit help from locals who speak the language. S</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Such help from local communities should go beyond translation and requires including the diverse communioties in the design process itself and not just in the final messaging. Language fluidity is not automatically inclusive and as designers we must be weary of what researchers call “</em>performative diversity<em>” which is looking inclusive without transferring actual power to marginalized communities</em></blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><h4>Hope through human-centered design</h4><p>Mamdani’s campaign gave people something special and new (perhaps also dangerous, it remains to be seen): Hope.</p><p>He did it by embodying core UX principles: <em>empathy</em>, <em>storytelling</em>, and <em>iteration</em>. His message was always empathetic, his statements clear and direct, and his “user requirements” (what he needed from his supporters) consistently open and accessible. This was a campaign led by the people, for the people, but more importantly, Mamdani didn’t position himself as someone observing New Yorkers from the outside. He is a New Yorker. He lived their stories alongside them, not above them.</p><h4>Remembering the human element and our responsibility as designers.</h4><p>As designers, it’s all too easy to get caught up in technical features or aesthetic appeal. While those things matter, the most meaningful work happens when we remember the element of humanity at the heart of every experience. As the UX world shifts rapidly, perhaps toward “Zero UI” where interfaces recede and experience comes to the foreground, we should focus on listening deeply, telling better stories, and designing platforms where users’ stories are welcomed, valued, and allowed to live and breathe.</p><p>But we must also remember our ethical responsibility; feelings give way to manipulation and exploitation, and the same techniques that built hope in Mamdani’s campaign can and are also used to to spread misinformation, manipulate vulnerable populations, and erode democratic institutions. Our work as designers is never neutral, after all design for everyone is design for no one, and the question is not whether our design has impact, but whether that impact serves democratic values, human dignity, and truth.</p><p>Mamdani’s campaign was a reminder that empathy, clarity, and authentic connection are what build hope and inspire change. But it’s also a reminder that these tools are powerful, and that with great power comes great responsibility.</p><blockquote>The future of design in democracy depends on our willingness to hold two simultaneous truths: that connection matters deeply, and that not all connection is created equal.</blockquote><p>Every design decision is a choice.

My phone was a few meters away in the living room and I rushed over like I had forgotten a burning turkey in the oven to make sure that I got to the phone before the second ad started playing. I tapped that lower-right hand skip button and the tension in my body temporarily melted away as I made my way back to the chore and continued listening to my podcast, ironically about the slow decay of once useful apps, that was so rudely interrupted by a Nissan ad.</p><figure><img alt=""Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*qVaAxIWg4nrXMgaT.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://strangershow.com/how-to-buy-youtube-premium/"">Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience</a></figcaption></figure><p>As I pondered how possible it would be to find an ad blocker for my phone, the answer was slapped in my face in the form of a glorious popup! <strong>Try YouTube premium and you’ll be ad free</strong>… something that only a few years ago was standard had become a premium and I asked myself why? The term I happened to be learning about that day from <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2"">Cory Doctorow was <strong>enshittification</strong></a>, which can be loosely defined as the process by which platforms decay as they shift value away from users and toward themselves and their business customers. In other words, things start out good for us, then get worse as the companies optimize for profit. While we all have a collective <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/"">intuitive sense of platforms decaying</a> over the last few years, I wanted to look closer from a design perspective, specifically, at how that decay unfolds through the deliberate, incremental rollout of ads.</p><p>The key players in this <strong>enshittification</strong> race are the four major tech companies that dominate our digital lives: Google, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, and YouTube. But for the sake of this article, I’m going to focus on one in particular, because it’s where I spend the most time: YouTube.</p><p>These companies’ slow decay into ad infested dystopian nightmares reminded me of a conversation I had with my good friend and cofounder <a href=""https://charliegedeon.medium.com/"">Charlie Gedeon</a>. He told me about this theory, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation""><strong>carcinisation</strong></a>, which is the very hilarious scientific process which can be described as “<a href=""https://brill.com/view/journals/ctoz/67/2/article-p79_1.xml"">the many attempts of Nature to evolve [into] a crab</a>”. In simple terms, there is an evolutionary momentum that has slowly pushed a variety of unrelated species to evolve into the general behaviour pattern and shape of a crab. So given enough time and opportunity, every species will eventually become a crab. I couldn’t ignore the metaphorical parallel: in our technological ecosystem, the biggest species don’t turn into crabs, they turn into ads.</p><p>Before YouTube, there was TV. The TV was invented in 1939, and the <a href=""https://www.madhive.com/insights/history-of-tv-advertising"">first ads were shown in 1941</a>. In the early 1940s, ads were short, mild interruptions between programs then by the 1980s, they had become pretty much the reason every sitcom, news broadcast, and sports event existed at all. It was simply the packaging for the ad breaks that paid for it. Then streaming arrived and it felt like a breath of fresh air! A new, ad-free subspecies breaking free from its commercial ancestors. Netflix, YouTube, and early Hulu gave us hope of a new evolutionary path: content without interruption. But, it didn’t stay ad free for long.</p><p>So let’s look at YouTube, starting with the first signs of life to crawl out of the primordial soup, we have the humble <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/66159/"">InVideo overlays first launched in 2007</a>, these were thin, semi-transparent banners that floated over the bottom of a playing video, usually small text or a tiny ad image that you could close with a small “X.” These early ads didn’t stop the video, or call for too much attention. They quietly fed on our attention without killing us, like a parasitic symbiosis. While annoying, they didn’t destabilize the delicate environment of early to mid-2000’s YouTube.</p><figure><img alt=""The early dismissible youtube ad banner showing at the bottom 20% of the screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QMeV9fQYXmh-XYNo.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Early dismissible youtube ad banner taking up the bottom 20% of a video.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Then between 2010 and 2018 there’s an explosion of life, the ads grow legs, lungs, and teeth… YouTube launched <a href=""https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/trueview-video-ads-give-viewers-choice/"">TrueView ads</a>, those aforementioned and all too familiar skippable pre-rolls that appear before your chosen video. These ads demand visibility, they evolved to study their prey’s habits, tracking which openings held attention longest. At first, there was just one, small but intrusive, a 5-second interaction before you could skip and move on. But as we all know, evolution rewards persistence. Soon, a single ad became two, then a pair before and after your video, and finally in 2012, <a href=""https://blog.youtube/creator-and-artist-stories/mid-roll-ads-updates-explained"">mid-roll ads appeared</a>, splitting your entertainment in bite size chunks.</p><figure><img alt=""Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZSukJyjEmxwlLrTt.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video</a></figcaption></figure><p>With each mutation, they became harder and harder to ignore. The variety was overwhelming, displaying banners above, overlays below, and videos within videos. The content creators themselves now, mimicking the copy of the ads. By the end of this period, the once teeming with life content creator ecosystem had turned into a chewed through rotting swamp where every spare patch of attention was colonized with a swarm of ads.</p><p>Understandably, this environment was not the most pleasant so I, like many others, used an ad-block. To put in perspective how prevalent this problem is, here’s a quote from Cory Doctorow that really struck me: <a href=""https://youtu.be/P1EKQidRooc?si=W5D9-f7NSy8VVT3I&amp;t=1372"">“51% of web users have installed an ad blocker, it is literally the largest consumer boycott in human history.”</a> The majority of people, which I imagine probably encompasses people making these decisions in the first place, probably have an ad blocker installed. This was our one tool to try and avoid the onslaught of ads that we’d be subjected to on a daily basis, and while there weren’t as easily accessible tools on mobile, we’d at least have a reprieve on our computers… or so we thought.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups, showing that Ad Blockers aren’t allowed on the platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*zH9j2L6vBUyKB43D.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.brave.app/t/youtube-showing-popup-for-ad-blockers/511149"">YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups</a></figcaption></figure><p>In late <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-growing-3380809"">May of 2023</a>, YouTube began to mutate again, starting with a small subset of tests where they rolled out banners saying “Ad Blockers are not allowed on YouTube.” An easily dismissable popup asking you to uninstall your Ad Blocker. It was the early signs of a dominant species that was going to make it impossible for you to avoid ads. Eventually, making it an unfeasible arms race between ad-blockers and ad-blocker-blockers (that’s a mouthful). This persisted to where we’re at now where it’s more of a pain to find a way to circumvent ads then to just sit through the discomfort that we’ve been conditioned to endure.</p><p>This whole process has been a calculated and heavily studied rollout. In some ways it is a masterful example of how to slowly introduce a feature to users that doesn’t actually benefit the majority. At first users feel discomfort, but not enough to abandon the platform. The designers, researchers and tech CEO’s know that they’re pushing unpleasantness and that they have to go as far as they can without causing too much pain because they understand that it’s a delicate ecosystem of attention and people will find alternatives if pushed too far too quickly. If YouTube had not given notice of its intention to block ads for months prior to the rollout of the full ad-block extinction, what would have happened? I personally think the consequences would have been cataclysmic and in some ways hoped that they would have torn off the bandaid a little more violently to shock us into action.</p><p>So over the course of 25 years, they’ve increased the heat and now we’re in a pot of boiling water, but in truth it’s we actually don’t know how much hotter it might get. Many <strong>PAID</strong> platforms now include ads, such as Prime and you have to pay additional fees to exclude them. So what comes next in this grand evolutionary chain? Maybe ads that blend seamlessly into the content, AI-generated sponsorships that mimic the creator’s voice so perfectly we can’t tell where the video ends and the commercial begins. Maybe they’ll feel like features instead of intrusions. Either way, the species isn’t going extinct anytime soon. Like crabs, like capitalism, ads always find a way.</p><p>The hope is for the next disruption. YouTube once broke the cable monopoly with creativity, and community before slowly mutating into the very thing it replaced. It would seem, that’s the pattern of evolution, the old ecosystem collapses under its own weight, and something new crawls out of the primordial muck.</p><p>One can hope that there is a better answer gestating. Maybe it’s decentralized video, maybe it’s a new model of sharing that doesn’t depend on monetized attention, more than likely it’s something we haven’t imagined yet. The godfather of the term, <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/"">Cory Doctorow</a>, explores this in his new book <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222615930-enshittification""><em>Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It</em> </a>, with the most important part being that final clause: <strong>what to do about it.</strong></p><p>As citizens, we can advocate for antitrust laws, interoperability, and policies that prevent platforms from locking in both users and creators. As users, we can choose to support the smaller, values-driven platforms that still have a soul, ones that remind us the internet doesn’t have to be stinky pile of ads, but a place we actively connect. And lastly as designers, we can embed the values of portability, transparency, user control, and minimal hidden value extraction. Better than hoping for the next better thing is putting our efforts into actually designing it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9e6032ff2d20"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">The evolution of Youtube: How every platform evolves into an ad machine</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How to translate philosophical theory into practical design principles and responsibility.</h4><figure><img alt=""Colorful circular diagram titled “Ethical Interface Design” with sections: Inclusion, Privacy, Autonomy, Transparency, Well-Being, each linked to ethical theories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm8743DS4GxpcGXJdywN2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The following article introduces an evolving academic framework called <em>Ethical Interface Design</em>, which examines how moral philosophy can guide interface design in the era of emerging technologies. The working site, <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com""><strong>ethicalinterface.com</strong></a>, presents these ideas through a minimalist, text-focused layout that intentionally prioritizes thought over visuals — a meta-commentary on where design itself may be heading. The framework remains in active development, and thoughtful feedback is welcome.</p><p>Society is moving beyond screens into conversational, immersive, and neural experiences, placing designers at the center of the ethical landscape of human–technology interaction. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> helps designers understand not only the impact of their choices but also the ethical frameworks behind them, exploring:</p><ul><li>How interfaces influence behavior across visual, tactile, conversational, neural, and mixed-reality modalities</li><li>The philosophical roots of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> — inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, and well-being</li><li>The trade-offs between competing moral frameworks — such as egalitarianism versus meritocracy, or collectivism versus libertarianism — that determine how ethical priorities are balanced in design</li><li>Practical guidance for applying ethics to real-world projects</li></ul><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> equips designers to make intentional, responsible choices as they shape the digital world ahead.</p><h3>Interface Modalities</h3><p>Every interface mediates the relationship between humans and machines — translating intention into action, and in doing so, shaping how we perceive, decide, and connect. Emerging technologies such as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models"">large language models</a> and <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/"">neural chips</a> are expanding that relationship, blurring the boundary between user and system. As interfaces grow more adaptive and conversational, the very definition of “user interface design” begins to dissolve — replaced by fluid exchanges that merge cognition, language, and computation.</p><p>This evolution raises profound questions about agency, inclusion, and moral responsibility — questions explored further in the Ethical Foundations and <em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em> section of this article.</p><h4>From Command to Conversation</h4><p>Early computing relied on text-based <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp"">command-line interfaces</a> — precise but exclusive, accessible only to those fluent in code. The 1980s introduced the <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphical-user-interfaces?srsltid=AfmBOorkkBsRT2lPaE0zQed3OJt5HT3hCRkelHQF4-T-KQ_riqUiSau2"">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a>, popularized by Xerox PARC and Apple, replacing syntax with icons and windows. This visual paradigm made computing public but also aestheticized control — what you could see, you could do.</p><p>As technology spread beyond the desktop, new modalities emerged. Touchscreens redefined tactility. Voice assistants reintroduced conversation. Gesture and neural systems now blur the line between intention and execution. Each step expanded access while also raising new ethical questions about consent, surveillance, and cognitive autonomy.</p><h4>Types of Interfaces</h4><p>Interfaces are the boundaries between human intention and digital response. They manifest through the senses and combinations of them — and increasingly through language itself in conversational systems.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-design-in-ux-study-guide/""><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong></a> → Screens, icons, and layouts that communicate through sight. Examples include smartphone apps, operating systems, dashboards, and AI applications that blend visual and conversational interaction.</li><li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S2666998624001728""><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong></a> → Touchscreens, trackpads, haptic vibrations, and adaptive textures that make interaction physical. The iPhone’s multitouch screen (2007) made touch the dominant input for a generation.</li><li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103448""><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong></a> → Spoken interaction with assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. Generative AI extends this to conversational agents voice mode, emphasizing tone, intent, and context over fixed commands.</li><li><a href=""https://www.hci.org.uk/article/exploring-the-role-of-gestural-interaction-in-user-interface-design-challenges-and-opportunities/""><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong></a> → Motion-based control through cameras and sensors, from the Nintendo Wii (2006) and Microsoft Kinect (2010) to AR/VR hand tracking. They extend interface design into physical space and embodiment.</li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/""><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong></a> → Brain–computer links such as Neuralink or medical prosthetics that translate thought into action. These collapse the boundary between user and system, making ethics inseparable from cognition itself.</li><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/3/600""><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong></a> → Hybrid environments such as virtual and augmented reality that merge visual, tactile, and spatial interaction. Examples include Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, and AI-powered immersive design spaces.</li></ul><p>Every modality encodes a worldview — about who controls interaction, what is considered intuitive, and where agency resides. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> asks not only how interfaces function, but what kind of human they imagine.</p><h3>Ethical Foundations</h3><p>Ethics has always asked how we ought to act. From <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/"">Aristotle’s pursuit of virtue</a> to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kant’s universal duty</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/"">Mill’s utilitarian calculus</a>, moral philosophy has sought to balance intention, outcome, and character. In design, these same questions take form in pixels, code, and policies. Every layout, algorithm, and feedback loop implies an answer to an ethical question — sometimes implicitly, sometimes with intent.</p><p>Yet the foundations of ethics are not absolute. Thinkers like <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/"">Nietzsche</a>, <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/"">Foucault</a>, and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/"">Derrida</a> challenged the idea of universal morality, arguing that ethical systems are shaped by culture, power, and interpretation. From this view, ethics is not a fixed code but a living discourse — one that evolves with our technologies and values. What counts as “good design” may therefore reflect not timeless truth, but the shifting moral architectures of an age.</p><h4>Philosophical Frameworks</h4><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> draws from a range of philosophical frameworks that form the foundation of <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>. While ethics is contextual, these pillars rest on moral principles widely recognized across contemporary society.</p><p>These principles act as guiding coordinates rather than fixed rules, reflecting a shared yet evolving moral landscape. The <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> reveal how ethical tensions emerge when values intersect — the goal is not to eliminate these contradictions but to make them visible, allowing designers to act with clarity and intent.</p><p>History shows how one value can override another — privacy may yield to collective well-being during crises, or inclusion may challenge merit-based systems. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> highlights these trade-offs, guiding designers toward more transparent and deliberate choices.</p><h4>Core Ethical and Philosophical Principles</h4><p>The following list outlines major philosophical frameworks relevant to ethical design. While many other schools of thought exist, these principles form the foundational basis for <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism""><strong>Collectivism</strong></a> → A moral and political philosophy that prioritizes the needs, goals, and well-being of the group over individual interests. It emphasizes cooperation, shared responsibility, and social interdependence as essential to human flourishing.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/""><strong>Communitarianism</strong></a> → A perspective emphasizing community, shared values, and social responsibility in shaping moral and political life. It critiques excessive individualism in liberal thought.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/""><strong>Egalitarianism</strong></a> → The view that all individuals deserve equal moral consideration and that social and economic inequalities require justification. It emphasizes fairness, equal opportunity, and the reduction of arbitrary privilege.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/""><strong>Kantian Ethics</strong></a> → A deontological moral theory grounded in reason and autonomy. It holds that moral action arises from adherence to universal moral laws derived from rational duty.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/""><strong>Liberalism</strong></a> → A political and moral philosophy that upholds individual rights, freedom of choice, and consent as the basis of legitimacy. It limits interference by the state or others in personal domains.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/""><strong>Libertarianism</strong></a> → A philosophy centered on individual liberty and minimal external control.

Interfaces now operate at cognitive and emotional levels once considered private. The goal of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> is to preserve human dignity within this expanding field of influence.</p><h3>The Five Pillars of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em></h3><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a> are built on established <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/ethics.html"">ethical principles</a> and common and emerging <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/modalities.html"">interface modalities</a>. Together, they reveal how moral values manifest across different modes of interaction — and how every ethical choice involves trade-offs that designers must navigate responsibly.</p><p>To learn more, review the principles in detail below. For a concise overview, refer to the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/img/five-pillars-ethical-design-2025.pdf"">summary table</a>.</p><h4>Inclusion</h4><p>Inclusion ensures that interfaces welcome, represent, and empower people across abilities, cultures, and contexts. It rejects design that privileges one type of user at the expense of others and treats accessibility not as accommodation but as design integrity. An inclusive interface assumes difference as a constant, not an exception.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Support diverse visual and linguistic literacies through adjustable type scales, high-contrast modes, and culturally inclusive iconography.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Design haptic feedback and physical controls that accommodate varied dexterity and sensory abilities, ensuring equitable interaction.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Train recognition systems on global accents, dialects, and speech patterns to prevent bias toward dominant languages.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Calibrate motion detection for diverse ranges of movement, body types, and physical capabilities instead of a single “ideal” gesture model.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Build adaptive systems that account for neurodiversity, cognitive variation, and comfort levels in signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Configure AR and VR environments to support varied sensory sensitivities, spatial perception, and physical comfort across users.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Rooted in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/"">Egalitarianism</a>. The core claim is moral equality — like cases should be treated alike unless a relevant difference justifies unequal treatment. In design terms, capability differences, cultural background, and context are relevant inputs to equalize effective opportunity, not reasons to exclude.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/"">Meritocracy</a> links reward to demonstrated talent, effort, or productivity, appealing to fairness through performance. In design, this logic supports optimizing for “power users” or “high-value segments” to maximize efficiency and impact.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Equality vs. Merit</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Design for accessibility and difference as defaults while recognizing merit, balancing equality with performance.</p><ul><li>Adopt accessibility guidelines (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">WCAG</a>, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"">WAI-ARIA</a>) as creative constraints.</li><li>Use participatory methods to include marginalized users in testing and feedback.</li><li>Offer personalization — contrast, input method, motion sensitivity, voice settings — without stigma.</li><li>Audit datasets, prompts, and imagery for cultural or algorithmic bias.</li><li>Frame inclusivity as an innovation driver that benefits all users.</li><li>Provide “power features” as additive layers, not the default path.</li><li>Evaluate efficiency metrics for the whole user base, not just the fastest quartile.</li></ul><h4>Autonomy</h4><p>Autonomy protects the user’s capacity to think, choose, and act without manipulation or coercion. In interface design, it means preserving agency — giving users real control over what they see, share, and decide.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Empower users to manage visibility and consent through clear privacy controls, opt-in dialogs, and transparent data-use indicators.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide physical controls, such as undo buttons and emergency stops, that let users reverse or interrupt actions on their own terms.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Require explicit verbal control over actions, ensuring conscious intent over automated interpretation.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Design gestures that distinguish deliberate intent from incidental movement, preventing unintended triggers.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Secure informed consent and allow opt-out before interpreting or predicting user intent from neural signals.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Give users control over spatial permissions, tracking boundaries, and data sharing within AR and VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Grounded in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kantian Ethics</a>. People must be treated as ends in themselves, not as means to collective goals. Ethical action respects rational self-rule, even when doing so conflicts with collective well-being. Favor transparent choices, meaningful consent, and reversibility over efficiency or mass benefit.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/"">Utilitarianism</a> values the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach may favor streamlined decisions, the removal of risky options, or persuasive defaults to maximize collective well-being and system efficiency.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Freedom vs. Welfare</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Preserve informed choice while allowing limited, transparent guidance that prevents harm without coercion.</p><ul><li>Treat informed consent as ongoing and contextual.</li><li>Provide granular settings for automation and data sharing.</li><li>Default to privacy-preserving choices.</li><li>State clearly where automation begins and ends.</li><li>Eliminate dark patterns and manipulative urgency cues.</li><li>When nudging for welfare, disclose the nudge, show the rationale, and offer a one-tap opt-out.</li><li>Provide escape hatches (undo, exit, manual override).</li></ul><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Transparency concerns the integrity of information shared between humans and systems. It requires honesty, disclosure, and authenticity so that what is shown aligns with what is real. It provides the truthful foundation necessary for understanding, accountability, and rational choice.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Present data truthfully through accurate charts, clear sponsorship labels, and visible indicators of AI-generated or manipulated media.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide feedback that reflects the true system state, distinguishing between successful actions, errors, and pending responses.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Disclose when users are interacting with non-human agents and summarize what information is recorded or retained.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Notify users when motion data is being tracked, interpreted, or stored to maintain awareness of system observation.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Distinguish which neural signals can be measured versus which should be, clarifying how thought-related data is interpreted and used.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Display clear boundaries between simulated and real elements, including visibility into what is recorded, shared, or AI-generated within AR/VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Draws on <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"">Virtue Ethics</a>. Honesty and truthfulness appear as reliable presentation, avoidance of deception, and willingness to disclose limits. Interfaces operationalize these traits via faithful visualizations, provenance signals, and candid explanation of uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/"">Pragmatism</a> values what works over what is strictly true. It treats clarity and usefulness as higher goods than full disclosure, accepting that some truths may be simplified or deferred when they hinder progress.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Truth vs. Utility</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Reveal truth and uncertainty clearly and in context, maintaining usability and trust.</p><ul><li>Disclose algorithmic involvement in rankings and outputs.</li><li>Make consent and data flows comprehensible in context.</li><li>Expose uncertainty and known limitations.</li><li>Align copy and feedback with actual system behavior.</li><li>Design clarity as a user benefit, not just compliance.</li><li>Use layered explanations: short, then expandable detail — never hide conflicts of interest.</li><li>Avoid “spin” — simplify presentation without sacrificing truth.</li></ul><h4>Privacy</h4><p>Privacy safeguards the boundary between the individual and the system. It upholds user control over information, attention, and identity — defining the conditions under which data is observed, shared, or stored.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Provide clear permission settings, visible tracking indicators, and accessible private modes that let users manage visibility and data exposure.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Incorporate hardware shutters, physical switches, and tactile indicators to give users direct control over sensors and device activity.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Include audible or visual cues when recording begins, and enable quick, in-flow deletion or redaction of captured speech.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Capture movement data only upon explicit initiation, ensuring gestures are recorded intentionally rather than passively monitored.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Protect sensitive neural data through local processing, encryption, and consent-based access to signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Allow users to define spatial privacy zones and control when spatial mapping, camera feeds, or biometric data are shared.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Informed by <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/"">Liberalism</a>. Individuals possess rights to personal domain and consent that constrain collective or commercial interests. Privacy functions as a precondition of autonomy by preserving mental space for deliberation, identity formation, and dissent.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/"">Communitarianism</a> prioritizes common goods and may endorse broader sharing for safety, coordination, or solidarity. Legitimate community aims must be balanced against the standing claim of individuals to control access and use of their data.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Autonomy vs. Solidarity</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Protect dignity through consent and control while permitting ethical data sharing for genuine collective benefit.</p><ul><li>Practice data minimization.</li><li>Show what’s shared, why, and for how long — without fatigue.</li><li>Make controls accessible, contextual, and reversible.</li><li>Process data on the user’s device whenever possible — use cloud storage or computation only when essential and clearly justified.</li><li>Frame privacy as trust that enables participation.</li><li>For “common good” uses, require aggregation, anonymization, purpose binding, and expiry by default.</li><li>Provide opt-out mechanisms for any data pooling or sharing when feasible — document non-optional cases.</li></ul><h4>Well-Being</h4><p>Well-being asks whether technology supports human and ecological flourishing — psychological, social, physical, and environmental. It favors sustained clarity, balance, and restoration over compulsive engagement, overuse, or unsustainable resource demand.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Design calm visual hierarchies, offer dark or focus modes, and adjust color temperature or brightness over time to reduce eye strain and fatigue.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Use haptic cues to encourage rest, posture shifts, or mindful breaks, supporting physical comfort and recovery.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Employ tone and pacing that convey calm support without emotional manipulation or artificial empathy.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Encourage healthy movement through interaction patterns that counter sedentary use and promote active engagement.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Adapt cognitive pacing and information density to match user comprehension and prevent overload or fatigue.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Balance immersion with grounding cues, allowing users to pause, recalibrate, or exit experiences to protect mental and physical well-being.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Anchored in <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism"">Collectivism</a><strong>.</strong> Well-being is measured by the health of the collective — how design supports shared welfare, mutual dependence, and the long-term sustainability of both human and ecological systems. Design choices emphasize cooperation, community benefit, and responsibility for collective outcomes over purely individual gain.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"">Libertarianism</a> prioritizes individual freedom and self-determination, often resisting design constraints that guide or limit user behavior for the sake of collective good. From this view, interventions that promote well-being — such as limiting usage or prompting rest — can be seen as paternalistic, infringing on personal autonomy even when intended for protection or benefit.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Welfare vs. Freedom</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Foster flourishing and reduce harm without violating autonomy or moral boundaries.</p><ul><li>Replace engagement KPIs with well-being metrics: satisfaction, balance, trust, recovery.</li><li>Use persuasion for healthy habits, not compulsion.</li><li>Add protective friction: time limits, focus modes, optional pauses.</li><li>Assess long-term emotional and cognitive effects of tone, color, and loops.</li><li>Test for calm, clarity, and self-perception, not only task completion.</li><li>Offer well-being prompts as configurable aids with clear off switches.</li><li>Decouple core utility from compulsive loops (infinite scroll, variable rewards).</li></ul><h3>Design for the Future</h3><p>Design for the future means translating moral philosophy into tangible choices that shape how people live, work, and connect. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> and the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> framework were developed by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/micbuckcreative/"">Michael Buckley</a> to help designers approach emerging technologies with awareness and accountability.

<h4><strong>AI can automate frameworks, but not their interpretation or meaning.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Minimal composition of neutral-coloured material samples arranged in geometric blocks on a soft beige background, suggesting structure, relationships and design frameworks."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*b8DzJdpcGkM2SfZcyrbI2Q.jpeg"" /></figure><p>AI can now generate design artefacts in seconds. It can fill in a Value Proposition Canvas, a journey map, or a jobs-to-be-done structure with impressive speed and coherence. For designers and other professionals, this raises an uncomfortable question: if machines can apply the tools of our disciplines, where does that leave human expertise?</p><p>The answer lies not in what AI can produce, but in what humans can <em>decide</em>. The real transformation is not about replacing expertise, but about separating the visible outputs of design and strategy from the judgement that gives those outputs meaning. The part of professional work being automated is not the expertise itself. It is the formatting. The model doesn’t replace human judgement; it replicates its surface patterns.</p><p>This distinction matters because in many disciplines, frameworks frameworksincluding design systems, journey maps and strategy canvases — have gradually become confused with expertise. In reality, frameworks were never the work. They were simply a way to show the thinking behind the work.</p><blockquote>A canvas, a storyboard, a strategic quadrant or a journey map is a visible output of reasoning. It is not the reasoning itself.</blockquote><p>Designers and professionals are trusted not because they can draw boxes in the correct configuration, but because they can decide what those boxes should mean in this particular context, and why certain trade-offs deserve priority.</p><p>This becomes especially clear in a phrase that appears frequently in AI technical discussions: “once you have a knowledge graph.” It sounds like a neutral implementation detail, but it conceals something fundamental. A knowledge-graph structure implies that the relevant concepts have already been chosen, that the relationships between them have already been defined, and that the worldview has already been interpreted. The graph does not emerge automatically from data. It is the result of decisions about relevance and meaning. In other words, the interpretive step — the step that decides what something really means — is already done by humans before the model can do anything intelligent with the structure.</p><p>Once meaning is structured, AI can format it into any template shape you like: a canvas, a SWOT, a JTBD card, a “north star” narrative or a product-positioning document. These are all just containers for meaning. The automation is real. And designers and professionals who ignore these new capabilities will eventually feel pressure from those who adopt them. But the layer that becomes automated is not the layer where value originates. It is the layer where value becomes visible.</p><p>This leads to a larger shift taking place across design and the professions more broadly. The next decade is unlikely to be defined by whether AI can perform technical tasks. It is already clear that it can. The future of work will be shaped by where professional value migrates in response. Designers and professionals who have defined themselves primarily by their ability to apply tools will see their contribution begin to shrink, not because they are being replaced by machines, but because the level of work they have specialised in is now becoming commoditised.</p><p>Where value increases is in the upstream layer: the ability to define the context, shape the problem, discern what matters and design the meaning architecture within which decisions will operate. In product development, for instance, the meaning architecture is not the journey map or the sprint cadence itself, but the decision to prioritise long-term ethical design over short-term growth, or to define ‘customer value’ in a way that includes accessibility and inclusion. These are structural choices about what the organisation believes to be valuable, and they shape every subsequent framework or metric that follows.</p><p>These are not technical choices; they are leadership ones. And because AI accelerates the downstream tasks so dramatically, the upstream space becomes more valuable. The gravitational pull of automation is downward toward execution. The centre of human advantage moves upward toward sensemaking.</p><p>In reality, the relationship between AI and human professionals is less a division of labour than a feedback loop. Automated outputs can expose hidden assumptions or new correlations, prompting humans to revisit and refine the structures of meaning themselves. The speed of automation accelerates the human capacity for interpretation by providing more “first drafts” to react to, question and evolve. In this sense, AI doesn’t just apply frameworks faster — it multiplies the opportunities for deeper sensemaking.</p><p>This is why, in strategic practice, the deepest leverage is not in the artefacts themselves but in the operating logic behind them. For example, in customer-centric strategy work, it is not the journey map or the value-proposition template that drives transformation, but the underlying ontology of the business. Frameworks such as the Customer Centricity Strategy Framework, used in strategic design practice, operate at this level, defining how customer value is understood, related and governed. This is the layer where meaning lives.</p><p>Deciding what matters is not only a rational act but also a deeply human one. It involves reading the emotional climate of an organisation, understanding unspoken cultural dynamics, and sensing how ideas will land with people. Frameworks may help clarify choices, but it is empathy, discretion and moral awareness that allow those choices to take root. The human advantage lies not only in deciding what matters, but in helping others believe in and act on it.</p><figure><img alt=""A person’s hand arranges natural and crafted materials — wood, ceramic, shells, and small objects — on a marble surface beside a cup of tea, suggesting human curation, reflection, and creativity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S48RRgrQ5v4gyW_93HEkZQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Human sensemaking in action — arranging, selecting and interpreting elements to create coherence and meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>So the real future-of-work question is not “Will AI replace me?” The more accurate question is: “At what level am I operating?” If your identity is tied to applying templates, AI will apply them faster. If your identity is tied to interpreting reality, your value not only remains, it increases. Designers and professionals do not become obsolete because their tools become automated. They become obsolete when they equate their professional identity with the tools.</p><p>AI can apply any framework. But only humans can decide what matters. The future of work will not be defined by competition between human and machine capability, but by the reallocation of value — from tool application to meaning architecture — and that is where real transformation in organisations is most likely to happen next.</p><p><em>For further reading on the deeper architecture of customer-centric meaning, see</em> <a href=""https://a.co/d/5vceae5""><strong><em>Designing Customer Experiences with Soul: How to Build Products, Services and Brands that People Genuinely Love</em></strong></a>, <em>which explores the ontology behind customer value and strategic coherence.</em></p><h4><strong>Author</strong></h4><p>Simon Robinson is CEO (Worldwide) of Holonomics and a global thought leader on customer experience, systems thinking and strategic transformation.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cb6e2dfecf6d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-new-professional-core-the-future-of-work-is-sensemaking-cb6e2dfecf6d"">The future of work is sensemaking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>When you can build a working prototype in an afternoon, the question is no longer <em>can you make it</em> — it’s <em>should you build it</em>, and <em>what should you build</em>.</h4><figure><img alt=""Central target with four coral hands reaching toward it, connected by teal circuit board lines and technology icons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ja7QeYOYZ4XrSSk5eA3opw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Most founders and teams struggle with those questions, not because they lack conviction, but because they test that conviction too late. Resources get committed before customer needs are validated. Confirmation bias filters what gets heard. They often fall in love with solutions before fully understanding the problems they need to solve.</p><p>AI-accelerated development affects everyone — from solo founders building alone to small startup teams to larger software organizations at scaleups and enterprises. Whether you’re a team of one or one hundred, the challenge is the same: deciding what deserves to exist.</p><p>The CHAOS Report (Standish Group, 2020) indicates that more than two-thirds of software projects fail to meet their intended outcomes. While execution failures play a role, the problems often begin earlier — in the discovery phase. A focus on delivery velocity has replaced the judgment time needed to uncover what truly matters.</p><h3>Co-Invention: Redesigning Discovery</h3><p>I had spent six weeks conducting discovery and design on an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate product discovery when I came across Ajay Agrawal’s YouTube interview, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfpHwcrx6c"">The AI Economist: The Skill You Need to Stay Employed in the Age of AI</a>&quot; (Full interview is 1 hour and 5 minutes). I was researching AI capabilities for the toolkit when his insight stopped me in my tracks. In my experience, software teams often skipped proper discovery, claiming they didn’t have time. I saw AI as the solution to a productivity problem: automate tasks, integrate workflows, and make discovery faster so software teams would have fewer excuses not to do it properly.</p><p>In their book <em>Power and Prediction</em>, Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2022) describe what happened when factories first adopted electricity. Manufacturers replaced steam engines with electric motors, but retained the same layout — one large motor, complex belts and pulleys, and machines clustered around a central power source. Productivity barely improved. The breakthrough came when they redesigned around electricity’s potential: machines could go anywhere, organized by workflow rather than power source.</p><p>This is what they call co-invention: the new technology is only part of the solution. The real value lies in inventing complementary systems, processes, and organizational structures that leverage the technology's strengths.</p><p>Today we’re making the same mistake with AI — bolting it onto existing workflows, increasing speed without improving outcomes. An effective AI-human partnership requires co-inventing new systems that leverage the strengths of each. The processes that guide discovery need fundamental redesign, not around speed, but around judgment.</p><p>Speed without judgment means building the wrong things faster.</p><h3>Prediction vs Judgment</h3><p>Agrawal’s deeper insight reframed my thinking. In the human-AI partnership, AI makes predictions radically faster — filling in missing information, recognizing patterns, generating options, and forecasting outcomes. What remains scarce is judgment: the ability to interpret meaning, weigh trade-offs, and decide what’s worth pursuing.</p><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkhxVv155CAE29w9F2Dal4uOtXrRKFuEZ?si=iZTAjfaqrrJrD4o2""><strong><em>Watch economist Ajay Agrawal explain this distinction</em></strong><em>(1 minute)</em></a></p><p>Decision-making is the interplay of prediction and judgment.

AI can analyze customer-interview transcripts and identify patterns across dozens of conversations — that’s prediction. But we must decide whether those patterns represent real problems worth solving or simply interesting noise — that’s judgment.</p><p>AI can forecast which features might increase engagement — that’s prediction. Only humans can decide how well they align with customers’ needs and the product’s vision, purpose and principles — that’s judgment.</p><p>Brandon Harwood (2025) describes this distinction in his framework for AI-powered product design, noting that specific tasks must remain human-centric due to the need for judgment, intuition, and emotional intelligence. What AI accelerates is synthesis; what humans provide is meaning-making.</p><p>Judgment develops by making decisions under uncertainty and owning the consequences. When you pursue an opportunity based on limited evidence, ship it, and learn it was the wrong bet, that failure can grow your judgment. When you kill a beloved idea because evidence doesn’t support it and that decision proves correct, that success strengthens your judgment. Learning comes from the whole cycle: decide → act → observe → reflect.</p><p>Discovery judgment is the practice of developing judgment about what deserves to exist. It’s not a single activity but a set of practices: identifying opportunities, talking to customers about their needs, mapping assumptions about what would make a solution valuable, testing those assumptions with minimal investment, and deciding when evidence is strong enough to commit resources.</p><p>Sinek’s (2009) Golden Circle, explored in <em>Start with Why</em> and his TED Talk <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"">“How Great Leaders Inspire Action”</a>, provides a valuable lens for understanding why judgment remains a human trait. The Golden Circle shows that inspiring action starts with <em>why</em> — purpose and belief — then moves to <em>how</em>, and finally <em>what</em> you produce. This order is often reversed, starting with what or how to build.</p><p>AI can handle the how and even suggest the what. Only humans can determine the why, which makes it worthwhile to build. Judgment is the capacity to reason about purpose, meaning, and value — capabilities that belong uniquely to us.</p><h3>Cross-Functional Discovery Judgment</h3><p>If discovery judgment is scarce, everyone involved in bringing software to market needs to develop it. Discovery emerges from judgment calls across multiple perspectives — technical feasibility, user needs, market fit, operational constraints, and strategy.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams make all these judgment calls themselves, constantly switching between perspectives. You’re the product person AND the engineer AND the designer — often feeling overwhelmed by the need to think across domains that don’t come naturally.</p><p>Larger teams distribute these perspectives across various roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and customer success. When these perspectives stay siloed, teams consistently build the wrong things. The “that’s not my job” mindset creates blind spots that AI acceleration only amplifies.</p><p>Tutti Taygerly (2020) learned this at Facebook: true collaboration isn’t about stakeholders handing work to each other — it’s about establishing trust and reasoning together from the start. Whether developing multi-perspective judgment as a solo founder or learning to reason together as a team, the principle is the same: cross-functional discovery judgment determines whether you build the right things.</p><p>For solo builders, this means developing judgment across domains you might not naturally think in — and creating systematic practices to compensate for working alone. For teams, it means different perspectives combining to form a better collective judgment. Over time, this capability compounds — solo founders develop intuition across multiple domains, and teams learn to reason together effectively.</p><p>For organizations, siloed discovery wastes insight and resources. For individuals working alone, a lack of systematic practices wastes time and money. For professionals staying narrow in their function, they become replaceable.</p><h3>Discovery as a Continuous Loop</h3><p>Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice that runs alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop. Whether working solo or in teams, you discover what to build, deliver it, learn from what happens, and feed those insights back into the next round of discovery.</p><blockquote><strong>“Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice running alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram illustrating the continuous discovery-delivery-learning cycle with arrows showing how builders discover what to build, deliver it, learn from outcomes, and feed insights back into the next discovery cycle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mgTX7TtZVj4kuIf97UINzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Discovery requires double-loop learning: not only asking Did this feature succeed? but examining the assumptions and reasoning behind it. Single-loop learning adjusts what you do; double-loop learning improves how you think about what to do.</p><p>Matthew Godfrey (2020) explores this in his work on the critical role of discovery, noting that the best product teams recognize that discovery and delivery should run concurrently and continuously, rather than as separate, sequential phases. This dual-track approach enables teams to address problems as they arise throughout the product development process.</p><p>As builders move through the discovery–delivery–learning loop, they’re not just refining the product — they’re refining their judgment. Each cycle sharpens your sense of what matters, which assumptions to test first, and what evidence is sufficient to act on. For teams, when this capability becomes shared, organizations learn to reason together — and that capacity compounds. For solo founders, systematic practice creates the judgment that teams might develop through diverse perspectives.</p><p>Solo founders often think they can skip systematic practices because “I am the product person AND the engineer AND the designer.” But that’s why the loop matters more — you need systematic practices to compensate for not having diverse perspectives catching your blind spots in real-time.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>When spreadsheets arrived, accounting firms hired fewer accountants — but those who remained became more strategic and better compensated. Arithmetic specialists moved on; judgment-oriented accountants thrived.</p><p>Software builders face the same shift. The ratio of value to people is changing dramatically. Your value isn’t in what AI can generate — code, mock-ups, or transcripts. It’s in developing discovery judgment: framing the right problems, interpreting evidence, weighing trade-offs, and helping others do the same.</p><p>I’ve seen this pattern repeatedly throughout my career. Teams would spend months building technically impressive solutions — only to discover they’d solved problems no customer actually had. The breakthrough came when we started mapping assumptions systematically before building—the same talented people, but different discovery judgment practices.</p><p>The market is splitting: professionals who use AI merely to execute faster versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment. The latter will become increasingly valuable precisely because AI can’t automate judgment. As Teixeira and Braga (2025) document in <em>The State of UX in 2025</em>, algorithms and automated tools are taking over execution tasks, making human judgment about purpose and meaning increasingly valuable.</p><p>For solo founders and small teams, this shift is even more pronounced. You can now build a complete product yourself using AI — but your judgment quality determines whether that product solves a real problem. The democratization of building capability means your competitive advantage is 100% in judgment, not execution speed.</p><p>If this all feels like too much change, that’s natural. AI is rewriting how we work; uncertainty is real; change feels relentless. But you’re already making judgment calls every day — deciding priorities, interpreting feedback, choosing when to proceed or pause. It isn’t new work; it’s becoming deliberate about the work that matters most.</p><blockquote><strong>“Speed and judgment used to be a trade-off. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.”</strong></blockquote><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>When AI makes building and delivering software easier, faster and more cost-effective, judgment becomes the scarce resource.</li><li>Judgment develops through decisions under uncertainty and reflection on results.</li><li>Cross-functional discovery judgment is the ability to interpret evidence and decide what deserves to be built and why — whether you’re building solo or as a team.</li><li>Discovery judgment is a continuous, double-loop learning practice, not a phase.</li><li>The software market is segmenting: those who focus on delivering faster versus those who compete on wisdom and strategic value.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Agrawal, A., Gans, J., &amp; Goldfarb, A.

<h4>And why history repeats itself over and over again.</h4><figure><img alt=""Sip, Dip and FLip, the internalization process before taking actions on development."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fhgMBgK9xHBSuTUdLlE8TQ.png"" /><figcaption>Sip, Dip and Flip is how the ideal process works.</figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever been frustrated by an app or website that seems to be working against you? It’s as if the designers didn’t think about how real people would use it. That’s where product thinking comes in. It’s a way of designing that keeps the user at the forefront of the process, ensuring that their needs and challenges are fully understood before any solutions are created. In this post, I will share some of the values of product thinking I have learned over the years and share some tips on how to build good User Experience for the masses.</p><p>It is a process learned through continued learning to stay ahead, develop soft skills, and cultivate empathy for the user. I found following these principles incredibly useful and you can too use them to create products and experiences that truly serve your users.</p><h3>The value of product thinking</h3><p>A cornerstone of product thinking is the <strong>meticulous study of the </strong><a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-genai-changes-creative-work/""><strong>user’s journey</strong></a>. We meticulously map out the steps a user takes to achieve a specific goal, pinpointing their pain points and frustrations. By doing so, we can design products and services that are tailor-made to address these issues, creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XxTRMd6CFuGb_r5kXP1YRA.png"" /><figcaption>Sample user journey map created by author.</figcaption></figure><p>Equally important is the consideration of the product’s value proposition. What unique benefits does the product offer to users? How does it solve their problems or improve their lives? By clearly defining the product’s value proposition, businesses can ensure that their product stands out in the market and that users can easily understand the value they will get from using it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nm4dnjiV9gr47C-LB-pwqg.avif"" /><figcaption>Courtesy:<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/value-proposition-canvas?srsltid=AfmBOoo2qjdc50y_zushQaKFUPTjYFRRp0z2zCcGJjmL_p3FPmwOiUob""> Interaction design Or</a>g</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also important to know that the aspects of Value prop and Mission statement of your product team can be very different. Here’s a clear breakdown of the <strong>differentiators</strong> between a <strong>Value Proposition</strong> and a <strong>Mission Statement</strong>, along with guidance on what kind of <strong>overlap</strong> is ideal and strategically beneficial.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*l1NG1p6czf8xvvxbIEvF4g.png"" /></figure><h3>Ideal Overlap Between the Two</h3><p>While distinct, a <strong>healthy overlap</strong> between the two ensures <strong>strategic alignment</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong>. Here’s what that looks like:</p><ol><li><strong>Shared Purpose Language:</strong><br /> Both should express a consistent <em>why</em> — the company’s fundamental reason for existing. <br />Example: If the mission is “to simplify global communication,” the value proposition might echo that with “helping teams connect seamlessly across borders.”</li><li><strong>Cohesive Brand Identity:</strong><br /> The value proposition should <strong>flow naturally</strong> from the mission — the mission is <em>why</em> the company exists; the value proposition is <em>how</em> it creates value in the market.</li><li><strong>Emotional + Rational Blend:<br />Mission: evokes emotion and belief (“We exist to improve lives”). <br />Value Proposition</strong>: translates belief into tangible benefit (“We deliver affordable healthcare tools to everyone”).</li><li><strong>Internal and External Alignment:</strong><br /> Employees motivated by the mission are better able to deliver the value proposition authentically. This alignment ensures that marketing promises (value prop) match lived experience (mission).</li></ol><p>Prioritizing features according to user needs and business objectives is another key aspect of product thinking. Not all features are created equal, and it’s essential to allocate resources to those that will deliver the most value to users and align with the strategic goals of the business. Through comprehensive user research and analysis, we can make informed decisions about which features to prioritize and develop.</p><p>Finally, testing and iterating on designs is essential to ensure that products meet user needs. User testing provides valuable feedback that can be used to refine and improve the product. By iterating on designs based on user feedback, businesses can create products that are user-friendly, effective, and enjoyable to use.</p><h3>Building experience for the masses</h3><p>Crafting Inclusive User Experiences for the Masses:</p><p>Creating products and services that meet the needs of a wide range of users is a key part of building UX for everyone. This requires a holistic approach that includes <a href=""https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-are-the-wcag-guidelines/"">accessibility</a>, inclusion, cultural sensitivity, and strong user research.</p><p>In the age of<a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/mobile-first-design""> mobile-first technology</a>, it’s crucial to design with mobile in mind. This means creating interfaces that are easy to navigate and interact with on smaller screens. Intuitive touch gestures and clear calls to action are key to a great user experience, and thorough testing across devices and network conditions is essential to ensure your design works for everyone.</p><p>Accessibility and inclusivity are not just buzzwords; they are fundamental to great UX design. Making sure that people with disabilities — whether they have vision impairments, hearing loss, or other challenges — can use your product isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s also good for business. Using clear and simple language, providing text alternatives for non-text content, and making sure your product works with assistive technologies can help you reach a wider audience.</p><p>Cultural sensitivity is another key ingredient in the recipe for successful global UX. Understanding the unique expectations and preferences of diverse cultures is vital to crafting interfaces that resonate with users from different backgrounds. This may involve employing culturally appropriate colors, fonts, and imagery, as well as localizing content to cater to specific languages and cultural norms.</p><p>And finally, ongoing user research and testing are critical to a UX <a href=""https://www.netguru.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ux-design"">designer’s success</a>. Surveys, interviews, and usability testing can provide valuable insights into what users need, want, and find frustrating. By involving users in the design process, we can create products that are truly user-centered and that provide a positive and inclusive experience for everyone.</p><h3>Keep learning to stay relevant</h3><p>The world of product design and development is always changing, with new technologies, trends, and user needs emerging all the time. To stay relevant and effective in this dynamic landscape, it’s important for designers to embrace a mindset of continuous learning and skill development. This means staying up-to-date with the latest industry knowledge, seeking out new opportunities for growth, and cultivating a diverse skill set that goes beyond technical expertise.</p><p><strong>You can use this GROW framework: </strong><br /> The word <em>GROW</em> captures the essence of continuous learning : it’s active, personal, and forward-looking. It reminds us that development isn’t about perfection; it’s about progress, curiosity, and courage. Each letter represents a mindset that fuels sustained growth in any field.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/713/1*JNMJcJxlBqmYhqAZSdWYfQ.png"" /><figcaption>GROW Framework</figcaption></figure><p>Among the most vital soft skills for UX designers is<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnNsSyDw-g""> <strong>the art of active listening</strong></a>, the ability to truly hear what users are saying and comprehend their needs. It also involves the capacity to ask the right questions and seek clarity when needed. Empathy is another cornerstone of the UX designer’s skill set, enabling one to step into the user’s world, understand their emotions, and motivations. By cultivating empathy, we can craft products that are not only user-friendly but also a joy to use.</p><p>Effective communication is yet another vital soft skill for UX designers. This encompasses the ability to articulate one’s ideas clearly and concisely, as well as the capacity to listen to feedback and integrate it into one’s work. Time management, too, is of the essence. The skill to plan, prioritize, and meet deadlines is paramount for the successful completion of projects to the highest standard.</p><h3>Building your soft skills</h3><p>Soft skills are the interpersonal and communication abilities that are crucial for success in any job. They encompass active listening, <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/"">empathy</a>, communication, and time management. In UX design, soft skills are indispensable for comprehending the user’s requirements and crafting products that fulfill those needs. By honing your soft skills, you can elevate your standing as a UX designer and enhance your prospects for triumph in the industry.</p><h3>Empathy for the win</h3><p>Empathy is a critical soft skill for UX designers. It allows us to understand the needs and desires of our users on a deeper level. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our users, we can create products and services that are truly user-centric.</p><p>We, as designers, can cultivate empathy through active listening, striving to comprehend the user’s perspective without bias. Engaging in user research, we can observe users in their natural settings, gaining valuable insights into their behaviors, needs, and challenges.</p><h3>This begs larger questions about AI’s impact on creativity</h3><p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in various industries, including design. With the ability to process vast amounts of data and perform complex tasks, AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process and improve the overall <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/designing-for-generative-ai-experiences"">user experience</a>.</p><p>However, as AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into the design process, it raises questions about its impact on creativity. Some argue that AI will replace human designers, making their skills and expertise obsolete. Others believe that AI will simply assist and enhance the work of designers, allowing them to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of the design process.</p><p>One of the main concerns is that AI may limit the diversity and uniqueness of designs. As AI algorithms are based on data and patterns, there is a risk that designs may become too similar and lack originality. This could result in a homogenization of design, stifling creativity and innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, AI has the potential to open up new possibilities and push the boundaries of design. By automating repetitive tasks and providing designers with insights and suggestions, AI can free up time for designers to <a href=""https://generalassemb.ly/blog/global-perspectives-ux-design-in-the-age-of-ai/"">explore new ideas</a> and experiment with different approaches. This can lead to more innovative and unique designs that would not have been possible without AI.</p><p>Another issue to consider is the ethical implications of AI in design. As AI algorithms are trained on existing data, there is a risk of perpetuating biases and discrimination in designs. It is crucial for designers to be aware of these biases and actively work towards creating inclusive and ethical designs.</p><p>In conclusion, the impact of AI on creativity in design is a complex and ongoing discussion. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process, it is essential for designers to approach it with caution and continue to prioritize human creativity and empathy in their work. By understanding and harnessing the capabilities of AI, designers can create truly impactful and meaningful designs for the benefit of users.</p><p>So as you move forward, remember to <strong>SIP, DIP, and FLIP</strong>. <strong>SIP</strong> the world around you to take in its ideas, lessons, and experiences with curiosity. <strong>DIP</strong> into them deeply, let understanding soak through your thoughts, shaping your perspective and intent.

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: the best Black Friday deals.</p>



<p>All of your favorite retailers have rolled out all their Black Friday deals, making now the time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/athleta-simone-biles-collaboration-interview"">Simone Biles</a> isn’t ready to get back in the gym yet. The Olympic gold medallist is the most decorated gymnast of all time and undoubtedly one of the most dominant and greatest athletes to ever grace sports, but these days, she’s taking time for herself. After competing for 22 years, <a href=""https://people.com/simone-biles-reveals-daring-sport-shes-learning-during-gymnastics-break-exclusive-11847531"">Biles is on a “break”</a> from gymnastics. Now, she’s focusing on hobbies like horseback riding, ice skating, pilates and long walks with her husband, Chicago Bears safety, <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4331768/jonathan-owens"">Jonathan Owens</a>. On NFL game day, you can find her on the field giving <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YahooSports/posts/simone-biles-out-in-the-chicago-snow-supporting-her-husband-jonathan-owens-%EF%B8%8F/1433346048154147/"">Owens a good luck kiss</a> (his one pre-game superstition) and showing out in various football-appropriate ‘fits. </p>



<p>Lately, football Sunday has turned into a who’s who of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/what-are-wags-rcna124752"">WAGs (wives and girlfriends)</a> — celebs like <a href=""https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-russell-wilson-s-wife-ciara-channels-james-bond-s-007-energy-faux-leather-bodycon-slit-dress"">Ciara</a>, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1424616/hailee-steinfeld-on-josh-allen-marriage"">Hailee Steinfeld,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/cuffing-season-taylor-swift-travis-kelce"">Taylor Swift</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHM2vZWJ9Tq/?hl=en"">Normani</a> are all partnered up with players — and their fashion makes weekly headlines. For Biles, game days are “so fun” but over Zoom, she says the attention is stressful: “I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man.” It’s a good thing <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=3034725"">Biles has her own collection with Athleta</a> to keep her looking good on game days. She even teased a custom Athleta look for the Bears’ upcoming faceoff against the Minnesota Vikings this weekend.</p>



<p>Biles and Athleta have been partnering for years but this marks the Olympian’s second women’s <em>and</em> girls’ collection for the activewear brand. Like her last Athleta collab, the collection is affordable, size inclusive, and includes intergenerational styles as well as accessories. Whether you’re looking for soft hoodies, performance-ready tights (Biles told R29 that the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583530002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=Elation%207%2F8%20Tight#pdp-page-content"">Elation Ultra High Rise Shine 7/8 Legging</a> is one of her all-time favorites), barrel-leg sweats, or a new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">fall jacket</a> (the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583465002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=sateen%20bomber#pdp-page-content"">Sateen Bomber</a> is another Biles must-have), Biles has you covered with pieces that are deserving of a game-day catwalk. </p>



<p>Throughout our chat, Biles’ excitement for the collection is palpable but so is her joy for this current moment in her life. She’s letting herself be bad at things (“I’m learning every day!” she says) and she’s soaking in a softer, more “selfish” life. To put it simply, Biles seems <em>free</em>. It’s beautiful to behold, and even more inspiring that the woman who landed the hardest vault in the world so flawlessly that <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/simone-biles-nails-yurchenko-double-pike-vault-at-world-championships-now-named-after-her/4730964/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">they renamed it after</a> her is now happily losing at darts to her friends. After all of Biles’ <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10611521/simone-biles-statement-mental-health-olympics"">public mental health struggles</a>, the normal, quiet contentment she describes to me feels like her biggest win yet. </p>



<p>Here, she talks more about her Athleta collection, how she <em>really</em> feels about being called a “WAG”, and supporting her friend and former teammate <a href=""https://www.intlgymnast.com/main/jordan-chiles-cha-cha-chas-her-way-to-dancing-with-the-stars-semifinals/"">Jordan Chiles on<em> Dancing With The Stars. </em></a></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29 Unbothered: Congrats on the collection! The pieces look so comfortable and chic. Tell me about this collection and how it aligns with how you approach working out.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Biles:</strong> It’s very different. It’s the boldest collection that we’ve had thus far. I’m obviously biased, but this is one of my favorite collections. We have followed some of the trends but really, I always say, that you can take it from the mat to conferences or whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be just for the gym. It’s my go-to travel style, as well as if I’m taking a pilates class with my husband. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942663.png?width=767&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=767%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What are the pieces in the collection that everyone needs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> There’s a couple. I’m going to start with the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/sale/sale-accessories?cid=50012"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sateen bucket bag</a>. That is just such a fashionable piece. It’s just a really cute accessory. And I think people are going to love to layer it, as well as the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shop/product/elation-ultra-high-rise-shine-7-8-legging-11781706"">Elation Shine Leggings</a>, those have a subtle zebra print, which you can’t really tell until you’re up close. It just adds something extra without being overpowering. That’s really, really cute and fashionable. We have the sateen bomber jacket that in the fall and the winter, I just put over everything. We also have the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBos7DTS2Nb/"">Forever Fleece sweatpants,</a> which are a barrel leg, and that is just so fun. What I love about Athleta so much is that everyone can wear it. We try to be inclusive — there’s extra extra small, all the way to extra large, as well as tall and petite sizing. And for me, at 4’8, that’s perfect. But then we got my girl, [Olympic swimmer] <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katieledecky/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Katie Ledecky,</a> over here, wearing tall. We don’t want it to be one size fits all. We want everyone to be able to rock it, especially through this fall and this winter weather. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p><cite>simone biles</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>For so many of us, working out and going to the gym is a hobby or something we do to stay healthy. For you, it’s been your job. How do you separate the work of staying active from the joy of it and doing it just because it makes you feel good? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Now, I’ve started to explore other hobbies that still include working out, but it just looks a little bit different. Right now, although I’m not in the gym 24/7, I’m in my horseback riding lessons, and I’m about to pick up ice skating lessons because I feel like gymnastics, although it was working out, it was just it was so much fun for me and you don’t even realize you’re exercising. So I wanted to feel that similar feeling. I took up horseback riding because going to a gym for me and doing pilates and all that stuff seems a little bit scary and daunting, but if you put it as a hobby, and say “I’m working out for an hour or so,” it feels a little bit easier. I’m about to start doing my ice skating lessons. I’ve already called the ice rink. I know they’re tired of hearing from me<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>What made you decide to do ice skating?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>The ​​rink is literally three minutes from my house and since I pass it all the time going to and from the airport, I’m like,<em> okay, that’s going to be a fun, little hobby.</em> I walk my dog and I have a weighted vest but just going on walks and seeing the leaves change in the fall is also fun for me. I don’t think I’m ready to just get into a gym just yet, unless it’s a girls’ activity and we’re doing pilates or we’re doing something cute. I don’t think I’m ready. I still want to have fun with it. Just random sidequests. </p>



<p><strong>I’m Canadian so I love to see Black girls doing winter sports. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yes! We can do it all. I’ve never seen as much representation as I have these days, and it’s so exciting. It’s inspiring me. At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, you can. One thing we love seeing you do is show up on NFL game days supporting your husband. Will we be seeing a custom Athleta game day set soon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah! It’s coming soon. We’re planning on not this weekend but the next weekend in Minnesota. A little custom bomber going on, okay! Got a little custom action coming. </p>



<p><strong>Take me through what goes on behind your game-day fashion. How do you put your outfits together for games? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I really try to base it on the weather and where they’re playing. My husband wants me to wear more navy and orange [for the team’s colors], but I’m always going with the blacks and the whites and the grays and the neutrals. I’m trying to implement a little bit more of the Bears’ colors. But other than that, I really base it off of the weather. I know later this year when we play in San Francisco, you can get a little bit more cute and fashionable, because for me, with my height, it’s so hard to be cute and look fashionable [in the cold] when I’m just going to walk around looking like a marshmallow. I try to implement certain things like that. But definitely, we have a couple things coming, and so I’m really excited about that. But weather first and foremost, and comfortability, comfortability, comfortability! And movement! </p>



<p><strong>I saw a headline today that said: ‘Is Simone Biles NFL’s Best WAG?’ How do you feel about that title? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I don’t know about that! We still got Ciara, we got Normani. We can all fit in that space! There’s room for all of us. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942671.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>It feels like there’s so much attention on WAGs, specifically football wives and girlfriends. How do you feel about the term WAG and being a part of that club with, as you said, with Ciara and Normani, and then there’s [Hailee Steinfeld and Taylor Swift] and all these people?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I don’t mind the word WAG, because really, I’m just showing up and supporting my husband. Although the fashion is so much fun to do, I’m really just there to go support my man, and that is really important that we get to show up and support one another. We’re always working so hard, and we have a limited amount of time with each other. We don’t know how long each of us are going to be professional athletes playing on a stage like this. So it’s really just fun for everyone to show up and support. I don’t mind sharing the space. </p>



<p>It’s so much fun. But again, there are a lot of eyes. I can wear a sweatsuit like this to a game, but I was telling my husband that every time I go on the field, even though I’m just supporting you, photos are everywhere. And that part stresses me out, because I just want to be relaxed. At the last game, I just did a messy bun, a sweat suit, and that was that. But you always have to pop off and I wish we didn’t. I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man, but I know how much it is going to be highlighted.</p>



<p><strong>I can imagine that it gets stressful, especially because it’s every week. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I’m only on the field because that’s my husband’s good luck thing. He knows that he has to have me on the sideline. He said that’s his one thing. He’s not superstitious at all, but he’s like, “I know I have to have my girl on the field, get that good luck kiss, and then we’re good.” If not, y’all would never see me down there. I would be up in the stands hiding like y’all would never see me. But that’s my husband’s thing so that’s why I do it. </p>



<p><strong>That is really sweet!</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’d be hiding. I don’t like the attention — never have, and maybe never will. That stuff stresses me out so bad, I will be hiding as much as possible. I don’t like all of this attention but you get used to it, I guess. But it’s stress! Anxiety! I just want to just go do my thing and watch in peace and quiet. Next year, I think I’m going to stay home for the away games. I just can’t do it. I’m just so stressed. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes logistics that goes into it as well. It’s not the easiest to try to get me into a stadium, either.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of stress, I’m also an anxious girlie. We’re Unbothered so we always like to do a Black girl mental health check in. You’ve been so outspoken about mental health and the importance of therapy, especially Therapy Thursdays. Is there a piece of advice or something you’ve learned in therapy that you can share with us, with our audience, who are mostly Black women? Give us some energy! We need it! </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I would say the one piece of advice that I have is you have to take that mental time to yourself and those personal days, because it really does change how you feel, talk about yourself, what your life looks like. So I would say, take those personal days. It’s really important to stay in tune and to listen to your body and your mind, because that literally can change the trajectory of your life. Be selfish, show up for yourself. We’re so in tune with showing up for everyone else, but at the end of the day, we neglect a little bit of our personal space and our well being. You have to show up for yourself first and foremost. Put on your favorite tunes, some Cardi B. Women are so powerful. We can do anything we put our minds to. And showing up for yourself is a win. We have to put ourselves first.</p>



<p><strong>One of the things that is so inspiring about you is that you are the best. And in being the best gymnast in the world, the best athlete in the world, you inspire me to think I can be the best at what I do. But I also think of the pressure or expectation that comes with that. What’s something you’re just OK at, and is there freedom in being mediocre sometimes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Every day with me and my husband, we’re learning new recipes. Since I’ve done my craft for so long, over 22 years, it’s really hard for me. I love learning new things, but I’m always learning, and keen to keep learning. It never ends. I’m learning every day. I know I’m not going to be the best at it. We even did a wine and sip the other day. Did my painting look the best? Absolutely not. But I don’t care. I’m not trying to be the best. I didn’t train 22 years to paint so it looks like what it looks like, and every day when I’m doing new recipes in the house, because now I love to cook, I love to cook, it’s OK. </p>



<p>I’m even trying to get better at my makeup and my hair. I was just bugging one of my makeup artists yesterday, like, girl, you really try not to have me be great at makeup, because I keep asking you to send me the tutorial, and she finally sent it to me yesterday. So now today, I’m going to go look at it, and I’m going to go practice my makeup. We always have more to learn. I’m okay with that. I love playing darts. I love playing ping pong. At our new house, which we sign for next week, we have a ping pong table and a dart board. Am I the best at it? No, but it’s about making memories, having fun and just still learning.</p>



<p><strong>I love that but I can also picture the competitive spirit in you trying to come out at the paint and sip. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>You know, that’s actually so funny, because everyone thinks I’m going to be so competitive at whatever we do, but I literally don’t care if I’m last place. Every time, I’m still going to play, I’m still going to have a good spirit, good energy, because it’s about making those memories. Obviously for them, they’re like, “I beat Simone Biles at something!” I don’t care. I don’t care. Let’s just have a good time. Let’s kiki, have a good time, good conversation, good vibes, good energy. And that’s a win in my book, because we’re not going to be good at everything. I’m incredibly gifted, and to do what I do every day has been such a blessing and to come out on top. But I also know that’s not normal. I know that’s very rare. So I’m just incredibly blessed and thankful. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942670.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>That’s inspiring that Simone Biles can be so chill about losing or being bad at something. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah, well I never wanted to be the best at gymnastics. I just wanted to go to college, hopefully get a college scholarship, and that was it. Obviously, the cards fell in place, and I got to do way more than my wildest dreams. But even as a young girl, did I want to go to the Olympics? No. Every one of my teammates said that. So I said it. I don’t even know what the Olympics was. I saw it in 2008 on the TV. And I was like, <em>Whoa. How’d they do that? </em>But I didn’t even want to go there. At that point. I saw the girls [gymnastics team] and they went to Italy. And I was like, <em>how do I go to Italy? I want to compete in Italy. </em>I never wanted to go to the Olympics. You just dream big and dream bigger.</p>



<p><strong>You were dreaming dreams you didn’t even know you had. Speaking of your teammates, you competed on Dancing with the Stars and now so is Jordan Chiles. She’s killing it. Are you watching? How proud of Jordan are you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Oh my god, I’m so proud of her. She’s totally in her element. This is what she was made to do. She’s always been an entertainer, and obviously that goes hand-in-hand with gymnastics. On floor [routines], we do have to entertain a little bit, but this is her space completely. And she gets to be 100% herself. People get to see her personality shine. It’s a little glimpse of what we’ve gotten to see over the past couple of years, but now she gets to share it with the whole world.</p>



<p><strong>Did you give her any advice going into the season? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>She needed no advice. She is so confident in who she is, and her personality is so big. I was too shy for that. Now I think I’m a little bit more comfortable in who I am, but this is perfect for her. So there was no advice, just “good luck, have fun.” And I told her, “you’re going to be on that show one day.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” Girl, look at you now! I said “they’re going to keep asking you and bugging you to do it.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” And now she’s like, “why are you always right?” I know these things. It’s like a sixth sense.</p>



<p><strong>I love being the friend who’s always right. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Yeah, I get badgered about that a lot. “You’re just always right!” OK. And am! </p>

Here, in this personal essay, as told to Andrea Cheng, she opens up and gets vulnerable about her wellness journey, her new approach to health and fitness, and how the Ninja BlendBOSS™ seamlessly fits into her everyday routine.  </em></p>



<p>Two years ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I cried, like, every day. Not that you’d know it — I appeared on millions of Americans’ TV screens every Monday night with a smile plastered on my face, reminding everyone that summer should be fun. I was thrust into the national spotlight after being cast in a reality show. There, I met (and started dating) a man who was just…not very nice to me. But sometimes <em>really</em> nice. And then really <em>not</em> nice again. I think the kids call it a “toxic relationship.” So I was navigating that, which left me in a spiral of insecurity and depression and anxiety, and simultaneously dealing with snarky commentary from the millions of people watching it play out.</p>



<p>I felt like I was under a magnifying glass, with everyone on earth seeing the worst parts of my life up close. All I could think about was how I was perceived, so I started living my life according to what I thought these people thought of me. In short, I was living two lives: one of red carpets and toothy grins, which mostly felt disingenuous — and one that was more honest, but totally miserable. It was only when my relationship ended that I realized how much of a toll it had taken on me, both physically and mentally. There wasn’t anything wrong with <em>me</em>, I realized — there was something wrong with…well, <em>that</em>. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941604.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>So I decided to embark on a healing journey (insert sparkle emojis here). In November 2023, I overhauled my life, determined to “do the work.” Signs of trauma had already shown up in my body: I was inflamed, I was bloated, and my skin was breaking out. I researched anti-inflammatory nutrition and changed my workout routine accordingly. I took care of my inner self: I went to therapy, I journaled, I unpacked some hard stuff, I took breaks from social media, I spent quality time with friends and family. </p>



<p>Throughout this two-year journey, I learned to prioritize my mental and physical health. But the biggest takeaway was learning about health in a whole new light — one that’s not entirely accessible nor intuitive. There’s a dearth of health information written by women, for women, and about women. For example: the importance of lifting weights. I’m on a body recomposition journey (sounds intimidating, I know, but hear me out) that’s basically an effort to eat more protein, carbohydrates, and fats. All it really means is that I’m trying to gain muscle, because skeletal muscle mass is directly correlated to how long we live. Simply put: I want to be strong. I want to build muscle so that I can live longer, so that I can pick things up, so that I don’t get injured when I work out. So that even if my heart gets broken, my mind and body remain in one piece.</p>



<p>And to be completely honest, I can’t do it without my <a href=""https://www.sharkninja.com/ninja-blendboss-tumbler-blender-with-26oz-travel-tumbler-cyberspace/DB301CCY.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ninja BlendBOSS™</a>. I’ve always been a smoothie girly, but my protein shakes have become an integral part of my daily routine, especially once I discovered that I needed to drastically up my protein intake. Now I can hardly make it out the door without my stomach growling if I don’t start my morning by blending up a protein shake (mine tastes like dessert, I swear), and I can’t recover afterwards without my 100 ounces of water, powdered supplements, or my homemade electrolyte concoction.</p>



<p>The Ninja BlendBOSS™ is kind of like an everything-in-one product — it’s a blender, a tumbler, a bottle, conveniently housed in an easy-to-use (and super chic) vessel. It’s for the busy mom on the go, for the hydration queen whose emotional support object is her water bottle (me), for the fitness It girl who doesn’t like stray from her routine (also me). </p>



<p>If you’ve never fueled with a goal in mind, it’s hard to even understand what kind of a lifesaver this is. I always do a big existential sigh when women say they avoid lifting weights because they’re “afraid of getting bulky.” If only they knew how much food they’d have to eat to achieve such a thing. Since I’m trying to hit 125g of protein, 225g of carbs, and 50g of fat, adding protein powder, peanut butter, bananas, and Greek yogurt into a shake allows me to consume at <em>least</em> 30g of protein before I’m even out the door in the morning. Thanks to the Ninja BlendBOSS™, I’m hitting my numbers in a way that’s healthy <em>and</em> enjoyable. </p>



<p>For almost all my life, the driving force when it came to my physical appearance was to look a certain way for other people, to fit what I thought was the beauty standard…which, to be blunt, was skinny. As a kid, with my blonde hair and blue eyes, I grew up hearing that I looked like a doll, and I spent my whole life feeling like I was supposed to look the part. That meant being a size double zero, having visible abs, and making sure my hair, makeup, and nails were always done. </p>



<p>I should mention that I was a ballerina growing up, with the plan to go pro (I lost out to a career-ending injury at 16). Anyone who’s ever done ballet will know that many studios are breeding grounds for body image issues. Clad in light pink leotards and tights, dancers almost invariably hear “I can see your lunch,” (as in…they can see your stomach) more times than they hear “great work” before the age of 13.</p>



<p>Historically, women are trained to think that getting in shape means losing weight — and losing weight means more cardio and less food. For so long, that was <em>my</em> mindset, too. I used to frequent HIIT classes, which are optimized for higher heart rates and dropping pounds. But two of my trainers over the years — Taylor Rae Roman and Madison Feeney — both of whom I now consider friends, reshaped my thinking. Through them, I learned to prioritize strong over skinny.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941605.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ll confess: When I first set out to build muscle, I was terrified. As a dancer, creator, and public figure, I’ve always been hyper-aware of what my body looked and felt like. I thought: <em>What if I look in the mirror and don’t recognize myself? </em>I already know that there will be times I pick myself apart — pinching parts of me, second-guessing, and worrying what other people think. Those are habits you don’t unlearn in a day.</p>



<p>But the motivation to do this is for myself — not for other people. And it’s not easy, but if I’ve learned anything on this journey, it’s that <em>everything</em> worth doing is hard. Already, I’m seeing a difference. Just this morning, I noticed that my body looked a little bigger. But I also noticed something more important, more exciting: the voice inside my head that shouted out my wins drowned out the voice that whispered my fears. I picked up a 45-pound weight instead of a 40-pound one. I climbed the five flights of stairs to my apartment without feeling out of breath. I felt hungry for every meal, because, finally, I’m supporting my body with nutrients in a way that actually makes my metabolism go faster. It all feels so rewarding and encouraging, because it’s how your body is<em> supposed</em> to operate. To the untrained eye, these changes are too subtle to notice, but they’re a big deal to me.</p>



<p>You know the saying, “You have to love yourself before someone else can love you”? I really used to think it was BS. But I must say: I’m not sure it’s a coincidence that the first time I started to love myself — six-ish months into my healing journey — is also when my boyfriend and I started dating. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this is the healthiest, happiest relationship I’ve ever known. Every single thing that’s good in your life comes from loving yourself. If you take care of yourself, you can feel strong, powerful. Beautiful. Lovable.</p>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, you must be wondering where I’ve ended up. To answer your question: I’m still in it. Because despite society convincing us that there’s a “before” and “after” for every journey, the truth is: It’s never really over. But I have settled on my destination. After all this soul searching, this healing, I feel like it’s my duty to share this message with other women who are going through the same things. I know how many of them are 30 minutes into their excruciating spin classes, thinking, <em>If I’m just one inch smaller, maybe someone will love me</em>. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to outsource your identity and self-respect to the opinions of others. It sucks. So if I can help even one person change that mindset, or even pursue a goal of being stronger and healthier for <em>themselves</em>, and no one else…then I’d go through all the pain again, so we could find ourselves here, together, now. It would all be worth it.</p>

The trio is sitting side by side (by side) in New York City during the movie’s press junket and their easy rapport and deadpan comedic timing is as pitch perfect offscreen as it is on the big screen. </p>

The timing of the release has made for some <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQF0cdDgfRX/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hilarious memes</a> as the internet continues to revel in the absurdity and fantasy of the real-life Louvre heist. In a time when <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/us-unemployment-rate-near-4-year-high-labor-market-hits-stall-speed-2025-09-05/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">unemployment is on the rise</a> and the rich are running amok and wreaking havoc on the poor — and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/us-supreme-court-trump-snap-food-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">social services in place to support them</a> — who doesn’t love the idea of rogue rascals sticking it to a bougie institution by running off with its crown jewels? That’s exactly what you see, and get, with <em>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. </em></p>



<p>Fittingly, the movie’s big bad villain is a white South African named Veronika Vanderberg (played by Pike who is having the time of her life as the delightfully devilish foe) and it’s full of the escapist eat-the-rich energy that seems to be permeating the zeitgeist now more than ever (recession indicator). Plus, the movie is about as anti-capitalist and anti-billionaire as a popcorn flick about magicians can be. </p>



<p>“Everyone needs a little bit of magic right now,” Fisher says when I ask about the film’s anarchist spirit. She’s right. This instalment is just as silly and entertaining as the previous two (with another twist you won’t see coming), which is exactly the vibe it feels like audiences are craving. And these three women from different generations who occupy three very different spaces in Hollywood — the Gen Z rising star (Greenblatt), the comedy queen primed for a comeback (Fisher), and the Oscar-nominated powerhouse (Pike) — are the perfect trio to pull off the impossible: sprinkling a little joy onto our timelines. </p>



<p>Here, along with gushing over Greenblatt, the stars talk about bonding with the stacked cast, the illusion of Hollywood, and decide which pop stars would make the best magicians. </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Isla, you are returning to this franchise after a decade while Rosamund and Ariana are new to it. How did you welcome the new cast to this world and did you give them any advice? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Isla Fisher: </strong>At the beginning, it was quite interesting. There was a bit of a divide. There were the old horsemen and we would go to set on time, no offense. Oh, we’d stand on our marks waiting, and we’d wait for the new ponies to show up, and they would be very suspicious of us and use words like “rizz” and “slay,” which we didn’t understand [<em>laughs</em>]. Then, finally, I think it was the time that actually <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/morganfreeman/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Freeman</a> showed up on set that we were able to join together, and then we became the best of friends. All of us get on so well and it suddenly went from being two organisms to one loving family.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist…. Who is this magical unicorn that exists?</p><cite>isla fisher on ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund Pike: </strong>That’s the first day I showed up on set and I didn’t know [what to expect]. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I knew, and have always been a massive fan of [Rosamund’s] so I was so excited that she was joining us, because obviously she’s the most brilliant actor. I felt very comfortable right away with her. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana Greenblatt:</strong> Justice [Smith] and I were so excited the day [Rosamund] showed up. So excited [and] so nervous. It was the queen arriving. Justice and I have this ongoing competition for your love that you don’t know about. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Well, you came to my play so you’re winning.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I supported her when I was in London, and it was the best thing ever. But yeah, I feel like Dominic [Sessa], Justice, and I were equally nervous to join this already existing family. And they really welcomed us with open arms. And it was a quick bond. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942505.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Rosamund Pike as Veronika in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. Photo Credit: Katalin Vermes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund, your character Veronika Vanderberg is such a good villain. You’re very good at playing characters we love to hate like in <em>I Care A Lot </em></strong><strong>and<em> Gone Girl,</em></strong><strong> for example. What is it about those roles that you are drawn to? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP</strong>: I hesitated to do this because I thought, <em>maybe nobody needs to see me do that again</em>. And then I realized it wasn’t exactly again, because Veronica is different. I mean, basically because she’s got a different accent, which is good enough for me [<em>laughs</em>]. Once I decided that she could sound different, I thought,<em> yeah, I’m going to do this</em>. Ruben [Fleischer], our director, promised that I would have a great time on this film and people say that, but he was absolutely right. We had a great time. I was sad to leave it behind. These guys need a good adversary, don’t they? And with Veronica, I was interested in whipping her character into a shape where she was having fun, and then I hoped that an audience would have fun watching her demise, because the more arrogant she can be, and the more pleasure she’s taking in herself for the longest time, then the greater the glee when you know she falls apart if she does. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana, your character June has this great, dry, dark sense of humor. She’s really smart but constantly underestimated because of her size and she’s a young girl. Why do you think teen girls are consistently underestimated and what did you enjoy about getting to explore that? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>. June is the definition of underestimated. She doesn’t flaunt what she can do, and she doesn’t really have to prove anything loudly to people. She just kind of lets it speak for herself when needed. And I think that was the most fun for me with June. When the time comes and when there’s danger ahead, she’s good. She doesn’t need anybody else. That was really fun.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>.</p><cite>ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And she did a lot of stunts. I’m just gonna, like, blow her up for a minute. [Ariana] is the most precise stunt person.<em> [Ariana laughs]. </em>You don’t laugh at this! This is genuine. What she can physically do — her prowess in the fight sequences that she does in this movie were amazing. I’ve seen her do it in other films, but seeing you do it on set, and watching you, particularly when you climb the wall and just you’re deeply athletic, which is, of course, impressive, but it translates into her stunts being another level. It was so cool to watch. You could be like Tomb Raider! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> It’s precision and power and accuracy. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah! And it’s control. It’s also bravery. You have to silence that inner voice to really perform it. And she does it perfectly.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Thank you. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong> And you look cool doing it, whereas I think I can do stuff like that but when I do it, I just don’t look cool. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah, it’s a wedgie for mom, it doesn’t go well for us. It’s just bingo wings and wedgies [<em>laughs</em>]. No one wants that.</p>



<p><strong>AG:  </strong>Thank you. I appreciate it. </p>

<p><strong>Isla and Rosamund, listening to you talk and hype up Ariana, I want to know if there’s something you wish you knew at Ariana’s age that you would go back and tell your younger selves?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Everything. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Everything. But she already knows it. And I knew that about her before I even met her, because I have daughters. And they would give me Ariana quotes and I’d say, “Who said that?” And they’re like “Mommy, the actress from Barbie. She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist.” And I was like, “Who is this magical unicorn that exists?” Back in our day, we used to talk about which boys liked us, and it was just so brilliant to meet her and have the wealth of her very unique perspective. She’s such an original thinker. She lives her life authentically. I’m sorry, this has turned into a talk show about you<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I didn’t have any of that sort of smarts or eloquence or ideas that were beyond my knowledge. I feel like Arianna is such a much more global citizen than I was at that age. Here we are in New York and I remember the first time I came to New York. I just didn’t know what to do with the city or how to be in this city. You’re so well traveled. And I just remember looking at a bowl of berries, which didn’t even exist in London, and thinking, “America!”</p>



<p><strong>Ariana, what does it mean to you to hear these two talk about you like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> It’s amazing. It’s so validating, especially from women like these two, and they’re so talented and they’re so intelligent, and I just love being in their presence and being able to work with them. I kind of just soaked up everything and more. It’s incredible. I feel like I never know what I’m saying or doing at all. So from an outsider’s perspective, knowing that I could be on the right path or that I’m doing something correct is really, really nice. I tend to be an overthinker, so it’s nice to be validated by people I would dream to be validated by. </p>



<p><strong><em>Now You See Me </em></strong><strong>is all about illusion, nothing is as it seems. You could say the same about Hollywood. Was there something in this industry that maybe isn’t as it appears from the outside looking in that surprised you to find out once you were in it? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Yeah, men take way longer in makeup than women! </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And then they act like they’re really alpha, but they’ve got mascara on. It’s like, honey, I would listen to your opinion, but you have a foundation line that ends at your chin. </p>



<p><strong>AG</strong>:<em> [laughs] </em>Absolutely! They need their snacks and their massages. And it’s like we’re wearing a corset. For me, obviously, [you’re shooting] for months, so there’s the time of the month when you’re a woman and you have heels on and a corset and you just have to live life like that’s normal. And I just remember being like<em> Ow, it hurts.</em> And no one understood, except my fellow girls. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> We get it. We get it! I feel like the biggest surprise for me was the red carpet piece being so corporate. I always thought it was a moment to express yourself and just wear something that you like, but it’s a lot. It’s a business. It’s more of a business than maybe it appears from the outside.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>For me, what was shocking was how many like stories that I’ve heard about how people mistreat other people, like they think that they are better than everyone else that’s making them who they are. I’ve been getting my hair and makeup done and I hear stories. It’s not in my nature to even think that that’s acceptable or okay. But the people that seem super gracious, unfortunately they mistreat people.</p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Are you looking at me? [<em>laughs</em>] Where’s my coffee! </p>

<p><strong>OK, we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions. Who’s most likely to pull off a heist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Rosamund, obviously!</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Ariana.</p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> The duo! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I’ll tell you how to do it and she’ll execute. </p>



<p><strong>Which one of you is driving the getaway car?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Isla’s driving the getaway car.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Isla, you’ve got the car. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Correct.<strong> </strong>I’m very good with a minivan. I know, it’s sexy. </p>



<p><strong>If you could have any magic ability, which one would you pick?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Getting my kids to eat vegetables! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Oh god, invisibility.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Yes! </p>



<p><strong>Which pop star would make the best magician? </strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Dua Lipa because she sings that song “Levitating.”</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Eminem.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I was gonna say Charlie XCX. Or Billie [Eilish], because she’s a siren so she’ll lure your brain like Merritt [McKinney, played by Woody Harrelson]. She’ll do some mentalism. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>That’s four horsemen right there. </p>



<p><strong>That’s a good lineup. The Louvre heist was pulled off in seven minutes. What could you pull off in seven  minutes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>I couldn’t even get out of bed in seven minutes.</p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> You know what’s weird about this? I do a seven- minute workout. There’s this thing that you can Google, and it’s called a seven-minute workout. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I told you you have the legs of a teenager. </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Nothing’s getting done in seven minutes. </p>



<p><strong>Which star sign would make the best horsemen illusionist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Scorpio! Cunning, manipulative. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Gemini, because don’t you have to be like two different people?</p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Yeah, Gemini. </p>



<p><strong>What’s something that you would rant about for 29 seconds? What’s the thing you want to go off on?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Okay, I’m ranting about those little foil things that you get at the end of a tube of toothpaste when you really need to brush your teeth and you need to be really fast, and then you get the cap off, and there’s one of those funny foil things, and you’ve got to get your nail under it. Those things really piss me off. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I’m going to go with parent chat groups. I’m on one right now that’s done my head in. If somebody just writes, “Thanks,” your phone just vibrates for hours and hours. You don’t need to thank anyone. Just stop texting. And then when you ask something real, like, <em>“What day is book week?”</em> and <em>“Is it like pajama day?”</em> it’s silence, crickets. You can’t get anyone on there. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> And we should never say thanks to an AI either. It’s apparently using up loads and loads of energy just to say thanks to people. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Or using it in general. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Being polite costs masses and masses of wattage. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> I thought if you weren’t polite, then when [AI] comes to take over us, they’ll just pick all the rude ones first.</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong><em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I want to rant about mean people on the internet and in real life. You’re not better than anybody. Seriously, like, learn some manners. I can’t stand it. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> This is what we’re talking about. I’m talking about the silver foil at the end of a toothpaste and she’s talking about something global and relevant. I’m utterly selfish. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>You’ve just highlighted the generational difference<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>There’s so much hatred. It’s so useless, it’s so annoying. It’s so much easier to just be chill. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Take the silver thing off the toothpaste! </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> And don’t say thank you to AI! And AI actresses don’t exist! </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">newest adaptation</a> of Mary Shelley’s timeless novel <em>Frankenstein</em> has captivated audiences, with director Guillermo del Toro’s film being praised for being mostly faithful to the source material. Starring Australia’s own Jacob Elordi as The Creature and Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, somehow it’s Mia Goth, as Elizabeth Lavenza, who steals the show — adorned by Tiffany &amp; Co. jewels and 19th Century gowns. Her extensive wardrobe for <em>Frankenstein</em> came from the mind of Emmy Award-nominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/materialists-dakota-johnson-outfits-costumes"">costume designer</a> Kate Hawley, who has worked on projects such as <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> and <em>Crimson Peak</em>. Goth’s character Elizabeth has an interest in entomology and botany, so Hawley included nods to beetles and other insects through patterns and garment shapes. Along with wasp-waisted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-style-corsets"">tight corsets</a>, certain fabrics were also chosen to mimic paper-thin beetle wings.</p>



<p>“With the green dress… that design was inspired by butterflies, and the patterns on butterfly wings,” Goth tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em>. “[This] was something that Guillermo and Kate were exploring a lot with Elizabeth and [with] all of the costumes, everything was thought through.” To create unique insect-like patterns, Hawley studied both cellular structures and the anatomy of beetles. “It’s all about echoing those insect and beetle-like qualities, just fitted to the period,” Hawley says in the production notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941847.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>Jewellery was also key to defining Goth’s character, with her blue outfit featuring a Tiffany &amp; Co. signature piece from the early 1900s. The Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace is made up of blue glass beetle motifs in a gold setting. “We wanted to pull pieces that were from the age of Mary Shelley so that you could study the choices our designers were making at that time,” Christopher Young, Vice President and Creative Director of Tiffany Patrimony and Global Creative Visual Merchandising, said in a <a href=""https://www.tiffany.com/world-of-tiffany/collaborations/netflix-frankenstein.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">press video</a>. The result is what jewellers describe as blurring the line “between jewellery and art”.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941846.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>One of Elizabeth’s most striking dresses is her final look, a white dress where white satin ribbons wrap around her arms. Made to resemble surgical bandages, it pays homage to both Elizabeth’s fate and The Creature’s origin. “That was deliberate,” Goth says. “That was there to mimic The Creature and his band aids that he has when he’s first born.” This white dress also features multiple layers of fabric that capture the light in an interesting way, a design element thought through by both the costume designer and director. “Guillermo wanted Elizabeth to be very ethereal, and there’s an iridescence and ephemeral nature to some of those colours and fabrics that helped us [portray this],” Hawley notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941845.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also a religious nod in many of Elizabeth’s outfits, particularly seen through the use of bonnets. “Religious language is a big part of Elizabeth’s character, and that bonnet is like a halo,” Hawley explains. “Mia has such an amazing, mercurial face  — one of the first fittings we had, we put that bonnet on her, and we put the yellow veil over her, and she just became this other creature.” While Goth jokingly tells <em>R29 </em>she couldn’t breathe in her restrictive wardrobe, stepping into the period pieces helped frame her performance as Elizabeth. “That was helpful, because that’s exactly how a woman in the Victorian world would feel, and it formed how I moved and how I sat,” Goth says. “I felt once I started to see where the costumes were headed, I found my character, Elizabeth, kind of from the outside in this time around. </p>



<p>“So, [by] seeing what they were doing with her on the outside, I was then able to kind of figure out what was going on in the inside.” </p>

Uruguayan sisters Lucía and Florencia Ottonello founded their <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/pastiche_sisterproject/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">slow-fashion brand Pastiche</a> in Montevideo in 2016. Nine years later, the brand’s cozy knits, structured denim, and breezy linen pieces are now available in the U.S. Last week, <a href=""https://pastichesisterproject.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pastiche launched its U.S. website</a>, making its playful, ethically made designs accessible to new shoppers. And with a collection of warm textures and artful silhouettes, the expansion comes just in time for our fall and winter seasons.<br /><br />“We’re vintage-inspired but still modern. We are most interested in classic looks,” Florencia told Refinery29 Somos of Pastiche's designs. “You’ll want to keep our pieces and pass them down. They’re not items to be discarded.” <br /><br />Pastiche’s commitment to slow, ethical production means every item is designed and crafted in Uruguay, often working with Uruguayan, Argentine, and Brazilian suppliers as well as local artisans. This approach not only preserves South American techniques and styles, but it also ensures fair wages, sustainable practices, and clothing that’s built to last — all increasingly meaningful choices for conscious consumers.<br /><br />“We’re just looking forward to growing thoughtfully. We don't need stores everywhere, we just want to make clothes that people feel good in, pay our folks well, and spend time with our families,” Florencia said.<br /><br />To celebrate the launch, we selected some of our favorite Pastiche pieces that are perfect for the cooler months, so that you can layer responsibly, mix textures, and invest in timeless, versatile pieces that will carry you through many more falls and winters.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>Yet another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">cool-girl fashion collaboration</a> has entered the chat. This time, model Alexa Chung is celebrating her <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">long-standing relationship with Madewell</a> — 15 years after their first collaboration — with a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">holiday collection</a> that pays homage to the East Village <em>and</em> East London.<br /><br />“We’ve been on a journey together, me and Madewell,” Chung tells Refinery29. “I’ve always made an effort to make things super personal, but this is definitely the most personal collection that we’ve collaborated on. It’s very vintage inspired and it’s also quite musically led, so it’s really specific to my tastes. I am thrilled with it.”<br /><br />From tried-and-true winter styles like oversized sweaters, crochet scarves, lacy slip dresses, and herringbone dress coats, to more <em>unexpected</em> styles like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/soccer-jersey-outfit-ideas-women"">football jerseys</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/white-jeans-styling-outfit-ideas"">white jeans</a>, and “We’re Witches Bitches” graphic tees, the collaboration perfectly reflects Chung’s “eclectic, specific, and cool” aesthetic.<br /><br />The nostalgic and romantic 31-piece collection also spans distressed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11495317/madewell-plus-size-denim-review"">Madewell jeans</a> and leather skirts and jackets, as well as giftable accessories like crew socks, hooded scarves, and floral brooches. Chung specifically recommends gifting one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-statement-belts-women"">statement belts</a> for the holidays. “I love <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY939/?ccode=EX0001"">this belt</a> because it can cinch your waist over a dress, slung low with baggy jeans, or wear it over loads of coats. I love the idea of jewelry over outerwear, so I’d probably get someone one of the belts.”</p>

<p>And in terms of her winter wardrobe staple, Chung highlights the <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY883/?ccode=WR2252"">collection’s peacoat</a>. “The navy blue coat is my non-negotiable winter coat. It’s genuinely warm. It’s a classic silhouette. It’s a bit oversized, it’s quite boxy, but you can fit your sweater underneath. It just makes you feel quite handsome and powerful when you put it on,” she explains.<br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for $24 brooches to gift to your fashion-loving friends or a $598 leather jacket to treat yourself, every piece will help you channel It-girl Chung’s signature style… and perhaps even Meg Ryan’s? The model says that if any fictional character would wear this nostalgic collection, it would be one of Ryan’s rom-com characters from ‘90s-era movies like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>, and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>.<br /><br />What more could we want from a cozy-season collection? We’ll have what Alexa’s having!</p>

Winter is long, and having cuddles on tap sounds quite nice. Hence <a href=""https://bumble.com/the-buzz/what-is-cuffing-season"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cuffing season</a>: the period when people “cuff” another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friends-to-lovers-stories"">into a relationship</a> for the colder months. Sometimes we cuff or get cuffed consciously, other times less so — you may be cuffed and not realize the other person’s intentions. Either way, something about this time of year makes us want to shack up and be cozy with someone else.<br /><br />This feels like a lot of work, to find someone now and put in the effort for a relationship that will probably end with the change in seasons. Some research has put it down to a desire to avoid feeling lonely — as many as <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datingcom-found-that-online-activity-hits-peak-season-during-cold-winter-months-300926222.html"">60% of people</a> turn to dating apps in winter for this reason. Where summer can be socially full-on and active, the prospect of an emptier calendar during winter might make swiping for dates more attractive. <br /><br />Like all relationships, some end horribly, others are over as quickly as they began and some manage to go the distance, like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Ahead, Refinery29 spoke to five women about their own cuffing season relationships — how they went, how they ended (or didn’t), and how they felt about it. <figure><figcaption><strong>Lila, 26, New York</strong><br /><br />I entered into a cuffing season relationship three to four months after breaking up with my boyfriend of two years. We talked for half of September, started seeing each other at the end of September, and went on dates until the end of November. We were intimate and I really liked the guy, although I thought things were too good to be true. <br /><br />I eventually went to look him up on social media at the end of October and saw he was anti-immigration, slightly MAGA and very incel-leaning (at least his Twitter likes were). I had made my politics very clear. I am very liberal and was actively outspoken at the time about Palestine and leftist ideals. It was so weird to see [his online activity] and I showed a bunch of my friends to make sure I wasn't crazy. <br /><br />Before I got to break up with him, he reached out and said he just wanted to be friends. He contacts me every so often with memes about my profession, and now he has become my seafood hookup (he works at a seafood market and whenever I want expensive seafood like scallops and oysters for free, I text him and he brings it to me. Nothing sexual there, he just hooks me up with free seafood!). Honestly, he was a rebound who should have never happened. I deleted the apps soon after that because I centered my interests towards engaging in my weekly therapy sessions.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Tiphani, 35, Mississippi</strong><br /><br />My last cuffing season relationship was hot and heavy. It started at the beginning of January and ended in February. We got snowed in together and he made an effort to Uber or Lyft back to my house if he had to go into work. He would cook every day. And we would lie around and watch movies and talk until bedtime. I didn’t think it was going to be temporary. I thought we were on the same page.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the snow melted, the relationship also became a puddle. I tried to keep it going but the communication became almost nonexistent and I just had to block him, move on, and let it go. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Olivia, 28, London</strong><br /><br />I dated someone for four months who categorically did not fancy me. I don't think I really fancied him either. We met in September and in January he dumped me over text as soon as my plane landed back from Christmas break. New year, new him, I guess. I think I knew deep down there wasn't attraction — we barely connected physically and I told myself he was just shy and my self-esteem was low. It was low, but going out with someone who isn't attracted to you will do that. <br /><br />I realize now this was the end result of a ""year of dating"" I put myself through. I pressured myself to put in more time and effort and go on more dates, and by September I was exhausted and the nights were drawing in. So the first person who consistently asked me out on dates (and was not cheating on someone with me, or another such horror story), I just leapt at. We did all the seasonal winter stuff as he'd just moved to London, but I wish I'd spent more time doing that with my friends. I realized that a year on dating apps had set my bar so low that someone consistently asking me on the next date had become incredibly impressive. <br /><br />This season I feel just as burned out by dating if I am honest, but I realize going out with someone who doesn't like me is not the answer to that. I've joined a stand-up comedy course instead. <br /><br />Last week my friend informed me she ""doesn't date from October to April, it's just too cold"" and honestly? I might join her. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Kerry, 47, Melbourne </strong><br /><br />My cuffing season story goes back 10 years. We met doing a casual security stint at a comedy festival. Our relationship ended up lasting for a couple of years, on and off. Sometimes I'd get random calls saying, ""Guess who this is?"" after a break.<br /><br />He'd tell me I was very beautiful but that I was too old for him, especially in his Indian culture where this was frowned upon. I'm unsure if that was to placate me but he did find me attractive. We'd hook up at my place. Once it even happened at a work site!<br /><br />I got into this relationship knowing it was temporary. I wasn't fussed at all. We both knew that. Long term would have been too complicated. And that casualness wouldn’t work on me these days. My standards are much higher! The casualness worked at the time. Also, at the time it gave me confidence and boosted my self-esteem. Much later down the line though, when we were both married, he gave me a call. This annoyed me; it was as if he was expecting me to be alone, and I thought it a betrayal of his wife. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Shriya, 25, Virginia</strong><br /><br />I ended up getting in a cuffing season relationship two years ago with someone who turned out to be the love of my life and we're planning on being engaged soon. It was my most successful cuffing season of all time!<br /><br />We originally met in undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh. His best friend and I were friends so we crossed paths but we never had any conversations or expressed interest in each other. A couple years went by and we graduated. During the pandemic, a large group of our friends would finish work together on Zoom every night (about 30 people) and we joined in. He and I started talking on the side. We had a <em>really</em> long talking phase for months during cuffing season where neither of us said anything or even made the first move but you could tell we were clearly interested in seeing where it went. We just didn't know if we were going to see each other since he was in Kansas and I was in Virginia, so no one attached any hopes to the situation. Even when he asked me on our first date, he said, ""Hey, I'm coming to DC to see a couple friends, would you like to meet up?"" and I had to ask if it was a date to clarify. But once we went on the first date, it was game over. We've been together ever since.<br /><br />Everyone says when you know, you know, and it's very true. He asked to meet my parents the weekend of our first date, and a few weeks later he asked me to meet his. I think it was easier for us to jump in because our talking phase was so long that we had a chance to really know each other and vet the person first before jumping into a physical date.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings… we thought we were coasting to the finish line of 2025, but baby, the cosmos said, “Not so fast.” This week kicks off with a <em>mind maze</em> of epic proportions as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">on November</a> 9 at 2:02 p.m. EST, and it’s happening in none other than Sagittarius — the sign of bold opinions, big dreams, and spontaneous “let’s go to Bali” texts. <br /><br />But under Mercury retrograde? Yeah… your GPS might glitch halfway through the journey. Sag energy loves to think big picture, but Mercury is trying to zoom in and say, “Wait, did you really mean that? Or were you just avoiding the details?” This is the kind of transit that makes you question your own hot takes. So if you suddenly backpedal on that workshop you were going to launch or rethink that long-distance situationship you were convinced was <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moon-phases-meaning-astrology"">soulmate-level</a> last week, you’re not flaky… you’re realigning. </p>



<p>The upside? Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius helps us relearn how to tell the truth, not the curated one, but the gut-level, soul-naked kind. You might revise that book pitch, backtrack on those travel plans, or finally admit that your “freedom” narrative was really a fear of intimacy in disguise. Don’t rush. Let yourself unlearn what you thought was the truth. Just double-check your emails, avoid signing contracts unless necessary, and be open to divine redirections. A closed door is a cosmic yes in another language. <br /><br />Then comes a major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">energetic shift on 11/11</a>, a sacred astro-numerological portal, and this year it hits different because Jupiter, planet of expansion, luck, and vision, begins its retrograde journey in Cancer at 11:41 a.m. EST. This is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter’s first retrograde in Cancer</a> in over a decade, and it’s pulling our energy inward, homeward, and backward. Think: ancestral roots, childhood patterns, and that “do I even want to live here anymore?” conversation that keeps circling your brain. The answers come slowly, but they’re sacred. You might be called to downsize, simplify, or renovate — not just your space, but your lifestyle. Maybe you thought you wanted a bigger house, but now you crave a cozier, quieter one. Maybe you thought you wanted to raise kids in the city, but now you’re craving ocean air and moonlight. This isn’t about contraction. It’s about rooted expansion. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer reminds us that the dream isn’t real if you can’t rest in it. </p>



<p>On November 12, the Last Quarter Moon in Leo flares up the tension between your public self and your private desires. This is a shedding moon — one that asks: <em>Is the persona you’re performing still aligned with who you’re becoming?</em> Leo moons can make us crave attention, validation, and applause, but this one’s got a little edge to it. You might feel hyper-aware of who’s watching, liking, or not responding at all. But instead of spiraling, try this: let it go. Use this quarter moon to release the pressure to be seen and instead commit to <em>seeing yourself</em>. The right people will always feel you. And the rest? Dust. </p>



<p>The week wraps with the Virgo Moon taking over from November 13 to 15, bringing a calming wave of discernment; not the perfectionist kind, but the cleansing, clarifying kind. This is the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">get your life together</a>” moon, but with softness. There are only six weeks left in 2025. This moon isn’t here to shame you for what you didn’t get done… it’s here to help you see what’s still worth doing. Let it highlight what’s still alive in your spirit. Where are you still passionate? Where are you tired for no reason? With Mercury retrograde ruling Virgo from fiery Sagittarius, this is your reminder that just because something once excited you doesn’t mean it still fits your values now. This week is a reclamation.

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, buckle up because Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius (starting November 9) is throwing some fire back in your direction… but not the type you can just power through. This retrograde hits your sector of expansion, travel, and publishing, so if you’ve got big plans, launches, interviews, or even far-off journeys on deck, double- and triple-check the logistics. You might feel misunderstood or even dragged online for something you said with the best of intentions — but instead of spiraling into defensiveness, use this time to ask yourself: <em>What do I actually believe, and is it still true for the version of me I’m becoming?</em> You’re not meant to shrink; you’re meant to refine. Editing your message, rethinking your audience, and getting clear about your voice doesn’t make you a sellout — it makes you someone with staying power. Think: slow down to go global. <br /><br />And then comes the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 portal</a>, where Jupiter begins retrograding in Cancer, your sector of home, family, and emotional roots. <em>Whew</em>. That one might hit a little deeper than you expected. Whether it’s your literal home or your internal sense of safety, this retrograde is asking you to pause and reflect. Do you still want to live where you are? Are you ready to build something new — or rebuild something old, but on your terms this time? Some Aries might suddenly crave a simpler life, downsizing their lifestyle or revisiting childhood patterns that shaped how they seek comfort. Others might feel pulled to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/november-tarotscopes-messages-ancestors"">connect with their ancestors</a>, mend family dynamics, or even reimagine what “home” means — especially if the old definition was wrapped in performance or pressure. You don’t have to fix it all right now. But <em>feel it</em>. Jupiter’s reminding you that true growth starts at the root. </p>



<p>By the time the Virgo Moon arrives (November 13 to 15), your spirit’s like, <em>okay, enough existential spiraling</em>, let’s get back in the body. This earthy moon moves through your health and wellness sector, giving you a stabilizing moment in an otherwise reflective week. The good news? This moon doesn’t want you to perfect anything — it just wants you to notice. Notice where you’ve been neglecting routines that actually help you feel more alive. Notice the little habits that need tweaking. And more than anything, notice what your body has been trying to tell you, especially as your mind has been zooming into big-picture questions all week. This is your mid-month grounding ritual. Drink the tea. Stretch your back. Cancel the plan you didn’t want to go to anyway. You’re allowed to rest even in the middle of the chaos. Especially then. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury’s retrograde in Sagittarius</a> beginning November 9 might stir up more than just philosophical questions — it’s nudging you into the shadows of your own psyche, your intimacy sector, where power, vulnerability, and shared resources live. And yeah… it could get a little messy. Old debts (emotional or financial) might resurface. Someone you thought you were “done” with might pop back in with a question or an apology. Or maybe it’s you who’s suddenly feeling called to unpack past decisions — especially the ones you’ve quietly judged yourself for. <br /><br />This retrograde isn’t about punishment, it’s about integration. What part of you have you been hiding out of fear of rejection or loss? You’re being invited to reclaim it. Reclaim your power, even if that means fumbling your way through some uncomfortable convos or realizations. Growth rarely comes wrapped in silk — sometimes it shows up with receipts and a mirror. </p>



<p>Then, on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, activating your communication and mindset zone — and that’s a big cosmic green light to slow your roll and listen more deeply. This isn’t about talking less, it’s about being more intentional with your voice. If you’re writing something big, launching something, or trying to have heart-to-hearts, give yourself space to revise, reword, or even re-feel what you’re trying to express. Childhood memories or old stories about your intelligence or communication style might resurface — not to haunt you, but to be rewritten with compassion. Are you speaking your truth… or the truth you think others expect from you? This is a powerful time to reconnect with your inner narrator and ask: <em>Is this the story I want to keep telling about myself?</em> If not, 11/11 is a beautiful portal for rewriting it. </p>



<p>By the time the Moon lands in Virgo from November 13 to 15, your creativity and joy sector becomes the stage for a mid-month emotional check-in. This isn’t about productivity — it’s about pleasure with purpose. Have you forgotten what makes you laugh? What makes you play? If you’ve been stuck in a loop of “doing the work,” this Moon invites you to remember why you’re doing it at all. Maybe it’s time to reconnect with your inner child, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/creativity-art-therapy-classes"">tend to a creative project</a> that’s been whispering your name. Maybe you just need to dance around your room with your phone on airplane mode. </p>



<p>Whatever it is, don’t wait for permission to delight in being alive again. You’ve been deep in the waters all week — now let this Virgo Moon offer you earth to stand on, and joy to reach for. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, let’s be real: Mercury’s retrograde starting November 9 is going to hit different, because it’s happening in your relationship sector (in the sign of Sagittarius), and Mercury’s <em>your</em> ruling planet. So yeah, you’re gonna feel it. Expect some double-texting energy, some “Wait… what did they <em>really</em> mean by that?” vibes, and maybe a ghost or two reappearing just when you thought you were emotionally vaccinated. This isn’t about drama for the sake of drama, though. It’s about clarity. If you’ve been unclear about what you want in love, business partnerships, or even creative collaborations, this retrograde could shake the dust off that indecision. Misunderstandings may happen, but they’re revealing what needs to be refined. And hey, if an ex pops up and you’re tempted? Ask yourself: Is this curiosity, closure, or an escape from what’s actually available to you right now? <br /><br />Then there’s 11/11 — a major portal, and the same day Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, which lights up your money and self-worth sector. This is deep. Like, ancestral beliefs about abundance deep. You might find yourself revisiting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/starting-investing-real-stories"">decisions around savings, investing</a>, or even the ways you’ve been undervaluing yourself in business or relationships. If you’ve been hustling for approval or centering others’ needs out of fear of rejection, this week will lovingly (or not so lovingly) ask you to stop. You are not a backup dancer in your own life. Jupiter here says: <em>take up more space — but the retrograde says, first, check where you’ve been shrinking</em>. Maybe it’s time to raise your rates. Maybe it’s time to cut off a draining energetic tie that’s been taking more than it gives. Either way, your value isn’t negotiable, even if your pricing strategy is. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your home and emotional roots sector, and it’s basically a cosmic reminder to stop skipping the warm-up. You don’t have to be “on” all the time, Gem. You don’t even have to be figuring things out. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-look-happier-trend-embracing-messiness"">You’re allowed to simply be: messy</a>, soft, still. Clean your space if that helps you breathe easier. Make your bed like it’s an act of devotion. Call someone who reminds you of who you were before the world told you to hurry. This isn’t a weekend to impress; it’s a weekend to nourish. Let the Virgo Moon guide you back to rituals that restore your nervous system and ground your ideas. The clarity you’re craving isn’t out there — it’s in the quiet corners you’ve been too busy to visit. Go home to yourself. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Mercury retrograde begins in your wellness, work, and routines sector on November 9, and let’s be real — if your body’s been whispering (or screaming) for rest, this is your sign to listen. This transit is like a cosmic timeout, forcing you to re-evaluate what “productivity” even means to you. Maybe you’ve been running on autopilot, saying yes out of guilt or fear instead of alignment. Maybe you’re craving a slower, softer pace but worried that if you stop, everything will collapse. Spoiler: it won’t. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius</a> is clumsy and chaotic, yes… but also philosophical. It invites you to pull back from the grind and ask: What’s the point of all this effort if your joy and peace aren’t part of the equation? <br /><br />Then comes a cosmic curveball and blessing wrapped in one: Jupiter begins its retrograde in your sign on 11/11, and Cancer, this is <em>big</em>. You’ve been expanding so much this year, maybe even faster than your inner world could keep up with. This retrograde is here to help you integrate. To help you reclaim what you’ve given away in the name of growth, people-pleasing, or perfection. You might revisit decisions you made earlier this year with fresh eyes, and this time, you’ll choose differently. You may downsize, cancel a major plan, or close a door that once felt full of promise — not because you’ve failed, but because you’ve evolved. Think of this as a soul homecoming: a re-rooting. And with your planetary ruler, the Moon, lighting up your sector of self-worth during the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus Full Moon</a> just days ago, your standards have risen — including the standards you hold for <em>yourself</em>. </p>



<p>As the Virgo Moon arrives November 13 to 15, things get even more introspective, but in the best, most clarifying way. This lunation activates your communication and learning sector, so consider it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-say-no-to-friends"">your permission slip to say no</a>, mute the noise, and re-curate your reality. Read something that expands your mind. Journal without editing. Take a walk without your phone and let your own thoughts be the soundtrack. Even if retrograde chaos swirls around you, you’re building something quieter and more grounded inside. </p>



<p>Something sacred. The second half of the week is like a mid-month recalibration: Where do you need to simplify? What ideas need breathing room? Virgo wants you to declutter your mind, and Cancer, that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">starts with choosing peace</a> over performance. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Mercury starts its final retrograde of the year on November 9 in your creativity, joy, and romance sector, and let’s just say, things might get <em>messy-hot</em> or <em>hot-messy</em> real quick. You might reconnect with a past lover (or crush), find yourself rewriting an old creative idea, or even second-guessing the ways you express your joy. Retrogrades aren’t meant to stall you, they’re meant to rewire you, so if your flirt game feels off or your passion projects aren’t clicking, don’t force it. Play. Revisit your old journals, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inner-child-healing"">revisit your inner child</a>. This retrograde wants to remind you that your creativity doesn’t have to be profitable, and your love doesn’t have to be performative. It just has to be <em>real</em>. <br /><br />Then on 11/11, a deeply emotional shift arrives: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer</a>, your sector of healing, rest, and closure. This is not the time to push. This is the time to soften. Some Leos may realize they’ve been carrying emotions that aren’t even theirs. Others may find themselves shedding ego identities that once felt protective — the performer, the leader, the strong one — in favor of deeper truth. You’re realizing that being seen isn’t always about being loud or perfect; it’s about being honest. Jupiter retro in Cancer helps you make peace with the past, with the versions of yourself you no longer need to be. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for solitude, sacred spaces, or spiritual nourishment. Let that be your compass. </p>



<p>As the Moon shifts into Virgo from November 13 to 15, you’ll feel a subtle but steady return to your values, money, and worth. You may be tempted to “fix” everything that feels off: your budget, your habits, your schedule, but the deeper ask is to center what actually sustains you. Not just financially, but emotionally, spiritually, physically. This Virgo Moon is your mid-month check-in: What’s been draining your light, and what’s been keeping it alive? The answers may not be flashy, but they’ll be <em>true</em>. Let simplicity lead. Let pleasure be enough. Let this week be a sacred act of recalibration — not so you can perform again, but so you can live more fully from your own center. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Mercury, your planetary ruler, begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations. This one’s going to feel personal. You might feel the urge to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">declutter everything in sight</a>, rearrange your furniture, or suddenly feel overwhelmed by family dynamics you thought were behind you. This isn’t regression; it’s excavation. If old patterns arise, especially around caretaking, over-functioning, or needing to be “the responsible one,” pause before reacting. Mercury retrograde wants to rewire your foundation from the inside out — so let yourself grieve, journal, question, and even nap more than usual. You’re making room for the version of home that feels more chosen than inherited. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, the ascension portal cracks open as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer</a>, illuminating your community and friendship sector. You may start to ask: Who really holds me? Who sees me when I’m not performing? Who do I trust to witness me in my becoming? This transit invites you to slow down your networking pace, rethink the roles you play in your social circles, and re-evaluate what solidarity actually looks like for you. Some Virgos may reconnect with old friends or communities that once brought joy, while others may realize they’ve outgrown certain connections — and that’s okay. Jupiter in retrograde is a cosmic blessing in disguise: it peels away the performance and leaves the soul. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon moves through your sign, and you’ll feel it like a subtle inner drumbeat returning you to yourself. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to do more or fix more to be worthy of ease. This is your mid-month reset. Instead of obsessing over what isn’t working, focus on nourishing what is. Ground yourself in rituals that feel like medicine — whether it’s meal prepping, doing absolutely nothing, or getting lost in a book. Let yourself be the thing you take care of this time. The world can wait — your healing can’t. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Mercury retrogrades in Sagittarius on November 9, lighting up your communication, learning, and local environment sector. So let’s be real: your words may trip over themselves this week, even when your heart is clear. That brilliant idea? It might need a few more rounds of refinement before you hit publish. The text you didn’t mean to send, the meeting you show up to on the wrong day… it’s all part of the cosmic comedy. But beneath the mix-ups, something deeper’s being rewritten. What are you <em>really</em> trying to say, Libra? What truths have you been avoiding out of politeness or fear of rocking the boat? Mercury’s slowdown invites you to get honest — not just with others, but with yourself. You don’t always have to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">translate your intuition</a> into something digestible. <br /><br />Then on November 11 (11/11 portal), Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your career and public image sector. If it feels like the outside world is slowing down just as you were picking up steam… that’s not a glitch, it’s divine timing. This retrograde asks you to <em>redefine success</em> on your terms. Maybe you’re not as excited about that promotion as you thought you’d be. Maybe a long-held goal no longer fits who you’re becoming. Jupiter in Cancer wants to root your ambitions in emotional truth, not external validation. You might find yourself craving a softer, more sustainable way of showing up in the world — one that honors your boundaries, your rest, your art. Let the discomfort guide you home. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your healing and subconscious sector, making this a powerful time to retreat, recalibrate, and listen to the whispers within. You don’t need to explain your absence. You don’t need to earn your stillness. Let this lunar energy be a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/staycation-digital-detox-personal-essay"">permission slip to say no, log off, close the tab</a>, and take the long way home. You are allowed to rest in the in-between. The clarity will come — but not if you chase it. Let it find you in the quiet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, Mercury begins its retrograde in Sagittarius on November 9, in your money, values, and self-worth sector, and this one’s hitting close to home — literally and emotionally. It might bring some financial delays or confusion: think forgotten payments, tech glitches with invoices, or miscommunications around collaborations. But beyond the surface-level chaos, this is a deeply clarifying period. Mercury’s slowdown is asking: What do you <em>actually value</em>? Are you hustling out of fear instead of alignment? This retrograde wants to help you reassess your entire relationship with abundance. Maybe what you need isn’t more… maybe it’s a better understanding of what “enough” means for you now. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your expansion, travel, and spiritual wisdom sector — and this is big. You may feel a sudden urge to cancel a trip, re-route a plan, or pull back from something you once thought was your “big break.” Let it happen. Jupiter’s moonlit retrograde is less about going somewhere and more about <em>returning</em> — to a truth, a purpose, or even an ancestor’s whisper you’ve been too busy to hear. You don’t have to chase enlightenment. You can live it in the quiet rituals, the daydreams, the pauses. This is the kind of transit that asks: What beliefs are outdated? What stories about yourself no longer fit who you’re becoming? </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendships"">energizes your community, friendship</a>, and long-term vision sector, and it’s here to help you sift through the noise. You’re realizing which social circles genuinely support your evolution and which ones subtly hold you back. Take stock of who you’re spending your precious time with. Are your connections reciprocal, or are you always the one holding space? Let the Virgo Moon guide you to organize your goals into tangible steps — no need for perfection. Just discernment, honesty, and a soft plan to carry you through these retrograde waters. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year in your sign on November 9, and you’ll likely feel it in your bones before you can name it. You might suddenly second-guess things you once felt 100% sure about: your image, your direction, even how you’ve been showing up lately. This isn’t a punishment, it’s a mirror. Mercury retrograde in your sign is like a cosmic mic check: Are your words aligned with your beliefs? Have your intentions kept up with your growth? If you’re misunderstood or if your message gets lost in translation this week, don’t panic. Take it as a signal to fine tune, not silence. You’re evolving. Your truth is too. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglements, and things get deep. A past entanglement, contract, or collaboration might resurface, and it’s not necessarily to restart it, but to reflect. This could be about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/personal-loans-real-examples"">money you loaned</a>, energy you overextended, or emotional investments that didn’t yield what you expected. Jupiter’s message here is loud: It’s time to reclaim your power by reexamining the places where you’ve over-given or under-valued your own needs. You might also feel a pull to tend to ancestral healing — themes of trust, survival, and legacy could come up, and they’re not here to haunt you, but to free you. </p>



<p>As the Moon moves through Virgo from November 13 to 15, your career and reputation sector lights up with earthy precision. While everything else may feel foggy or slowed down by retrogrades, this lunar transit helps you <em>ground your goals</em>. Clean up your calendar. Edit that proposal. Check your online bios — they might need updating. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing better. You’re learning to build a life that fits the version of you that’s emerging, not the one who was hustling out of habit. Let this week guide you to work smarter, live slower, and speak more intentionally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of spirituality, solitude, and endings. This one’s a little slippery. You may feel unusually foggy, sleepy, or overstimulated and disoriented all at once. It’s because your mind is trying to do what your spirit hasn’t caught up with yet. This is a week for remembering that not everything needs to be shared, explained, or understood immediately. Mercury retrograde is asking you to hit pause on external obligations and listen to your inner world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Dreams may get weirder</a>. Gut instincts stronger. You’re shedding thought patterns you didn’t realize were weighing you down. Let it happen in layers. </p>



<p>Then on the sacred 11/11 portal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde shifts into Cancer</a>, in your sector of relationships and contracts. Whether it’s a romantic partner, a business agreement, or an old commitment that’s expired, this transit is here to bring it all back to the surface. If something feels unfinished — it is. But this is not about reopening old wounds just to relive them. It’s about integrating what you’ve learned. This transit may challenge you to confront where you’ve overextended yourself in partnerships or allowed resentment to fester under the surface. On the flip side, it may illuminate where you’ve been too guarded to let real intimacy in. Either way, the invitation is to reimagine how you relate — not from survival, but from reciprocity. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lights up your sector of truth, travel, and expansion. You may find yourself craving an escape, but not necessarily a physical one. This might be the week you get lost in a book, sign up for a course, or revisit a philosophy that once anchored you. It’s the perfect time to assess what you’ve outgrown and what still resonates. Virgo’s clarity will help you map out the next leg of your soul journey… just don’t rush to have it all figured out. Let your sense of direction come from stillness, not pressure. You’re growing in silence this week, and it’s exactly what you need. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of community, vision, and long-term goals. If you’ve been go-go-go with big ideas, collaborations, or social media visibility, this is your cue to pause and reassess. Are you creating from your truth, or just trying to keep up? Mercury retrograde might bring a few tech glitches, scheduling delays, or misunderstandings among friends or team members. But it’s also a golden opportunity to get real about where your energy is going and why. Use this transit to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">revise your vision board</a> — metaphorically or literally. Who are you becoming, and who do you need around you to help make that future feel real? </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, the astro-numerological portal, and with it, Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, your sector of wellness, service, and daily rituals. This is less about productivity and more about sustainability. Jupiter here wants you to zoom out and ask: Is the way I live each day aligned with how I say I want to feel? Are you overgiving at work or neglecting your body’s requests for rest, nourishment, and movement? Maybe it’s time to simplify your routine, or even re-evaluate the kind of work you’re doing entirely. This transit might stir memories of past jobs, health routines, or caretaking roles that shaped your current reality — not to haunt you, but to help you release what’s no longer needed. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lands in your sector of intimacy, trust, and emotional transformation. You may find yourself quietly craving deeper connection, not just with others, but with the parts of yourself you’ve avoided. The Virgo Moon wants you to cleanse. This could look like journaling through a fear, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">organizing your finances</a>, or even deleting an old situationship’s number once and for all. Let this be a ritual of release. Mercury may be retrograde, but clarity is still available — especially when you’re honest about what you’ve outgrown. Make room for intimacy that feels like ease, not performance. You deserve that. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mercury begins its retrograde journey in Sagittarius on November 9, activating your career, visibility, and life direction sector. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">could feel like déjà vu</a> in the workplace, where past projects resurface or delayed recognition finally makes its way to you, but with strings attached. You may find yourself rethinking your goals or even reconsidering what “success” looks like for you. Are you chasing someone else’s version of accomplishment? Or is it time to give yourself permission to redefine what lights you up? Double-check important emails and deadlines, but also check in with your higher self — she might be whispering a totally different route forward. </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, and your planetary ruler Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, in your sector of creativity, romance, and self-expression. This is where the magic gets personal. A love from the past could resurface, not necessarily for reunion, but for reflection. You might feel pulled back into old creative dreams you once abandoned, wondering, “What if?” Jupiter’s slow dance in Cancer invites you to nurture your inner child and revisit the art forms or love stories that once brought you joy. If you’re a parent or mentor, this could be a healing period for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-aunts-uncles-nibling-social-media"">bonding with the young people</a> in your life, or with your own youthful spirit. Let yourself be moved. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo illuminates your relationship and one-on-one connection sector. It’s a clarifying lunar moment that may reveal where boundaries need adjusting, or where walls need softening. Whether you’re single, partnered, or in something undefined, the Virgo Moon brings discernment without coldness. Take this time to have the talk, send the email, or write the letter (even if you never send it). You’re learning to show up more authentically in partnership, but also to honor your solitude. Clarity is not closure, it’s a doorway. Walk through with grace. </p>
<p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>",
