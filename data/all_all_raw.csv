<p>Unlike most popular sports, the origin of basketball has a precise year and creator: it was invented in 1891 in the United States by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as an indoor sport for athletes at Springfield College during the winter, after the end of the football season. The sport quickly expanded beyond U.S. borders, being included in the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/olympic-games"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olympic Games</a> in 1936 and achieving international popularity after the Second World War. As basketball became more widespread, it also left the controlled environment of gymnasiums and began occupying a wide range of locations: playgrounds, public plazas, school courtyards, driveways, and backyard patios became informal courts for play and community life, reinforcing <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/925956/7-examples-where-physical-activities-were-the-catalyst-behind-a-neighborhood-regeneration"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the role of physical activity as a catalyst for social interaction and neighborhood regeneration</a>.</p>",

<h4>Using AI in UX design, Interactions, Motion, &amp; Marketing.</h4><figure><img alt=""AI Hat"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJH-70_fdENoXr8UHWpGyQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Recently top companies have publicly come out to share their processes implemented by senior designers and entire creative teams. Some notable companies like Meta and Atlassian stood out. Not only are these companies building their own AI workflows, but they are spending millions of dollars to train their employees on them. From watching interviews to reading lengthy articles, here is what I’ve learnt about their carefully crafted AI workflows.</p><h3>Atlassian’s design-to-prototype workflow, powered by AI</h3><figure><img alt=""Atlassian AI workflow"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4fZ32GccUsAaebh-zYfjBg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The famous software company has to build large scale tools and software for some of the biggest enterprises in the world. AI is the perfect companion for their team to design and test faster.</p><p>In a recent <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">hands-on session</a> with their design team, the wonderful people at Dive Club who interviewed them, shared exactly the methods that work for them. PS. It’s all about the balance here.</p><h4><strong>Using a pre-built template strategy:</strong></h4><p>The Atlassian team realized that AI was often messing up core elements and not completely understanding complex commands. So they created a sort of “design system” for their AI led prototyping. Here they feed a page with pre-coded elements which AI doesn’t change, but lets the tool work on other elements which are open to interpretation in a way.</p><h4><strong>They built instruction files:</strong></h4><p>Unlike most designers who just ask AI tools to code in a certain programming language or use a certain framework, their team has created certain instruction files to “guide the AI”. This instructions file (essentially a text file) might have a specific instruction to use a design system element, variable or certain token in case the AI encounters a certain type of element.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u6dpoZI88gIqb_QfvirDcg.png"" /><figcaption>Their template file in Figma — These are written instruction for the AI to follow</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">the interview</a>, their team discusses using tailwind (a CSS framework), but writing specific instructions to <em>only use their own design components</em> in certain areas. This is essentially an <strong>over-ride instruction</strong>, where the AI skips certain actions in order to fulfill their prompts.</p><h4>Recipes over hard work:</h4><p>A complex business like Atlassian requires simplified workflows to make life easier. The team just uses the copy-paste strategy to add pre-baked instructions to their prompts. The team talks about how most of their products consists of a dark mode switch. So, whenever they prototype a new page or product, they just add a dark mode switch command in their prompts. It’s barbaric, but it works!</p><h4>They calibrate AI to see better:</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8yxOdybbjgNqV-x8RFV7IQ.png"" /><figcaption>Calibrating the AI to learn their style &amp; components</figcaption></figure><p>Custom software production needs custom AI. When training their AI, they feed their design elements in and ask the AI what it sees. If the AI is accurate they move on, but if the AI gets an element wrong, they correct it to avoid future issues. This also fixes the screenshot-to-code conversion that they use in their company.</p><h3>Designers at Meta are adopting AI at all levels</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/0*RXUAbEMhSvc9JSHL.jpg"" /></figure><p>A slew of designers across different departments at Meta are scrambling to incorporate AI and supercharge their workflows.

He clarifies that he’s only taking over smaller tasks rather than completely removing designers from the equation. According to the PM, a majority of roles at these companies are collapsing, and one person needs to do much more.</p><h3>Tesco designers are vibe coding their own Figma plugins</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*G_-I9J7BZXsjYVEN3z1P5g.png"" /><figcaption>Tesco is publicly using Adobe AI &amp; Firefly</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href=""https://youtu.be/ISoolpPvIyU?si=IdNcG_8w8KqCeLz2"">recent interview</a> with Tesco’s senior designer, it was revealed that they developed their own powerful Figma plugins to get the most out of the tool.</p><p>They’ve created a Figma plugin that connects directly to the data of their website.

<h4>What it really takes to build a product inside ChatGPT while the ecosystem is still forming (and without an engineering team)</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a hand pressing the ChatGPT logo, surrounded by abstract shapes, nodes, and connecting lines on a blue background, suggesting interaction within a networked system."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0B3_mRr5_B3ZZYMtsXm6RA.png"" /></figure><h3>Building in a space that doesn’t exist yet</h3><p>A ChatGPT app isn’t an app in the way we’ve learned to think about software.</p><p>It doesn’t ship with a standalone interface or a familiar navigation model. It lives inside a conversational surface, where <a href=""https://blog.uxtweak.com/conversational-ux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">language, intent, and orchestration shape how a product is experienced</a> just as much as UI does. Still, companies are moving quickly to integrate, sensing that showing up inside these systems will soon be table stakes for discovery.</p><p>The moment feels familiar. In the early 2010s, <a href=""https://resources.latana.com/post/mobile-first-brands-level-up/"">teams rushed to become mobile-first</a> before fully understanding what mobile would demand of product, design, or infrastructure. Large language models are triggering a similar shift — except this time the interface is conversational, the distribution layer is centralized, and many of the constraints are still undefined.</p><p>Participating in this new layer requires more than exposing an API. Products need a way to express what they do, how they should be used, and under which conditions they should be invoked. <a href=""https://getsquid.ai/blog/what-are-mcps"">MCP</a>s are one emerging attempt to make products legible to language models, though the standard itself is still taking shape.</p><figure><img alt=""Modal titled “New Connector (Beta)” with fields for name, description, MCP server URL, authentication type set to OAuth, and a warning indicating the connector is not verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vuiQNBn2oJH3kx0Ndm_1Rg.png"" /><figcaption>Adding connectors in ChatGPT developer mode. Full breakdown of steps <a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode"">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>What stands out most is how early this ecosystem feels.</p><p>Tools are appearing faster than shared mental models. Founders are building in parallel toward very different interpretations of what a “ChatGPT integration” actually is. For non-technical builders — designers, product thinkers, operators — the promise of access exists alongside real uncertainty about control, responsibility, and realism.</p><p>This article is a set of field notes from trying to build a ChatGPT app early, without a technical background, while the space itself is still in flux.</p><h3>A platform shift that pulled me in</h3><p>I started paying attention to this space out of curiosity more than mandate.</p><p><a href=""https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/"">When OpenAI released the ChatGPT app ecosystem</a> to direct submissions in Dec 2025, it felt like the opening of a new product surface — one that would quietly reshape how discovery works and how products are understood. Conversational interfaces were no longer just answering questions; they were influencing what users saw, compared, and acted on.</p><figure><img alt=""ChatGPT “Apps (Beta)” directory screen showing a featured “Create with Canva” card, category tabs, and a list of integrated apps such as Adobe Photoshop, Airtable, and Booking.com."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*97ppIXhA8gP73ShHZ0l6qA.png"" /><figcaption>ChatGTP’s Apps directory as of Dec 2025</figcaption></figure><p>It was obvious that <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">surfacing inside ChatGPT would matter, and quickly</a>. Not as a simple presence, but as a product that could be interpreted, ranked, and differentiated within a conversational flow.</p><p>I wanted to understand what that actually meant in practice.</p><p>Rather than speculating from the outside, I started exploring the space by trying to build something concrete: a prototype that behaved like a real app inside ChatGPT, constrained by its strict UX &amp; UI guidelines, its invocation patterns, and its rules.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow mapping document titled “Product selection &amp; handoff,” showing a multi-row UX analysis with labeled sections, notes, and a large embedded property listing interface on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NmpIfEnyO5qXNr0ppEOuGg.png"" /><figcaption>My initial research led my to observe &amp; analyze flows and patterns of behavior around the very first ChatGTP partner apps (here Zillow)</figcaption></figure><p>That exploration pulled me into an ecosystem I didn’t fully understand yet, but one that felt important to experience from the inside.</p><h3>The constraint: moving fast without being technical</h3><p>I approached this as a product designer — someone whose value comes from shaping behavior and orchestrating systems, not writing production code. That constraint became clarifying: it forced me to focus on the product questions that actually mattered. At the start, my mental model was incomplete: I didn’t yet understand where code actually lived, how APIs differed from MCPs, or how invocation worked once a product entered a conversational system.</p><p>What I did have was urgency, and a strong drive to understand the space.</p><p>Waiting for engineering availability wasn’t realistic. No-code tools became leverage — a way to maintain velocity while the ecosystem was still forming.</p><p>I expected the process to be relatively fluid. That these tools would absorb complexity and make experimentation easier.</p><p>Instead, I encountered a fast-growing ecosystem full of ambition, pressure, and partial solutions. Many platforms promised to bridge the gap between non-technical builders and ChatGPT integration. Very few actually reduced the friction involved.</p><h3>Entering the frontier: a fragmented ecosystem</h3><p>My exploration started with a straightforward question: which tools could realistically help me export an MCP and demo a functioning ChatGPT app?</p><p>I did my due diligences and experimented first with general no-code and AI-assisted platforms like <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor</a> and <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> in order to get a reference.</p><p>Cursor, while powerful, assumed familiarity with local development environments, file systems, and publishing semantics that weren’t obvious without a development background. “No-code” didn’t remove complexity — it required architectural intuition most designers simply do not have. The recent emergence of various <a href=""https://adplist.notion.site/cursor-for-designers"">courses</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faezjTHA5SU"">tutorials </a>explicitly aimed at making Cursor more approachable to designers reinforces that this gap is structural, not personal.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from a marketing video displaying a Cursor interface, with a design inspector panel open on the right showing component properties, and an embed chat UI panel on the left."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4j2r_Pa-lBy5prbKnf0q_g.png"" /><figcaption>Cursor introduces their <a href=""https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor"">visual editor</a> end of 2025 in an attempt to make its software more accessible to non-coders</figcaption></figure><p>Lovable, as I had rightfully assumed, assisted in creating beautiful and realistic enough visuals when carefully prompted but never could extend beyond the role of ingenious prototype.</p><p>I then quickly moved on to exploring several early platforms attempting to solve this problem specifically, including <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a>, <a href=""https://fractalmcp.com/"">Fractal</a>, <a href=""https://noodleseed.com/"">NoodleSeed</a> and <a href=""https://manifest.build/"">Manifest</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Four landing pages arranged in a grid, each promoting tools for building or deploying apps inside ChatGPT, with headings, call-to-action buttons, and product interface previews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TeDhUZwtkXCTyugG8cQgMw.png"" /></figure><p>In conversations with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmatthews-pm/"">Colin Matthews</a>, founder of <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a> and instructor at <a href=""https://maven.com/tech-for-product/ai-prototyping-for-product-managers"">Maven</a>, he described the value as enabling teams to “export code, view sharable specs, and run evals directly within the platform to facilitate cross-functional handoffs.” That made sense for what I was trying to do — bridging design intent and implementation without owning production code.</p><p>Each of these emerging tool approached the problem differently. Some were strong on prototyping but struggled when pushed toward something deployable. Others required a level of technical investment that conflicted with my constraints. A few were promising but blocked by access limitations, incomplete products, or early-stage instability.</p><p>Nearly everything I tried was in beta.</p><p>Platforms were buggy. Context was frequently lost. Documentation was thin. Many tools assumed users already knew how to prompt effectively, how to reason about conversational flows, or how to debug hallucinations when things broke.</p><p>Alongside the tooling, I spent time talking directly with founders building in this space. Those conversations became just as informative as the products themselves.</p><p>Even when tools looked similar on the surface, the underlying visions were very different. Builders had conflicting ideas on who the primary user was, what MCPs should represent, and whether this layer was fundamentally about infrastructure, product creation, or distribution.</p><p>You could feel that divergence in how each platform behaved.</p><h3>Where things broke</h3><p>As I kept experimenting, patterns began to repeat.</p><p>Hallucinations showed up in different forms — including code that looked convincing but simply didn’t hold up. Some abstractions accelerated early progress, only to break under real constraints. Context loss meant restating intent again and again.</p><p>In several cases, MCPs appeared to work inside builder environments but failed to surface at all inside ChatGPT. In others, the system repeatedly reported success — changes “applied,” actions “completed” — while nothing had actually changed. Debugging became conversational: repeatedly prompting the system to self-diagnose. When that failed, progress depended on reaching out directly to founders to investigate issues that weren’t visible from the surface.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing an error message while creating a custom connector on the left, and a ChatGPT conversation on the right explaining that live event data cannot be verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tKa5E30Fiwa0arbzoYTF2w.png"" /><figcaption>Left: MCP fails to connect altogether despite numerous attempts at self-diagnosis | Right: Although app is connected it fails to respond when invoked</figcaption></figure><p>These issues aren’t unique to any one tool. They’re <a href=""https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/"">well documented</a> across current LLM platforms and early-stage developer tooling, particularly when systems rely heavily on generative output without strong validation layers.</p><p>The harder part was understanding where responsibility sat.</p><p>When behavior deviated from expectations, it wasn’t obvious whether the issue came from the platform, the MCP configuration, or the tool itself. There was very little support for reasoning across those layers.</p><p>I also realized that I had more influence than I initially thought — over ChatGPT-native layout, conversational flow, and follow-up questions — but that influence was rarely surfaced clearly. It lived behind structured inputs and assumptions that were easy to miss if you didn’t already know they existed. That realization forced me to get more deliberate about what I was actually optimizing for.</p><h3>How I learned to choose</h3><p>Facing this level of fragmentation and instability, I needed a way to evaluate what actually mattered.</p><p>I stopped optimizing for comprehensiveness and started optimizing for learning velocity. That shift required being explicit about tradeoffs — what I was willing to sacrifice and what I wasn’t.</p><p>The framework that emerged:</p><p>Speed to behavioral validation over perfect infrastructure — I cared more about seeing how something behaved in ChatGPT than building it “correctly.” Mock data, hardcoded responses, simplified flows — whatever got me to a testable embedded interaction fastest.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing screengrab from various softwares.

I’d rather ship one well-orchestrated flow than ten that worked but felt bolted on.</p><p>Debuggability over abstraction elegance — When something broke, I needed to understand why. Tools that hid complexity behind beautiful abstractions became liabilities. I favored visibility, even if it meant more manual work.</p><p>This hierarchy shaped everything: which tools I abandoned, which compromises I accepted, and how I structured the interaction model itself.</p><h3>Patterns that emerged across tools and conversations</h3><p>Looking across tools and conversations, a few themes stood out.</p><p>Guidance was mostly under-designed. Many platforms offered powerful capabilities but assumed a level of prompt literacy and architectural intuition that designers don’t naturally start with — and that the tools themselves didn’t teach.</p><p>“No-code” didn’t remove the need for systems thinking. It redistributed it. I found myself reasoning about flows, tool invocation, compliance, system architecture and boundaries, even without writing production code.</p><figure><img alt=""Dashboard-style interface showing six configuration panels labeled Attachments, Connectors, Filters, Model management, Modes, and Parameters, each describing options for controlling data sources, model selection, interaction modes, and prompt settings."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tqfV5fo1MGgNWpJ9KDLfdg.png"" /><figcaption>Tuners, as described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmiecampbell/"">Emily Campbell</a> in the <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">Shape of AI</a></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest source of friction was translation. Enterprise assets — APIs, design systems, UI kits, brand and photography guidelines — aren’t LLM-ready by default. Converting them into something that could be safely and predictably invoked required manual judgment at nearly every step.</p><p>ChatGPT<a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/ui-guidelines/""> UI guidelines</a> added another layer of ambiguity. It wasn’t always clear what was disallowed, what was risky, and what simply needed adaptation. Validating those decisions ahead of review remained difficult, even when an app appeared to work. That ambiguity isn’t accidental — it reflects a space where standards, responsibilities, and even product definitions are still being negotiated.</p><figure><img alt=""Slide showing a question about implementing brand colors in ChatGPT UI, alongside two panels outlining a “Brand Colors — Implementation Plan,” with color tokens, SDK-compliant areas, gray areas, and sections marked “keep as-is.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LM8ZeYvQmVFZ_3zSyWOlWg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Chippy illustrating ambiguity in ChatGPT UI compliance due to unclear SDK guidance.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it became obvious that the space hasn’t converged yet. Founders are building toward different futures, and that lack of alignment shows up directly in the products.</p><h3>What the workflow revealed</h3><p>Over time, I stopped expecting the tools to define the experience for me.</p><p>Progress came from taking ownership of the interaction model: deciding which results to surface, how they should appear, and what kind of conversational path felt intentional rather than reactive. I worked with mock data instead of real APIs to focus on behavior before scale.</p><p>Visual control required additional effort. UI components &amp; the data they should contain were thought through and designed separately, exported as structured assets, and reintroduced into the platforms to better align with each product’s unique requirements.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of two content cards, one showing restaurant listings with images, ratings, addresses, and selectable reservation times, and the other showing hotel listings with photos, review scores, amenities icons, pricing per stay, and “View on Booking.com” buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9SgFgdIcq_QK1bwFx6iDEw.png"" /><figcaption>Left: ChatGTP’s inline carousel widget template | Right: Booking.com’s interpretation</figcaption></figure><p>Testing always happened inside ChatGPT itself. Differences between builder environments and real platform behavior were common, and those gaps often surfaced the most insight.</p><p>What this workflow ultimately revealed was less about process and more about role. Building in this space required judgment across design, systems, and platform interpretation. The work sat somewhere between product design and infrastructure awareness, even without owning production code.</p><h3>What this shift changes about who gets to build</h3><p>This experience clarified something: the line between “product” and “technical” work is dissolving.</p><p>In an informal conversation I had with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamsegal/"">Noam Segal</a> — AI Insights Lead at Figma — he framed it simply: “designers in this space have to agree to tinker, fail often, and share those failures in order to learn.” Even without owning production code, I had to understand how tools connect, how data flows, and how decisions propagate through an LLM-driven product. These aren’t optional skills for designers working in AI — they’re foundational.</p><p>Prompting felt less like creative expression and more like intent specification. Over time, it became clear that this skill will likely be absorbed into tooling rather than remain a standalone practice.</p><p>For designers, this shift is significant. The work moves away from static artifacts and toward shaping behavior in uncertain systems. Comfort with experimentation, ambiguity, and failure matters more than deep mastery of any single tool.</p><p>Finally, product leadership too, is shifting. Outcomes matter more than mechanics. Adaptability matters more than precedent. And direct visibility into how products behave in the world matters more than perfectly polished specs.</p><h3>Open questions and forward-looking bets</h3><p>This exploration surfaced more questions than it resolved — and that feels appropriate for a space still taking shape.</p><ul><li>Where does responsibility sit when hallucinations slip through?</li><li>How much control will non-technical builders retain as governance tightens?</li><li>How do teams meaningfully validate products when preview environments remain incomplete?</li></ul><p>At the same time, a few patterns feel durable enough to bet on:</p><p>The translation layer will become its own discipline. Converting enterprise systems into LLM-legible interfaces isn’t a one-time technical task — it’s an ongoing design problem that requires new kinds of judgment.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface showing Slack-style messages, an audio digest player titled “Q4 projects — Weekly Insights,” and a “Configure digest” panel with fields for title and destination channels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m0v180qrT0PFk_rGKVWKZw.png"" /><figcaption>Rather than replacing existing tools, AI products are increasingly embedded within them — shifting the design challenge toward translation and orchestration, from Design Patterns For AI Interfaces course, by <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/vitaly-friedman/"">Vitaly Friedman</a></figcaption></figure><p>Conversational coherence will matter more than feature count.

<h4><em>It’s not about adding AI, it’s about solving problems better than before.</em></h4><p>Lately, I've seen a shift in the market… one that gives me hope for the future. Instead of asking, <em>&quot;How can we put AI into our product?&quot;</em> the new question to ask is, <em>&quot;How might we solve customer problems with AI?&quot;</em></p><figure><img alt=""Two sales people from the sketch comedy show, Portlandia, with the phrase, &quot;Put a bird on it.&quot;"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5uSmq93bQqBjA9TpYR-Tpw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Put a bird on it — Portlandia, Source <a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/put-bird-on-xugExlK"">imgur</a></figcaption></figure><p>This seemingly subtle difference represents a massive mindset shift because one question is driven by hype, and the other is driven by value.</p><p>The first question, “How can we add AI?” is <em>trend-chasing</em>. It puts technology before purpose, and often leads to bloated features no one asked for, wasted development time, money, and opportunity cost of building something desired and innovative instead.</p><p>The second, “How can we solve a real problem better with AI?” is <em>value creation</em>. It puts the customer at the center and treats AI as a tool, not a trophy.</p><p>That’s the shift we’re seeing. And it’s the difference between shipping gimmicks and building enduring solutions.</p><h3>Put some AI in it!</h3><p>Since the start of the AI revolution, we've been doing research with both Big Tech and smaller AI-based startups to help them understand their customers and their response to AI-based products and services.</p><p>The initial request was simply to, &quot;Put some AI into the product.&quot; It makes sense: it's a new, emerging technology and it's important to stay competitive…</p><p>What it looked like in real life was a different story: It became more of a race to integrate a chatbot into the product than a process of determining whether a chatbot is really the solution to a problem.</p><p>I mean, unless the business problem is have a chatbot because my competitors also have a chatbot.</p><p>If you remember the sketch comedy show, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia""><em>Portlandia</em></a>, then you might recall the sketch, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw"">Put a bird on it</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the sketch, two well-meaning artists try to help struggling businesses by literally adding birds to random products:</p><blockquote>&quot;Look at this sad little tote bag… I know, I'll put a bird on it!&quot; easily becomes, &quot;Look at this sad Pre-GenAI product… I know, I'll put some AI on it!&quot;</blockquote><p>It’s funny because it’s true. And it’s tragic because it’s happening.</p><p>That sketch nails the problem with trend-first thinking: it’s surface-level. Aesthetic over substance. AI becomes a sticker, not a solution. When you chase a trend, you decorate. When you pursue end-user value, you solve.</p><p>And solving is where the real growth is.</p><p>(Continue watching as it devolves hysterically at your own risk).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href"">https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href</a><h4>You aren't asking the right question</h4><p>Having spent my career helping companies uncover deep customer pain points and design real solutions, this wave of “just add a chatbot” feels like watching innovation on autopilot.</p><p>It wasn’t strategic. It wasn’t solving for anything. It was tech for tech’s sake fueled by FOMO (Fear of missing out). The real question that drives long-term growth is this:</p><blockquote>“Are we solving our customer’s most urgent problem better than anyone else?”</blockquote><h4>AI is a means to an end</h4><p>Simply adding AI is like when the internet exploded in the mid-90s saying that we needed to add some HTML into our product. Or, to have a website. But a website to do what? To solve what problem?</p><p>AI can help answer that question. But it doesn’t replace the question itself. AI is a means to an end, not the end in itself. And to be clear: the end goal is happy customers that purchase your product or service.</p><p>This is where the mindset shift comes in: It's not about <em>adding AI </em>as much as it's about <em>solving customer problems.</em></p><h3>The mindset shift</h3><p>&quot;I have a new tool in my toolbox. It's called AI. Or Agentic AI. Or an LLM.&quot;</p><p>Ok, cool, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>The real shift is this: instead of jamming AI into an already bloated product roadmap, teams are starting to ask a smarter question:</p><blockquote>“Where can this tool help us solve a customer problem in a better way than we could before?”</blockquote><p>This may sound obvious, but the implications are transformative.</p><p>The best companies aren’t leading with the tool. They’re leading with the outcome. AI is a means, not the mission. A lever, not the solution itself.</p><p>Think of it this way: You used to have a hammer, maybe it was a really good hammer, but it was really good at nails. Now you also have a screwdriver. It's flashy and helps you solve new problems because not every problem is a nail.</p><figure><img alt=""Quote from Star Wars: &quot;These aren't the droids you're looking for.&quot; Obi-Wan Kenobi."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*wYrXWxbixlOW_G__CcIiig.png"" /><figcaption>Obi-wan from Star Wars (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_aren%27t_the_droids_you%27re_looking_for"">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The shift isn’t just about what tools are available, it’s about what problem you’re solving and what’s now possible because of this new AI toolset.</p><p>The leading Tech companies understand this shift because it comes from a place of power. By reframing the problem and the approach, you're able to stop playing catch-up and start leading the market with your new, innovative approach.</p><p>Leveraging AI for what it does best allows product development teams to focus on what they do best: designing and developing solutions, now with more options on how to solve problems.</p><h3>Taking action</h3><p>If you’re building with AI, here’s your first step: pause and reframe the question.</p><p>Don’t start with, “Where can I use AI?” Instead, start with:</p><blockquote><strong>“What is the biggest, most urgent, and most underserved problem our customers face? And what is now uniquely possible because of AI?”</strong></blockquote><p>To help you shift into this problem-first mindset, try this simple diagnostic:</p><ul><li>What’s the #1 frustration your customers keep bringing up?</li><li>What do they wish they could do but currently can’t?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand, what would you remove, automate, or radically improve?</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself: does AI give us a new advantage to solve that?</p><p>If the answer is Yes: Great! Keep going and build with intentionality.</p><p>If not: don’t force a square peg into a round hole. This isn't the screw your AI-screwdriver is looking for.</p><h4><strong>Now it's your turn</strong></h4><p>Putting the <em>most </em>AI into your product isn’t a winning strategy. Instead, it’s being <em>intentional</em> and <em>selective</em> about when, where, and why you chose to incorporate AI into your product.</p><p>This is your opportunity to lead the shift inside your team, your company, your product. Solve real problems by being the one who helps your team make the mindset shift and asks the better question.</p><p>That’s how meaningful innovation and growth happens. And you can be the change.</p><p><strong>Josh LaMar</strong> is the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href=""https://amplinate.com/"">Amplinate</a>, an international agency focusing on cross-cultural Research &amp; Design.

Version 1.0 includes Regular, Medium, and Bold weights.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans/releases/latest""><strong>Download Latest Font</strong></a></p><p>I’ve used <a href=""https://rsms.me/inter/"">Inter</a> for years. It’s been my default across dozens of projects and, in my opinion, represents the best of open-source typography. Its clean geometry, strong engineering, and consistent rhythm have made it a staple of modern design systems. Over time, especially while working on accessibility-focused products, I began noticing small limitations. Certain glyphs blurred together at smaller sizes, some bowls felt tight in low-vision contexts, and characters like I, l, and 1 weren’t distinct enough for readers who rely on extra clarity. None of this diminished my respect for Inter, it simply highlighted areas where accessibility could be improved.</p><p>Because of these legibility challenges, when I started doing product work for <a href=""https://loudandclear.io/""><em>Loud + Clear</em></a>, an app designed for people with Parkinson’s, I turned to <a href=""https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. It’s one of the most thoughtfully designed accessibility fonts available, with radically open forms and unmistakable glyph shapes that prioritize clarity. For low-vision users, it excels.</p><p>But I missed Inter’s visual aesthetic, its modern geometry, contemporary rhythm, and the familiarity designers expect in UI typography. I admired Atkinson’s readability and Inter’s overall look, and kept wishing there were a way to bring the strengths of both into a single design.</p><p><strong>Hyperlegible Sans</strong> is the result. It’s an open-source fork of Inter that preserves its modern character while incorporating hyperlegible principles inspired by Atkinson. It isn’t meant to replace either font, just to offer another option, one that didn’t exist before.</p><p>What I changed (and why)</p><p>The philosophy behind Hyperlegible Sans is simple: keep the visual identity of Inter intact, but reduce ambiguity wherever it appears. That meant making targeted, deliberate adjustments rather than redrawing the font from scratch.</p><p>Here are the most impactful changes:</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison image showing Inter on the left and Hyperlegible Sans on the right, with highlighted letters demonstrating clearer apertures, improved differentiation between I, l, and 1, a wider capital O, and a slashed zero in Hyperlegible Sans."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZLD_DI4KANEeF9uaOSqhmQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side comparison of Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, highlighting changes to ambiguous glyphs, including a, e, I, O, and 0, to improve character differentiation and legibility.</figcaption></figure><h4>Capital I</h4><p>I added subtle top and bottom bars.

Low-vision readers rely on disambiguation, and this single change dramatically improves clarity without altering the overall feel.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the capital letter I, with Inter on the left as a plain vertical stroke and Hyperlegible Sans on the right with added top and bottom bars to increase clarity and differentiation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*13DkDS1Lg5mmu5y9oR_qlg@2x.png"" /><figcaption>Capital I comparison demonstrating the addition of subtle top and bottom bars in Hyperlegible Sans to improve distinction from lowercase l and numeral 1.</figcaption></figure><h4>Lowercase l</h4><p>I added a small baseline spur.

Hyperlegibility is often achieved through a series of minor adjustments that build up to meaningful improvements in clarity.</p><h3>The design belief behind this project</h3><p>Accessibility shouldn’t require compromising aesthetics.</p><p>A font shouldn’t look “special” or “different” to be inclusive. Good typography should simply work for everyone.</p><p>Hyperlegible Sans reflects a belief I carry into every project: <strong>design can be both beautiful and accessible</strong>.</p><p>We don’t need to choose between modern geometry and clear letterforms. We can have both.</p><p>Design is full of these false choices, and part of the work is expanding the range of tools available so designers can choose what best fits their intentions.</p><h3>What’s next for Hyperlegible Sans</h3><p>This is only version 1. The roadmap includes:</p><ul><li>additional weights</li><li>a full variable font</li><li>expanded punctuation</li><li>broader language support</li><li>refinements for dark mode and low-contrast environments</li></ul><p>And like Inter, this project is open-source. I’m uploading the complete files to GitHub, along with documentation on the changes and a roadmap for future versions.</p><p>My hope is simple: that this font becomes another tool in the accessibility toolkit. Something UI designers, developers, and product teams can reach for when they need both clarity and beauty, when they want typography that reflects how modern design should work.</p><p>Not less beautiful. Not more clinical. Just clearer, easier, more humane.</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans""><strong>View “Hyperlegible Sans” on Github</strong></a></p><figure><img alt=""Text layout titled “Why Legibility Matters,” explaining how clear letterforms and spacing improve readability, reduce cognitive effort, and support comfortable reading in conditions such as small sizes, low contrast, or motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0mM6d5g12cE1BdBg-qr7A.png"" /><figcaption>Legibility-focused text sample demonstrating how clearer letterforms, consistent spacing, and strong character differentiation reduce cognitive load and improve reading comfort.</figcaption></figure><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7b3c823692fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hyperlegible-sans-a-free-open-source-font-for-accessible-design-7b3c823692fb"">Hyperlegible Sans: a free, open-source font for accessible design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong><em>How brand, data, and reuse help ideas move past the demo phase</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IZ6fOsQkSAw4pHD1iXAFuA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard</em></figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we know there are many tools at our disposal to create AI-generated UI, like Lovable, Anima, and Uizard. There has been a lot of progress in this space, with AI output at unthinkable speeds and of unprecedented quality. But still…most of it feels short-lived and unusable.</p><p><strong>The generated screens look convincing, but they’re treated as placeholders instead of starting points in the ideation process</strong>. For instance, when a generated screen needs to reflect a brand’s styling, handle real data, or align with existing patterns, the work has to be rebuilt (and the generated UI is tossed).</p><p>This is simply a mismatch between how UI is generated in AI tools and how products are actually built. So instead of avoiding constraints such as branding and data, they need to be integrated into the generation process. This way, the UI becomes more valuable and can be used to continue to iterate past a demo or proof of concept (POC) phase.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 constraints (brand styles, data, and pattern reuse) that separate generated UI that gets discarded versus UI that is used end-to-end in the product development cycle</p><h3>Start with a brand versus restyling later</h3><p>AI-generated screens typically use visual styles that are neutral, like system-default colors and typography. Though the UI feels “close enough,” it’s not truly accurate to your product’s brand (or any other brand you want to test). And once real branding is introduced, the UI designs break down from the gaps created from the neutral styling used during generation.</p><p><strong>This ultimately causes rework to better incorporate the product’s branding (either restyling elements or starting over completely)</strong>. To avoid this issue, brand alignment must become part of the initial AI prompt versus being considered as extra steps to fix in later stages.</p><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Anima that is inspired by the Airbnb brand and AI prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IJ-5YTLl4BBmz8LZKf_17g.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>Anima generates UI inspired by a brand</em></a><em> (like Airbnb) from the first AI prompt, and can make modifications to individual elements as needed</em></figcaption></figure><p>But generating UI with brand context doesn’t eliminate design judgment– it more so reduces how much work gets discarded. When generated UI reflects a real brand early in the design or ideation process, it becomes something teams can refine rather than replace.</p><h4>How to integrate branding and generated UI</h4><p>Many of the AI tools we already know are beginning to account for specific brand inclusion:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: With <a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/"">Anima Playground</a>, you can generate an application using the visual language of an existing brand. Just write the app you want to build, along with the brand to use as inspiration (from your own brand to Airbnb’s). You can also refine individual UI elements or adjust inline copy without regenerating the designs again and again.</li><li><strong>Uizard</strong>: <a href=""https://uizard.io/autodesigner/"">Uizard’s Auto-designer</a> allows you to write a text-based prompt, then select a style (from a screenshot, URL, or brand kit). After the designs are generated, you can modify elements and generate themes.</li><li><strong>Google Stitch</strong>: Similar to the other tools, <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Google Stitch</a> generates screens based on your prompt, which can include brand styling. Stitch’s output is solid, but you cannot modify individual elements; you can only use an entire screen as reference for modification requests.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Google Stitch that is based on the prompted brand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0HsQrO4-IZeMRk-WU1V6-g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Google Stitch generates screens based on the requested brand, but can only modify entire screens versus single elements</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some of the tools, like Anima, generate the UI with flexibility and can be restyled with </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>different branding inspirations</em></a><em> without rebuilding the entire layout. So you can easily compare visual directions or get stakeholder feedback.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of branding from the start</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster alignment</strong>: Introducing brand context early reduces the gap between initial concepts and stakeholder expectations (shifting feedback away from styling and toward design intent)</li><li><strong>Comparison between directions</strong>: Applying different brand styles to the same layout makes it easy to evaluate options without redesigning the experience each time</li><li><strong>Less restyling later</strong>: When typography, colors, and tone are set from the start, teams spend less time retrofitting as the design evolves</li></ul><h4>Limits of branding with AI tools</h4><ul><li><strong>Surface-level branding</strong>: AI-driven branding captures visual cues like color and type, but doesn’t replace a deeper Design System</li><li><strong>Accessibility and content review</strong>: Generated UI still needs to be manually reviewed and validated by designers for accessibility and content standards</li></ul><h3>Apply real data to reveal if the UI actually works</h3><p>Screens that have been generated with AI typically use mock data as placeholder content. Though mock data helps teams understand the design idea, it also masks the hardest UX problems. Not every user goes through the ideal, “happy path”…they will encounter empty states, error flows, and permission rules.</p><p><strong>These unexpected, but common scenarios don’t show up in static screens, which means early designs can give a false sense of readiness</strong>. Without real data and content driving interactions, product teams discover these gaps late in the design and development process.</p><figure><img alt=""Database feature in Anima to view and edit real data for your app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lWxdv2nCddjR-rjiLJXFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Anima automatically creates a database with editable data to support your project</figcaption></figure><p>Though this doesn’t replace user-centered design thinking, it ensures ideas are grounded in authentic user behavior from the beginning of the design process. So by integrating real data into the generated UI, teams can see whether interactions work, content fits, and user permissions behave as expected. This is especially important when features rely on user input, authentication, or content submission.</p><h4>How to include real data with generated UI</h4><p>With the right AI tools, you can replace placeholder content for real data:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: You or your team can describe the data a feature needs in Anima’s Playground text prompt, and the system will generate databases and/ or tables based on the instructions. The data will be connected to the project and will automatically come with <a href=""https://www.animaapp.com/blog/product-updates/built-in-databases-for-anima-playground-zero-config-backend/?ref=fmt-handpicked"">default security policies</a> that match the intended usage.</li><li><strong>Cursor</strong>: With <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>, you can integrate your codebase (GitHub or GitLab) to give AI more context, as well as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkpZzs04-I"">connect MySQL database</a> to create elements like tables.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Manually configuring a database via extension to the Cursor tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0XQGV9bKFQb8nVp8VgxWGQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Cursor requires manual configuration to connect a database via extension to the AI agent</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: With Anima, just about anyone can create a database (even with no code knowledge). On the other hand, Cursor’s MySQL setup process is more technical and hands-on.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of using real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Discover problems early</strong>: Testing with real content surfaces UX gaps (like validation and edge-cases) before they become costly rework later</li><li><strong>Clear sense of readiness</strong>: When screens behave with actual data, it’s easier to know what’s ready for iteration versus what’s purely visual</li><li><strong>Reduced throwaway</strong>: By grounding UI in common behavior from the start, teams rely less on static mockups that will probably be discarded</li></ul><h4>Limits of integrating real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Developer input</strong>: Complex tables, queries, or structured data often need manual configuration beyond what AI can create</li><li><strong>Premature focus on data</strong>: Focusing on data structure before validating broader design concepts can distract from testing core user flows</li></ul><h3>Reuse and build off familiar patterns</h3><p>Many product teams rely on established UI components and patterns that AI ignores when generating screens. So teams have to rebuild or replicate familiar components, which adds unnecessary work and risks inconsistency.</p><p><strong>When screens don’t leverage existing assets or common interaction patterns, they won’t integrate with the rest of the product ecosystem</strong>. When AI can build off trusted patterns and components from the start, the generated UI becomes more durable, consistent, and easier to refine.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima’s Chrome extension lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hp-9Z4oohRw0brznSurstQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo""><em>Anima’s extension</em></a><em> lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website, as well as manage the elements in the right rail</em></figcaption></figure><h4>How to reuse what already exists</h4><p>Tools that allow you to grab existing elements to use in your generated UI:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: In <a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo"">Anima’s Chrome extension</a>, you can capture UI components directly from live websites using the Clipboard feature.

Similar to Anima, you can mix and match your components with existing patterns.</li><li><strong>KwikUI</strong>: KwikUI has a <a href=""https://www.kwikui.com/chrome-extension"">KwikSnap Chrome extension</a> that lets you screenshot webpages to web elements. After screenshotting, you can convert the images into coding prompts within KwikUI for more context-based output.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""YoinkUI’s Chrome extension lets you select and save elements from live sites"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0yU5q6lxr8LSr21ch5-QMA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yoinkui/ihlkclcengelgcfkkmpkhgadepmgijkk""><em>YoinkUI’s extension</em></a><em> lets you select and save single to grouped elements from any live website, like </em><a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/""><em>Airbnb</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: After capturing UI elements from the site of your choosing, you can select the Clipboard Gallery button in Anima Playground’s prompt to insert them into your generated screens.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Insert captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l7uEriwp1pss7WmedPH7fA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Insert your captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens to recycle real UI components and patterns</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits of reusing familiar patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster iteration</strong>: Designers can leverage existing UI and patterns, which reduces the need to recreate components from scratch</li><li><strong>Continuity across projects</strong>: Reused components help maintain a consistent look and feel; even generated and manual UI are combined</li><li><strong>Reduced cognitive load</strong>: Familiar patterns make it easier to evaluate new screens and maintain predictable interactions (for both product teams and end users)</li></ul><h4>Limits of reusing patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Captured UI may need adaptation</strong>: Elements from other sites may require cleanup or adjustment to fit the current project’s needs</li><li><strong>Legal and licensing</strong>: Reusing UI from external sources may require extra consideration to copyright or usage rules</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Generated UI begins to show actual value when it holds up under real-world constraints; not simply from its delivery speed or trendiness. Brand alignment, real data, and reuse makes early concepts sturdy, reliable, and less prone to be thrown away. These 3 constraints allow product teams to continue to iterate on generated UI instead of regenerating or starting from scratch.</p><p><strong>As AI tools like Anima and Lovable continue to evolve, their progress will be shown in how usable their output is past the demo phase</strong> (rather than producing work that will be discarded). Because when AI-generated work fits into product workflows and design constraints, it will start becoming part of the product development cycle.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=96b44ade04a1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-makes-generated-ui-worth-keeping-96b44ade04a1"">What makes generated UI worth keeping?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955992.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that nothing makes my beauty editor heart beat faster than finding a drugstore diamond in the rough. I’ve always been that way; my first makeup memories were in the aisles of CVS and Target, and I still gleefully peruse the stacks while waiting for a prescription to be filled.  </p>



<p>My latest discovery comes in the form of <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/conceal-perfect-blur-out-skin-tint-stick-pimprod2049385?sku=2635876"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick</a>, which I found via <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOoWoSLifRN/?igsh=MXd3ZDd1ZW9kcnI3eA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">makeup artist Alexandra French’s</a> (whose celebrity clients include Katy Perry, Mary Beth Barone, and Victoria Pedretti) rave review (an essential follow, BTW!). Keep reading for everything to know about this IYKYK product.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955818.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>What is Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick, and what are the benefits? </strong> </h2>



<p>It’s all in the name, really: Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick is a solid, cream-based product with the sheer, buildable coverage you would expect from a skin tint (and I’ve <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">tried several!</a>) with a soft-matte finish. Many products claim to lend a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blurred, filter-like effect</a>, but this one truly does — my pores and texture are almost undetectable when I have this on. It feels super lightweight on the skin, but is formulated with ingredients like moisturizing murumuru butter, strengthening vitamin E, and guava extract for a brightening boost of vitamin C.  </p>



<h2><strong>What makes Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick special? </strong> </h2>



<p>From the first swipe, I knew Milani’s Conceal + Perfect skin tint stick was something special — I audibly gasped when I saw the flawless shade match and sophisticated demi-matte finish. A little goes a long way (I’ve been testing mine for maybe two months now and still have plenty of product left), so the value aspect of this is also a major plus.  </p>



<p>I’ve tried a few high-end skin tint sticks ranging from Charlotte Tilbury to Dior, and Milani’s is by far my favorite — and the least expensive. What I love most about it is that it really does have an optical blurring effect — seriously, where did my pores go? — and a matte, but not flat finish that my oily skin loves. You can also layer this for extra coverage depending on how much you apply, but I usually will use a separate concealer in tandem with this if I’m craving more coverage around my forehead, chin, or nose.  </p>



<h2><strong>What to know about Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick: </strong> </h2>



<p>– Available in 25 shades . <br />– Sheer, buildable coverage with a soft-matte finish. <br />– Packed with moisturizing skincare ingredients and antioxidants. </p>



<h2><strong>How do you use Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick, and is it worth it?</strong> </h2>



<p>After prepping my skin with my morning skincare routine — serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen — and letting it absorb, I like to swipe Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick on the sides of my face, forehead, and chin. Then, I blend it out either with clean fingers or a fluffy brush like <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/flawless-face-brush-xlsImpprod14521237?sku=2500415"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f.’s Flawless Face Brush</a>. It sets within a minute or so, but if you’re extra oily or want it to stay in place all day, I recommend finishing with strategically placed loose powder and/or setting spray. (Again, this is totally optional!) My current favorites are the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/veil-translucent-setting-powder-P430240?skuId=2691046&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p430240:product"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hourglass Veil Translucent Setting Powder</a> and the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/airbrush-flawless-matte-blurring-waterproof-setting-spray-P516899"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Matte Blur Setting Spray</a>. </p>



<p>At $18.49, it performs like a much more expensive product; it glides on smoothly but doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. The coverage is also really customizable, allowing me to wear it as a true skin tint or as a more comprehensive complexion product. While it won’t completely mask active breakouts or hyperpigmentation, it does do an excellent job filtering out things like texture and pores. </p>



<h2><strong>Where can you get Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick? </strong> </h2>



<p>Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick is available at most mass beauty retailers and drugstores, including <a href=""https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwjyht-NuJ2SAxXbqloFHQ5vLfYYACICCAEQBxoCdnU&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAj8LLBhAkEiwAJjbY77IxIjuUCQjylWZ08MQe9sjPbCciNU-itMuGq0mYlTNz2jnfXKmA8BoCXJAQAvD_BwE&amp;cid=CAAS3gHkaPduJn0aey1-yyypCNHasupbOvxd42gN9wbQFTq5v3LxEWLCWiRG3B-J7dY64NJY4tzHH9K_NEo2vUtyrcu6vVotjQx7m4svFFJ4e1n26bqoyTnj_aBgUsNC1AaupguNH75132U1rPPshhgzU28OcHuKvJBrRfqTV_ICN27iCERbJnc10UQypOr6rSwInuUrugfrF3DZnx-J4PUTHNnDdE1MDYIycbRbfKwCKK_2DvE7R6qo-7tQ6_3l0LQHQg9EQcaf3BgeDi7G-kXxFvojWM0MkRNaQQJNDeWZOyI&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_32&amp;sig=AOD64_1CDFm6nn1yUCN2VkmC0HHNJgWJIw&amp;ctype=5&amp;q=&amp;nis=4&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitjdeNuJ2SAxUEVTABHR_GI1wQ5bgDKAB6BAgUEAs&amp;adurl="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ulta Beauty</a>, <a href=""https://amzn.to/3Ny4kYK"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a>, <a href=""https://goto.target.com/19E9yD"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a>, <a href=""https://www.cvs.com/shop/milani-conceal-perfect-blur-out-skin-tint-prodid-7200404?skuId=601813&amp;cgaa=QWxsb3dHb29nbGVUb0FjY2Vzc0NWU1BhZ2Vz"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CVS</a>, in addition to <a href=""https://www.milanicosmetics.com/products/conceal-perfect-blur-out-skin-tint"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milani’s website</a>.  </p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong> </h2>



<p>The best compliment I can give Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick is that it’s not just a good product at a competitive price point; it’s a good product that will upgrade your makeup routine <em>period. </em>It checks so many of my boxes (not super expensive, inclusive shade range, doesn’t break me out, long-lasting) and is just so good, I genuinely can’t believe more people aren’t talking about it — well, until now, that is. </p>

<p>Elusive and empathetic Neptune is re-entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Aries on January 26th</a>, offering us a second chance to understand the journey ahead. This time around, we’ll go full throttle in Aries to find our path until March 2039. The nearly 14-year transit is augmenting the world and our lives. </p>



<p>To understand how transit affects us, it’s essential to look to the past to gain a clearer perspective. When Neptune was previously in Aries, we’ve seen reformation, uprisings, and advancements in society, particularly in the medical and scientific fields. Empires have risen, and others have fallen in history when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune has been in Aries</a>. To sum it up, the good comes with its challenges — that is how Neptune rolls.  </p>



<p>Last year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune made a quick entrance into Arie</a>s from March 30th to October 22nd, then moonwalked back into Pisces.  In questionable times, people have sometimes turned to mysticism to give them a sense of control and order amidst the political chaos. Spiritual Neptune urges us to take action to change our lives by any means possible. We can expect more magic until 2039. </p>



<p>One of the most important astrological transits of the year occurs on February 20th, when Neptune and Saturn link up in Aries. This planetary connection is set to bring sweeping changes to the collective, ushering in a new state of mind. A new era of creativity, innovation, and societal transformation is unfolding. The 1989 Neptune and Saturn conjunction in Sagittarius coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the onset of the Velvet Revolution. Although the alignment of these two celestial entities occurs approximately every 36 years, it has been centuries since they last came together in Aries. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment of Neptune and Saturn in Aries is making our dreams a reality, as long as we approach our progress with pragmatism and remain committed to the cause.  </p>



<p>Take note: July is going to be a stellar month for Neptune in Aries! Neptune and Uranus in Gemini harmonize on July 15th, changing the way we communicate with others. Neptune and Jupiter in Leo gently touch each other on July 20th, enhancing our compassion and artistry. Neptune and Pluto in Aquarius spark each other up on July 25th, rebirthing our ideology with novel perspectives. We’ll use our voice to fight authoritative forces and trust our intuition to guide us through challenging situations and choices.  </p>



<p>The following 13 years are going to intensify the effects of Neptune in Aries. But 2026 is going to bring us into a higher state of consciousness. We have until 2039 to figure out our next steps. For now, we must prioritize ourselves. We hold the ultimate power over our own success. Don’t forget that! </p>

<p>Having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/combination-imbalanced-skincare-routine"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">combination skin</a> is like bringing all your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">different friendship groups</a> together on your birthday — but instead of enjoying yourself on the karaoke machine, you’re making sure they get along. Keeping every personality happy at once is no easy feat, and the same goes for managing two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-cleansing-routine-skin-type"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin types</a>. In my experience, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-moisturizer-for-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moisturizers for dry skin</a> tend to be unctuously thick, which can trigger breakouts, while those made for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oily skin</a> are often too light to make a difference. So when I find a product that does it all — quenching dry patches and delivering hydration without a greasy feel — I have to shout about it. Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s new Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. </p>



<h2>What is The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Don’t be fooled by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. At first glance, it looks like one of the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">many serums</a>, and while it boasts a lightweight, milky consistency and comes in a dropper bottle, this product is actually a moisturizer. </p>



<p>The Ordinary drew inspiration <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">from K-beauty</a>, specifically milky skincare textures, when developing this moisturizer, and its star ingredient — rice lipids — also nods to Eastern beauty rituals. You might be familiar with rice water in skincare, but lipids are a little different. NYC-based dermatologist <a href=""https://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/"">Joshua Zeichner, MD</a>, explains, “Rice lipids are natural fats derived from the outer layer of the rice grain known as the bran, and they have emollient benefits.” This, adds Dr. Zeichner, means they “fill in cracks” between cells on the surface of the skin. As a result, Dr. Zeichner explains that rice lipids can soften the outer skin layer, or what is known as the skin barrier.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, $13</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955647.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-ectoin-hydro-barrier-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ectoin, a skincare ingredient</a> that’s finally getting its dues in skincare. “Ectoin is a naturally derived compound that helps maintain a healthy skin barrier and protects skin from the environment,” says Dr. Zeichner. He adds that it’s naturally found in bacteria that live in extreme conditions, helping those bacteria to survive. “In skincare, it improves hydration and provides antioxidant benefits to prevent inflammation,” continues Dr. Zeichner. If your skin feels rough, flaky, or tight after cleansing, then ectoin is for you. Even better? It has a soothing effect on inflamed skin, and over time, it can help improve uneven skin texture.  </p>



<p>For the ingredient buffs, hydrating electrolyte molecules and amino acids — the building blocks of skin-strengthening proteins — are also present in this milky moisturizer. These are both present in the skin anyway, but sometimes our reserves run low, resulting in dry skin. But there’s good news: “These ingredients have been replicated and used in skincare products,” says Dr. Zeichner, “and they pull hydration into the skin.” As someone currently using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength retinol</a> and really feeling the effects of cold weather and central heating, this sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What makes The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion special? </h2>



<p>Lightweight moisturizers can be hit or miss. In fact, my bathroom cabinet is lined with gel-cream products that keep my oily T-zone happy but just don’t cut it on my dry patches, so I slotted this into my routine the day it landed at my door — and I’m so glad I did.  </p>



<p>I started using it after ditching a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength acid</a> that wrecked my skin barrier, and within just a couple of days, my skin had already recovered. It was less red and angry; the dry skin around my mouth had disappeared, and there was a subtle dewy sheen that meant I didn’t want to wear as much foundation. I ended up dropping my thicker moisturizer and shelving my hydrating serum, too, because this does it all. I even take it up to my eyes and use it as an eye cream — it’s that moisturizing. </p>



<p>Besides the powerhouse ingredients, how the moisturizer is made is pretty special. Without boring you with the science, the formula goes through microfluidization, a high-pressure mixing technique that blends light, water-based ingredients with slightly heavier, oil-based ones. The result? A lightweight, comfortable moisturizer that absorbs quickly but is substantial enough to hydrate even dry skin. </p>



<h2>What to know about The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion </h2>



<p>• Reduces visible skin redness after one use. </p>



<p>• Provides hydration for up to 24 hours and repairs a weakened skin barrier. </p>



<p>• Can be used in the morning and evening and comes in 60ml and 120ml bottles. </p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and is it worth it? </h2>



<p>My skincare routine is pretty simple. In the morning, I wash my face with a cream cleanser, apply a pipette-full of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin</a>, then finish with three finger lengths of sunscreen. In the evening, I double cleanse to remove all traces of makeup and sunscreen, apply Rice Lipids + Ectoin, and finish with my retinal serum. I find that, even though this moisturizer is featherlight, it provides a nice cushion for retinoids and helps reduce irritation and flaky patches of skin. </p>



<p>Because it’s such an all-rounder, I’ve happily and easily recommended it to anyone looking for a simple moisturizer that transcends seasons. While it’s working wonders on my skin this winter, it’ll be just as brilliant come spring and summer, thanks to its quenching feel and lack of any slippery residue. Better still, a 60ml bottle is only $13. If you love it as much as me, you grab the 120ml bottle, which is $22.50.  </p>

<p>We’ve never been very good at keeping secrets on the R29 beauty team. If anything, oversharing is our forte. That’s why, every year, we bring you the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/beauty-awards"">Beauty Innovator Awards</a>: a comprehensive edit of the products that genuinely improved our routines, earned us countless compliments, or simply made us feel really good. That’s the power of beauty, right? To transform the everyday. </p>



<p>This year, we’re doing things a little differently. For starters, our typically end-of-year roundup is here in January — and for good reason. True to our thorough approach, we’ve spent the entirety of 2025 swatching, testing, and using the newest launches down to the very last drop, separating the standouts from the so-so. </p>



<p>Whether your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/citric-acid-skincare-benefits"">skincare routine</a> needs a reset or you’re searching for a new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-find-signature-scent-fragrance"">signature scent</a>, we’ve got you covered. Ahead, find all of the best beauty products worth your money this year, hand-picked by our beauty team — because gatekeeping isn’t welcome in 2026. </p>

<p>“Every January, L’Oréal unveils a mascara to rival the previous year’s, and I’m convinced it’s impossible to beat the last one — but I’m always proven wrong. Big Deal is a serious upgrade on the Panorama Mascara, which scooped the top spot in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">2024’s Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a>, and I’ve barely gone a day without it. Most mascaras are too wet on the first swipe, but this one is perfect from the get-go. The springy, conic brush boasts two types of bristles to capture and thicken lashes in one swipe, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how easily it slips on. Just like its predecessor, it stays put until you decide to remove it at the end of the day. Smudges? Where?!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“My bathroom cabinet is lined with oils promising growth, shine, and 101 other benefits, but this is the one I always come back to — and the only oil I actually finished last year. I run a quarter of a pipette through towel-dried hair before blow-drying, and it leaves my hair shinier, softer, and healthier, without even a hint of heaviness. That’s thanks to glycolic acid, which smooths the hair cuticle to reduce frizz, plus hydrating hyaluronic acid suspended in a nourishing yet lightweight oil base. When I skip it, I really notice the difference. Even better, the subtle rose and sandalwood notes mean it doubles as a hair perfume.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve never met a heat protectant that didn’t make my hair feel greasy and look dull — until this. While it’s deeply conditioning thanks to a blend of plant oils and strand-strengthening proteins, it offers lightweight heat protection up to an impressive 450°F. I use it knowing it shields my hair from my flat iron without ever weighing it down, even if I accidentally apply too much. I recently gave a bottle to my mom, who has very dry, bleached blonde hair and usually relies on Olaplex, and she hasn’t stopped raving about how soft it leaves her hair — and how much easier it is to style. She’s a total convert.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“This no-frills cleanser is the skincare product I bought most in 2025. It feels like a lightweight lotion but transforms on contact with water into a silky milk that dislodges mascara and melts foundation, all without leaving skin feeling stripped or tight. The star ingredient is 5% rice milk, a key component in many dew-giving Korean skincare products, along with hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin. It does the job of an expensive cleanser at a fraction of the price, and it’s so quick I no longer dread washing my face at night. That’s no small feat!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“If you’ve asked me on any given day what lipstick I was wearing last fall, it was almost certainly this one. I usually never wear matte liquid lipsticks, and for a few reasons: Too many of them are uncomfortably dry, go on patchy, or migrate at first bite or sip. I was already a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.violettefr.com%2Fproducts%2Fpetal-bouche-amour-fou%3Fvariant%3D43587553755325"">Violette_FR’s iconic Petal Bouche</a> matte liquid lipstick, but its newer addition, Plume Lip, is even better. It has the most incredible whipped texture that effortlessly glides onto lips, and doesn’t feel like dry cement once it sets. I audibly gasped after I swatched the rosy brown Châtaigne Grillée (aka my new go-to for everyday wear) — <em>that’s </em>how stunning she is IRL. Because I’m in my soft girl era, I’m especially loving Plume Lip’s diffused, blurred finish, which is just so pretty and romantic.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“Another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lancome-lip-idole-juicytreat-gloss-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">breakout favorite among R29’s beauty editors</a> appeared in the form of Lancôme’s JuicyTreat Lip Oil Gloss, which proved that lightning can indeed strike twice. (This, said by a girl who keeps a Juicy Tubes in every bag.) I’m convinced the magic is in the hydrating, naturally plumping benefits, thanks to the squalane-packed formula. Any gloss can sit atop lips with a shiny finish, but true ‘juiciness’ comes from lips that are soft and nourished, then made even better by gloss. No notes — just more shades in 2026, please!” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve lost count of how many blushes — from pressed powders to creams — landed on my desk in 2025, but this is the only one I used consistently. It’s a chunky product, so you only need a single swipe, and it has a subtle iridescence that makes my skin look alive. When I have to join a last-minute virtual call, it’s the product I reach for to look fresh in seconds. I pop it on my cheeks, lids, and lips, and I’m always impressed by how well it stays put, even though it’s a cream.

<p>“I recently donated a foot of my hair, and while I love my new bob, the styling learning curve is real. For days when I don’t feel like using a curling iron to enhance my natural waves, I’ve been using mousse as an easy air-dry hack, and my favorite from recent history is, without a doubt, Crown Affair’s Texturizing Air Dry Mousse. It’s easily the most sophisticated mousse I’ve ever tried, and I’m convinced it’s the closest thing to what clouds must feel like. The weightlessness, airy foam has none of the crunch I knew (and hated) from back in the day, and the soft scent (Crown Affair’s signature blend of bergamot, yuzu, and lemongrass) is clean and refreshing. I finger-comb three or four pumps of the stuff into damp strands and watch as my hair air-dries in soft, tousled waves with just the right amount of bounce.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

Designed in tandem with the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">existing DIY gel system</a>, Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel polishes (retailing for $12 each) are thicker in texture than traditional gel polish, creating a strong, supportive barrier to help grow your natural nails.

<p>“Last June, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">best skin tint</a> for people with olive skin, and I stand by it — I’ve been using it ever since. I’ve tried multiple high-end skin tints and foundations over the past year, but I always come back to this one. It’s more substantial than other tints I’ve tried, yet the coverage is perfect — not too thick, but pigmented enough to blur dark circles and acne marks. It blends in seconds, leaves my skin looking healthy and radiant, <em>and</em> has mineral protection in the form of SPF 50. A pea-sized amount covers my face and neck, and it lasts well into the evening.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

Cosmetics’ Halo Glow Skin Tint</a> was my go-to for most of last year, besting several formulas (including those double the price) in my extensive collection. Nothing I’ve tried (and I’ve tried what feels like hundreds) compares to its lightweight hydration and sheer veil of coverage. (Added SPF 50 is a welcome bonus, even if it doesn’t replace sunscreen as a separate step — say it with me!) I also want to shoutout the niacinamide and bisabol in the formula, two ingredients that my notoriously breakout-prone skin loves. Anything with ‘glow’ in the name tends not to suit my oily complexion, but Halo Glow actually has a wearable, not greasy, finish that genuinely looks like you don’t have makeup on.

Waving hair can feel like a chore, but this lets me take bigger sections and finish in half the time.

I had to get my hands on a bottle, and I can confirm it’s incredible. It’s equal parts spicy and floral, thanks to creamy jasmine and clean sandalwood, while the ‘solar’ notes make it warm and comforting, like cozying up in your favorite cashmere sweater. Everyone compliments me when I wear it.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“Last week, I left the house without this and had to turn back to get it — even though I was already a 20-minute walk away by the time I realized. That’s how I knew it deserved a Beauty Innovator Award. One swipe delivers a sheer wash of color, and while it feels like a lip gloss at first, it dries down to a comfortable, moisturizing balm that leaves my usually parched lips feeling soothed and soft. That’ll be the shea butter and plant oils. I’m convinced the subtle shimmer makes my lips look more plump. My go-to shade is Galaxy, which leaves behind a hint of blackberry.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em> </p>

<p>“I’ve really put this hairspray through its paces. The first time I used it was before a 10-hour flight that turned into a 24-hour travel day thanks to delays. Even though I slept in it, my waves didn’t budge an inch — so much so that my travel companions were convinced I’d packed a portable curling iron and redone my hair in the airport bathroom. While it delivers a strong hold, there’s no hint of crispiness. Instead, hair stays glossy, flexible, and completely resistant to humidity. Better still, you can brush it out, and it’s like it was never even there. No flakes, no stickiness, nothing.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I was a big fan of Kosas’ debut mascara, The Big Clean, which packed lash serum-like ingredients in an inky black, volumizing mascara. And while brands discontinuing a beloved product is usually a good way to ruin my day, Kosas’ sophomore mascara was a rare exception. The brand’s<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Soulgazer Mascara</a> was indeed an improvement in every sense. It retained the serum-grade, conditioning peptides with none of the clumping that some users experienced with The Big Clean.

<p>“Call me biased, as I’m a Brit, but UK skincare brand Medik8 really broke the mold with this moisturizer. It’s packed with all the ingredients skin needs to maintain bounce, radiance, and strength. Think peptides that help preserve the skin’s collagen reserves, keeping it soft and supple; polyglutamic acid, which hydrates far more deeply than hyaluronic acid; and growth factors to further support collagen and elastin, the two key proteins that give skin structure and help prevent fine lines. Applying it after cleansing feels like a relief — it eases tightness and leaves skin silky and comfortable.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“That’s right: Shark impressed us so much that they are a double-BIA winner this year.

<p>“I finished this body wash months ago, and I’m still thinking about it. While its main job is to cleanse, the added ingredients make it feel like a treatment. Glycolic acid (an AHA) gently exfoliates and helps fade the marks left by body breakouts, while salicylic acid (a BHA) prevents clogged pores from forming in the first place. Despite a satisfying lather, it’s deeply moisturizing thanks to shea butter and glycerin — I often skipped body lotion altogether.

<p>“I’ve been a ZIIP devotee ever since getting a facial from founder Melanie Simon several years ago; I’ll never forget seeing my skin visibly lifted and brighter after one session with her, and continued to use the brand’s hero product, the Halo, to help tone facial muscles, address uneven tone, and treat breakouts — that’s right, it does it all, thanks to the power of nano- and microcurrent. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ziip-dot-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ZIIP’s latest device, the Dot</a>, brings the same technology in a palm-sized, acne-focused tool that retails for half of the Halo.

I love Tatcha’s original Dewy Moisturizer, but my skin adores this lightweight version even more — so much so that I’ve gone through two bottles in the past year. That’s saying something considering how many moisturizers I need to try for my job. While it’s thinner than its original counterpart, it still delivers a hydrating punch. And the dew? Unrivaled.

<p>“I loved this fragrance so much that I wore it on my wedding day last year. (It is now stored in a cool, dark room so I can treasure it forever.) The crisp mix of citrus, white florals, and musk is undeniably romantic, but not super girly or feminine. At first spritz, the bright bergamot and orange blossom are invigorating and clean, but as the scent dries down, I pick up on the lingering floral notes left behind. (This is also a scent that will stay for hours, from getting-ready to dancing the night away.) As the name suggests, it’s an olfactive interpretation of snowy slopes and the cozy appeal of <em>après-ski </em>— fitting as we said ‘I do’ at our favorite ski mountain.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping.

For starters, it’s thick — probably the most dense I’ve tried. But it delivers instant, long-lasting relief for very dry, flaky skin, with results that last for hours. When I use it at night, I wake up to skin that looks and feels brand new. That’s thanks to squalane, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin, alongside skin-smoothing ceramides, hydrating niacinamide and cholesterol — a natural lipid that helps repair and maintain the skin barrier, keeping moisture in and bacteria out. The most interesting thing about this moisturizer, though, is the way it dispenses: it comes out like whipped cream.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out.

<p>I’m very lucky to have access to some of the world’s top dermatologists and skincare professionals thanks to my line of work. Whenever I ask them for product recommendations — whether it’s the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">best retinol serum</a> or the right <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sunscreen-spf-on-airplane-flights"">sunscreen to wear on a plane</a> — one brand invariably gets lots of love: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laroche-posay.us%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">La Roche-Posay</a>.</p>



<p>The French skincare brand, which recently turned 50 years old, will likely already sound familiar if you’re a fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drugstore-beauty-products"">drugstore beauty</a>. Its hero products have gone viral many times over, in particular the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcicaplast-balm-b5-soothing-therapeutic-multi-purpose-cream-pimprod2018263%3Fsku%3D2570171"">Cicaplast Balm B5</a>, which has racked up <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/cicaplast-baume-b5?lang=en"">millions of views on TikTok</a> for its myriad uses, mainly to aid skin repair and hydration.</p>



<p>But all this immense social media hype isn’t merely skin deep. La Roche-Posay is a leading brand in <a href=""https://www.lorealprofessionalskincare.com/lrp/clinical-studies"">research on the microbiome</a>, aka the trillions of microorganisms (think friendly bacteria, fungi, and so much more) that make up the largest organ of the body — the skin. What’s more, most of its product range contains thermal spring water sourced from La Roche-Posay, an actual place in France, which is rich in minerals that have calming and soothing benefits for the skin.</p>



<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Ahead, we’ve asked leading dermatologists to share their favorite La Roche-Posay products and what they’d recommend to patients with various skin concerns.</p>

<p>“I often recommend this serum to women of color, who are predisposed to hyperpigmentation.

For patients prone to hyperpigmentation when getting a chemical peel or microdermal abrasion, I put them on this serum for two to four weeks prior [as hyperpigmentation can be a <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3560165/"">side effect</a> after the procedure].

<p>“I live in Colorado, and many of my patients struggle with dry skin. They’d moisturize with lotions and tell me that their skin still feels really dry. In a lot of cases, they are actually using the wrong body wash. The easiest thing I’d recommend is switching to this shower oil, since it moisturizes while cleansing the skin. The formula is oil-based, so it gives you that extra moisture boost before you even exit the shower and put on body cream.

<p>“I always say that the best sunscreen is the one that you want to put on every day. I love this SPF moisturizer for that exact reason; the cosmetically elegant formula feels so nice that you actually don’t mind putting it on. It’s ultra lightweight, absorbs in seconds, and provides SPF 50 broad-spectrum protection, while hyaluronic acid leaves the skin looking dewy. The pump dispenser is so convenient, too. I have dry skin, and this one is my go-to.” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drheathermd"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Woolery-Lloyd</a></em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955585.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple of seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple of years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and be sure to also look out for coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the trending <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. There are also non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.</p>

<p><em>You say you want change?</em> Well, the time has come! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">Action planet Mars</a> is entering the sign of Aquarius, encouraging us to push back popular notions and lean into our one-of-a-kind perspectives. The opportunity to express ourselves is here. As a result, we’ll be able to direct our attention toward the future and take steps to set the intention that will help us attain our dream. First, we must get out of our comfort zones and take a leap of faith. Every visionary has begun their journey here. Let’s get it started! The path less taken is ready for us to walk down. </p>



<p>It’s been over a year since Mars was in the Air sign of Aquarius. Now that it’s coming back into orbit, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">January 23rd to March 2nd</a>, we are reaffirming our commitment to causes and striving to give our best to care for others in our community. Mars in Aquarius isn’t shy about giving us the stamina to assert ourselves. Still, this transit does require a more innovative approach to taking a stance and defining our needs and desires. This often marks a time of uprising and rebellion, when we speak our minds and take a stand to assert our personal beliefs. Note that this can transcend in any form — from something as simple as defying the “norms” of relationships to fashion trends to peer groups. We’re elevating our lives to showcase our unique sentiments, feelings, and talents. </p>



<p>While it is fantastic to captivate an audience and to hold personal power, the caveat is that once we get on our soapboxes, it’ll be hard to listen to different perspectives and not force our ideals onto others. Knowing when to slow down and take a step back can be challenging, but it’s essential. To effect change in the world, we must have an open mind and accept that everyone holds different views — even if we disagree with them. However, having an active discourse and debate is a great way to harness the diverse ways people think. A moderator, or mutual acquaintance, should be present to ensure we do not take the conversation too far — especially on January 19th, when Mars and Pluto form a conjunction in Aquarius (this is an astrological aspect that occurs when two planets come together in the same sign and degree) triangulating circumstances.   </p>



<p>Being a social justice warrior will be at the forefront of our hearts and passions. Still, it’s also vital to examine situations that require assistance on both a smaller scale and a collective level. Focusing on social dynamics, injustices, and local issues in our neighborhoods or cities will be necessary. Try to be more involved in politics, voter registration, or even participate in charitable endeavors. Paying it forward will be rewarding on many levels, particularly when it comes to our aspirations to better the common good — a vibe we will feel during the Snow Full Moon in Leo on February 1st. </p>



<p>When it comes to friendships and relationships, we often find ourselves drawn to those who align with our aspirations. Looking at the people who add fun, excitement, and push us to think outside the box propels us to regenerate our lives and be different. Their presence reassures and inspires us to be our best, most authentic selves. We can live freely and authentically, thanks to Mars in Aquarius. February 27th motivates us to take the leap towards confidence and embracing ourselves, due to Uranus in Taurus squaring off with Mars. We’ll want to make a break into the purest essences that define us. </p>



<p>Mars in Aquarius is going to be a moment in which we strive to be greater. We aren’t going to sit back and let life happen. Be bold and daring! By taking a firm stand, we can do our best to implement transformation and evolution — not only in the world but also in our personal lives. The goal is to improve in any way we can, so what are you waiting for?</p>
