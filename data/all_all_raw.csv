<p>After its completion in late 2023, Tianlin Park1 designed by VIASCAPE has been receiving positive public feedbacks. Coincidentally, teachers from Xuhui Science and Technology Kindergarten2 visited Tianlin park multiple times during 2024–2025, both spontaneously and in organized groups. They found that the natural habitat design, which integrated into the holistic landscape experience, closely aligns with their ongoing early childhood nature education program. This led to an initial contact with VIASCAPE through connections, in which they expressed a strong interest in collaborating on the landscape enhancement of their kindergarten's Wending campus (hereinafter referred to as ""the kindergarten""). Following this initial contact in April 2025, VIASCAPE design team was invited to give a tour guide for the kindergarten teachers, introducing the landscape-oriented natural habitat design in Tianlin Park. During the visit, design team also elaborated on the concept and value of ""urban habitat,"" an integrated approach that combines natural, vibrant, and cultural elements. This process laid a solid foundation for the following collaborative design marked by mutual inspiration.</p>",

<h4><strong>The shift in product design with the advent of AI and a potential generative experiential future</strong></h4><blockquote>This short essay explores how core concepts in AI can reframe how product designers think about feedback, intent, and the future of our role.</blockquote><p>A lot has been written about the evolution of user experience since before I ever sat in a Barnes &amp; Noble for hours, trying to understand what the letters “H, C, and I” even meant. In the twelve years since that moment, the tools we use have matured, the rules for interaction have solidified, and the role of design has expanded. We have become a bridge connecting users, businesses, and the technologies that serve them.</p><p>Now, with artificial intelligence entering the public mainstream, a new question emerges: <em>where do we go from here?</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/767/1*l9X1bG4711j9SH6efndG5g.png"" /></figure><p>I am not here to push anyone toward <a href=""https://medium.com/@jacquelynyakira/thoughts-on-the-future-of-product-design-in-an-ai-first-world-621be208bfa5"">vibe coding</a>, <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/figma-make-the-biggest-shift-in-ux-ui-since-sketch-5483e18f76d7"">Figma Mak</a>e, or any particular path. Instead, I want to share an idea that came to me while learning the basics of how large language models work. It is a way to start connecting core concepts across domains and help product designers bridge toward the next era of technology. As we move beyond conversational interfaces, we will need new ways of thinking about how to interact with this emerging intelligence.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/451/1*4Psy0Mc7Nh5fyPS89nz9HA.png"" /></figure><p>At the top, I want to recognize that, for the purposes of this article, the term <em>product design</em> can mean many things. Even <a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-product-design/"">Figma’s own definition</a> lists responsibilities that extend far beyond “pushing pixels.” Product designers excel when they have a deep understanding of how technology works and how the business measures success. Whether supporting key metrics or shaping strategy, our work brings together different domains.</p><p>To do that well, we already think in systems, frameworks, research, and telemetry to influence metrics and drive better outcomes. If we take that same mindset and apply it to concepts from AI such as <strong>training corpus, loss, gradients, and intent</strong>, we can start to see a future where design is not just about arranging interfaces but about understanding <em>how systems learn</em>. That is the bridge I want to explore.</p><h3><strong>What AI teaches us about feedback and learning</strong></h3><p>In almost every conversation about technology today, one word keeps surfacing: <em>data.</em> It shapes the experiences we design, the decisions businesses make, and the intelligence that powers modern systems. For this section, I want to focus on how data in AI can teach us something about our own design process, specifically how we learn and iterate.</p><figure><img alt=""Generic graph showing points as if plotted on an x- and y-axis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*5IW-t0Tmhfn0pJTGytGu4w.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s pretend we have a bunch of data at our disposal.</figcaption></figure><p>In user experience, we often work with two types of data: qualitative, which describes what people say, and quantitative, which describes what they do or how often they do it. Let’s focus on the quantitative side for a moment. Imagine plotting the results of a usability study on a simple x and y axis, showing effort versus success rate. Now imagine doing something similar with the data an AI model learns from, what’s called its <strong><em>training corpus</em></strong><em> </em>(<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90916291/what-is-a-corpus-ai-corpora-chatgpt"">FastCompany’s article “What is a ‘corpus’”</a>)<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Sample graphs, showing hypothetical data points along an x- and y-axis, one depicting sample usability data and the other training data for an LLM."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*YWP-fStx1-W9Jfr1rHGFWQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s imagine plotting our data, once for a usability study and another for our training data.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, an LLM’s data isn’t really this simple, but as a metaphor it helps. Once both sets of data are visualized, we can imagine drawing a line that represents our average user response on one chart and the AI’s predicted understanding on the other. The distance between those lines represents something that exists in both worlds: the gap between what we <em>expect</em> and what we <em>observe.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Hypothetical graphs with data points and an overlayed line on each showing average user response and the other illustrating an LLM’s prediction understanding from training data."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*NKc49UaujgiY5KKwqm2xOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Now let’s visualize what, as a green line, the average user response or an LLM’s prediction might look like.</figcaption></figure><p>In design, we call that <em>friction.</em> In AI, it’s called <strong><em>loss</em></strong><em>.</em> Both terms describe the cost of being wrong. When we iterate on a flow or redesign a feature to remove friction, we are, in a sense, minimizing loss. Each round of testing gives us more data to adjust our model of the user’s mental model, just as machine learning systems adjust their internal weights to better predict outcomes (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function"">IBM: What is Loss Function</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Two graphs showing difference between average lines and data points, illustrating the connected concept(s) of user friction and loss."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/1*W-btC1pdHsjJgBsaIvK-nA.png"" /><figcaption>Difference between our predictions and reality impact our work exponentially irregardless if it is for an experience or an LLM we are creating.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider an onboarding flow where users repeatedly abandon a form at the “Company Name” field. Once identified, we might re-label the field or make it optional, reducing friction and improving completion rates. That adjustment mirrors how an AI system corrects its parameters after identifying an error.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating data points towards desired average path to highlight how iteration and optimization are key for usability and LLM performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*XD_oG9iPScZzYRwO7Vjy7w.png"" /><figcaption>Tweaking an LLM’s parameters, or iterating on an experience, helps us optimize both.</figcaption></figure><p>This is where the concept of <strong><em>gradients</em></strong> comes in. In machine learning, a gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed to reduce loss. Think of it like rolling a ball down a landscape toward the lowest point (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent"">IBM: What is Gradient Descent?</a>). The slope tells the model how to adjust its parameters to improve performance. In product design, we do something similar every time we interpret usability data or customer feedback to decide what to change next. Our gradient is directional insight, the sense of where to move to make the experience smoother.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating a curved line representing a downward slope, a gradient descent, with a data point at the bottom showing zero loss or friction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*qHoM1I0rStyKAZN37XXCng.png"" /><figcaption>By tweaking parameters, of an LLM or an experience, we should see a reduction of friction and loss until they, ideally, disappear.</figcaption></figure><p>The iterative process that defines good design is, in many ways, a form of gradient descent. We identify where users struggle, adjust our assumptions, and measure again. Over time, our understanding converges toward what users need. It is not perfect, but neither are machine learning models; both are approximations refined through feedback.</p><p>If there’s one takeaway from this parallel, it’s that feedback, whether from people or from data, is not an afterthought. It’s the learning mechanism that keeps systems aligned with reality. And just as models can overfit to their training data, teams can overfit to internal assumptions or stakeholder preferences. In both cases, the cure is the same: structured, ongoing feedback loops that balance exploration with correction.</p><h3>Design as a system of optimization</h3><p>Now that we understand the shared language of feedback and learning between design and AI, it helps to zoom out and look at how these loops exist across every layer of our work. Most senior product designers already know that the interfaces we craft are only one piece of a much larger system. As noted in <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/"">Nielsen Norman’s levels of UX maturity</a>, mature groups and practitioners move beyond pixels to build frameworks, strategic models, and alignment structures. Even at these higher levels, tight loops of feedback and iteration guide what we do.</p><p>If learning and iteration exist at every level, our role is to understand how those levels connect. Each one has its own kind of <em>loss</em> to minimize and its own signals to optimize. We can roughly think of three layers at play:</p><ul><li><strong>Designers optimizing interfaces</strong>: reducing friction and improving micro-interactions (<em>micro Jobs to Be Done</em>).</li><li><strong>Interfaces optimizing user journeys</strong>: helping people complete the key <em>Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)</em> that deliver product value.</li><li><strong>Organizations optimizing outcomes</strong>: aligning those journeys to business metrics such as adoption, retention, and revenue.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating three key levels in enterprise product design design and various focuses and example intents."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/1*u_7UvtufIi01PV66ZQC8RA.png"" /><figcaption>Product designers working strategically naturally optimize across three key layers in their work. Leveraging key signals across each level, alongside the goals (or intents), lets us understand the loss and how we can iterate to eliminate loss.</figcaption></figure><p>At the first level, designers focus on immediate signals like click rates or error events to reduce friction and guide users toward small but meaningful completions. At the next level, we expand our view to higher-order goals, such as “users complete their profile within thirty days.” These are composite outcomes that indicate whether our product fulfills its promises. Finally, at the organizational level, we zoom out again to see how entire journeys and feature sets contribute to larger KPIs and OKRs. Each level informs the others, forming a continuous loop of optimization from micro-interaction to business strategy.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating simplified click-path and sample metrics across three optimization levels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*sjffZcAXhKJXXoqAhS5v7g.png"" /><figcaption>Mapping optimization cycles in traditional experiential design, with accompanying signals, might look something like this.</figcaption></figure><p>As product designers, our work is shifting away from static interfaces and toward orchestrating these systems of <strong><em>intent</em></strong> which I mentally still hold in the same place as a JTBD. With the looming advent of more generative experiences, our influence lies less in deciding where each pixel goes and more in defining the <em>direction</em> a system should learn toward. Our task becomes identifying the goals for each layer, ensuring the feedback flowing through them is meaningful, and guiding the system to reduce its loss at every scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Simple graphic illustrating how a simple set of activities could change with inclusion of generative UI elements and their potential new signals for measurement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*8sMLLbyQ0JBSwfxSUin98g.png"" /><figcaption>Signals become more about accuracy of identifying user needs (intent) and correlating actions an LLM takes towards supporting desired outcomes (such as delivering most impactful copy to encourage someone to purchase a product).</figcaption></figure><p>Doing that requires data and this is where many organizations struggle. In my experience at both small and large enterprise companies, few have mature instrumentation strategies that connect in-product signals to their KPIs or OKRs. The result is a blind spot: teams can’t see how user intent translates to business outcomes, especially in environments increasingly shaped by AI. When instrumentation is thoughtfully designed, those signals become the gradients we follow. They allow us to see where experiences fall short, measure how far off the mark they are, and iteratively align the product, the user, and the business.</p><p>Directionally similar to other schools of thought, such as from Claudia Canales’ <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/beyond-the-model-a-systems-approach-to-ai-product-design-fd9917750993"">Beyond the Model: a systems approach to AI product design</a>, positioning design as a system, I see it as one of optimization and not creating perfect screens. It’s about cultivating feedback systems that learn alongside users. When product designers learn to interpret intent, orchestrate signals, and balance the goals of each layer, we build the foundation for truly adaptive, AI-infused experiences.</p><h3>From control to guidance</h3><p>As product designers, many of us are used to controlling every element of the experience. But as generative systems begin composing parts of the interface for us, our value shifts from crafting the final form to defining the conditions that shape it. We move from being <em>the maker</em> to being <em>the guide</em> — designing how intent, data, and feedback interact to keep the system aligned with human goals.</p><p>Imagine opening your design tool and seeing a generative prototype already built around inferred intent. You don’t redraw components; you evaluate signals: <em>Did the model understand the job correctly? Did the feedback loop close?</em> That shift, from crafting to curating, is one direction our craft might be headed. Our influence doesn’t disappear; it evolves.</p><p>When we see design as a system of optimization, we stop treating AI as a separate discipline, or the latest tool to use, and start seeing it as a mirror. It reflects how we already work: learning, adjusting, and seeking balance between human intent and technical possibility. The next evolution of design isn’t about replacing what we do, but about scaling how we learn.</p><p>In the next article of this series, I’ll explore how instrumentation and <em>Jobs to Be Done</em> can serve as the connective tissue between intent and measurement — the practical levers we can use to steer generative systems toward meaningful outcomes.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1d372707472d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

At the top is an iPad-like screen with an arrow labelled decode pointing down to smaller pieces. Another arrow labelled reorder points right to a rearranged screen. The final arrow labelled rebuild points up to the original screen."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zYZTPyhARpMMjBuUMMKo7A.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This article focuses on individuals who use products in English, despite their native language being different — those who reconstruct the context when perceiving information in English.</p><p>About 1.19 billion people use English as an additional language, <a href=""https://www.icls.edu/blog/most-spoken-languages-in-the-world"">compared with</a> 390 million native speakers — leaving 810 million non-native English users worldwide.</p><p>Since English content accounts for roughly <a href=""https://www.isocfoundation.org/2023/05/what-are-the-most-used-languages-on-the-internet/"">55% of all websites</a>, while only about 16 % of the world’s population speak English — including both native and non-native speakers — a large share of those users navigate the web in a language they learned later in life.</p><h3>What is context reconstruction and why it matters</h3><h4>How non-native English speakers perceive information</h4><p>When users interact with content in a non-native language, they don’t just read — they reconstruct. Context reconstruction is a three-step, non-linear loop where users decode unfamiliar words or syntax, translate them inwardly, then rebuild the intended meaning before deciding how to act. It’s not a passive process but an active, effortful one.</p><p><a href=""https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1214282.pdf"">Studies on second-language comprehension</a> show that readers use strategies like translation, paraphrasing, and contextual inference to reconstruct meaning. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/8/1/86"">Research on bilingual reading</a> confirms this process — users draw on background knowledge and context to bridge linguistic gaps.</p><p>In digital interfaces, <a href=""https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/9608"">this reconstruction extends beyond reading</a>: multilingual users interpret layout, structure, and tone through the same active meaning-making loop, as UX research on multilingual personas highlights.</p><p>When users process content in a second language, the reconstructive loop <a href=""https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/15502/1/A.E.Schweitzer%20PhD%20Thesis%20November%202016.pdf"">increases cognitive load</a>. Native speakers usually integrate syntax and meaning almost automatically. For non-native speakers, this integration slows down — the brain weighs <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022537179903554"">multiple interpretations before resolving the right one</a> — even when the surrounding context favours only one.</p><p>This pause — invisible but measurable — is where comprehension friction begins.</p><h4>How reconstruction principles apply to native speakers</h4><p>The cognitive load described in multilingual users isn’t unique to them. Similar friction appears for people with <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10036960/?utm"">lower literacy levels or certain cognitive disabilities</a>. Comprehension challenges like decoding, restructuring, and inferring meaning are shared <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility?utm"">across many cognitive differences</a>. Design patterns that reduce this gap benefit everyone, not only international users — accessibility and language clarity go hand in hand.</p><p>The term ‘native speaker’ itself <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8517917/"">oversimplifies</a> how people use and learn languages. It combines factors like identity, exposure, and cultural background into a binary label that hides real proficiency differences and often reinforces bias. Instead of defining audiences by birth language, teams can describe them through language exposure and functional fluency.</p><p>Setting writing targets around those needs is more practical — for example, aiming for B1–B2 readability levels on the <a href=""https://readable.com/readability/readability-formulas/"">Flesch-Kincaid scale</a> supports broad comprehension across audiences.</p><p>Looking ahead, the line between native and non-native is already blurring. Trans-languaging — the natural mixing of languages — is common in global teams. UX copy isn’t just read by non-native speakers, it’s often <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/were-spilling-the-tea-spotify-ux-writing-questions-answered"">written by them</a>. Inclusive language isn’t just good UX — it’s sound <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/content-design-practices-for-sustainable-communication-in-tech-cbfc679be0cc"">workplace practice</a>.</p><h4>Business perspective on the topic</h4><p>For global products, English source copy should work like a blueprint — clear, structured, and easy to adapt. When it’s written in plain language, localisation teams can translate the meaning without losing intent. That clarity travels: it reduces rework, speeds up releases, and makes products easier to use in any language.</p><p>Plain content also saves money. Teams that act on clear copy often see fewer support requests and faster resolutions — <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02737"">in some studies</a>, ticket volume dropped by up to 25 % after improving language clarity.</p><p>The same practices that make content easier to translate also make it <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-023-00986-z"">more accessible</a>. Structured, readable text reduces cognitive load for people with learning or attention differences — and helps non-native speakers too. Poor localisation <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2022/6942735"">does the opposite</a>: it confuses users, adds cost, and quietly blocks conversions.</p><p>Language clarity isn’t just a UX win — it’s a business one. Aligned copy, culture, and layout turn communication into scale, making products more inclusive and more efficient at the same time — whether users are solving a problem, completing a task, or looking for quick answers inside a product.</p><h3>Designing for reconstruction</h3><h4>Quality benchmarks</h4><p>Making content reconstruction-ready takes small but deliberate shifts — across language, structure, process, and testing. The checklist below helps teams spot risks early and build toward equity at scale.</p><p><strong>Plain language: </strong><a href=""https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language"">Use plain verbs and avoid idiomatic phrasing</a>: ‘Create account’ or ‘Register’ instead of ‘Sign up’, ‘Start trial period’ rather than ‘Get started’. This reduces parsing complexity and helps meaning travel better across languages.</p><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Collect key terms in a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/product-glossary-simple-tool-for-consistent-content-960f8ea1b94f"">product glossary</a> and use them consistently. Avoid synonyms that fragment meaning — if you use ‘plan’ in one screen, don’t switch to ‘package’ or ‘bundle’ elsewhere. Consistency keeps terms stable across journeys and translations.</p><p><strong>Structure: </strong>Clear structure — one of content design’s core principles — <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1305134/full"">improves comprehension</a> for non-native readers and supports accessibility for all.</p><p>Start with information architecture: make navigation transparent and logical. Let users move back, pause, or finish a task midway. Use bullet lists to clarify choices and keep headings, buttons, and labels predictable. This saves time and makes content easy to scan and act on.</p><p>Good structure also supports fast problem-solving — users should find answers where they expect them, without scanning or guessing.</p><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Plain, well-structured content also boosts accessibility. Around <a href=""https://www.allaccessible.org/blog/web-accessibility-statistics-the-impact-of-disabilities-on-web-use"">16 % of the world’s population</a> live with some form of disability, and small design choices determine whether they can use products effectively.</p><p>Avoid embedding text in images, and always provide alt-text that adds missing context rather than repeating labels.</p><p>Clear hierarchy and scannable sections also make self-help content and automated responses easier to use for people under cognitive load.</p><p><strong>Localisation: </strong>Consider localisation from the wireframe stage. Write source copy that can stand on its own, so meaning stays clear when removed from layout for translation. Even a short phrase like ‘Info updated’ can be misinterpreted — reflexive in one context, passive in another. For example, translators may not know if it means ‘The system updated the info’ or ‘The user updated the info’.</p><figure><img alt=""A split illustration compares two versions of a screen with the text Info updated. On the left, a blue background shows a paper-like character pressing its own button labelled Updated. On the right, a purple background shows a hand pressing the same button. The image shows how the phrase Info updated can mean either the system updated the information or the user did."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AxBc9ygNg7C1OaiZL2e6Pg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Integrate continuous-localisation tools early to prevent late copy freezes and rework.</p><p><strong>Test and research:</strong> Include non-native speakers in every usability round. Ask them to pause and explain what they think a piece of copy means — you’ll quickly see where reconstruction fails.</p><p>Testing this way exposes issues that standard metrics often miss and helps build empathy across teams. Include tasks that mirror real support interactions — finding help, clarifying messages, or following troubleshooting steps — to reveal hidden friction.</p><h4>Reconstruction blocks</h4><p>When users reconstruct meaning, language and layout can either support or block that process. Even small mismatches can escalate into task failure. Beyond well-known localisation issues like <a href=""https://m2.material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-layout"">directionality</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/@finnclark/designing-for-localisation-what-you-could-be-thinking-about-320184be10a9"">text expansion</a> there are recurring but less obvious tensions.</p><p>These patterns create friction in comprehension and task completion — addressing them early reduces errors, rework, and user frustration.</p><p><strong>Phrasal verbs: </strong>Phrases like ‘Sign up’ or ‘Sign in’ <a href=""https://riyajawandhiya.medium.com/figuring-out-when-to-use-sign-up-vs-register-vs-join-while-looking-at-principles-of-ux-writing-26d299f514dc"">often confuse users</a> — even native speakers. The difference feels small but delays action, especially when both appear on the same screen.</p><p>Use clear, literal verbs that describe the action. These forms translate more reliably and reduce hesitation. Test them with users to confirm comprehension.</p><p><strong>Idioms: </strong>Colloquial phrases like ‘Heads up’ or ‘Kick things off’ rely on cultural metaphors that don’t carry across languages. Replace them with phrasing that makes action explicit. Literal phrasing keeps intent clear and prevents cultural distortion.</p><p><strong>Cultural assumptions: </strong>Error messages like ‘Oops, something went wrong’ may sound casual in English but dismissive elsewhere. In languages with layered politeness, such as Korean or Japanese, <a href=""https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=5350&amp;context=lkcsb_research#:~:text=Abstract%20A%20very%20prominent%20feature,and%20directions%20for%20future%20research"">tone directly shapes trust</a>.</p><p>Write clear, neutral guidance instead — ‘We couldn’t load your details. Please refresh or try again’. Matching tone to user expectations builds reliability and respect.</p><p><strong>Gendered grammar: </strong>English verbs are neutral, but many languages inflect for gender. In Spanish or French, mismatched gender agreement <a href=""https://linguistics.washington.edu/sites/linguistics/files/documents/research/language_learning.pdf"">slows reading</a> and can sound awkward. Translators often have to choose gendered forms even when the English source is neutral.</p><p>Avoid phrasing that forces this choice — use ‘Confirm’ instead of ‘I agreed’ or ‘I’m ready’. Check how target languages express gender early in localisation to keep translations inclusive.</p><p><strong>Auto-generated alt-text and captions: </strong>Machine-generated captions and alt-text <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9395872/"">often miss nuance or context</a>. When captions run faster than about <a href=""https://dcmp.org/learn/601-captioning-key---presentation-rate"">160 words per minute</a>, comprehension drops sharply.</p><p>Review all accessibility copy manually for clarity, neutrality, and pacing. Treat it as part of the user experience, not metadata.</p><p><strong>Split attention: </strong>When instructions appear far from the fields they describe — for example, password rules above an input box — users must hold information in working memory. That extra effort <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12366468/"">increases cognitive load</a>.</p><p>Keep related information close together in both layout and flow. Memory should not have to carry UX.</p><p><strong>Choice overload: </strong>Too many visible options overwhelm users, especially non-native speakers. Studies show that greater menu complexity increases <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357695637_An_Analysis_on_the_Impact_of_Choice_Overload_to_Consumer_Decision_Paralysis"">decision paralysis</a>, while simplified layouts improve task speed by about <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01292"">25 percent</a>.</p><p>Apply <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure?srsltid=AfmBOooR-h3xZ1WJIY52UypnK4QcAYctQ_n6DXzch7p3qOg1Ya6RZB-Q"">progressive disclosure</a> and group related items logically. Fewer, clearer decisions reduce drop-offs and support comprehension.</p><p>Reconstruction fails when copy or layout forces users to infer too much. To avoid this, designers must go beyond surface fixes and invest in understanding how language and culture shape perception.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-does-knowledge-of-other-languages-impact-your-perspective-as-a-ux-designer-1ecb6bf99690"">Language and design are inseparable</a>: learning how different languages structure thought and communication broadens a designer’s perspective and leads to more inclusive solutions. Awareness of cultural and linguistic diversity helps anticipate preferences, avoid stereotypes, and create source copy that is clearer, more adaptable, and easier to localise.</p><h3>Final thought &amp; first step</h3><p>Design is what people get, not what we write.</p><p>To get information, hundreds of millions of people who use English as a second or additional language reconstruct what they read — decoding, reordering, and rebuilding intent before action.</p><p>Awareness of this effort changes how we design. It makes us notice the friction that usually stays invisible — where meaning slips or clarity fades. Non-native content designers and UX writers experience this every day, and their insight helps reveal those hidden gaps.</p><p>When we design with that awareness, content starts to speak across languages — clearer for non-natives, smoother for everyone.</p><p>The first step is noticing how people get meaning — and designing from there.</p><h4>Checklist for designing with reconstruction in mind</h4><ul><li>Use verbs that make it clear what users can do next</li><li>Skip idioms and culture-bound phrasing that don’t translate well</li><li>Use hierarchy, lists, and consistent patterns so users can see how information connects</li><li>Ensure copy stays clear when removed from its visual context or translated</li><li>Test with multilingual users to uncover hidden friction</li><li>Bring in non-native content designers—they experience reconstruction first-hand</li><li>Focus on how users build meaning, not how design presents it</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=deae09b93a93"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-invisible-gap-designing-for-users-who-reconstruct-not-just-read-deae09b93a93"">The invisible gap: Designing for users who reconstruct, not just read</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

But UX should never be reduced to just trendy visuals, and it would be a mistake to see M3E as simply a refresh to MD’s aesthetic sensibilities.</p><p>M3E is at its core speaking to the problems that a large plurality of users, particularly older age groups, have experienced to varying degrees with the dominant UI design paradigm of the last decade or so — ‘flat’ UI design. These overly-simplified designs showed a lack of <strong>clear interaction signifiers</strong>, leading to <strong>click uncertainty</strong>, and <strong>barriers to quick scanning</strong>.</p><p>Digging into the guidelines, the research, and the changes Google has pushed thus far, it’s clear that M3E represents the MD team’s attempt to address these limitations of flat UI design, applying the conclusions of UX researchers over the years, now supported by Google’s own usability studies.</p><figure><img alt=""A collection of 10 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QzkU3a_Pelfur_EvQnjNrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Some promo material for Google’s M3E update.

From perhaps the earliest days of consumer computing, UIs relied on a set of principles known as <strong>skeuomorphism</strong> — taking physical cues from the real-world, like shadows, depth, and imagery, to communicate the functionality of an interface.</p><p>This methodology is today most fondly remembered from Apple’s early iOS apps, especially the ones which took skeuomorphism to an almost pantomime degree by imitating the functionality and look of real, traditional objects or devices. A notebook became a notes app with a yellow paper background and ruled margins; a newsagents’ cabinet carried over into the newsstand app, with digitally articulated oak wood-texture shelves.</p><p>Skeuomorphism was essentially a very complex set of <strong>signifiers</strong> — <a href=""https://jnd.org/signifiers-not-affordances/"">cues that an object uses to communicate how to use it</a> — which communicated functionality to the user by relying on our real-world knowledge. Eventually, once interaction paradigms became <a href=""https://jnd.org/affordances-and-design/"">cultural convention</a>, skeuomorphic flourishes became visual flair and noise, distracting as it was no longer necessary to teach functionality by relating the real to the digital.</p><h4>Flat design</h4><p>By 2014, digital interfaces no longer seemed constrained by the users’ presumed greater familiarity with the physical world. Cue <strong>flat design</strong>. Windows 8 went full brutalist minimalism; iOS 7 stripped away all the Steve Jobs gloss; and Android Lollipop brought Material Design to the party. Material was always a little different, basing itself off a series of stacked-paper metaphors which included a healthy dose of drop shadows (<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/"">NN/g called it ‘Flat 2.0’</a>), but it was still, at its core, a flat approach.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two versions of the iPhone calendar app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xHNivWuKzFhnGfhAzU_5VQ.png"" /><figcaption>When Apple adopted flat design: the calendar app’s skeuomorphic look in iOS 6 (left) vs. iOS 7 (right). (Moss, 2013)</figcaption></figure><p>Flat design’s philosophy, in the great modernist tradition, was exceedingly simple: <strong>remove everything that’s not needed</strong>.</p><p>Retreating from the overtly heavy visual ornamentation that skeuomorphism had become infamous for was a step in the right direction. But along with the trend toward simplification, researchers found that many flat design implementations also harboured a worrying tendency to go to far, to <strong>oversimplify</strong>, leaning too hard on assumptions of user familiarity with common layouts. In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces that produced hesitation rather than harmony.</p><p>In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces which produced hesitation rather than harmony</p><p>Ever since flat design emerged researchers, particularly those at the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g), have been hard at work studying these usability challenges. In the interests of time and space, mine and yours, a short guide to some of the best research is presented below, although I recommend you take the time to read each article for yourself.</p><h3>Flat design &amp; click uncertainty: The 22 percent problem</h3><p>In 2017, Kate Moran and the NN/g team ran an extensive eyetracking study into the then-emerging flat design. They presented 71 users with 9 different pairs of website designs: one with strong visual signifiers (colour, shading, and/or depth); and one with weak or non-existent signifiers (utilising reduced contrast and/or containment). Participants were presented with simple real-world tasks, such as “<em>You will see a page from a hotel website. Reserve this hotel room.</em>”</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side closeup of two different text treatments"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CP4f35b11kmr2tzYZWr0Dg.png"" /><figcaption>A closeup of a jewellery website target link tested by NN/g, strong-signifier (left) and weak-signifier (right) versions.

However, the core tenet of flat design is <strong>simplification</strong> of an interface, and the point of the study was to discover how the extent to which this principle is applied affects usability. Many flattened interfaces suffer from these exact pitfalls, and the stimuli pairs that Moran et al. tested were in fact sourced from real website pages.</p><p>(Just the other day I actually ran into an e-commerce website which shared the same button styling, or lack thereof, as in the weak-signifier version of the jewellery website above — evidently the study’s lessons remain relevant to this very day)</p><h4>Click certainty vs. uncertainty</h4><p>NN/g’s heatmaps revealed what Moran labelled “click uncertainty.” On the strong-signifier pages, user attention was more often than not far more focused and confident on than on the flat pages. Because the flat versions of each page had stripped away certain cues that users rely on to differentiate what’s clickable and what’s not, they had to spend more time scanning the page, expending more cognitive load to locate the UI element which would complete the task given to them.</p><p>It’s the opposite of what good UX aims for. To quote Moran:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We want our users to have experiences that are easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Users need to be able to look at a page, and understand their options immediately. They need to be able to glance at what they’re looking for and know instantly, ‘Yep, that’s it.’<em>”</em></blockquote><p>But although it was a significant, extensive piece of research, Moran’s study was not the first — and would not be the last — to sound the alarm on the potential pitfalls of flat design.</p><h3>Further UX research</h3><p>One of the earliest studies addressing the usability drawbacks of flat UI designs focused on an early progenitor of the trend: Windows 8. NN/g’s ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/windows-8-disappointing-usability/"">Windows 8 — Disappointing Usability for Both Novice and Power Users</a>’ (2012) strongly rejected the overtly flat changes Windows 8 had touted: poorly signposted buttons, hardly distinguishable from text labels or info cards, and icons that were “<em>flat, monochromatic, and coarsely simplified,</em>” falling into the background of the overall information architecture.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark-blue settings menu with a 3x3 grid of white menu link buttons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/344/1*vmQRRzsnFVoXEXYOb37ylQ.png"" /><figcaption>A disturbingly flat settings menu in Windows 8. (Nielsen, 2012)</figcaption></figure><p>And similar conclusions to the Windows 8 article were noted in two other studies in 2015:</p><p><strong>Lücken et al.</strong> published ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110443929-039"">Evaluation of buttons in the context of the Flat Design style</a>,’ which found that stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>In <strong>Burmistrov et al.</strong>’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-22668-2_10"">Flat Design vs Traditional Design</a>,’ the task of identifying clickable objects created a higher cognitive load and rate of error in flat website designs than in ‘traditional’ site designs. Scanning in a grid of flat icons also took twice as long as scanning in a grid of skeuomorphic ones.</p><p>Stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>An NN/g study from 2015, ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">Long-Term Exposure to Flat Design: How the Trend Slowly Decreases User Efficiency</a>,’ was one of the earliest to note that young adult users were more effective at identifying clickable elements in flat interfaces, while also pointing out that flat design had trained users to spend more time hesitating before clicking. But despite younger users’ superior performance with flat UIs, the study noted that “<strong><em>young adult users don’t enjoy click uncertainty </em></strong><em>any more than other user groups</em>.”</p><p>More recently, in 2022’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1814867"">From skeuomorphism to flat design</a>,’ <strong>Urbano et al.</strong> delineated and tested three interface design styles: flat, skeuomorphic, and ‘skeuominimalist’. The researchers created mockups reflecting the differences between the three styles, incorporating their approaches to colour and shading, adding varying degrees of visual signifiers for interactable elements. Their findings revealed that purely flat designs significantly increase click error rates across <em>all</em> age groups, and <strong>for older users, task completion time was notably sabotaged</strong>.</p><p>One common thread runs through the research: flat design’s tendency to strip away visual signifiers from interfaces inevitably impairs usability. It made interfaces harder to use, especially for older users. Rather than focusing user attention on what matters, making UIs <strong>too clean</strong>, <strong>too white</strong>, <strong>too flat</strong> has the opposite effect: users can lose the ability to discern what they should be paying attention to at all, generating click hesitation and increasing scanning time.</p><p>While our humble UX researchers have been studying these issues for many years, not many companies have actually noticed and followed suit — but with M3E, Google has bucked the trend.</p><h3>From flat design to Material 3 Expressive</h3><p>The example below is a screenshot from <a href=""https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive"">one of Google’s new M3E guideline articles</a>, and it perfectly demonstrates how Google has brought the weight of UX research to bear on their design philosophy:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of a financial app home screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JfALVeLBXkvIRgLVss7BOw.png"" /><figcaption>Do’s and don’t’s from Google’s new guidelines. (<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>The flat design (left) uses implicit whitespace and section labels to enable users to understand the structure, requiring extra cognitive effort and potentially introducing click hesitancy.</p><p>The expressive design (right), by contrast, has instant visual structure:</p><ul><li><strong>Containment</strong> using contrasted shades is used to signify important interactive elements.</li><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/common-region/""><strong>Common region</strong></a> boundaries — stronger than proximity or similarity alone — separate distinct groups of elements in a rounded container. The subtle corner shape between each element in the container, background colour dividers between the contained buttons, makes each a distinct element.</li><li><strong>Stronger colours</strong> make buttons more obvious against the light background.</li></ul><p>Colour and shade are used not for visual flair, but to <strong>efficiently</strong> <strong>signal key interactive elements</strong> and <strong>instantly communicate visual structure</strong>, ensuring the user doesn’t get lost in whitespace.</p><h4>The changes so far</h4><p>We haven’t seen full overhauls of apps that resemble the bold and experimental mockups shown in M3E’s initial load of promo material. But since June of this year, Google has begun rolling out design refreshes to their roster of apps, implementing changes that take cues from the new Expressive guidelines:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of the Gmail email app inbox screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8snae9amX10NThLf8tBn3A.png"" /><figcaption>The Gmail inbox, before (left) and after (right) M3E.

(Li, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Again, <strong>containment </strong>(each settings link and each email get their own containers), <strong>common region </strong>(related settings and emails list explicitly grouped) and <strong>stronger colours </strong>(see the M3E Gmail’s compose button) are all strategically implemented, adding important signifiers to critical interactions, and creating immediately clear structure.</p><p>We were lucky enough to get a large amount of the research behind these changes published by Google. And it’s clear from their findings that these changes were aimed at solving the problems with flat design that we’ve seen in the research so far — lack of clear signifiers leading to click uncertainty and barriers to scanning.</p><h3>Google’s research findings</h3><p>In the snappy article which explained the research behind the update, ‘<a href=""https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research"">Better, Easier, Emotional UX</a>,’ the MD design team waxed lyrical about the origins of M3E:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>Back in 2022, our research intern was studying user sentiment toward Material Design in Google apps. After mentioning her initial findings to colleagues in a Munich beer hall, she sparked a team-wide design debate: Why did all these apps look so similar? So boring? Wasn’t there room to dial up the <em>feeling</em>?<em>”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""A collection of 9 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyMRWpPABImhPv35gGbyuQ.png"" /><figcaption>Dial up the FEELING! (<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>The results of this debate speak for themselves. Instead of just redesigning based on designerly intuition, Google embarked on a massive three-year-long, 18,000 participant-strong research study, testing hundreds of design variations across 46 different research studies and conducting surveys and focus groups to gather emotional responses.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive was the result, and Google’s findings validate everything that UX researchers have been pointing out about flat design for years: click uncertainty, barriers to scanning, and age gaps.</p><h4>4x faster discovery</h4><p>Using the latest eye-tracking equipment to analyse where users attention was focused, Google had participants interact with 10 different apps pairs: one in current M3 style, and a new M3E version.</p><p>One example was that of an email app: where the current M3 Gmail design relied on whitespace alone to contain the key action (sending the email), hiding it in the top app bar next to other secondary buttons, the M3 Expressive design heightened the visual signifiers, making the primary interaction a large, explicitly contained and contrasted button, placed just above the keyboard.</p><p>Users discovered the send button <strong>four times faster</strong> in the Expressive redesign.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of an email drafting screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dVScxiHpXmmBY9qok8LKTA.png"" /><figcaption>Two versions of a concept email app Google used in its testing. (<em>Better, Easier</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>That’s a significant improvement, and it demonstrates just how much more of an additional cognitive load was added by the flatter information architecture and reduced visual signifiers that flat design boasted. The benefits also extended beyond fixation time: across all the Expressive design apps tested, the time users took to tap on the key action actually <strong>decreased by seconds</strong>.</p><p>The key takeaway isn’t only that Google’s M3E designs are better, but that the research was right: flattening an interface too much results in decreased ease of scanning, and hesitancy about where to click.</p><h4>Age gaps flattened</h4><p>As we’ve seen, digital products usually exhibit a measurable performance difference between younger and older users. Older age groups take longer to identify key UI elements, while <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">younger users can often pick up on subtle design cues</a> which allow them to identify key actions much faster.</p><p>So perhaps the most important finding from Google’s research is that their Expressive design tactics have resulted in a dramatic <strong>erasure of this gap in performance</strong>:</p><figure><img alt=""Line graph showing that UI elements were spotted faster (in seconds) in expressive designs across all age groups"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BIhWwgmrSZaIy_RXziyExA.png"" /><figcaption>Chart of M3 vs M3E fixation times per age group. (<em>Better, Easier</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Yet M3E not just about trying to help older users become digital natives. With this update, the Google Design team has acknowledged that visual signifiers do cognitive work that benefits all users. Strategically applied shading, borders and containment are hallmarks of good design, not just visual flair for the sake of visual flair.</p><p>Strategically applied shading, borders and containment are hallmarks of good design, not just visual flair for the sake of visual flair.</p><h3>Conclusion: The return of colour</h3><p>The MD team obviously aren’t high on nostalgia for skeuomorphism. They aren’t bringing back wood panelling, glass sheen or yellow note paper textures — they’re bringing back <strong>functional signifiers</strong>, the visual cues that help users identify interactive elements and allow them to understand the information architecture at a glance. M3E is a data-driven correction to the problems of flat design that researchers have noted for more than a decade.</p><p>Mind you, the update isn’t perfect. The two new wavy progress indicators, while a lovely idea, do look a bit like a shuffling worm and a wobbly intestinal tract. You be the judge:</p><figure><img alt=""Animation of linear and circular purple progress indicators showing determinate progress and indeterminate progress"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZiKNgUuDmjx51fRYhCkxLw.gif"" /><figcaption>M3E’s new earthworm &amp; human intestine indicators. (<em>Progress indicators</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s probably not a coincidence that M3 Expressive comes at a time when it seems like the whole world is retreating from minimalism: style, buildings, design everywhere, just look around! Vogue Australia’s <a href=""https://www.vogue.com.au/vogue-living/design/decor-trends-2025/image-gallery/8a0c4e8a1db9042a17cd6a8eec7e9112"">guide to 2025’s interior design trends</a> even reads like it could be a pitch for M3E — ‘<em>express yourself</em>,’ ‘<em>bolder is better</em>,’ ‘<em>the return of colour</em>.’</p><p>This is the line us UX designers must tread. Trends, to a certain extent, allow us to identify what users are familiar with, what they might find the most ‘modern’ or appealing.</p><p>But an app isn’t a house. It’s a 2D tool, projected on a crystalline display, that solves a problem for a user, and I would argue the aesthetic choices of our 2D tools may have far more of a knock-on effect on usability scores than aesthetic interior design choices do. Perhaps it’s because we interact with our apps with the minutia of fingers and eyes alone, rather than the full-body experience of a house. Or perhaps it’s just discipline tunnel vision.</p><p>The research — from NN/g’s heatmaps to Google’s 18,000-person studies — has definitively shown that blindly following popular trends (i.e. flat design) without studying the utility impact can do far more harm than good.</p><p>As designers, we should never have let ourselves be satisfied with the assumption that, since many users have become familiar with general interface patterns, we can afford to go totally minimalist in our approach to content, layout and signifiers. Conventions are a powerful and necessary tool, and designers should always aim to leverage a users’ existing knowledge. But there are limits to every law. UI design, particularly for products used by a broad range of ages like Android, should be able to articulate itself for every user, offering <strong>clarity of function</strong> as well as simple form.</p><p>Rather than let their design guidelines enter a phase of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/"">rampant design cacophony</a>, Google have chosen to build on the years of usability research accumulated since flat design’s inception. It’s an incredibly encouraging development.</p><p>On one last point — although this article is primarily about the research trail from the earliest flat design studies to M3E — it would be remiss of me not to note M3E’s exciting new aesthetic possibilities. In a culture when users are becoming increasingly bored with minimalist trends, interfaces injected with additional artistic intent and emotional appeal have the potential to stand out from the bland, unexciting competition.</p><p>The keywords of M3 Expressive — delight, joy, playfulness, modernity — are exciting for designers and users alike, but these touches must be applied with intent, skill and strategy, always testing with that age-old question, so often lost in translation: ‘<em>does this improve the end user experience?</em>’</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><em>Better, Easier, Emotional UX</em>.

In fact, my first tattoo was of the Superman symbol — I know, cheesy. But there was something about that idea of strength guided by purpose that stuck with me. However, one character that truly captured my imagination was Superman’s failed copy — <a href=""https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro"">Bizarro</a>.</p><p>Bizarro is a botched experiment by the genius villain <a href=""https://superman.fandom.com/wiki/Lex_Luthor"">Lex Luthor</a> to replicate Superman. He sort of looks like the hero we know, has his powers, and even tries to do good — but everything he does comes out wrong. He saves people by endangering them, speaks in twisted opposites, and mistakes harm for help. He isn’t evil — just reversed. That inversion — an imitation of greatness that misunderstands its essence — is a fitting metaphor for modern AI.</p><p>But this metaphor isn’t just poetic—Apple’s 2025 paper <a href=""https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking""><em>The Illusion of Thinking</em></a> backs it up. In the study, Apple researchers tested a class of models they called “Large Reasoning Models,” essentially Large Language Models (LLMs) retuned for reasoning, using puzzles like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi"">Tower of Hanoi</a>. At first the models performed well, but as the puzzles grew more complex, their reasoning began to fail.</p><p>Instead of increasing their effort, the models produced shorter and less coherent thought chains, often stopping even when more computation time was available. The researchers observed that their reasoning degraded, revealing that the systems were matching patterns that appeared like reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning.</p><p>As complexity increased, their logic collapsed into pure prediction. The models recognized the shape of thought without ever truly thinking. The result sounded intelligent but felt hollow.</p><p>At the end of the day, these “intelligent” machines are little more than glorified autocorrect systems — predicting, not thinking. That’s dangerous, because it blurs the line between intelligence and imitation.</p><p>It’s a false illusion sold by powerful tech companies as they rake in billions. If I didn’t know better, I’d call the entire <a href=""https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/ai-schemes-could-make-bernie-madoffs-fraud-look-trivial-eugene-soltes"">AI movement a modern Ponzi scheme</a> — but that’s a discussion for another day.</p><p>Anyone who’s used tools like ChatGPT knows the frustration of arguing with a machine that doesn’t know it’s wrong. And yes, I say “arguing” because I often catch myself yelling (with colorful language) at these conversational AI tools — a fact I’m not proud of.</p><p>I know it’s foolish to yell at a machine, but in my defense, maybe it should act more like a machine instead of a compulsive liar.</p><p>Just the other day, I asked it to debug a JavaScript snippet it had written. When I said it wasn’t working, it replied, “You’re absolutely correct! The code appears to be flaky.” Code it had just given me. I was actually more surprised by the use of the word flakey than the fact that it gave me broken code.</p><p>That moment perfectly captured the essence of modern AI — confident errors, fluent nonsense, and zero accountability. This is where we’ve landed as a society. We’ve traded honesty for efficiency.</p><p>To understand why a model would confidently call its own code “flaky,” we need to look at how we have historically defined intelligence in machines, and how that definition has shifted.</p><p>The earliest approach in AI, <a href=""https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/18/what-is-symbolic-artificial-intelligence/"">symbolic intelligence</a>, encoded human-knowledge in explicit rules and logic. It relied on structured reasoning — if-then statements, symbol hierarchies, and clear inference paths. The advantage—every conclusion is transparent and traceable.</p><p>But the disadvantage—when faced with messy, real-world inputs (such as image recognition or natural language), the rule-based system struggles to scale or cope with ambiguity.</p><p>Following the limitations of rule-based symbolic methods, the field shifted to <a href=""https://www.aaas.org/taxonomy/term/9/heuristic-and-statistical-artificial-intelligence"">statistical artificial intelligence</a>. Instead of encoding explicit logic, this approach relies on probability, large datasets and pattern recognition.</p><p>The system doesn’t “reason” in human terms — it correlates. It learns statistical relationships between inputs and outcomes, then uses those to predict. The trade-off—high scalability and flexibility, but weak transparency and little genuine “understanding.”</p><p>And then there’s today’s g<a href=""https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI"">enerative artificial intelligence</a> — the kind behind text, images, and music. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet, learning statistical patterns across billions of examples.</p><p>LLMs use <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model"">transformer networks</a> to learn contextual relationships by predicting the next word across billions of parameters, creating language that feels coherent but remains purely probabilistic.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/diffusion-models"">diffusion models</a> generate images by gradually denoising random noise into structured visuals, guided by patterns learned from vast datasets.</p><p>Both systems learn correlations, not concepts — they model likelihoods, not meaning.</p><p>The trajectory is clear — the further we’ve moved from the transparency of logic (symbolic AI) toward the fluency of prediction (generative AI), the more convincingly human the output appears — and the more fundamentally alien the process behind it becomes.</p><p>This is the paradox of modern AI. In our quest to build reliable intelligence, we created its flawed reflection — a brilliant mimic whose fluency guarantees imitation, but whose lack of reasoning prevents the very understanding and accountability we need to trust it.</p><p>But maybe it’s not entirely bad. Generative AI feeds on what already exists, which means originality still belongs to us. That gives creators a chance to stand apart — to make what the machine can only imitate.</p><p>The more I learn about AI, the less I fear it taking our jobs — and the more I fear its power to distort truth. These systems don’t think—they replicate. They strip away context until meaning becomes optional.</p><p>In that sense, Big Tech has become our Lex Luthor — brilliant, self-assured, and convinced it’s saving humanity while quietly trying to own it. Its creations mirror its ambition—powerful, profitable, and fundamentally indifferent to the truth.</p><p>That’s the real danger — not that AI will outthink us, but that it will outproduce us, flooding the world with fluent illusions that sound right but aren’t. It’s our own version of Bizarro — except this time, there’s no Superman coming to save us.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce6d4ba04f64"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/we-wanted-superman-level-ai-instead-we-got-bizarro-ce6d4ba04f64"">We wanted Superman-level AI.

<h4>Figma’s inclusive design updates</h4><p>Designers are expected (sometimes legally required) to create accessible products. But many tools we rely on are inaccessible themselves.</p><p>Imagine trying to use <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/accessibility-in-illustrator.html"">Adobe Illustrator using only your keyboard</a>… yes, you could navigate the toolbar and open menus, but you really couldn’t use any of the core features (vector drawing or creating shapes).</p><p><strong>Most of these design tools weren’t built for users with disabilities.</strong> And products like Adobe would require massive retrofitting to accommodate for items like keyboard accessibility (unfortunately).</p><figure><img alt=""3 screens from Figma showing the enhanced contrast mode with the accessibility icon in the middle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5BSF0aoXbXYoTbIJQG6n4A.png"" /></figure><p>But Figma is distancing themselves from this common convention. Not only have they introduced features that help designers create accessible work, like the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uvU1-2xq3U&amp;t=5s"">native color contrast checker</a>, they are making the tool more accessible in itself.</p><p><strong>In the last few Figma releases, they have updated the tool to include improved keyboard accessibility and high-contrast modes for users who have low-vision or have trouble using only their mouse.</strong></p><p>If Figma can retrofit accessibility into something as complex as a design tool, there’s little reason other products can’t. To see where they’ve made accessibility enhancements, let’s dive in deeper to their recent updates and where gaps still exist.</p><h3>Figma’s accessible updates</h3><p>Figma has introduced both an <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/5576781786647-Change-themes-in-Figma#h_01K57AMY9Y08P2656MNM2HDS1H"">enhanced contrast mode</a> (supporting both light and dark themes) as well as <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35063862380311-Accessibility-at-Figma#h_01K7FGP0TSK59TNV5TBCSZWHV0"">improved keyboard navigation</a>. These aren’t “nice-to-have” features, but show core advancements that align with WCAG accessibility standards and real user needs. Let’s look at both features.</p><h4>Enhanced contrast mode</h4><p>This feature may seem obvious and simple, but you’d be surprised how many design tools don’t allow users to customize their interface beyond swapping between light and dark themes.</p><p>When enhanced contrast mode is toggled on, the difference is very noticeable on UI controls like buttons, as well as the dividers separating sections of the interface.</p><p><strong>This feature significantly impacts users with low-vision or even users working outside in the sun. Not only that, it helps clarify what is currently selected or interactive for all users.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Comparison between “Enhanced contrast mode” toggled on and off"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0FndJ-ajuVRNUKlXKGSkGA.png"" /><figcaption>Comparison between “Enhanced contrast mode” toggled on and off</figcaption></figure><p>Here is a comparison on the color contrast ratios with the enhanced mode turned on/off:</p><ul><li><strong>“Design” file button</strong>: 1.24:1 (off) → 4.6:1 (on)</li><li><strong>“View plans” button</strong>: 2.99:1 (off) → 7.72:1 (on)</li></ul><blockquote>Note<em>: The “View plan” button actually fails color contrast requirements when turned off (</em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum""><em>must be 4.5:1 at minimum</em></a><em>).</em></blockquote><p><strong>To see the enhanced contrast mode for yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>Select the “F” Figma logo to open the main menu</li><li>Select “Preferences” → “Accessibility settings”</li><li>Toggle on “Enhanced contrast mode”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings in Figma with the enhanced contrast mode toggled on"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QDGKv-nYeC6tpalURbWdDA.png"" /><figcaption>How to enable “Enhanced contrast mode”</figcaption></figure><p>Though some elements have no change when the mode is toggled on, like badge components and hover states, I expect this feature to allow greater visibility as Figma continues to update.</p><h4>Keyboard navigation</h4><p>The ability to navigate and use design tools with only a keyboard has been notoriously impossible. Of course, many tools provide keyboard shortcuts, but those are intended for more advanced users. So what about users who can’t use a mouse or trackpad?</p><p><strong>Figma has improved its keyboard-friendliness by offering users to navigate between top-level sections of the UI, adjust the UI, as well as add and select objects on the Figma canvas.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Figma’s focus indicator on the toolbar in the bottom of the interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZ-OBNq7oHZcpaw5I8k2Aw.png"" /><figcaption>Focus indicator on Figma’s toolbar</figcaption></figure><p>Not only does this positively impact users who cannot use a mouse, but also improves the workflow for all users who are keyboard-first.</p><p>Here are some <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35063862380311-Accessibility-at-Figma#h_01K7FGP0TSK59TNV5TBCSZWHV0"">keyboard commands to trial out in Figma</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Navigate top-level areas of the UI</strong>: F6 // Control-F6</li><li><strong>Navigate in and out of layers on the canvas</strong>: Return // Shift-Return</li><li><strong>Enlarge the Figma UI scale</strong>: Option-Shift-Command-=</li><li><strong>Reset the Figma UI scale</strong>: Option-Shift-Command-0</li><li><strong>Pan the Figma canvas</strong>: Arrow keys // Shift-arrow keys</li><li><strong>Add object to canvas</strong>: Command-K (open Action menu) → Search for tool → Enter / Return (place object on canvas)</li></ul><blockquote>Note<em>: You don’t have to enable any setting to access the keyboard commands; they are on by default (as they should be).</em></blockquote><p>Though this does help Figma get closer to <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard"">WCAG standards for keyboard accessibility</a>, some features are still only functional with a mouse or trackpad. For example, <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328653-Use-Figma-products-with-a-keyboard#h_01K0YRA44V0RJ9NVVMRXT3Y34E"">adding objects that require multiple clicks</a>, like a line or vector paths, cannot be done with a keyboard.</p><p>This is a great start to achieving full keyboard accessibility for a design tool. Maybe Figma will be a pioneer in supporting vector-based drawing using only a keyboard (I hope so).</p><h3>Large accessibility gaps in design tools</h3><h4>Outdated assumptions</h4><p>Even with Figma’s progress, most design tools remain inaccessible at a fundamental level. Accessibility has infamously been forgotten and/or disregarded across the entire creative industry.</p><p><strong>But it’s not that accessibility was never important; many of these products were built on assumptions about who their users are.</strong> They pictured able-bodied, well-sighted, and mouse users. So many of the industry’s core design platforms exclude anyone who doesn’t fit that archetype.</p><p>Adobe is a prime example with Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign were all built before accessibility frameworks became standard. Many of the core functions like drawing vector shapes or selecting anchors depend on a mouse/ trackpad. Though you can open menus and panels with a keyboard, creating designs without a pointer device is pretty much impossible.</p><figure><img alt=""A vector shapes being drawn in Adobe Illustrator using a mouse to manipulate a curve"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uQseNlyYMtlgJbm0.jpg"" /><figcaption>Drawing vector shapes in Adobe Illustrator isn’t possible using only a keyboard</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.adobe.com/trust/accessibility.html"">Adobe does have an accessibility initiative</a> and has introduced improvements in products like Acrobat, but its creative tools exclude people outside the ideal, archetypal user.</p><h4>Beyond keyboard inaccessibility</h4><p>The gaps don’t stop at keyboard accessibility; visual accessibility is also limited. Many creative tools still lack adequate color contrast as well as sufficient UI customization for the users who need it.</p><p><strong>For instance, interfaces rely heavily on subtle visual cues to indicate active layers, which makes it difficult for users with low-vision.</strong> These tools also include dense, abstract toolbars and hidden commands that create steep learning curves; though this impacts everyone, it’s detrimental for neurodivergent users.</p><figure><img alt=""Adobe Premiere Pro includes an overwhelming UI that confuses all users"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*2cDtNZJ6Sh0Wufot.jpg"" /><figcaption>Adobe Premiere Pro includes an overwhelming UI that confuses all users</figcaption></figure><p><strong>When an interface itself isn’t perceivable or intuitive to all users, it limits who can participate in design.</strong> The industry unintentionally reinforces exclusion at the very starting point of creation. But creative tools need to account for broader necessities outside the assumed user so accessibility can be both produced and practiced.</p><h3>Inclusive design tools matter</h3><h4>It determines who gets to use them</h4><p>When the tools we use to design aren’t accessible, it creates a ripple effect.</p><p><strong>If creative tools exclude people with disabilities, then the perspectives building digital products remain limited, and the designs created in the tools are inherently less inclusive.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Accessibility framework showing that it’s a part of the entire product development cycle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*cxe36MY7q7JQUMIQ.png"" /><figcaption>Spotify’s accessibility framework; via <a href=""https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/accessibility"">Spotify for developers</a></figcaption></figure><p>Accessibility in design tools isn’t just an internal UX issue; it’s a diversity and equity issue that directly impacts the products people use every day.</p><h4>They better shape designers</h4><p>Inclusive design tools reframe how designers think. When accessibility is built into the tools themselves, it unknowingly teaches better design habits. Designers can internalize accessibility practices by experiencing them:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Noticing high color contrast, focus indicators, and clear visual hierarchy</li><li><strong>Operable:</strong> Understanding the importance of keyboard access and flexible interactions</li><li><strong>Simple:</strong> Recognizing how clean, intuitive UI improves the experience for all users</li></ul><p>By embedding these principles into everyday workflows and tools, accessibility is normalized as a part of good design practice.</p><p><strong>Figma is showing that accessibility in complex design tools can be done without functional or visual sacrifice.</strong> If a creative platform as intricate as Figma can retrofit accessibility into its interface, then the long-standing excuse that “it’s not possible” no longer holds up.</p><p>Accessibility is a design challenge like any other, and the entire creative industry needs to catch up and confront it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c87c831b1393"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-figma-in-its-accessibility-era-c87c831b1393"">Is Figma in its accessibility era?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>This post explores living in the contradiction: working to change harmful systems while knowing that those same systems help pay our bills.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract dream scape with the text “shifting within”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*R70zC4B7MnVrM2Zz.jpeg"" /></figure><p>I dream of a future where everyone has what they need and where design supports human and planetary flourishing. This vision fills me with hope while also making me acutely aware of the reality many designers face today. Our work is done within the dominant capitalist framework that prioritizes financial growth above all else, often at the expense of true flourishing. In this system, design has largely been co-opted as a tool for increasing profits, optimizing efficiency, and driving consumption — rarely questioning the foundations of the systems it serves.</p><p>As designers, we often find ourselves caught between:</p><ul><li>The practical necessity of working within existing systems to earn a living and have immediate impact</li><li>The moral imperative to imagine and create fundamentally different systems that center human dignity, social justice, and ecological health</li><li>The professional challenges of balancing client expectations with our deeper values and ethics</li><li>The emotional labor of holding hope for transformation while facing the limitations of incremental change</li></ul><p>This reality creates a fundamental tension between “within” and “beyond” We recognize the need for radical systems change while needing to function in the current system in order to pay our bills. These tensions aren’t just philosophical — they manifest in everyday decisions about which projects to take on, how to approach design challenges, whose voices to amplify, and what futures we choose to help create. It raises questions about complicity, compromise, and the real possibilities for change within and beyond the systems we inhabit.</p><p>As I’ve been thinking about a better future for and through design, I’ve been asking myself:</p><blockquote><em>How can we shift within the current system as we work to a better one?</em></blockquote><p>In my explorations, I’ve found three different ways to shift within the current system: practicing harm reduction, building movements, and centering rest as a form of resistance here and now.</p><h3>1. Practice harm reduction</h3><p>I think our role today is to practice harm reduction within the current system and minimize damage through immediate interventions like making existing services more accessible or policies more equitable, while simultaneously imagining and prototyping entirely new ways of organizing society, work, and care.</p><p>One of the most accessible and powerful ways designers can practice harm reduction is by asking better, braver questions. Questions that slow down the pace of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhU0hRng-eE"">solutionism</a>“ and open space for reflection:</p><ul><li>​​Who benefits from this design — and who might be excluded or harmed?</li><li>What values are embedded in this solution?</li><li>What voices are missing from this process?</li><li>What assumptions are we making about users, needs, or impact?</li><li>What happens when we ask “at what cost?” instead of just “how might we?”</li></ul><p>Many of these questions were first introduced through <a href=""https://designjustice.org/"">The Design Justice Network</a>. Their work centers principles and practices meant to shift what we work on, who our work is in service for, and how we do the work as designers. Design is often framed as a neutral tool for innovation, but this view ignores the power dynamics and inequalities baked into the systems we operate in. Practicing harm reduction means rejecting neutrality. It means acknowledging that our work participates in shaping the world — often in ways that reinforce existing hierarchies unless we actively push back.</p><p>When I think of design and its ability to create change, I think about the dance between possibility and responsibility. Our work can either harm or heal. A few months ago, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/idampersson_good-design-is-a-dance-between-curiosity-activity-7208430723320422400-dFkn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"">I posted this on Linkedin</a> “Good design is a dance between curiosity and criticality. As designers, we love asking, “how might we” but we also have to ask “at what cost.” Design can heal but it can also harm. As designers, we must balance possibilities and responsibilities. We must be curious AND critical.”</p><h3>2. Build movements</h3><p>Building movement is another way we can create change within the current system. When we take a look around, we see many movements and organizations working to fight the current system and help us live better within them and throughout history movements like Black Lives Matters, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=452a92eb2c2ade68&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enDE1084DE1084&amp;cs=0&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPEI14tTYBaOXPPY93OhusSAziItQ%3A1756923972799&amp;q=Disability+Rights+Movement&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi30Yjqm72PAxUK9bsIHUphGVIQxccNegQIBhAB&amp;mstk=AUtExfDbXQ0XBuWo4KcGM-UFM6qZYGH8B1jwOTMHkxTUm5RLgM7OtDDhwTYnGCnC19bUqDtYOAEd2Xh4BNxa-tXnyhQL_3ZW_mVLFg_r1jv-CKgenSmZnLgqlNnsL4UEPPYJp0Mz3uIwUnZmQ4xN1Abd8PhUI7YN0X_TFVT2jbVIIXKklH9Ha7lzX5KKxWSYXk4s0LWGhcezfUJPeh-hPVVSAsYIcuVQLdU5vcFzr75mDfz17Y3215Thmk8PsAOjDYnhFXPhAmJladFpI8bKLyhxFMnU40GVaf1UOuH1Ow-E-tn6pw&amp;csui=3"">Disability Rights Movement</a>, Gay Rights Movements, etc. have paved the way for many of the rights we have today. Within design, <a href=""https://designjustice.org/"">Design Justice</a> movements, <a href=""https://www.tidsociety.com/"">Trauma-informed design</a>, etc. have made our profession more accessible while questioning the powers at play. Movements are ways to challenge the current systems from within and hopefully dismantle them in the future.</p><p>Many movements we champion today exist precisely because <strong>the current system doesn’t allow for equality and justice. </strong>Feminism responds to gender inequality. Disability rights acts respond to systems that don’t accommodate differences. In an ideal future, we won’t need these movements — but until we get to a liberated future, our job is to reduce harm through movement building.</p><h4>Movements vs. identity</h4><p>In her book <a href=""https://decolonialfutures.net/hospicingmodernity/"">Hospicing Modernity</a>, Vanessa Machado de Oliveira (formerly Vanessa Andreotti) shares an anecdote around movement building. During a panel discussion on global feminism, she was asked what role global feminisms will play in decolonial futures. She responded: “If we still had to talk about global feminisms in a supposedly decolonized future, something would have definitely gone wrong.” She continued, “When I identify as a feminist, I see the point of my role as working myself out of the need for feminist critiques in the future, rather than indefinitely investing in a collective identity.”</p><p>Machado de Oliveira highlights an important difference between a movement and an identity. While many movement help us fight for ours and others rights, clinging to the cause as identities CAN limit our ability to let go of the movement when they no longer serve the intended cause anymore. It can also keep us from connecting across differences and reject anymore who does not identify in the same way. As the writer and activist <a href=""https://adriennemareebrown.net/"">adrienne maree brown</a> writes:</p><blockquote><em>“We live inside of interlocking systems of oppression. These systems only work because we uphold them inside ourselves and between us. Rather than canceling each other for every way that we’re embodying the systems, we need to help break each other out of these systems and find ways to course correct for our country and our species together. When we turn on each other, the systems actually persist and they just go elsewhere. But when we actually heal each other and bring it all into the light, those systems become irrelevant. That’s what we actually need right now. For the planet’s sake and for our life on it, we need to hold on to each other and grow our soul.”</em></blockquote><p>When we create together we transform individual healing into collective progress. By turning toward one another, we can challenge the system and together create something that supports the well-being of all.</p><h3>3. Rest as resistance</h3><p>In order to continue to reduce harm and build movements that fight the current system, we need to rest. Poet, performance artist, and activist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricia_Hersey"">Trisha Hersey</a> promotes how “rest is resistance”. In her book by the same name she explains that we can reclaim our sense of worth by resisting the grind culture and choosing rest. She positions rest as a human right — not something that needs to be earned. Her book was transformative for me. I found the book in a time where I was working hard to reach new heights while ignoring burnout signs from my body and my mind. It helped me evaluate where I was pushing beyond my own boundaries and how it kept me from being able to fight for others.</p><p>Resistance is different from resilience. It doesn’t tell us to push through or become stronger than the system. Rather, it helps us unlearn what we’ve been taught and resist what’s being reinforced about hard work through the larger paradigm. <a href=""https://medium.com/@augustvoyej/how-gen-z-is-challenging-the-concept-of-hustle-culture-bf6db8819db3"">The rejection of hustle culture has been embraced by many</a>. It’s not just a way to reclaim our worth but also a way to wake up and see clearly how the current culture of productivity, capitalism, and speed harms both ourselves and the planet.</p><p>Centering rest as a radical act can help us survive with a little more ease in a system that wants to exploit us.</p><h3>From Within to Beyond: Bridging the present and the future through The Adjacent Possible</h3><p>Between “within” and “beyond” lies what innovation theorist <a href=""https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/about"">Steven Johnson calls “the Adjacent Possible”</a> — spaces of possibility that become available from our current position. These are the opportunities that exist not in some distant utopia but in the immediate next steps we can take.</p><p>In the book <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069"">Good Ideas</a> (shop at your local book shop), Johnson writes “The adjacent possible is a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent itself.” Each moment in our history unlocks new doors of adjacent possibilities.</p><p>The Adjacent Possible reminds us that transformation occurs not in sudden leaps but through continuous exploration of emerging possibilities. It’s about finding footholds for change within our present reality that can lead toward more substantive shifts.</p><p><a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde"">Audre Lorde</a> said: “At the same time as we’re surviving in the mouth of the dragon, we also need to be feeding our vision.” Surviving within the mouth of the dragon means practicing harm reduction, building movements alongside others, and resting as a form of resistance. These actions can open up a space for us to free our vision of a better tomorrow.

<h4>Seven design insights from taking Grammarly ads (too) seriously.</h4><figure><img alt=""A collage of pastel rectangles with exclamation marks, with a bold wavy line snaking between them like through a labyrinth."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*69TJE9nfEYpzRhienCAVzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Writing your way or pushing writing out of the way? Image by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Three weeks ago, YouTube finally decided that I must be interested in writing. Fair enough: I’m a Human-Computer Interaction professor researching writing tools and the impact of AI. Soon, my feed filled with Grammarly ads — and I started reflecting on their curious messages.</p><p><strong>What if we took AI writing tool ads seriously<em>?</em></strong></p><p>Ads may seem an odd source for design reflection. Yet they need to be highly intentional design artefacts: Since they compete for attention at a price per view or minute, they are forced to distil a design’s essential features and choose concrete values to highlight. This makes them spotlights on how a design wants to be seen and understood.</p><p>The key insight from my anecdotal ad-vestigation:</p><blockquote>As portrayed in their ads, these AI tools address people who don’t value writing for its intellectual or creative demands, and thus miss its opportunities for growth.</blockquote><p>In response, I outline seven design insights and questions to inspire alternative directions for your next (AI) writing tool design. They are organised into two parts: concepts and use cases.</p><h3>Concepts of human-AI interaction in writing tools</h3><p>The ads reveal several recurring themes in how human–AI interaction is framed within writing tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A collage of four Grammarly promotional images showcasing different AI tools. The visuals feature clean gradients and text about features such as “AI writing app,” “Paraphraser agent,” “Proofreader agent,” and “Humanizer agent.” Each image includes the Grammarly logo and brief taglines about improving writing clarity, tone, and efficiency."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g7rgjWiThQCmy0xCPrmu2A.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of the analysed ads. Image created from screenshots by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Interaction paradigm: What exactly is an agent?</h4><p>Some ads present Grammarly as an <em>app, </em>others as an <em>agent</em>. Interestingly, in both cases, they depict a toolbar or sidebar UI element. The only ad that shows a chat does not<em> </em>use the word <em>agent, </em>although chatting feels more characteristic of an agent than toolbars. This leaves open how Grammarly itself understands and operationalises “agent-ness”, at least in the ads I encountered.</p><p><strong>Questions for your design: </strong>Which interaction design, offering which (AI) capabilities, would make your system an <em>agent </em>rather than a <em>tool</em>, from a user’s perspective? And how does that serve your design goals?</p><h4>Task delegation: Avoiding writing with AI</h4><p>Mandy ads emphasise the appeal of delegating writing tasks to AI to save time and effort. Examples include slogans like <em>“Your work-life balance just got more manageable”</em> and <em>“Sound natural and polished without extra effort”</em>. One ad even promotes a <em>“Humanizer agent” </em>to <em>“Eliminate robotic phrasing”.</em> This likely targets those disappointed by past results with AI. Another ad mentions an <em>“AI lineup”</em>, implying delegation of writing to multiple agents<em>.</em></p><blockquote>Across these examples, the ads frame writing as labour to be avoided. As someone with a deep interest in writing, this does not speak to me at all.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools that let writers delegate the tasks that <em>distract </em>from writing, rather than writing itself?</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a Grammarly ad featuring the text “Start your best draft with this AI lineup” on a blurred background resembling a writing app. A blue paper plane icon and vertical toolbar with Grammarly-style icons appear on the right. The Grammarly logo is at the top center. The caption below reads: “Your best work deserves a powerful stage — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*-QvSZ83HsNf9Ow_r_KvHFg.png"" /><figcaption>An ad implying delegation of writing to a “lineup” of AI. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Writing stages: AI wants to help everywhere</h4><p>Several ads stress the user’s involvement through phrases that highlight “your” contribution. Examples include <em>“keeping ownership of your ideas”</em>, “<em>make your voice resonate with readers”, “Your best work deserves a powerful stage”, </em>and <em>“See specific ways to strengthen your essay”. </em>Across idea, voice, work, and essay, these ads imply that AI will assist at any stage of writing.</p><blockquote>Together, these ads position AI as always present, with no clear roles or boundaries. This might be less appealing to expert writers who know their workflows well.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>What if we made it a deliberate design goal to constrain AI to a specific role, rather than letting it do everything? And how might we empower writers to shape the scope of AI functionality and its integration into UIs and workflows themselves?</p><h4>Cognitive processes: Typing but not writing</h4><p>One ad promised to <em>“Get Effective, Mistake-Free Writing Every Time You Type”. </em>This framing turns the user into a receiver of writing from an unspecified source, implied to be AI. The user is not entirely passive, though: They still “type” — but they do not “write”. This is a key difference. In the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">cognitive process model of writing</a>, typing aligns with the <em>transcriber</em>, the most mechanical of the three processes. The other two are <em>proposer </em>(generating ideas) and <em>translator </em>(expressing them in words). The ad’s message thus assumes users who prefer to avoid the more creative efforts of writing.</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design (AI) writing tools that help users actively explore their own ideas and expression, instead of passively receiving prefabricated language from the system?</p><h3>Use cases for AI writing tools</h3><p>The ads primarily target two audiences: students and professionals. Moreover, ideation appears as a third use case across both groups.</p><h4>Ideation — without exploration</h4><p>Several ads promise help with finding ideas at the start of a writing project. Examples include <em>“Say goodbye to blank-page scaries and jump-start ideas faster”</em>, “<em>Start your best draft with this AI lineup”, </em>and <em>“Jump-Start Ideas With Grammarly’s AI Brainstorming Features”. </em>The latter ad shows a brainstorming button that generates high-level essay content for a user-provided topic. I like that it offers possible directions without dictating details. However, the feature’s UI design limits exploration and iteration. It is crammed into a chatbox pop-up with no space and editing capabilities to compare or iterate on ideas.</p><blockquote>As shown in the ad, users are expected to immediately copy an AI-provided idea. This workflow seems unlikely to appeal to people who enjoy exploring many ideas before committing one to the page.</blockquote><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design for a closer integration of ideation and writing? Of canvas and page? What if the AI’s role were to facilitate transitions between these processes, or to provide a substrate for exploration and iteration, rather than simply generating text to copy?</p><h4>Communication: Is AI polish all you need?</h4><p>Another group of ads focuses on writing as communication, such as <em>“Put your best foot forward”</em>, <em>“Send the right message”</em>, <em>“Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth”</em>, and <em>“Communicate clearly, come across as you intend, and strengthen work relationships”</em>. Fittingly, these ads feature people rather than interfaces, highlighting the promise that AI will help the user be perceived positively.</p><figure><img alt=""A Grammarly ad showing a person with a beard looking focused while sitting indoors, with natural light and a plant in the background. White text on the image reads, “Send the right message.” The caption below says, “Get heads nodding on your first email instead of your fifth — Sponsored · Grammarly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/624/1*XFKqMo4OwGzrTIQpnclPCw.png"" /><figcaption>An ad targeting the use case of writing for communication. Screenshot by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the opposite can also be true: When a message is perceived as AI-generated, it can <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">decrease trust</a>. It remains unclear how the design mitigates these risks. The existence of a <em>“Humanizer Agent”</em> in another ad supports this: Why design features that require the user to also “humanize” the text?</p><p><strong>Alternative design direction: </strong>How might we design tools with a nuanced understanding of the social nature of writing in focus, rather than assuming that AI polish is all you need?</p><h4>Learning: Grades over growth</h4><p>Grammarly’s YouTube <a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfPYYNRetSN_cKgkv3vFk6A2Felr9_kfb&amp;si=KW1ZOhNwXRLSi_0X"">playlist</a> for students focuses on performance markers. Its slogans include <em>“Work faster and smarter”</em>, <em>“Make the grade”</em>, <em>“Submit high-quality work for school”</em>, and <em>“Craft your success story”</em>. The last one features a time-travel plot in which a student learns that <em>“everyone’s using it”,</em> and joining in will turn him into a CEO later in life. As an educator, I find this focus troublesome because the ads never portray students motivated by genuine learning.</p><p>Identifying this as the best marketing strategy for a writing tool may reveal more about cultural views of education than about the tool itself. A behind-the-scenes video titled <em>“How to succeed in school” </em>makes this even clearer:<em> </em>It interviews actors from the ads, who give personal advice such as <em>“don’t take it so seriously”</em> and <em>“people put too much emphasis on studying”</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""A frame from Grammarly’s YouTube video titled “How to Succeed in School | Behind the Scenes at Grammarly’s ‘Back to School’ Shoot.” It shows a person with long blonde hair, dressed in black, sitting on a gray chair and speaking to the camera.

Image arranged from screenshots by the author; additional caption added by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, the ad <em>“Edit Essays Faster” </em>shows a degree of introspection through interaction with AI. A student reflects on edit suggestions: <em>“That’s true. This is much better. You know, I didn’t know my writing contained so many run-on sentences until I started using Grammarly.”</em></p><figure><img alt=""A frame from a Grammarly YouTube video showing a person with short dark hair wearing a green plaid shirt, sitting with a laptop in a bright, modern space.

Yet those demands offer opportunities for thinking, expression, personal insight, and skill development. I suspect this mismatch is a part of why AI tools can miss the mark with writers.</p><p>If we read ads as reflections of underlying design assumptions, they tell us something about tool design itself, not merely marketing strategy. This view motivated the questions above, pointing to alternative design directions.</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s a difference between how a tool is advertised and how it can be leveraged. In this spirit, and as a small experiment, I edited this article with Grammarly. I had a good experience with it in this limited role. I even liked some of the constraints of the free account: It marked sentences for me to revisit, yet hid the AI suggestions. I like to think that this prompted my own thinking. Some features, like “expert reviews”, also seem designed to generate questions rather than only answers. More broadly, I’m curious to see upcoming updates, from <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/blog/company/introducing-new-superhuman/"">acquiring Superhuman</a> to proactive agents, and how these will be advertised — and to whom.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>These references provide further reading on the mentioned concepts and suggested design directions:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517731"">Perceptions of AI in email writing</a> and in other <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3641955"">interpersonal communication</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3698061.3726924"">Creativity support tools designed for more than productivity</a> and for <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606831"">empowering writers</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3690712.3690725"">What if AI tools were designed to center writers’ own creative decisions?</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/0741088312451260"">The cognitive process model of writing</a> and the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3581641.3584060"">role of AI suggestions therein</a></li><li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3714119"">Combining canvas and page UIs for writing with AI features</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1bab97d0fa98"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ai-writing-tools-fail-to-speak-to-writers-1bab97d0fa98"">How AI writing tools fail to speak to writers</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

As he fell asleep, I was struck by a thought. The <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/08/14/move-fast-and-break-things-as-strategy-tech-experts-takes/"">“move fast and break things” ethos</a> of the last two decades in tech is remarkably similar to the core themes of the 200+ y/o Shelley classic. The story of a creator obsessed with his own genius, blind to the consequences, who unleashes a powerful, uncontrolled creation into the world and then abdicates all responsibility for the harm it causes? An apt comparison, indeed.</p><p>Victor Frankenstein’s great folly lay <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/mit-press-scholarship-online/book/20711"">not in his ambition, but in his abdication</a>. Horrified that he “had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch,” he ran. He left his creation to be feared and misunderstood by a society that was not prepared for it.</p><p>This is the dilemma of the modern tech profession. We, the architects of the digital commons, have acted with the same hubris. We build systems optimized for profit and engagement, unleash them upon society, and then hide behind a structure of <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/diffusion-responsibility"">diffused responsibility</a> when systemic harms emerge (<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl8d0x9lpdo"">teen mental health crisis</a>, <a href=""https://digitalchew.com/2025/10/21/are-tech-companies-fueling-political-division-in-the-u-s/"">political polarization</a>, <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/technological-addictions-the-new-frontier-in-addiction-psychiatry/4160D1D48CD08BBC4AE03DEA90B6B9CE?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=bookmark"">mass addiction</a>, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/"">erosion of privacy</a>).</p><p>Which brings me to another idea that occurred around the same time: “Terms of Service.” No, I’m not talking about the little box you check, having not read the thousands of words of dense, technical jargon.

The ethos of the early internet was rooted in the promise of a decentralized, open commons: a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/06/science/joichi-ito-innovating-by-the-seat-of-our-pants.html#:~:text=The%20Internet%2C%20on%20the%20other,groups%20at%20its%20%E2%80%9Cedges.%E2%80%9D"">“freedom to connect, to innovate, to program, without asking permission.”</a></p><figure><img alt=""A retro pixel-art graphic from an old operating system, showing a “Dialing Progress” window.

IYKYK. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> blockchaincompound.com</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, that ethos has been superseded. The commons has been enclosed and commercialized. Today’s dominant platforms are not public utilities but engines of monetization, driven by an <a href=""https://public.summaries.com/files/1-page-summary/the-attention-economy.pdf"">attention economy</a> that treats human focus as its primary resource.</p><p>In his book <strong><em>Technofeudalism, </em></strong>Yanis Varoufakis describes how</p><blockquote>“cloud capitalists… have mutated into something far grander: techno-lords presiding over cloud fiefs and accumulating a new form of rent- cloud rent-extracted from a new class of serf: the cloud serf.”</blockquote><p>The fundamental change in purpose- from a tool for communication to a system for extraction- is precisely why the field is overdue for an ethical overhaul.</p><h4><strong>Precedents for Accountability</strong></h4><p>This is not the first “wild west” in professional history…</p><p>Imagine you are a stonemason in ancient Greece, struck by a fever that will not break. You seek help in the agora, but the marketplace of “healers” is a chaotic spectacle.</p><p>One man offers a poultice of herbs mixed with magical charms. Another, a priest, insists your illness is a divine punishment and demands a sacrifice. A third offers a potion, but you’ve heard whispers that some such men are not above accepting payment to administer poison. Who do you trust with your life when there is no standard to distinguish a healer from a charlatan?

While the legend that the first rings were made from the bridge’s wreckage is an embellishment, its endurance speaks to the profession’s embrace of a foundational lesson in humility. Similarly, the legal and financial professions bind practitioners as <a href=""https://scholarship.law.ua.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=fac_articles"">‘officers of the court’</a> or with a <a href=""https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/fiduciary-duty"">‘fiduciary duty’</a>, a legal standard obligating them to act in their client’s best interest, not their firm’s.</p><p>In all cases, these oaths provide a higher authority to which the professional must answer, overriding the demands of a boss or a project budget. The tech industry, while relatively nascent, operates as a great exception.</p><p>Built on what Harvard Professor Shoshana Zuboff defines as</p><blockquote>“the unilateral claiming of private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data,”</blockquote><p>our current model of “surveillance capitalism”(Zuboff) is not an inevitable result of technology, but a specific <a href=""https://www.oru.se/contentassets/981966a3fa6346a8a06b0175b544e494/zuboff-2019.pdf"">“economic creation”</a> that has thrived in secrecy and <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/after-the-digital-tornado/caveat-usor-surveillance-capitalism-as-epistemic-inequality/9EB949FA5BD07CF448C7D8F6A226B975"">in the absence of law and regulation</a>.</p><p>The resultant system of unchecked growth without accountability now translates into our crisis of governance.

Yet with technology, we continually do. Corporations treat multi-billion-dollar fines as a fractional “cost of doing business.” In 2023, the five largest tech firms were fined a combined $3.04 billion.

No single person can be held responsible for the systemic harms that emerge.</p><p>This is the system’s genius: it scales profit and impact while atomizing responsibility.</p><figure><img alt=""The popular “Spider-Man pointing” meme, showing three identical Spider-Man characters standing in a circle and pointing accusingly at each other."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TVpZX_q_jLQYFXkSx9sTag.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Actual depiction of designers, engineers, and product managers when asked, ‘Who is responsible for the rollout of this harmful feature?’ <strong>Image credit:</strong> Marvel Entertainment / From the 1967 <em>Spider-Man</em> animated series, episode “Double Identity”… meme-ified.</figcaption></figure><p>A new oath, therefore, cannot be a passive pledge. It must be an active, professional tool that empowers the practitioner to fight this diffusion. It must grant tech workers the formal standing to ask questions, the right to see data, and the power to refuse; not as a malcontent, but as a professional upholding their code.</p><p>Consider the designer asked to create a notification system using intermittent variable rewards (<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201311/use-unpredictable-rewards-to-keep-behavior-going"">the same mechanism as a slot machine</a>) to maximize engagement. Ethical UX design principles dictate that a practitioner must <a href=""https://uxpa.org/uxpa-code-of-professional-conduct/"">“do no harm”</a> and put the <a href=""https://app.uxcel.com/tutorials/ethical-principles-for-creating-responsible-and-user-focused-ux-design-582#:~:text=UX%20design%20ethics%20means%20making,users%20have%20with%20your%20product."">user’s needs first</a>, but it would require something closer to a “Mandate of Inquiry” to fully empower the designer to ask: “Have we researched the potential impact of this on teen anxiety? Can I see that data before proceeding?” Under a protected oath, the designer is no longer a troublesome employee, but a professional upholding a standard.</p><p>It is crucial to distinguish such a framework as a set of <em>enforceable rights</em>, not as another aspirational pledge. The landscape is littered with <a href=""https://mkdale.github.io/techoath/"">“feel-good” oaths</a> and top-down corporate principles published by the very <a href=""https://ai.google/principles/"">companies causing harm</a>. These top-down models are ultimately toothless because they disempower the individual. They are tools for <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_4864"">legal compliance</a> and public relations, not for the practitioner in the “engine room.”</p><p>Even our most evolved professional codes, such as those from the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">ACM</a>), are largely silent on the employer-employee power dynamic. They are excellent at describing a practitioner’s duty- to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code"">prioritize the public good</a>, to <a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">“avoid harm”</a>, and to “<a href=""https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics"">challenge unethical rules</a>,” but they provide no tool or protection to do so against a conflicting order from management.</p><p>In other words, they tell the engineer to wave a flag at the runaway train, but offer no way to stop it. The practitioner who follows this duty is often the one who gets steamrolled, fired as a “dissenting employee” with <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">little recourse</a>.</p><p>The following Mandates, therefore, propose a fundamental shift: from a passive duty to an active <a href=""https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/negotiating-tech/governance-of-workplace-technology-applications/work-task-technologies-and-applications/control-ownership-and-protection-of-personal-and-professional-autonomy/"">power</a>. They are designed to arm the practitioner for that inevitable moment of conflict. While as yet imperfect and conceptual, they are intended to spark necessary conversation about what a framework of enforceable and protected ethics must look like, and how we, as a profession, can begin to implement it.</p><figure><img alt=""A symbolic image of a human hand shaking a glowing, blue, wireframe digital hand over a desk with a laptop on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1bCvg4YQsa9Jljd6vYQEhQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A symbolic handshake represents the “Architect’s Mandate,” a proposed formal pact between a tech professional and the systems they build, ensuring rights and accountability. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Unsplash</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The Architect’s Mandate: A Proposed Code</strong></h4><p>A functional oath for a tech professional would be less a pledge and more a formal declaration of professional obligations:</p><p><strong>I. The Mandate of Inquiry</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to ask “Why?”; to perform a root cause analysis on the intent behind the features I am asked to build. I will not be satisfied with metrics of “engagement” as a substitute for human value.</p><ul><li>This mandate is a direct antidote to the “architecture of diffused responsibility”. While existing codes suggest practitioners should <a href=""https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf"">“reflect upon the wider impacts of their work”</a> or <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/initiatives/great-tech-great-responsibility/addressing-ethical-issues-tech-worker/"">“talk across teams”</a>, this provides a formal, protected right to demand answers and data, piercing the veil of organizational siloing.</li></ul><p><strong>II. The Mandate of Consequence</strong></p><p>I shall have the right to access any and all research on the likely human impact of my work before it is deployed. I pledge to place the long-term well-being of the user above the short-term metrics of the platform.</p><ul><li>This right is a novel mechanism for accountability. While human rights organizations often <a href=""https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/where-human-rights-and-engineering-meet"">partner with engineers to analyze data</a> and ethical frameworks discuss organizational <a href=""https://iabac.org/blog/ethical-data-engineering-the-challenges-of-responsible-data-handling"">“transparency”</a>, no code grants the individual practitioner an affirmative right to access internal impact research before a product’s release.</li></ul><p><strong>III. The Mandate of Refusal</strong></p><p>I shall not be compelled to design, build, or deploy systems that I believe, in my professional judgment, are designed to exploit human vulnerabilities, erode agency or privacy, or amplify division. I will have the protected right to refuse such work without fear of retaliation.</p><ul><li>This mandate radically expands the existing “right to refuse” work. Current legal protections are almost exclusively limited to situations of “imminent danger” of “death or serious injury”. This proposes a new, professional standard of refusable psycho-social harm, and demands explicit <a href=""https://www.eeoc.gov/facts-about-retaliation"">protection from retaliation</a> for what amounts to secular, professional <a href=""https://www.westsoundworkforce.com/conscientious-objection-in-the-workplace/"">“conscientious objection”</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>IV. The Mandate of Precedence</strong></p><p>I pledge to hold my duty to the public- their safety, their agency, and their mental well-being- as paramount, above my duty to my employer’s stock price or my project’s quarterly goals.</p><ul><li>This is the foundational principle of all mature professional codes. The National Society of Professional Engineers, for example, states that the <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/sites/default/files/Ber97-5-app.pdf"">“highest ethical obligation is to protect the public health and safety”</a>. This mandate affirms that this established principle must finally be applied to the digital world.</li></ul><p><strong>V. The Mandate of Testimony</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to bear witness to systemic public harm caused by a product I helped create, even after its release. My professional duty to warn the public shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement or corporate policy, and I shall not be subject to retribution for this testimony.</p><ul><li>This is a potent synthesis of legal and ethical precedent. It argues that a tech professional’s <a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/communication-and-mass-media/duty-warn"">“duty to warn”</a> the public of danger, a duty that supersedes confidentiality in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542236/"">medicine</a> and <a href=""https://www.nspe.org/career-growth/ethics/board-ethical-review-cases/signing-confidentiality-agreement-duty-disclose"">traditional engineering</a>- must also supersede a non-disclosure agreement or policy. While <a href=""https://www.whistleblowers.org/non-disclosure-agreements-and-whistleblowers/"">whistleblower laws</a> already protect reporting of <em>illegal</em> activity and courts can compel testimony, this mandate seeks to extend that protection to testimony regarding <em>systemic public harm</em> that is not yet explicitly illegal.</li></ul><p><strong>VI. The Mandate of Audit</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to audit the data sets and models I am asked to use before deployment. I will have the right to test for, document, and mitigate algorithmic bias, even if it conflicts with a project’s timeline or stated goals.</p><ul><li>This mandate targets a well-documented harm: AI systems that perpetuate and amplify societal biases. An algorithm is often <a href=""https://www.proskauer.com/podcast/ai-bias-audits"">“only as good as the data that was used to train [it]”</a>. While some laws require top-down corporate <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/auditing-employment-algorithms-for-discrimination/"">“bias audits”</a>, this mandate grants the right to the practitioner, empowering them to test models and retrain or suspend biased algorithms as a matter of professional practice.</li></ul><p><strong>VII. The Mandate of Sustainable Design</strong></p><p>I shall have the protected right to refuse work that I believe, in my professional judgment, intentionally implements planned obsolescence or demonstrably contributes to environmental degradation.</p><ul><li>The tech industry is a massive contributor to e-waste and environmental harm, often by design (a <a href=""https://www.iberdrola.com/sustainability/planned-obsolescence"">“deliberate industrial strategy”</a>). This mandate extends the “right to refuse” beyond immediate human danger to include systemic environmental danger, empowering engineers to advocate for sustainable <a href=""https://www.computer.org/press-room/2016-news/code-of-ethics"">“green” engineering principles</a> and refuse to participate in practices they know to be destructive.</li></ul><p>The framework outlined here is not a plea for rebellion. If the “move fast and break things” era was marked by a defiant, adolescent, Frankenstein-esque hubris, this proposal is (conversely) a declaration of industry maturation. It is our chance to act on what Frankenstein only briefly glimpsed long after abandoning his creation, when he confessed,</p><blockquote>“For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were…”</blockquote><p>A codified set of principles, with the ultimate goal of legal enactment, is what separates a collection of atomized employees from a unified profession. A single person can be <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/conscientious-objectors-in-the-workplace-98913/"">fired</a>; a profession with a shared, legally-enforceable code of conduct has power.</p><p>We are not at the mercy of an unregulated “tech monster” beyond our control. We are its architects and gatekeepers. This is the moment we stop abdicating and choose to fulfill the duties of a creator.</p><p>This is the blueprint. It is time to take ownership.</p><p><em>I invite a public critique of these mandates from all professionals in the field. Join the conversation in the responses below.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4498fb64ea84"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-hippocratic-oath-for-tech-with-teeth-4498fb64ea84"">A Hippocratic Oath for tech… with teeth</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings… we thought we were coasting to the finish line of 2025, but baby, the cosmos said, “Not so fast.” This week kicks off with a <em>mind maze</em> of epic proportions as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November</a> 9 at 2:02 p.m. EST, and it’s happening in none other than Sagittarius — the sign of bold opinions, big dreams, and spontaneous “let’s go to Bali” texts. <br /><br />But under Mercury retrograde? Yeah… your GPS might glitch halfway through the journey. Sag energy loves to think big picture, but Mercury is trying to zoom in and say, “Wait, did you really mean that? Or were you just avoiding the details?” This is the kind of transit that makes you question your own hot takes. So if you suddenly backpedal on that workshop you were going to launch or rethink that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/long-distance-relationship-advice"">long-distance situationship</a> you were convinced was soulmate-level last week, you’re not flaky… you’re realigning. </p>



<p>The upside? Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius helps us relearn how to tell the truth, not the curated one, but the gut-level, soul-naked kind. You might revise that book pitch, backtrack on those travel plans, or finally admit that your “freedom” narrative was really a fear of intimacy in disguise. Don’t rush. Let yourself unlearn what you thought was the truth. Just double-check your emails, avoid signing contracts unless necessary, and be open to divine redirections. A closed door is a cosmic yes in another language. <br /><br />Then comes a major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">energetic shift on 11/11</a>, a sacred astro-numerological portal, and this year it hits different because Jupiter, planet of expansion, luck, and vision, begins its retrograde journey in Cancer at 11:41 a.m. EST. This is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter’s first retrograde in Cancer</a> in over a decade, and it’s pulling our energy inward, homeward, and backward. Think: ancestral roots, childhood patterns, and that “do I even want to live here anymore?” conversation that keeps circling your brain. The answers come slowly, but they’re sacred. You might be called to downsize, simplify, or renovate — not just your space, but your lifestyle. Maybe you thought you wanted a bigger house, but now you crave a cozier, quieter one. Maybe you thought you wanted to raise kids in the city, but now you’re craving ocean air and moonlight. This isn’t about contraction. It’s about rooted expansion. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer reminds us that the dream isn’t real if you can’t rest in it. </p>



<p>On November 12, the Last Quarter Moon in Leo flares up the tension between your public self and your private desires. This is a shedding moon — one that asks: <em>Is the persona you’re performing still aligned with who you’re becoming?</em> Leo moons can make us crave attention, validation, and applause, but this one’s got a little edge to it. You might feel hyper-aware of who’s watching, liking, or not responding at all. But instead of spiraling, try this: let it go. Use this quarter moon to release the pressure to be seen and instead commit to <em>seeing yourself</em>. The right people will always feel you. And the rest? Dust. </p>



<p>The week wraps with the Virgo Moon taking over from November 13 to 15, bringing a calming wave of discernment; not the perfectionist kind, but the cleansing, clarifying kind. This is the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">get your life together</a>” moon, but with softness. There are only six weeks left in 2025. This moon isn’t here to shame you for what you didn’t get done… it’s here to help you see what’s still worth doing. Let it highlight what’s still alive in your spirit. Where are you still passionate? Where are you tired for no reason? With Mercury retrograde ruling Virgo from fiery Sagittarius, this is your reminder that just because something once excited you doesn’t mean it still fits your values now. This week is a reclamation. Of your voice, of your truth, of your energy. <br /><br />You can be wise, wild, and well rested. Let that be your mantra as we enter the final stretch of the year.  <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, buckle up because Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius (starting November 9) is throwing some fire back in your direction… but not the type you can just power through. This retrograde hits your sector of expansion, travel, and publishing, so if you’ve got big plans, launches, interviews, or even far-off journeys on deck, double- and triple-check the logistics. You might feel misunderstood or even dragged online for something you said with the best of intentions — but instead of spiraling into defensiveness, use this time to ask yourself: <em>What do I actually believe, and is it still true for the version of me I’m becoming?</em> You’re not meant to shrink; you’re meant to refine. Editing your message, rethinking your audience, and getting clear about your voice doesn’t make you a sellout — it makes you someone with staying power. Think: slow down to go global. <br /><br />And then comes the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 portal</a>, where Jupiter begins retrograding in Cancer, your sector of home, family, and emotional roots. <em>Whew</em>. That one might hit a little deeper than you expected. Whether it’s your literal home or your internal sense of safety, this retrograde is asking you to pause and reflect. Do you still want to live where you are? Are you ready to build something new — or rebuild something old, but on your terms this time? Some Aries might suddenly crave a simpler life, downsizing their lifestyle or revisiting childhood patterns that shaped how they seek comfort. Others might feel pulled to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/november-tarotscopes-messages-ancestors"">connect with their ancestors</a>, mend family dynamics, or even reimagine what “home” means — especially if the old definition was wrapped in performance or pressure. You don’t have to fix it all right now. But <em>feel it</em>. Jupiter’s reminding you that true growth starts at the root. </p>



<p>By the time the Virgo Moon arrives (November 13 to 15), your spirit’s like, <em>okay, enough existential spiraling</em>, let’s get back in the body. This earthy moon moves through your health and wellness sector, giving you a stabilizing moment in an otherwise reflective week. The good news? This moon doesn’t want you to perfect anything — it just wants you to notice. Notice where you’ve been neglecting routines that actually help you feel more alive. Notice the little habits that need tweaking. And more than anything, notice what your body has been trying to tell you, especially as your mind has been zooming into big-picture questions all week. This is your mid-month grounding ritual. Drink the tea. Stretch your back. Cancel the plan you didn’t want to go to anyway. You’re allowed to rest even in the middle of the chaos. Especially then. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury’s retrograde in Sagittarius</a> beginning November 9 might stir up more than just philosophical questions — it’s nudging you into the shadows of your own psyche, your intimacy sector, where power, vulnerability, and shared resources live. And yeah… it could get a little messy. Old debts (emotional or financial) might resurface. Someone you thought you were “done” with might pop back in with a question or an apology. Or maybe it’s you who’s suddenly feeling called to unpack past decisions — especially the ones you’ve quietly judged yourself for. <br /><br />This retrograde isn’t about punishment, it’s about integration. What part of you have you been hiding out of fear of rejection or loss? You’re being invited to reclaim it. Reclaim your power, even if that means fumbling your way through some uncomfortable convos or realizations. Growth rarely comes wrapped in silk — sometimes it shows up with receipts and a mirror. </p>



<p>Then, on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, activating your communication and mindset zone — and that’s a big cosmic green light to slow your roll and listen more deeply. This isn’t about talking less, it’s about being more intentional with your voice. If you’re writing something big, launching something, or trying to have heart-to-hearts, give yourself space to revise, reword, or even re-feel what you’re trying to express. Childhood memories or old stories about your intelligence or communication style might resurface — not to haunt you, but to be rewritten with compassion. Are you speaking your truth… or the truth you think others expect from you? This is a powerful time to reconnect with your inner narrator and ask: <em>Is this the story I want to keep telling about myself?</em> If not, 11/11 is a beautiful portal for rewriting it. </p>



<p>By the time the Moon lands in Virgo from November 13 to 15, your creativity and joy sector becomes the stage for a mid-month emotional check-in. This isn’t about productivity — it’s about pleasure with purpose. Have you forgotten what makes you laugh? What makes you play? If you’ve been stuck in a loop of “doing the work,” this Moon invites you to remember why you’re doing it at all. Maybe it’s time to reconnect with your inner child, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/creativity-art-therapy-classes"">tend to a creative project</a> that’s been whispering your name. Maybe you just need to dance around your room with your phone on airplane mode. </p>



<p>Whatever it is, don’t wait for permission to delight in being alive again. You’ve been deep in the waters all week — now let this Virgo Moon offer you earth to stand on, and joy to reach for. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, let’s be real: Mercury’s retrograde starting November 9 is going to hit different, because it’s happening in your relationship sector (in the sign of Sagittarius), and Mercury’s <em>your</em> ruling planet. So yeah, you’re gonna feel it. Expect some double-texting energy, some “Wait… what did they <em>really</em> mean by that?” vibes, and maybe a ghost or two reappearing just when you thought you were emotionally vaccinated. This isn’t about drama for the sake of drama, though. It’s about clarity. If you’ve been unclear about what you want in love, business partnerships, or even creative collaborations, this retrograde could shake the dust off that indecision. Misunderstandings may happen, but they’re revealing what needs to be refined. And hey, if an ex pops up and you’re tempted? Ask yourself: Is this curiosity, closure, or an escape from what’s actually available to you right now? <br /><br />Then there’s 11/11 — a major portal, and the same day Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, which lights up your money and self-worth sector. This is deep. Like, ancestral beliefs about abundance deep. You might find yourself revisiting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/starting-investing-real-stories"">decisions around savings, investing</a>, or even the ways you’ve been undervaluing yourself in business or relationships. If you’ve been hustling for approval or centering others’ needs out of fear of rejection, this week will lovingly (or not so lovingly) ask you to stop. You are not a backup dancer in your own life. Jupiter here says: <em>take up more space — but the retrograde says, first, check where you’ve been shrinking</em>. Maybe it’s time to raise your rates. Maybe it’s time to cut off a draining energetic tie that’s been taking more than it gives. Either way, your value isn’t negotiable, even if your pricing strategy is. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your home and emotional roots sector, and it’s basically a cosmic reminder to stop skipping the warm-up. You don’t have to be “on” all the time, Gem. You don’t even have to be figuring things out. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-look-happier-trend-embracing-messiness"">You’re allowed to simply be: messy</a>, soft, still. Clean your space if that helps you breathe easier. Make your bed like it’s an act of devotion. Call someone who reminds you of who you were before the world told you to hurry. This isn’t a weekend to impress; it’s a weekend to nourish. Let the Virgo Moon guide you back to rituals that restore your nervous system and ground your ideas. The clarity you’re craving isn’t out there — it’s in the quiet corners you’ve been too busy to visit. Go home to yourself. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Mercury retrograde begins in your wellness, work, and routines sector on November 9, and let’s be real — if your body’s been whispering (or screaming) for rest, this is your sign to listen. This transit is like a cosmic timeout, forcing you to re-evaluate what “productivity” even means to you. Maybe you’ve been running on autopilot, saying yes out of guilt or fear instead of alignment. Maybe you’re craving a slower, softer pace but worried that if you stop, everything will collapse. Spoiler: it won’t. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius</a> is clumsy and chaotic, yes… but also philosophical. It invites you to pull back from the grind and ask: What’s the point of all this effort if your joy and peace aren’t part of the equation? <br /><br />Then comes a cosmic curveball and blessing wrapped in one: Jupiter begins its retrograde in your sign on 11/11, and Cancer, this is <em>big</em>. You’ve been expanding so much this year, maybe even faster than your inner world could keep up with. This retrograde is here to help you integrate. To help you reclaim what you’ve given away in the name of growth, people-pleasing, or perfection. You might revisit decisions you made earlier this year with fresh eyes, and this time, you’ll choose differently. You may downsize, cancel a major plan, or close a door that once felt full of promise — not because you’ve failed, but because you’ve evolved. Think of this as a soul homecoming: a re-rooting. And with your planetary ruler, the Moon, lighting up your sector of self-worth during the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus Full Moon</a> just days ago, your standards have risen — including the standards you hold for <em>yourself</em>. </p>



<p>As the Virgo Moon arrives November 13 to 15, things get even more introspective, but in the best, most clarifying way. This lunation activates your communication and learning sector, so consider it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-say-no-to-friends"">your permission slip to say no</a>, mute the noise, and re-curate your reality. Read something that expands your mind. Journal without editing. Take a walk without your phone and let your own thoughts be the soundtrack. Even if retrograde chaos swirls around you, you’re building something quieter and more grounded inside. </p>



<p>Something sacred. The second half of the week is like a mid-month recalibration: Where do you need to simplify? What ideas need breathing room? Virgo wants you to declutter your mind, and Cancer, that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">starts with choosing peace</a> over performance. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Mercury starts its final retrograde of the year on November 9 in your creativity, joy, and romance sector, and let’s just say, things might get <em>messy-hot</em> or <em>hot-messy</em> real quick. You might reconnect with a past lover (or crush), find yourself rewriting an old creative idea, or even second-guessing the ways you express your joy. Retrogrades aren’t meant to stall you, they’re meant to rewire you, so if your flirt game feels off or your passion projects aren’t clicking, don’t force it. Play. Revisit your old journals, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inner-child-healing"">revisit your inner child</a>. This retrograde wants to remind you that your creativity doesn’t have to be profitable, and your love doesn’t have to be performative. It just has to be <em>real</em>. <br /><br />Then on 11/11, a deeply emotional shift arrives: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer</a>, your sector of healing, rest, and closure. This is not the time to push. This is the time to soften. Some Leos may realize they’ve been carrying emotions that aren’t even theirs. Others may find themselves shedding ego identities that once felt protective — the performer, the leader, the strong one — in favor of deeper truth. You’re realizing that being seen isn’t always about being loud or perfect; it’s about being honest. Jupiter retro in Cancer helps you make peace with the past, with the versions of yourself you no longer need to be. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for solitude, sacred spaces, or spiritual nourishment. Let that be your compass. </p>



<p>As the Moon shifts into Virgo from November 13 to 15, you’ll feel a subtle but steady return to your values, money, and worth. You may be tempted to “fix” everything that feels off: your budget, your habits, your schedule, but the deeper ask is to center what actually sustains you. Not just financially, but emotionally, spiritually, physically. This Virgo Moon is your mid-month check-in: What’s been draining your light, and what’s been keeping it alive? The answers may not be flashy, but they’ll be <em>true</em>. Let simplicity lead. Let pleasure be enough. Let this week be a sacred act of recalibration — not so you can perform again, but so you can live more fully from your own center. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Mercury, your planetary ruler, begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations. This one’s going to feel personal. You might feel the urge to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">declutter everything in sight</a>, rearrange your furniture, or suddenly feel overwhelmed by family dynamics you thought were behind you. This isn’t regression; it’s excavation. If old patterns arise, especially around caretaking, over-functioning, or needing to be “the responsible one,” pause before reacting. Mercury retrograde wants to rewire your foundation from the inside out — so let yourself grieve, journal, question, and even nap more than usual. You’re making room for the version of home that feels more chosen than inherited. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, the ascension portal cracks open as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer</a>, illuminating your community and friendship sector. You may start to ask: Who really holds me? Who sees me when I’m not performing? Who do I trust to witness me in my becoming? This transit invites you to slow down your networking pace, rethink the roles you play in your social circles, and re-evaluate what solidarity actually looks like for you. Some Virgos may reconnect with old friends or communities that once brought joy, while others may realize they’ve outgrown certain connections — and that’s okay. Jupiter in retrograde is a cosmic blessing in disguise: it peels away the performance and leaves the soul. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon moves through your sign, and you’ll feel it like a subtle inner drumbeat returning you to yourself. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to do more or fix more to be worthy of ease. This is your mid-month reset. Instead of obsessing over what isn’t working, focus on nourishing what is. Ground yourself in rituals that feel like medicine — whether it’s meal prepping, doing absolutely nothing, or getting lost in a book. Let yourself be the thing you take care of this time. The world can wait — your healing can’t. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Mercury retrogrades in Sagittarius on November 9, lighting up your communication, learning, and local environment sector. So let’s be real: your words may trip over themselves this week, even when your heart is clear. That brilliant idea? It might need a few more rounds of refinement before you hit publish. The text you didn’t mean to send, the meeting you show up to on the wrong day… it’s all part of the cosmic comedy. But beneath the mix-ups, something deeper’s being rewritten. What are you <em>really</em> trying to say, Libra? What truths have you been avoiding out of politeness or fear of rocking the boat? Mercury’s slowdown invites you to get honest — not just with others, but with yourself. You don’t always have to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">translate your intuition</a> into something digestible. <br /><br />Then on November 11 (11/11 portal), Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your career and public image sector. If it feels like the outside world is slowing down just as you were picking up steam… that’s not a glitch, it’s divine timing. This retrograde asks you to <em>redefine success</em> on your terms. Maybe you’re not as excited about that promotion as you thought you’d be. Maybe a long-held goal no longer fits who you’re becoming. Jupiter in Cancer wants to root your ambitions in emotional truth, not external validation. You might find yourself craving a softer, more sustainable way of showing up in the world — one that honors your boundaries, your rest, your art. Let the discomfort guide you home. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your healing and subconscious sector, making this a powerful time to retreat, recalibrate, and listen to the whispers within. You don’t need to explain your absence. You don’t need to earn your stillness. Let this lunar energy be a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/staycation-digital-detox-personal-essay"">permission slip to say no, log off, close the tab</a>, and take the long way home. You are allowed to rest in the in-between. The clarity will come — but not if you chase it. Let it find you in the quiet. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, Mercury begins its retrograde in Sagittarius on November 9, in your money, values, and self-worth sector, and this one’s hitting close to home — literally and emotionally. It might bring some financial delays or confusion: think forgotten payments, tech glitches with invoices, or miscommunications around collaborations. But beyond the surface-level chaos, this is a deeply clarifying period. Mercury’s slowdown is asking: What do you <em>actually value</em>? Are you hustling out of fear instead of alignment? This retrograde wants to help you reassess your entire relationship with abundance. Maybe what you need isn’t more… maybe it’s a better understanding of what “enough” means for you now. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, your ruling planet Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your expansion, travel, and spiritual wisdom sector — and this is big. You may feel a sudden urge to cancel a trip, re-route a plan, or pull back from something you once thought was your “big break.” Let it happen. Jupiter’s moonlit retrograde is less about going somewhere and more about <em>returning</em> — to a truth, a purpose, or even an ancestor’s whisper you’ve been too busy to hear. You don’t have to chase enlightenment. You can live it in the quiet rituals, the daydreams, the pauses. This is the kind of transit that asks: What beliefs are outdated? What stories about yourself no longer fit who you’re becoming? </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendships"">energizes your community, friendship</a>, and long-term vision sector, and it’s here to help you sift through the noise. You’re realizing which social circles genuinely support your evolution and which ones subtly hold you back. Take stock of who you’re spending your precious time with. Are your connections reciprocal, or are you always the one holding space? Let the Virgo Moon guide you to organize your goals into tangible steps — no need for perfection. Just discernment, honesty, and a soft plan to carry you through these retrograde waters. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year in your sign on November 9, and you’ll likely feel it in your bones before you can name it. You might suddenly second-guess things you once felt 100% sure about: your image, your direction, even how you’ve been showing up lately. This isn’t a punishment, it’s a mirror. Mercury retrograde in your sign is like a cosmic mic check: Are your words aligned with your beliefs? Have your intentions kept up with your growth? If you’re misunderstood or if your message gets lost in translation this week, don’t panic. Take it as a signal to fine tune, not silence. You’re evolving. Your truth is too. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglements, and things get deep. A past entanglement, contract, or collaboration might resurface, and it’s not necessarily to restart it, but to reflect. This could be about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/personal-loans-real-examples"">money you loaned</a>, energy you overextended, or emotional investments that didn’t yield what you expected. Jupiter’s message here is loud: It’s time to reclaim your power by reexamining the places where you’ve over-given or under-valued your own needs. You might also feel a pull to tend to ancestral healing — themes of trust, survival, and legacy could come up, and they’re not here to haunt you, but to free you. </p>



<p>As the Moon moves through Virgo from November 13 to 15, your career and reputation sector lights up with earthy precision. While everything else may feel foggy or slowed down by retrogrades, this lunar transit helps you <em>ground your goals</em>. Clean up your calendar. Edit that proposal. Check your online bios — they might need updating. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing better. You’re learning to build a life that fits the version of you that’s emerging, not the one who was hustling out of habit. Let this week guide you to work smarter, live slower, and speak more intentionally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of spirituality, solitude, and endings. This one’s a little slippery. You may feel unusually foggy, sleepy, or overstimulated and disoriented all at once. It’s because your mind is trying to do what your spirit hasn’t caught up with yet. This is a week for remembering that not everything needs to be shared, explained, or understood immediately. Mercury retrograde is asking you to hit pause on external obligations and listen to your inner world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Dreams may get weirder</a>. Gut instincts stronger. You’re shedding thought patterns you didn’t realize were weighing you down. Let it happen in layers. </p>



<p>Then on the sacred 11/11 portal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde shifts into Cancer</a>, in your sector of relationships and contracts. Whether it’s a romantic partner, a business agreement, or an old commitment that’s expired, this transit is here to bring it all back to the surface. If something feels unfinished — it is. But this is not about reopening old wounds just to relive them. It’s about integrating what you’ve learned. This transit may challenge you to confront where you’ve overextended yourself in partnerships or allowed resentment to fester under the surface. On the flip side, it may illuminate where you’ve been too guarded to let real intimacy in. Either way, the invitation is to reimagine how you relate — not from survival, but from reciprocity. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lights up your sector of truth, travel, and expansion. You may find yourself craving an escape, but not necessarily a physical one. This might be the week you get lost in a book, sign up for a course, or revisit a philosophy that once anchored you. It’s the perfect time to assess what you’ve outgrown and what still resonates. Virgo’s clarity will help you map out the next leg of your soul journey… just don’t rush to have it all figured out. Let your sense of direction come from stillness, not pressure. You’re growing in silence this week, and it’s exactly what you need. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of community, vision, and long-term goals. If you’ve been go-go-go with big ideas, collaborations, or social media visibility, this is your cue to pause and reassess. Are you creating from your truth, or just trying to keep up? Mercury retrograde might bring a few tech glitches, scheduling delays, or misunderstandings among friends or team members. But it’s also a golden opportunity to get real about where your energy is going and why. Use this transit to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">revise your vision board</a> — metaphorically or literally. Who are you becoming, and who do you need around you to help make that future feel real? </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, the astro-numerological portal, and with it, Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, your sector of wellness, service, and daily rituals. This is less about productivity and more about sustainability. Jupiter here wants you to zoom out and ask: Is the way I live each day aligned with how I say I want to feel? Are you overgiving at work or neglecting your body’s requests for rest, nourishment, and movement? Maybe it’s time to simplify your routine, or even re-evaluate the kind of work you’re doing entirely. This transit might stir memories of past jobs, health routines, or caretaking roles that shaped your current reality — not to haunt you, but to help you release what’s no longer needed. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lands in your sector of intimacy, trust, and emotional transformation. You may find yourself quietly craving deeper connection, not just with others, but with the parts of yourself you’ve avoided. The Virgo Moon wants you to cleanse. This could look like journaling through a fear, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">organizing your finances</a>, or even deleting an old situationship’s number once and for all. Let this be a ritual of release. Mercury may be retrograde, but clarity is still available — especially when you’re honest about what you’ve outgrown. Make room for intimacy that feels like ease, not performance. You deserve that. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mercury begins its retrograde journey in Sagittarius on November 9, activating your career, visibility, and life direction sector. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">could feel like déjà vu</a> in the workplace, where past projects resurface or delayed recognition finally makes its way to you, but with strings attached. You may find yourself rethinking your goals or even reconsidering what “success” looks like for you. Are you chasing someone else’s version of accomplishment? Or is it time to give yourself permission to redefine what lights you up? Double-check important emails and deadlines, but also check in with your higher self — she might be whispering a totally different route forward. </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, and your planetary ruler Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, in your sector of creativity, romance, and self-expression. This is where the magic gets personal. A love from the past could resurface, not necessarily for reunion, but for reflection. You might feel pulled back into old creative dreams you once abandoned, wondering, “What if?” Jupiter’s slow dance in Cancer invites you to nurture your inner child and revisit the art forms or love stories that once brought you joy. If you’re a parent or mentor, this could be a healing period for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-aunts-uncles-nibling-social-media"">bonding with the young people</a> in your life, or with your own youthful spirit. Let yourself be moved. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo illuminates your relationship and one-on-one connection sector. It’s a clarifying lunar moment that may reveal where boundaries need adjusting, or where walls need softening. Whether you’re single, partnered, or in something undefined, the Virgo Moon brings discernment without coldness. Take this time to have the talk, send the email, or write the letter (even if you never send it). You’re learning to show up more authentically in partnership, but also to honor your solitude. Clarity is not closure, it’s a doorway. Walk through with grace. </p>

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> said “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she wasn’t referring to only the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-impactful-tv-shows"">moments in history</a> that feel like sunshine and roses. The iconic singer and activist meant the dark and ugly parts, too. </p>



<p>Lately, however, there’s been an alarming trend of people in power <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVG7PNTZbtM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">censoring art that reflects reality</a>. Just recently, Apple TV postponed the release of <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/""><em>The</em> <em>Savant</em></a><em> </em>in the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The series follows an investigator (Jessica Chastain) who interferes with white supremacist organizations before mass shootings occur. In a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"">Deadline</a>, a spokesperson for the streaming platform said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” adding that it would be released at a later date. <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain expressed her disappointment</a> on Instagram, stating that “we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States” since they began making the show five years ago. </p>

<p>This is just one example of Hollywood executives <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">canceling or suspending shows</a> and movies seemingly in immediate response to headlines of the day. Their statements may be broad, and their actions may do little more than appease shareholders, but the consistent <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">attacks on freedom of speech</a> and expression through the arts do nothing but hold the entertainment industry — and society — back.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth praising the TV shows and films that confront the times instead of running from them. These are the best series and movies that have refused to shy away from the social and political climates they were made in. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Fruitvale Station </em></strong>(2013)</h2>







<p>The world was introduced to the genius of Ryan Coogler through <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a poignant film that highlights the final day of Oscar Grant’s life. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, Grant was <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-years-since-oscar-grant-s-death-what-13489585.php"">killed at age 22</a> on New Years Day in 2009 by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer Johannes Mehserle. The killing occurred in Oakland, California — Coogler’s hometown — but the film resonated across the nation, and with timely reason: It debuted one year after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an event that sparked protests nationwide and ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in a formal way. State-sanctioned and racist violence was all too common, yet it had been long ignored on the silver screen. Coogler’s directorial debut shined a light on the deadly cost of institutionalized racism that the United States has yet to contend with. <strong><em>Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Watchmen </em></strong>(2019)</h2>







<p>Regina King is the true hero of this HBO limited series, adapted from the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name. Though <em>Watchmen</em> is set in a present-day alternate universe, it’s based on the true horrors of the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years_n_60a574b2e4b0313547925c09"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, in which white supremacists targeted an area of town known as Black Wall Street for its thriving Black-owned businesses. Unlike in reality, the descendants of the massacre receive reparations, leaving resentment amongst the white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry. King is a masked vigilante on a mission to put an end to the group’s pattern of racial violence. <em>Watchmen</em> also stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, and Jean Smart as their characters must confront their own ethics in ways they’ve never had to before.. This nine-episode series is a masterclass in rich, nuanced storytelling about the traumas that wounds inflicted from racism hold — and the inherited pain that ensues if not addressed head-on. With the resurfacing of white nationalism and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/us-black-history-dei"">erasure of historical facts </a>on federal and state levels, this prescient show is absolutely worth a rewatch today. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>One Battle After Another </em></strong>(2025)</h2>







<p>There’s a reason Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest has been heralded as one of the best films of 2025 while also spinning <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/one-battle-after-another-conservative-reactions-1236394128/"">conservatives into a tizzy</a>. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti, and highlights the cost and complexities of serving as part of a revolution. Though <em>One Battle After Another</em> doesn’t specify what the protagonists are fighting for other than freedom, it’s evident that patriarchal and white supremacists systems are a known enemy. (Sound familiar?) The film tackles racism, sexism, xenophobia, and classism as the main characters reunite after decades of inactivity in the effort to save the daughter of one of their own. A secondary plot focusing on immigrant rights reflects the reality of so many people and families who have recently been targeted by ICE raids under Trump’s regime; markedly, the film spares no punches in its depiction of this violence. <strong>One Battle After Another<em> is in theaters now with a digital release date of November 20.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Morning Show </em></strong>(4 seasons, 2019-present)</h2>







<p>Season after season, this Apple TV series understands the assignment. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, <em>The Morning Show</em> is a novel depiction of the inner workings of the media, this time from a nationally syndicated morning show on a major network. Each season, these journalists are impacted personally and professionally by major events happening in the world, from the #MeToo movement to the pandemic to the rise of artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, they must contend with a changing media landscape that leads to layoffs and a challenging environment for journalism to thrive. Watching this four-season show can be triggering for those working in the industry. Binge at your own risk.<strong><em> Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Adolescence</em></strong> (2024)</h2>







<p>This Netflix original is an uncomfortably ugly ride that exposes the life-threatening dangers of the digital manosphere. Owen Cooper plays a 13-year-old named Jaime, who — despite coming from a solid home with a seemingly normal foundation — is arrested for killing a female classmate who declined his advances. The four-episode series is a devastating depiction of how the dark corners of social media and the internet at large are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"">radicalizing young men</a> today. <strong><em>Stream now on</em></strong> <em><strong>Netflix.</strong></em></p>

<h2><strong><em>Her</em></strong><strong> </strong>(2013)</h2>







<p><em>Her</em> isn’t a horror film — but it might soon become a documentary, as a recent Vantage Point Counseling Services study showed that almost a third of Americans have admitted to having an <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/americans-romantic-relationships-ai-chatbot-study-b2838217.html"">intimate or romantic relationship</a> with an AI chatbot. That is more or less the premise of this film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely and introverted Theodore Twombly. Fresh off a divorce, Theodore falls in love with Samantha, a chatbot voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Though the Spike Jonze feature premiered more than a decade ago, it eerily predicted the moment in time we currently live in, particularly as a <a href=""https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it"">loneliness epidemic</a> and advancements in generative AI converge. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong> (6 seasons, 2017-2025)</h2>







<p>Watching this dystopian Hulu series is sombering, especially in a post-<em>Roe v. Wade </em>society. Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, the Emmy-winning series takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian nation that was once the United States. Its power-hungry men have made laws that subjugate women to follow an extreme set of laws that essentially gives the government total control of their bodies. It is illegal for them to read, vote, divorce, and freely express themselves in any way. June Osborne (Elizabeth Moss) is one of the few fertile women left in Gilead; for this, she is captured, enslaved, and forced to become a surrogate for a Commander and his wife. The torture, abuse, and dehumanizing conditions these characters experience make this show a hard watch, especially as lawmakers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/health/usaid-contraceptives-destroyed-trump.html"">continue to police</a> <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/09/texas-abortion-pill-ban/"">and chip away</a> <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2025/09/birth-control-incorrectly-labeled-as-abortifacients-by-trump-administration.html"">at women’s reproductive rights</a> at the federal and local level. <strong><em>Stream now on Hulu.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></strong> (2019)</h2>







<p>Gentrification has been a hot button topic for quite some time, but seeing how it’s depicted in <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> gives the conversation around it a fresh lens. The film centers on Jimmie Fails, a third-generation San Franciscan holding onto the Victorian home his grandfather supposedly built despite it no longer belonging to his family. When the home’s white former tenants vacate, Jimmie moves out of his friend’s apartment in a low-income neighborhood that’s built on toxic waste and begins squatting. The realities of the movie continue to this day: As the cost of living in one of the country’s <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/income-needed-to-live-comfortably-in-most-expensive-us-cities.html"">most expensive cities</a> continues to rise, <a href=""https://capitalbnews.org/black-displacement-gentrification-watts-study/"">communities established by people of color</a> have only become whiter and whiter. This Sundance Film Festival winner maintains its relevancy as Black and Brown neighborhoods across the country contend with what “home” looks like when so many of their neighbors are being displaced. <strong><em>Rent now on Prime Video or AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em></strong> (2018)</h2>







<p>Barry Jenkins masterfully adapts James Baldwin’s novel of the same name into the beautiful love story. Fonny and Tish are a young, Black couple from Harlem. Their relationship is tragically interrupted when Fonny is falsely accused of raping a white woman and thrown in prison. Though the film depicts the tragedy of mass incarceration and corruption, it takes care to treat the families impacted by these systemic travesties with  sophistication and dignity. The moral of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> is that no matter what systems try to break love, its resiliency is undeniable.<strong><em> Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong> (2015)</h2>







<p>The housing crisis took place in 2008 but Adam McKay’s <em>The Big Short</em> still feels eerily relevant. Starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, it takes a comedic approach to explaining how a group of investors predicted that a crash was coming and bet against the banks. They won big while the rest of the country went into an economic downward spiral. The Oscar-winning film depicted the role Wall Street’s greed played in causing The Great Recession. While other factors certainly contributed to the economic realities of 2008 and the following years, the film still hits as today’s everyday Americans increasingly feel financial strain. <strong><em>Watch now on Paramount+</em></strong>.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Don’t Look Up</em></strong> (2021)</h2>







<p>As a comet hurls towards Earth, two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) try to warn the global population in this Adam McKay-directed film. Few are taking this death star seriously, however — including the U.S. president. <em>Don’t Look Up </em>follows DiCaprio and Lawrence’s charaters as they take matters into their own hands and warn the general public. Political hijinks ensues as the comet becomes a divisive issue rather than a rallying cry for action. Though a comet is the big threat in this film, it feels like a metaphor for many things, including the looming dangers of climate change and the gullibility of viewers who believe something is “fake news” because a politician told them so. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix. </em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Severance</em></strong> (2 seasons, 2022-present)</h2>







<p>This Emmy Award-winning Apple TV series premiered after the onset of the Covid pandemic and the work-from-home era, when many Americans had the time to assess their relationship with their work. Seasons don’t exist in the cold and dreary town run by Lumon, the company that sells the dream of a true work-life balance by literally severing their personalities into two. Their workplaces selves (innies) don’t know anything about their outside selves (outies). What initially seems like the ideal technology becomes an actual living hell for a group of employees who have effectively lost their free will. <strong><em>Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Wire</em></strong> (5 seasons, 2002-2009)</h2>







<p>A hallmark of prestige television since the moment it debuted in 2002, <em>The Wire</em> should be required viewing for anyone looking to pursue careers in law enforcement, journalism, local government, or the legal field. Set in Baltimore, the HBO original chronicles institutions on each side of the drug trade and examines how cops, drug dealers, reporters, lawyers, teachers, and blue-collar workers are all connected by the same system. Creator David Simon paints a vivid picture of the toll political corruption, racism, and addiction take on both individual people and the entire city. Though specific to the Maryland city in its accents and details, the show’s message easily applies to other urban cities across the country. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>After The Hunt</em></strong> (2025)</h2>







<p><em>After The Hunt</em> poses a frustratingly timeless question: Who gets to be the perfect victim? Ayo Edebiri stars as Maggie Price, a queer Black student at Yale University whose family is filthy rich. This complex background — a mix of privilege and marginalization — as well as her suspected missteps call her integrity into question after she accuses a male instructor of raping her. Julia Roberts plays Alma Olsson, Maggie’s professor and mentor, who has to make a decision: Support her mentee as Maggie seeks to hold her abuser accountable, or side with her colleague with whom she shares romantic chemistry. The film challenges assumptions as it holds an uncomfortable mirror to the ways in which modern society still views consent and cancel culture.<strong> After the Hunt <em>was in theaters in October and will be released digitally on PrimeVideo soon.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em><strong>I May Destroy You </strong></em><strong>(1 season, 2020)</strong></h2>







<p>The series created by and starring Michaela Coel premiered two years after bombshell allegations against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein thrust Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement into the national spotlight and sparked widespread conversations about sexual assault, harassment, and survivorhood. It’s a visceral but necessary watch. The show centers on three main characters as they navigate what it means to heal after being subjected to sexual violence. In just one season, <em>I May Destroy You</em> tackled the messy, dark, harrowing reality of what it means to process sexual assault and maintain a sense of your own agency as a survivor. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>



<h2>Important Dates:</h2>



<p><strong>November 17:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer harmonizes with the Sun in Scorpio, giving us a chance to take a step back and see ourselves clearly. <br /><br /><strong>November 22:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer connects with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Scorpio</a>, making us sentimental and longing for the past. <br /><br /><strong>November 26:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer trines <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our emotions and desire to connect with others. <br /><br /><strong>December 6:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio sync up again, retracing the actions and decision of the previous weeks. <br /><br /><strong>January 9, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer opposes Venus in Capricorn, pushing us to take risks that may or may not be victorious. <br /><br /><strong>January 10, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer juxtaposes the Sun in Capricorn, amplifying our strength and vitality. <br /><br /><strong>January 10, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer aspects Mars in Capricorn, adding energy and gusto our auras. <br /><br /><strong>January 14, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer links up with Mercury in Capricorn, intensifying miscommunications and travel delays. <br /><br /><strong>February 16, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer dances with Mercury in Pisces, allowing us to be more sensitive to others and ourselves. <br /><br /><strong>February 22, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Venus in Pisces get nostalgic, enticing us to reach out to those that made an impression upon us back in the day. <br /><br /><strong>March 5, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and the Sun in Pisces, boosting our self-confidence and rizz. <br /><br /><strong>March 9, 2026:</strong> Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and Mercury retrograde in Pisces, establishing re-communication with old flames and acquaintances. </p>

<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>

In November, the veil between the living and spirit realms is thin. This traditionally is a prime opportunity for us to tune into the silence and grasp the guidance that is being given to us through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">our ancestors</a> and spirit allies. Between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> and Gede Season, spirit reminds us that death is not an ending but an additional chapter in our lives. It’s a new beginning of sorts. <br /><br /> This month, our task is to listen to the direction we are being pointed to. This will help us sharpen our intuitive and psychic gifts that we’ve inherited from our ancestors and surrender to whatever is meant to shed from our lives so that a new beginning can arise. This is a time to celebrate your lineage, pour libations, and embody the prayers that made you possible. November’s tarotscopes will grant you clarity on your next steps during this season.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941368.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />This month is an emotional rebirth. Prepare to embody a more mature and abundant you. The ancestors and guides are pouring into you, whether that is through mirroring to you your truth and magnificence, providing juicy opportunities that will have your cup overflowing, or giving you the space to process your emotions and release in a safe way. Allow your heart to lead you. You’ve spent enough time surviving; now it’s time to receive. The Ace of Cups opens a new cycle of intimacy with yourself, your spirit, and the people who see you clearly. Don’t overthink. Let whatever is coming up to flow. What’s meant for you won’t require force. Your ancestors are blessing this new beginning. Drink from it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941369.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />This season implores you to slow down, milk the present moment, and seek the portal to all possibilities by enjoying the luxuries you have now. Find ways to devote to yourself versus rushing onto your next destination or attempting to control outcomes you have no control over. You are the wealth and success that you seek, so you do not chase something you already are. You are being asked to be disciplined on the homework your spirit guides have appointed to you. If you know doing something is for your betterment, commit to it. Be consistent. Everything you do, act on, say, think, and believe is sacred work. You are powerful. Focus on alignment and precision. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941370.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 7 of Wands<br /></strong><br />Your ancestors are fighting for you. They are carving pathways that you did not deem possible. They are defending your names behind closed walls and protecting you from unseen dangers and setbacks. Have you taken the time to thank them and to honor them? Have you considered what incredible qualities and characteristics you’ve inherited from them that you have yet to leverage? This season is about fighting back and ensuring that you will no longer play small or be taken for granted. Enough is enough. It’s time that you show the world what you are made of. Are you going to be a victim and just accept life’s circumstances as if you have no power of your own? Or will you invoke the flames of your ancestors to accept what is rightfully yours and enjoy every minute of it? </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941371.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: Justice<br /></strong><br />Behind the scenes, your ancestors are ensuring that justice is paid off and that the scales are balancing in your favor. This season, say that powerful prayer that is known to clear the roads of obstacles and unfavorable conditions. Ask your ancestors to remove any limitations, hindrances, and unwarranted energies in your life that are keeping you from reaching your next level and are not for your highest good. Prepare for the plot twist of your life and for a new chapter to emerge with more clarity than ever. Remain in integrity with yourself and the spirit realm. If you say you will do something, do it. If you receive benevolent guidance that will accelerate your life, act on it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941372.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 6 of Swords</strong><br /><br />You’ve got the green light to move on. You are being supported by the spirit realm to make this transition and shed that energetic weight with as least resistance as possible. Anything that has been making you stuck or showing no progress, will now be alleviating itself from your life. Your ancestors are guiding the boat now, steering you toward calmer waters. Don’t look back out of guilt or nostalgia. What’s ahead is peace, clarity, and spiritual renewal. Trust the transition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941373.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: The Star</strong><br /><br />It is safe to believe again. Prior to this month, you might have questioned your desires and possibility of you actually attaining them. You may have questioned the route you are taking and whether or not you are on the right path. This season you will be shown just how aligned you are. Your ancestors are lighting the path ahead, showing you what’s possible when you believe again. This is your season to rebuild your faith, not from fantasy but from alignment with your higher purpose. You are blessed and highly favored. It is time to believe and pour into yourself so heavily that no other assumption exists. Allow yourself to shine because it is your identity. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941374.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: 4 of Swords</strong><br /><br />Rest is sacred work, and it holds the key to you attracting all that you need. The guides want you to slow down and intentionally implement old and new ways of relaxing and resting because that's how they get to speak directly to you without resistance. You need to be open and receptive to the guidance that wants to stream through. The information and downloads you receive this month are paramount to your evolution in life. Call your energy back to you and engage in practices that bring your awareness back into your body. Catch how many times your consciousness begins to wander somewhere outside of you and gently pull it back. Pause because clarity comes in stillness. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941375.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: 5 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You’re being asked to let go. Stop replaying what didn’t work or who didn’t stay. Something more glorious and aligned is on the horizon, but grief is keeping you from tapping into it. Give your sorrows, frustrations, and angst to your ancestors. Allow the emotions to be fully felt and embraced, but don’t hang onto them too long that they become a hindrance. This season, choose acceptance over attachment and seek peace. Mourn and release. Then lift your head, because the blessings ahead need your full presence and anticipation, not your pain.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941376.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 10 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />This season is about cementing your legacy through bold quantum moves. You’re not just acting from this timeline but from four timelines above it. Envision the person who already has what they want: what would that version want, and what would that other version want, and so on and so forth. Act from that space because leaping above the mundane is what’s going to set you apart and rapidly accelerate the attainment of your desires. You are not making yourself proud but breaking barriers for your entire lineage. The abundance is overflowing from you because you are secure in the embodiment of it. The amount of value you exude and provide is tremendous. Know that you are the answered prayer and everything you do moving forward will expand. Celebrate yourself and how far you’ve come. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941377.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 2 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You are being invited to learn more about yourself through your interactions and relationships with others. Your ancestors are sending mirrors: people and situations showing you how you give and receive love. Take notes. This is a time to consider if you have been providing the right energy that will foster supportive harmonious relationships and if you’ve been poured into as well from the other end. This is an optimal opportunity to allow old dynamics to shed and transform into beneficial supportive partnerships but also to call in new community and relationships that you desire. Prepare for the truth to be revealed to you and don’t run from it. Lead with your heart. You’ll know what to do. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941378.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: The Sun <br /></strong><br />You are the center of your own universe and the source of all abundance, so move like it. This is your glow up season where all eyes are on you, but, most importantly, you are shining on yourself like no other. This period is going to bring visibility, praise, recognition, joy, creative expansion, orgasms, and the successful results of doing the inner work and embodying your highest timeline. The ancestors are celebrating you and clearing the path so you are free to live your best life and, through example, show others that they can do it, too. Trust that so much is coming your way, and you will be perpetually making room for it all. You deserve it all.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941379.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Luxury is your birthright. Don’t you forget it! There are so many ways that you will choose to indulge in luxury this season that it becomes the baseline and the standard of your reality. Your ancestors are reminding you where you come from and how to shift struggle and turn it into gold. Your ability to generate abundance will be evident by the way you glow and live your life. You’ve cultivated this season of abundance through discipline, healing, and divine timing, so enjoy it! Don’t shrink your shine or apologize for your success or for choosing joy over suffering. Dress well, move with grace, and own your softness as power. You are walking proof that self-worth attracts everything.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>Every year, when Venus enters Scorpio, we dive headfirst into our passions. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio is an intense water sign</a> that instantly knows what it wants. The intuition of Scorpio is fire, leading us to align with those at our level by forming close relationships with them. When Venus is in Scorpio, the romantic planet becomes slightly more seductive and goes after what it wants, encouraging our affections to reach a feverish pitch. We do not settle for anything less than we deserve, as we know to shoot for the stars and beyond. The caveat is that we can get competitive, since our ambitions take center stage. Calming this part of ourselves will be challenging — especially with this season’s cosmic line-up. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-2024-meaning-effects"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is adding to the swampiness of the next several weeks. Since we are already in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>, the connection to Mercury retrograde in Scorpio, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, and Saturn and Neptune retrograde in Pisces is tapping into our emotions and the past. It’ll be hard to escape the present ramifications of our former decisions, urging us to be more reflective. As a result, we may spend time alone, ruminating over our choices and trying to forge a new path forward. The one positive thing is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the signs in the water element</a> keep us going; however, most planets are retrograde, making us feel like we are paddling against the current flow of energy. The best way to handle the vibe is to stop working hard relentlessly for the future and to be present. Water can heal and soothe our pain if we let it.</p>



<p>There could be moments of enlightenment during Venus’s stint in Scorpio. Having a discerning eye during the New Moon in Scorpio on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November</a> 20 urges us to break free from situations and relationships holding us back. Releasing people, whether by unfollowing them on social media or keeping a safe distance, will make us lighter. Carrying around resentments and jealousies isn’t emotionally healthy, so it’s ideal to do a cleansing to ensure we can mend our hearts. Remember, this may take a while. There is no timeline for recovery. Everyone is different and does what works with their own methods. <br /><br />Watch out for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-support-partner-with-ptsd"">trauma bonding</a> at this time because we might align with those going through parallel experiences. Although the instant reaction is to assume that they are our spiritual counterpart, the relationship will shift when Mercury turns direct on November 29 and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30 (these dates are markers for specific cycles’ ending). The lesson is to maintain boundaries and not to blur lines. Staying in our lanes is advisable to ensure we do not become upset when the rapport dissipates. Therefore, it’s best to discuss our baggage with a therapist, close friends, or family members who will be by our side through thick and thin. <br /><br />Words of wisdom: From November 6 to 30, while Venus is swimming in the deep end of the ocean in the enigmatic and provocative sign of Scorpio, make sure to do something nice for yourself. Whether buying a cute pair of shoes, driving to the countryside to bask in the beautiful foliage, or reading an exciting book. The celestial waves of Venus in Scorpio are bringing change, which means putting ourselves first. More importantly, becoming obsessed with ourselves because we are fabulous in our own unique ways.</p>
