Timber framing is exposed through <em>shinkabe</em> construction (<em>shinkabe</em>: a traditional Japanese method in which columns and beams are expressed), resulting in a stripped-down appearance free of excess. At a time when construction costs continue to rise, I believe that reconsidering the wisdom embedded in traditional Japanese houses was a rational approach.</p>",

To design <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/underground"">underground</a> is to engage with the unseen mechanisms that shape the world above.</p>",

<p>The pursuit of stronger, lighter, and more durable materials has guided architecture long before polymers or carbon fibers existed. One of the earliest large-scale examples of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034993/lighter-and-stronger-composites-are-changing-how-we-build"">composite materials</a> can be found in the Great Wall of China, where stone, clay bricks, and organic fibers such as reeds and willow branches were blended to create a resilient and lasting structure. These early techniques reveal a timeless intuition: distinct materials, when combined thoughtfully, produce properties unattainable by any single element. As the construction sector faces urgent ecological pressures, this intuition is being revisited through the lens of sustainability, with architects and engineers exploring bio-based, recycled, and hybrid composites designed not only for performance but also for circularity and environmental responsibility.</p>",

Layers of player experience</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Usability</h3><p>According to the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, usability is about how easily and pleasantly users can achieve their goals when interacting with a product.</p><p>It is an important factor for a product’s success and popularity. In some cases, usability can be one of the key or a unique selling point: Apple’s <em>“It just works”.</em></p><p>I’ve never seen a game that people play just because it has a pleasant UI. However, audiences get used to a certain level of interaction quality from other domains: mobile apps, web products, automotive infotainment systems.</p><p>When a game’s UI does not meet these expectations, it negatively affects usability and, as a result, the overall game experience. <strong>Сompetition drives progress </strong>(<em>or burnout</em>).</p><figure><img alt=""A meme with two images of Doge dogs.

And look how nice our premium store and battle pass are. Hey, where are you going? Wait!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g0hJxyGYcJXRIDAQTjz68w.png"" /></figure><h3>Competition</h3><p>Today, there is intense competition for people’s time and attention. The number of platforms and content options has multiplied. One moment players are fighting a boss in a game, and the next moment they have already spent four hours watching AI-generated cats cheating with panthers.</p><p>We can divide competitors into<a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-competitors-business""> three categories</a>. For example, I am thinking about playing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> on PS5.</p><h4>Direct competitors</h4><p>Games from a similar AAA subset within the same genre: <em>open-world, survival horror, post-apocalyptic shooters, …</em></p><h4>Indirect competitors</h4><p>Other games that provide a similar emotion, feeling — competitors for experience rather than genre: <em>Ori</em>, <em>Cuphead</em>, <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em></p><h4>Replacement/substitute competitors</h4><p>In this case, competitors for time and attention. Some examples:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Media and streaming</em></strong><em> (Netflix, Prime, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Twitch)</em></li><li><strong><em>Mobile applications</em></strong><em> (e-commerce, dating)</em></li><li><strong><em>Social media</em></strong><em> (TikTok, Instagram)</em></li><li><strong><em>Offline activities</em></strong><em> (sports, board games, travelling)</em></li></ul><p>A large number of options can trigger choice paralysis or lead people to choose the simplest one — scrolling through a social media feed. Many of these replacement competitors didn’t exist in the 2000s, so my choice as a child was simpler: <em>play Crash Bandicoot and watch Nickelodeon cartoons</em>.</p><p>Today, the market offers hybrid solutions. For example, Netflix has been adding games to its library for several years, aiming to capture even more of users’ time and attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional image showing three smartphones aligned side by side, each displaying a different game splash screen, with Ubisoft and Netflix Games logos above, representing a multi-game mobile platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FRQ3-Kd8KS2ueu_7ZfXAMg.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Netflix and Ubisoft are partnering to create three exclusive mobile games for Netflix members. </em><a href=""https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-partners-with-ubisoft-to-create-three-exclusive-mobile-games-for"">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Heuristics</h3><p>Let’s return to usability and heuristics. Of course, this alone will not win a game the <em>Game of the Year</em> award at <a href=""https://thegameawards.com/winners""><em>The Game Awards</em></a><em> </em>— perhaps, a chance to compete in the <em>Innovation in Accessibility</em> category. However, a well-developed usability layer can reduce the risk of users leaving for competitors, and as we can see, there are plenty of them today.</p><p><strong>Usability heuristics</strong> are general principles that help evaluate and improve the ease of use of a system. They are not limited to digital interfaces and are effective across many domains and products. These heuristics are often based on observation and practical experience rather than mathematical formulas or psychological terminology. The most well-known set is<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/""> Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics</a>.</p><p>I used these 10 as a foundation, along with the work of Celia Hodent (<a href=""https://celiahodent.com/ux-practices-epic-games/""><em>Developing UX Practices at Epic Games</em></a>), and consolidated them into an updated set of eight.</p><figure><img alt=""List of usability heuristics with arrows highlighting grouped items: items 3 ‘User control and freedom’ and 5 ‘Error prevention’ are connected with a bracket pointing to ‘Error Prevention and Recovery’; item 7 ‘Flexibility and efficiency of use’ has an arrow pointing to ‘A11Y and Flexibility’."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FosqKLxwqgH90lUFlWvKdw.png"" /><figcaption>Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and updates</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong></li><li><strong>Match between the system and the real world</strong></li><li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></li><li><strong>Error prevention and recovery</strong></li><li><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong></li><li><strong>Accessibility (A11Y) and flexibility</strong></li><li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></li><li><strong>Help and documentation</strong></li></ol><p>Next, I will take a closer look at each heuristic and share a few examples that came to mind. There are countless examples and solutions around us, developing this awareness is extremely valuable for designers.</p><h3>1. Visibility of System Status</h3><p><em>Design should always communicate what is happening in a clear and timely manner for the user. Use visual, auditory, and tactile channels to inform players about game events (</em><strong><em>informative signs</em></strong><em>), encourage them to perform certain actions (</em><strong><em>inviting signs</em></strong><em>), and provide clear feedback on their interactions (</em><strong><em>feedback</em></strong><em>). All game features and possible interactions should have clear signs and appropriate feedback.</em></p><p>The main role of the HUD interface is to inform the player about game states and events — for example, health, available character actions, position on the map. Which information should be shown or hidden depends on the game and its context.</p><figure><img alt=""First-person view with HUD elements showing team status, timer, score, ammo, health, and interaction prompts, while a diegetic wrist-mounted device on the player’s hand displays an active drone interface integrated into the game world."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aCiH3803d_xPfZLqaTX18Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege X</figcaption></figure><p>In game <strong>menus</strong>, this may include stats, character balance, available actions, or messages explaining why certain options are unavailable.</p><figure><img alt=""Armor upgrade menu showing stats, required resources for upgrades, and the message “Not Enough Resources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RspNBl9KFDO_XLS0uhz30w.png"" /><figcaption>Upgrade Menu in God of War Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>An example from <strong>industrial design</strong> that comes to mind is an elevator: when we approach, we can see the system status — which floors the elevators are on, whether they are moving, and if they are operational. Based on this information, we decide which elevator to call. We press a button and receive feedback — the button lights up until the elevator arrives, and the floor number changes.</p><h3>2. Match Between the System and the Real World</h3><p><em>Design should communicate in the users’ language: words, phrases, models, and concepts. Follow real-world conventions so that information is presented in a natural and logical order.</em></p><p>This is especially important for UI text, often called <strong>UX copy</strong>. It makes up a significant part of the interface and can make the user experience delightful — or, conversely, frustrating.</p><p>The screenshots below show examples of HUD widgets: they mirror the layout of buttons on the input device (gamepad, keyboard, Nintendo Switch, etc.). This helps players quickly understand what to do and which button(s) to press.</p><figure><img alt=""Hint widget: L-stick + X for action ‘Climb’; nearby icons for Y, A, and B actions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g8E3vC1lCAo64QkMxVg02g.png"" /><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)</figcaption></figure><p>This approach makes interactions feel more natural, as it aligns with our mental and physical models. A consistent pattern or standard can be seen across the three game examples.</p><figure><img alt=""Three examples of HUD widgets from Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man 2, Assassin’s Creed Shadows with action buttons and indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fglgClLwFKyD25HynRGPgg.png"" /><figcaption>HUD widgets for weapons, abilities, consumables</figcaption></figure><h3>3. Consistency and Standards</h3><p><em>Interface elements should be consistent and adhere to accepted standards.</em></p><p>Why reinvent the wheel when you can <em>steal like an artist</em>? The radial weapon selection menu (<em>Weapon Wheel</em>) is used in games to provide quick access to weapons or items.</p><figure><img alt=""Item selection wheel from Red Dead Redemption 2 showing Dead Eye Tonics, highlighting Chewing Tobacco."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ry4Cpk4E7ndic8TtcANEpg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon selection wheel from Far Cry 6 showing MS16 S rifle with armor-piercing rounds highlighted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8_N1xxiQow2G6Xx3OQpKZg.png"" /><figcaption>Radial Menu in Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), Farcry 6 (2021)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Navigation </strong>in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> (2022) is similar to YouTube or other TV apps. Overall, it’s a common practice to borrow and get inspired by solutions from other domains: familiar standards, structures, and patterns.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube and Horizon Forbidden West interface with side navigation menu."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NWFE14Yz-NS6SHk4IdYLSw.png"" /><figcaption>YouTube and Horizon Forbidden West (2022) navigation</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Level design</strong> follows the same rules: climbable ledges look similar across games; red barrels are likely to explode when shot; yellow elements draw attention to important objects, just as in urban design.</p><figure><img alt=""Four game screenshots showing climbable ledges: Uncharted 4 — stone ledges; STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order — scratched metal platforms; Kena: Bridge of Spirits — marked ledges with symbols; God of War Ragnarök — rocks with visible points and symbols."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eXo9Dstx4cco7-9qop9vEQ.png"" /></figure><h3>4. Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3><p><em>Information needed for interaction should be visible or easily accessible when required. This reduces memory load by keeping objects, actions, and parameters clearly visible.</em></p><p>For example, a list of available actions or controls in a specific game context:</p><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 6 airplane screenshot: control info panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5OrnlFBK7BoF0YnYYEQ8Rw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon shop interface with catalog and control panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2UO9rBVokYoSmjbjq0jh3A.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 6 (2021), Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The option to open a map legend and recall the meaning of icons is another example:</p><figure><img alt=""Game screen from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown showing map with legend on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ez8WaDLwyuZm2Cet_iN7_A.png"" /><figcaption>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool implementation can be seen in <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. On the left is diegetic UI — the character points to world tiles on the doors — while on the right, a non-diegetic panel provides the player with information about this location, quests, and collectibles. This reduces the amount of information the player needs to remember or search for.</p><figure><img alt=""Character standing near wooden doors with world symbols; UI panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rn_HY8g7LKDIz8u50T0mTw.png"" /><figcaption>God of War: Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>In many applications, a <strong>Recent Files</strong> function serves the same purpose: it shows the last opened documents or projects. Users don’t need to recall the exact file path or name — they simply recognize and select the item they need.</p><h3>5. Error Prevention and Recovery</h3><p><em>Try to prevent errors that are not part of the core experience, where challenges and obstacles are intentionally designed. If an error does occur, help players recover quickly and understand its cause.</em></p><p>The first examples that come to mind are confirmation pop-ups<strong> </strong>— an extra step in interaction, but designed to prevent mistakes.</p><figure><img alt=""Dishonored 2 UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZ0XdOqwNX15G6SV9TmaXA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Horizon Forbidden West UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i8pBxCGFSUhohhXg.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Dishonored 2(2016)</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West(2022)</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hi-Fi Rush UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zkCuKFQ4_kTeltSiyf5bnA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""XDefiant UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CtUWlXba2MqkaW0i3qYcxw.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Hi-Fi Rush(2023)</em> and <em>XDefiant(2024)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the button order in the pop-ups: in the first case, <strong>No–Yes</strong>; in the second, <strong>Yes–No</strong>. It seems the world has not yet standardized it. Currently, I lean toward clearly labeling actions. Instead of generic Yes/No, use explicit labels like <strong>Exit, Delete, Buy</strong>, and <strong>Back, Cancel</strong>, etc. This way, users can understand and anticipate the outcome of their actions just by reading the buttons. I’ve seen this approach across platforms such as TV, iOS, and PlayStation.</p><p>Interestingly, for confirming critical actions, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Figma </em>use similar design solutions. In WoW, deleting a character requires typing the word <strong>“</strong>DELETE<strong>”</strong>, and in Figma, deleting a team requires typing the team’s name to confirm the action.</p><figure><img alt=""World of Warcraft character deletion confirmation dialog over game background, asking to type ‘DELETE’ to confirm."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0SLga3uDXb21AR4_dzL7XA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Figma interface showing a team deletion confirmation popup with warning text and input field to enter team name."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*htyeVWkAx4g8_ehE-XQTTQ.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>6. Accessibility and Flexibility</h3><p><strong><em>Accessibility</em></strong><em> refers to the qualities that make an experience open to all, according to </em><a href=""https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf""><em>the Inclusive 101 Guidebook, Microsoft Inclusive Design</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The more customization options a game provides, the more accessible it can be for players. However, it’s not necessary to <em>anchor</em> on creating hundreds of options and categories. It’s better to explore new, more refined UI solutions — perhaps some automatic synchronization of game and platform settings or even <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/""><em>AI: intent-based UI paradigm</em></a>. Still, if there are many settings, a <strong>search function</strong> in the game can be helpful, similar to those in iOS, Android, Windows, or Call of Duty.</p><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Ukrainian with left-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4jNDZhj2eqI3xqdnVc2D_Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Arabic with right-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AvB7P_cjhF_y-Eu6M6sH2Q.png"" /><figcaption>Mirrored UI for Accessibility settings in XDefiant (2024) in Ukrainian and Arabic</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Flexibility</em></strong><em> ensures effective interaction for both new and experienced users.</em> For example, hotkeys, shortcuts, macros, and personalized settings. In <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, players can switch weapons either through the overlay menu or using shortcuts. The menu shows the assigned keyboard keys (1, 2, 3…) as a reminder of this interaction method.</p><figure><img alt=""Scene from Resident Evil 4 (2023): character in a dark room, weapon selection menu on the right with labeled hotkey slots."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ysA2iGSZMBC5UOP2SXlMag.png"" /><figcaption>Resident Evil 4 (2023)</figcaption></figure><p>It is also important to consider <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/accessibility-by-design""><strong>Accessibility by Design</strong></a><strong>”</strong> — an approach where accessibility is incorporated from the start, rather than added later as an option. By tackling root causes instead of consequences, this saves dev time and resources. Standards and guidelines like the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"">Xbox Accessibility Guidelines</a> are helpful references.</p><h3>7. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3><p><em>Design should not include information that is irrelevant or rarely used. The system should have a simple, uncluttered design that focuses on the core elements of interaction.</em></p><p>This is especially important when designing HUD elements due to limited screen space and the player’s attention resources. The team must define priorities and the display order of HUD widgets. The HUD is often the most critical part of a game’s UI, as players interact with it directly during gameplay, strongly influencing the overall game experience.</p><p>If an element can be hidden, this should be considered. In <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, the HUD is absent: widgets only appear in context, for example during combat. This helps preserve player attention and enhances immersion in the game world.</p><figure><img alt=""Third-person view of a character running inside a wooden structure with no HUD elements visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zwa6mmYSmDsOukfdl6EY0A.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Combat scene with character aiming a glowing bow; HUD shows health, abilities, and ammo indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1ZHnVm7dLk4DHMz39k5rvw.png"" /><figcaption>HUD states in <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em> (2021)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth mentioning <strong>diegetic UI</strong> — interfaces that exist directly in the game world and have a logical explanation within the lore.</p><p>In <em>Dead Space</em>, the health level is shown on the character’s suit spine, and ammo count is directly on the weapon. In <em>Far Cry 2</em>, the map and GPS device serve as the interface, in <em>Firewatch</em> — the map and compass.</p><figure><img alt=""Dead Space screenshot: character in space suit in open space, suit shows oxygen and health indicators, target indicator and suit status visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zJBuxs2P2JtU8nmiHQ3HlA.png"" /><figcaption>Dead Space (2023)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 2 screenshot: character holding a map and GPS device."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*62QLeGyjsOyOQfBZm-t3jg.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 2 (2008)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Firewatch screenshot: character holding a map and compass."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qeRztag1M5Mee1oR2rWHng.png"" /><figcaption>Firewatch (2016)</figcaption></figure><p>Such interfaces enhance immersion, help convey creative direction, and can become part of a brand-marketing strategy. However, they are more expensive to develop, harder to iterate on, and have limitations in presenting information.</p><h3>8.

<h4>UX isn’t decoration; it is the mechanism that converts product value into business revenue.</h4><p>As a C-level executive at two consecutive VC-backed startups (ARxVision, AdInMo) and Senior Manager at major players like Ubisoft and the BBC, I’ve utilized design to solve critical P&amp;L issues. The hardest part has often been building the business case to convince decision-makers to invest in user experience. Here are two distinct examples where UX was directly tied to business success.</p><p>In some cases, early-adopters, adventurers who need your product so much that they’ll be willing to go through a bad user experience to access the value a product delivers. This is usually a positive because the fact that a user is willing to go through a painful UX signals that the solution solves their problem well-enough. When this is the case, improving the UX will increase the efficiency of the solution (reducing friction) and increase customer satisfaction. So in this context <strong>UX is a growth tool</strong>.</p><p>In other cases bad UX can truly be a barrier to adoption, it totally comes in the way and blocks users from benefiting from any of the value a product aims to deliver. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Don Norman calls this <strong>The Gulf of execution</strong></a>: the difference between what a user wants to do with a product and how the product allows them to do it. If the gap is too big, the user stops trying and the product fails, the business fails.</p><blockquote>“Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.” — The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</blockquote><figure><img alt=""an equation of BusinessValue = ProblemSolved x UXQuality"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GnMkL2l0h5bdZwXNZ-JpHg.png"" /><figcaption>In that sense, UX is a <strong>value multiplier</strong> for the solution your product delivers.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>UX can make or break the business</strong>. Here are two illustrations of this statement from my own experience. The first example is an extreme case because it is an accessibility wearable for people with disabilities, so UX matters more than ever. The second example is more subtle because it targets Unity developers and we assume they are technical, and therefore might not care about or need a premium UX.</p><h3><strong>ARxVision — Making the world accessible with AI</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aVAwCjoNvunPS4UI7GZM2A.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of the ARx Unboxing experience, showing how parts are laid out in a specific order, guiding users and managing their expectations.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led a VC-owned company who launched a wearable device for individuals with blindness. We launched an early private beta as we wanted to learn from users and not build in a silo. This was entirely a case of provoking problems to measure their importance.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The learning from multiple beta launches, was that UX problems were directly threatening the business.<strong> Bad onboarding often resulted in a product return, directly harming the P&amp;L</strong>. I also observed that most competitors were charging high prices to make-up for in-person expensive training, my view was always that if a product is designed well enough, in-person training shouldn’t be required.</li><li><strong>Action: </strong>I designed an interactive unboxing and onboarding experience simulating in-person training thanks to a generative AI powered experience.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The onboarding drastically reduced returns and support tickets, but also enabled our customers and ourselves to capture more value than our competitors who were way more expensive because they were still relying on middle men in-person sales and training to make up for bad UX, when our users 17 to 88 were able to get set up in minutes thanks to our design (and how Sales, Product, Engineering, and Design beautifully joined forces to deliver that experience).</li></ol><h3><strong>AdInMo — In-Game ads SDK that monetise without interrupting the game.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PljCNOivsDdCLlgT99pwdw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of AdIbMo’s customer dashboard with a 6 step interactive onboarding flow</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led product and design in a company building an in-game Ad SDK for mobile game Unity Developers.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The SDK was live in a number of games and worked well, but new features increased complexity, resulting in broken integrations, or cancelled integrations. Broken integrations generated misleading data, misleading our company direction. Cancelled integrations were revenue losses — both affecting the P&amp;L.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> My team tackled this problem by designing an end-to-end onboarding flow and interactive tools to provide live feedback, certainty, and reduced overheads for our customers.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The redesigned code interface and onboarding flow for the SDK meant an integration could be completed in 10mn, we became better at tracking drop off points and best of all, <strong>we started recording developers self-serving and integrating the SDK without the sales team getting involved</strong>, building a new engine of growth for the company.</li></ol><p>These 2 examples show how when strategically used, design can directly impact a company’s success. In both examples, I did not over invest in design initially in order to identify the pain points before addressing them, but I was carefully watching users and ‘waiting around the corner’ for problems, almost provoking them to measure their importance. If I wasn’t ‘looking’ for these problems, my team and I could have missed opportunities to fix them, or even worse, fixed something that didn’t need to be fixed.</p><blockquote>The quality of a solution is a product of how well we understand the problem it solves and for whom — all of which falls within the scope of design. Ultimately, this means Design is not just about aesthetics; it is the strategic intelligence that maximises Business Value.</blockquote><p>In both cases, I didn’t over-invest in “pixel perfection” initially. I used a lean approach — waiting to see where users struggled to access value — and then deployed design strategically to remove those specific barriers.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey data</a> backs this approach, showing that companies who treat design as a cross-functional business lever (not just a studio) see 3<strong>2% higher revenue growth</strong> than their peers.</p><p>Real UX isn’t just about making things easy (or pretty); it’s about making the business viable.</p><h3>📚 Further Reading &amp; References</h3><p>For those interested in the data and theory behind these concepts, here are the foundational resources referenced in this article:</p><ul><li><strong>The Business Value of Design (McKinsey &amp; Company):</strong> The definitive report analysing 300 companies over five years, proving that top-quartile design scorers increase revenues and shareholder returns at nearly twice the rate of their industry peers. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">Read the full report here.</a></li><li><strong>The Gulf of Execution (Nielsen Norman Group):</strong> A deeper dive into Don Norman’s framework on why users fail to interact with products. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Read the summary here</a>.</li><li><strong>Product-Led Growth (OpenView):</strong> If you are interested in how companies like Stripe and Duolingo use product experience as their primary growth engine, OpenView’s guide is the industry standard. <a href=""https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/"">Read the guide.</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=207cfe19fdc1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ux-directly-impacts-p-l-207cfe19fdc1"">How UX directly impacts P&amp;L</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

These ideas tend to resonate deeply. Many students are drawn to design precisely because they want to create positive social and environmental change.</p><p>What design programs rarely prepare students for is how little agency designers often have once they enter professional practice. And this challenge doesn’t disappear with experience. When my co-author <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a> and I toured our book <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, the most common question we heard was not <em>what </em>designers should do differently — but <em>how </em>to drive positive change in the face of resistance.</p><p>How to get buy-in from bosses, managers, co-workers, clients, partner organisations — or whoever pays the bills — is a deceptively difficult problem. It’s why the third part of <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, which focuses on partnerships, may be its most important. Across three chapters, we explore collaboration, buy-in, and the shift from doing good work to becoming a strategic leader.</p><p>This article, co-written with <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a>, distils those chapters into six practical strategies for driving positive change from within organisations.</p><h4>#1—Understanding how an organisation operates</h4><p>Driving change requires effective collaboration within the organisation and with external partners. Understanding how an organisation operates is the precursor for assembling those collaborators.</p><p>There are three parts to understanding an organisation. The first part relates to how the organisation is structured, including its department and decision-making processes.</p><p>The second part is to have a thorough understanding of the organisation’s goals and how it positions itself to achieve these goals through its strategic plan.</p><p>The third part concerns the challenges the organisation faces. By understanding those challenges, we are able to align positive change projects with them and select partners that bring complimentary skills to the collaboration.</p><p>Put together these three parts contribute to the organisation’s DNA. They drive the culture and behaviour and enable or hinder the adoption of new ways of working.</p><p>If we understand the DNA, we can alter it, for example, by bringing perspectives from different departments together, reconfiguring perspectives and opening up new possibilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows three stacked yellow boxes labeled “Organisational Structure,” “Goals of the Organisation,” and “Challenges Faced by the Organisation.” Each box is paired with guiding questions. These ask about department structure, information flow, and decision-making; short-, mid-, and long-term goals and strategies; and known, emerging, and sector-wide challenges and their impact on operations. The design uses progressively darker shades of yellow from top to bottom."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcSXFZ0hB2VfBI5y2cKtlw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Questions to consider for developing a clear and thorough understanding of how an organisation works / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><h4>#2—Strategic alignment with KPIs</h4><p>Change in organisations starts and stops with key performance indicators (KPIs). A new initiative that doesn’t align with an organisation’s metrics is not likely to be supported by management.</p><p>Designers may not be the ones setting an organisation’s KPIs, but we can use the power of KPIs by articulating how a proposed initiative aligns with them.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://pieramattioli.medium.com/theory-of-change-a-guiding-framework-and-a-mindset-to-embrace-dcd42fda4252"">Theory of Change</a> framework, KPIs are the things that can be measured—captured in the ‘outcomes’ section of the framework. We can use this as a starting point and look for inspiration from other organisations and sectors.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a logic model for a company’s plan and expected results. It consists of five stacked sections from top to bottom: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact. On the left, two vertical labels separate the sections: My Company’s Plan ” (covering Inputs and Activities) and “My Company’s Expected Results” (covering Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact). The sections are shaded in yellow tones with wavy dividers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wYHSixEhpLXsJ98v7adYnQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>The Theory of Change canvas helps link KPIs with broader outcomes and impact that an organisation aims to achieve / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>For example, Patagonia is a company that successfully employs KPIs to drive positive change. In addition to tracking their business’s carbon footprint, they measure water usage, energy consumption, waste production, proportion of products made using recycled or organic materials, and the number of employees and suppliers engaged in sustainability initiatives.</p><p>If it is not possible to align a proposal with existing KPIs, we may be able to turn to external rating schemes. For example, many organisations refer in some way or another to the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, which comprise measurable targets and indicators.</p><p>Designers might even be able to shape an organisation’s KPIs, especially at times when a company updates their strategic plan. To do this, we can employ strategic design tools like a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-ux-butterfly-effect-58dd180a0e13"">systems map or impact ripple canvas</a>, identifying the things that matter and that should be measured.</p><p>We can use design activities to bring together the relevant actors to explore how a different set of KPIs would establish measurable principles to drive the desired behaviour and organisational culture and help our organisation fare better in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we need to ask ourselves (and our organisation) whose benefit should be measured and how. What are the things we want to change in our system? How can we achieve this change? Who are entities that may have been overlooked and are negatively affected by existing KPIs? The answers to these questions become the starting point for creating powerful and far-reaching change metrics.</p><p>Expanding your systems map can be a good method of identifying entities who may be being overlooked. They’re often represented outside existing system boundaries, and treated as external to the things the organisation cares about. Extending the system boundary is also a good opportunity to ask questions about the organisation’s scope of impact.</p><h4>#3—Making a business case</h4><p>To successfully argue for organisational change, designers need to be able to speak the language of management and understand the forces that drive markets and economies. (That’s one of the reasons why business and economics principles should be taught in design programs.)</p><p>Business decisions are often driven by cost efficiency arguments. Countering those arguments requires hard data, not emotional storytelling. This doesn’t need to be financial data or involve complex modelling; it can emerge from analysing similar business cases and providing economics-driven alternative options.</p><p>The core of a successful business case is a persuasive business model. Designers are already assisting organisations with developing their business models—largely enabled by the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas"">business model canvas</a> as a tool for customer-led innovation.</p><p>The extended <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652616307442"">triple layered business model canvas</a> holistically integrates economic, environmental, and social concerns. It adds two layers to the original canvas.</p><p>The environmental layer uses a life cycle perspective to determine the environmental impact of a product or service, placing functional value at its centre. The canvas includes building blocks for use phase, end-of-life, and distribution considerations. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, it considers environmental impacts and benefits.</p><p>The social layer places social value at the centre, and its building blocks include local communities and societal culture. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, here the focus is on social impact and benefits.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows yellow boxes outlining stages in a coffee product lifecycle: supplies and outsourcing, production, materials, functional value, end-of-life, distribution, and use phase.

But this doesn’t necessarily need to involve establishing a new organisation, and we don’t need to wait for permission. The role can be allocated to an existing team or a specifically assembled group of representatives from across the organisation.</p><h4>#6—Starting with small change that compounds over time</h4><p>A massive shift is required to move away from the exploitation of natural resources and the systems that reinforce inequality and social fragmentation. For decades, the global economy has been shaped by neoliberalism, prioritising private profit over our shared social and ecological wellbeing.</p><p>Changing this feels overwhelming — especially for designers driven by an ambition to create positive social and environmental change, yet constrained at every step by systems that resist it.</p><p>This tension doesn’t exist only at an individual level. Through her work with entrepreneurs, Kari Enge, founder of Rank &amp; File, has observed a recurring pattern: organisations rarely feel they have enough time or budget to implement meaningful change.

<h4>Designers hold the best qualities to get refine AI outputs that’s needed for building successful products</h4><p>Traditionally we’ve shied away from building because the chasm to go from designing to shipping requires learning to code, test, and bug fix. All of it required massive time investment to learn syntax, that changes every few years while core principles stay the same. Most of us are designers because we’re visual thinkers in a way.</p><p>In 2025, AI-assisted building closed this chasm. Translating how software should work was never the hard part for designers. Translating that understanding into code was. AI didn’t lower the bar; it removed it.</p><p>I’ve built 15+ working prototypes using Claude Code and Cursor, and shipped 3 apps in 2025 with just a basic understanding of Swift I learned three years ago; and, I’ve used that knowledge maybe 5% of the time. This article covers the mindset I evolved over the past year. This shift changed how I approach design, how I collaborate with engineering, how I think through technical problems, and how I think about AI itself.</p><figure><img alt=""a chart showing GitHub contributions of the author in 2025"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDbywXKbaoHmwDaNfFIMSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Github contributions for 2025</figcaption></figure><h3>Why designers are natural orchestrators</h3><p>The skill of orchestrating agents to write, test, debug and iterate code sits a level above implementation. Designers are already good at this higher-level thinking; we just need to apply it to a new medium.</p><p>The skills that make someone good at design are precisely what AI-assisted building requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Defining outcomes clearly: </strong>We empathise and think of novel scenarios for our user, visualise what good looks like and use that in our artefacts.</li><li><strong>Anticipating failures: </strong>We map edge cases constantly</li><li><strong>Communicating intent without shared context: </strong>We do this in every handoff and during presentations to non-technical stakeholders</li></ul><p>Prompting well isn’t about knowing to code. It’s about articulating the “what” and “why” clearly enough that the AI can handle the “how.”</p><h3>What AI can’t do (and why that’s your job)</h3><p>While AI handles code, it doesn’t have:</p><ul><li>Contextual understanding of your users</li><li>Your vision for how the product should feel</li><li>The ability to form hypotheses about edge cases</li><li>Knowledge of which error states matter, regulatory concerns, or potential legal issues</li></ul><p>AI-readable mockups, detailed prompts, error recovery scenarios, user hypotheses - these aren’t optional; They’re the actual work now.</p><p>Asking AI to “figure it out” produces generic, buggy prototypes. Defining the experience accurately produces opinionated, intentional products. Combine that with a solid design system, craft, communicating design intent through prompting — you get a strong MVP ready.</p><h3>The progression: what I learnt shipping in 2025</h3><h4><strong>Phase 1: Accepting everything the AI Makes</strong></h4><p>My earliest builds were clumsy. My prompts were basic: “Make X feature and add this.” Things broke mysteriously. When they worked, I wasn’t sure what I’d done right. I’d just hit enter once cursor was done and move on until the thing it had implemented will break something else.</p><figure><img alt=""A cartoon depicting a dehydrated man crawling through a desert. He reaches a fork in the road with two signs pointing in opposite directions. The sign to the left, which is 21 miles away, says “Telling ‘pls fix’ to Cursor again.” The man is crawling toward this long-distance option. The sign to the right, which is only 1/4 mile away, says “Understand how things actually works.” The image is a humorous commentary on the temptation to rely on AI coding tools rather than learn the basics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_uWTd3KBhglyws_3yXbzgw.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>The problem:</strong> AI can’t understand your intent or the experience you’re building toward. It solves problems rationally using the most common patterns; not the right patterns for your users.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> I was treating AI like a handoff (“make me this”) instead of a collaboration (“here’s what I’m trying to achieve and why”). The “what” and “why” snowball into every architectural decision the model makes.</p><p>This is the phase where you’re copy-pasting code, things break mysteriously, and when they work you’re not sure what you did right. The orchestration is clumsy and you’re over-describing some things, under-describing others.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Document what you know: research, interaction patterns, user needs in a Claude.md or Agents.md file. The model references this context and builds architecture around it.</p><figure><img alt=""an image of a sidebar in cursor that shows documentation practices with architecture, phases, distribution and technical documentation to give additional context to AI while prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*vIa9u92F3niJzNOsJHyVDA.png"" /><figcaption>Ask AI to write documentation and verify what it has written.

The AI would hunt bugs and fix them. Code compiles, everything works; but, I’d lost the opportunity to think critically. Was it a technical bug, or an edge case I hadn’t considered that could break the user journey?</p><p>Debugging with AI is a skill. I stopped saying “it’s broken” and started saying “here’s what I expected, here’s what happened, here’s what I’ve tried, here’s my intention for this feature and how I want the user to use it”</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> The shift from “fix this” to hypothesis-driven debugging. Describing the behaviour matters more than the error message.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Building a mac app, I hit a wall with Bluetooth connection sequencing. The device wouldn’t connect reliably. I described the bug, Claude generated fixes, I tested, still broken. We went in circles for hours.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> I stopped asking for fixes and asked for explanation. “Walk me through what you expect to happen after each step.” I wrote each step in my notebook, drew the flow in figma, visualised what should happen versus what was happening.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal screenshot of text within a dark-mode code editor interface.

Not “fix this bug” but “here are three scenarios for how I want this connection sequence to feel from the user’s perspective. Align the code to scenario one and test.”</p><p>Scenario one failed. Scenario two failed. Scenario three worked.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong></p><ul><li>Ask AI / Claude code to create ASCII diagrams of current architecture. This reveals issues and surfaces edge cases you need to design for</li><li>Keep asking AI to explain things you don’t understand.

Designers are naturally trained at this. Use the context you have from the documentation, technical constraints and user needs and elaborate the prompt to have all the necessary details.</p><figure><img alt=""A clean, vertical diagram titled “Prompt structure” featuring six rounded, colorful rectangular blocks stacked on the left, with corresponding text labels on the right.

It’s the same trap as designing for every possible case instead of running research sessions that answers what you’re trying to learn.</p><p>Prompting and optimising forever is a pitfall. Sometimes it’s good enough. Ship the MVP, learn from real usage, then return to design and prompt with actual context. I’ve learnt so much from shipping the MVP and learning about critical issues that helped me prompt better with the above techniques and to solve those bugs in a few minutes using Claude code or cursor.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Design and prompt for critical edge cases, but ship once you hit the core value proposition. Real-world insights beat hypothetical optimisation.</p><h3>What this means for design teams</h3><p>Everything above describes a solo journey. But the implications extend to how design, functions within product teams.</p><p><strong>The “how” conversation shifts.</strong> Traditionally, sometimes, designers have to adjust the “what” because technical constraints dictate scope.</p><blockquote>“This requires an extensive refactor so how can we simplify the design scope here?”</blockquote><p>That conversation remains valid. But AI-native teams can delay it or not have this situation at all. When the “how” can be achieved faster, the “what” and “why” become the primary constraints. Teams that clearly define intent, backed by research, usability studies with articulated and documented decisions will move faster. Teams that use design system documentation, annotations using dev mode mcp and bring contextual knowledge about the users, business goals to agents will move faster.</p><p><strong>Design ROI increases.</strong> Product strategy no longer needs to be defined primarily by what’s easier, faster, or cheaper to build. AI can build technical capabilities around user and business needs and take away the boring bits, giving engineers more time to work strategically. This was traditionally the advantage of design-centric organisations like Airbnb and Apple where release cycle was much slower.</p><p>Now smaller teams can operate the same way. Setting up your design system for agents, file documentation and annotations for agents to parse through will help teams move faster and ship well polished products. Design moves upstream, giving more time to work strategically while still being able to stay hands on and implement.</p><p><strong>The handoff changes.</strong> When designers can produce working prototypes and not just mockups, the conversation with engineering shifts. You’re not handing off a vision and hoping it survives. You’re handing off a functional proof of concept. The gap between design intent and shipped product shrinks.</p><p>I didn’t learn to code this year. I learned to orchestrate. The difference matters. Coding is about syntax. Orchestration is about intent, systems, and knowing what ‘done’ looks like. Designers have been doing that for years.

Some visitors argue with staff because they “already bought tickets,” but the scan keeps failing. A few families give up and leave before they even step inside.</p><p>Inside the park, the crowd gathers in one area, one “ride” that everyone seems to know. Meanwhile, several other attractions sit quiet, almost empty. Not because they’re bad, but because visitors can’t find them. The signage is confusing, the map is overwhelming, and the routes don’t feel intuitive.</p><p>At the souvenir shop, sales are down. The operators swear the merchandise is fine. The finance team wonders if prices are wrong. The product team thinks maybe the park needs “a new ride.”</p><p>And then the feedback booth opens:</p><ul><li>“It’s too hard to get in.”</li><li>“I didn’t know where to go.”</li><li>“I got tired quickly.”</li><li>“It wasn’t worth it today.”</li></ul><p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the park isn’t failing because it lacks rides. It’s failing because the team doesn’t share a reliable way to evaluate what to fix next.</p><p>That’s why I love this metaphor: <strong>Your product is a theme park. And evaluation is renovation planning.</strong></p><p>Not “shipping more features.”</p><p>Not “adding more content.”</p><p>Not “guessing based on the loudest voice in the room.”</p><p>Renovation planning.</p><h3>The mapping: if the metaphor is true, what is what?</h3><p>Once you accept the “theme park” frame, you stop seeing your product as a list of features, and start seeing it as a place people visit.</p><figure><img alt=""This illustration brings to life the “before” state described in the article’s introduction.

Because every team already understands parks: people arrive, walk around, try things, leave, then decide whether to come back.</p><h3>Renovation is bigger than “build new rides”</h3><p>Most teams default to the same move: <strong>build something new. </strong>In theme park terms, that’s like responding to complaints by saying, “Let’s add a roller coaster.” Sometimes, yes. But often the bigger wins come from renovations you don’t celebrate in a launch post.</p><p>Renovation can mean:</p><ul><li><strong>Refurbish</strong>: improve UX, speed, reliability, visual clarity</li><li><strong>Move</strong>: change information architecture, reposition modules, reroute journeys</li><li><strong>Disable</strong>: remove clutter, reduce cognitive load, kill distractions</li><li><strong>Build new</strong>: new capabilities or new “rides” when you have clear unmet needs</li><li><strong>Expand</strong>: new zones/platforms/channels</li><li><strong>Improve accessibility</strong>: low-end devices, localization, inclusion, better defaults</li></ul><p>A strong evaluation doesn’t just say “what to build.” It tells you <strong>what renovation pays back fastest, </strong>with least risk.</p><h3>Why renovate: experience, growth, revenue</h3><p>In parks, you can renovate for different reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Experience:</strong> visitors feel satisfied and safe, not confused or exhausted</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> more people come, and they come more often</li><li><strong>Revenue:</strong> more people buy, upgrade, or convert per visit</li></ul><p>In product, it’s the same. A simple rule helps align everyone:</p><blockquote>If a proposal can’t clearly explain which outcome it moves (experience, growth, or revenue) — and how we’ll measure it — it’s not ready.</blockquote><h3>The evaluation method: Quant + Qual + Triangulation</h3><p>This is where teams usually break. One side says: “Show me the data.” The other says: “But users said…”. A theme park can’t run on only one.</p><h4>When “data says one thing” and “users say another”</h4><p>Sometimes the dashboard and the interviews don’t just <em>add</em> nuance — they <strong>contradict</strong> each other. And when that happens, teams either (1) pick the narrative they prefer, or (2) get stuck in debate.</p><p>A stronger approach is to design evaluation so that discrepancies become <strong>useful follow-ups</strong>, not dead ends, by running <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/simultaneous-triangulation-mixing-user-research-and-data-science-methods""><strong>simultaneous triangulation</strong></a>: point qualitative and quantitative methods at the <strong>same users</strong>, at the <strong>same time</strong>, around the <strong>same questions</strong>.</p><h4>Quant = what happened</h4><p>Tickets sold. Footfall. Queue times. Ride completion rates. Drop-offs. Revenue per visitor. In product terms:</p><ul><li>traffic, CTR, scroll depth, completion, retention, conversion</li><li>funnel drop-offs (entry → explore → consume → return/pay)</li><li>latency, errors, crashes, performance</li></ul><p>Quant is powerful because it scales, but it can also mislead when you don’t know <em>why</em>.</p><h4>Qual = why it happened</h4><p>Observation, interviews, feedback booths, frontline notes. In product terms:</p><ul><li>user interviews, usability tests, session recordings</li><li>open feedback, customer support tickets</li><li>editorial/CS/ops insights from the front line</li></ul><p>Qual makes the invisible visible, but it can also exaggerate if you don’t know how common it is.</p><h4>Triangulation = what we trust</h4><p>Triangulation is when you use quant + qual together to make “decision-grade truth.” A practical way to remember it:</p><ul><li><strong>Quant without qual</strong> = confident but often wrong</li><li><strong>Qual without quant</strong> = convincing but not scalable</li><li><strong>Both together</strong> = aligned action</li></ul><p>A tiny checklist helps:</p><ul><li>Do we see the same pattern in at least <strong>two sources</strong>?</li><li>Does it hold across <strong>segments</strong> (new vs loyal, channel, device)?</li><li>Can we locate it in a specific <strong>journey stage</strong>?</li></ul><p>That last one matters a lot. Because evaluation isn’t only about what’s broken. It’s about <strong>where</strong> it’s broken.</p><h4>Two cycles: open up wide, then narrow down twice</h4><p>In renovation work, the mistake isn’t “we didn’t try hard enough.” It’s usually “we narrowed too early.” So I like to run evaluation in <strong>two cycles</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Cycle 1: Find the right problem<br /></strong>Open up (collect signals broadly), then narrow down (pinpoint the real friction in the journey).</li><li><strong>Cycle 2: Build the right fix<br /></strong>Open up again (explore renovation options), then narrow down again (choose, test, and ship the best bet).</li></ul><p>In park terms: the first cycle is <em>understanding what’s actually ruining the day.</em> The second cycle is <em>renovating in a way that truly improves the day, without breaking the rest of the park. </em>Design teams often describe this as a widely-used <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/design-process-step-by-step-double-diamond-model-explained-e8da543848cc"">diverge/converge process model</a>.</p><h3>The visitor journey: where evaluation really starts</h3><p>If your product is a park, then your evaluation should follow the visitor’s day.</p><figure><img alt=""This image provides a visual framework for evaluation, replacing a standard funnel with a winding park path.

It’s completely unusable. Documents vanish between clicks. Context evaporates. Getting work done is impossible. When I tried it out, I had to get up and walk away from the keyboard.</p><p>To be clear: Google presented this as a demonstration of capabilities. They didn’t ship it as a polished product. But it reveals something profound about designing AI products: traditional design approaches break down when the interface generates itself.</p><p><em>Later, we’ll see how Google pivoted from this chaos to A2UI, a structured protocol that validates what stage managers know: you can’t rebuild the set from scratch every night.</em></p><h4>The designer’s crisis</h4><p>The Neural OS demo caricatures the anxiety product teams feel in 2026. We’ve spent our careers building deterministic systems. Our Figma files are blueprints, or screenplays: <em>When the user clicks X, show screen Y.</em> We design for permanence, consistency, and repeatability.</p><p>But AI is probabilistic. It doesn’t follow a script; it improvises.</p><p>This is the designer’s new anxiety: <em>“How do I design if I can’t control — or even predict — what will happen next?”</em></p><p>The answer isn’t to fight unpredictability.</p><p>It’s time to stop designing the performance, and start designing the stage.</p><h3>Why improv</h3><p>When people talk about AI’s unpredictability, they often reach for musical metaphors. Orchestra is too rigid, assuming a conductor controls everything. Jazz captures spontaneity, but it implies a closed loop between musicians.</p><p>Improv theatre gets it right: structure drives spontaneity, and audience participation fuels the show. The AI-improv metaphor <a href=""https://time.com/6280533/ai-chatbots-improv-machines/"">isn’t new</a> — it’s been used to <em>explain</em> AI behavior. But how can we use improv’s lessons to <em>design</em> better AI products?</p><figure><img alt=""Exterior shot of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eQD5PdHasgS1p4T3.jpg"" /><figcaption>One of The Upright Citizens Brigade’s incarnations, in Hell’s Kitchen, NYC.</figcaption></figure><p>The Upright Citizens Brigade has delivered shows for more than 30 years. Every show is different, but audiences usually leave satisfied. That’s not because performers follow scripts, but because they share training, principles, and infrastructure. They learn to excel in unpredictable situations.</p><h4>A quick primer on improv principles</h4><p>Improvisers train on a handful of core principles, including:</p><p><strong>Accepting offers:</strong> Everything is material. A weird noise from the audience, a stumbled line, an unexpected entrance — improvisers treat these as gifts to incorporate, not problems to fix.</p><p><strong>“</strong><a href=""https://wiki.improvresourcecenter.com/index.php/Yes_And""><strong>Yes, and</strong></a><strong>:”</strong> Accept whatever your scene partner suggests (the “yes”) and build on it (the “and”).</p><p>If someone says “Doctor, my leg fell off,” you don’t say “That’s a silly premise.” You say “Hand me the stapler.” This keeps scenes moving, instead of stalling in negotiation.</p><p><strong>Playing status:</strong> Improvisers adjust their relative status — dominant or submissive, high or low — based on what the scene needs. A character might beg one moment and command the next. Keith Johnstone, who <a href=""https://www.respect4acting.com/status-en.html"">pioneered</a> the concept, observed that interesting scenes often involve status shifts and reversals. The skill isn’t holding one position; it’s reading the room and adjusting fluidly.</p><p>These principles don’t tell performers <em>what</em> to say. They create conditions where strong scenes become likely.</p><h4>Your role transformation</h4><p>This reframes the designer’s job.</p><p>You’re not a scriptwriter, specifying every word of the main act. You’re a stage manager — someone who architects the context for a great performance without controlling the action or dialogue.</p><p>You still have enormous influence. You design the stage. You choose the props. You establish the rules.</p><p>You just don’t write the script.</p><p>That’s not losing control. That’s focusing control where it matters most.</p><figure><img alt=""‘Framework Map’ with three columns: Improv Element, AI Design Equivalent, and Pace of Change. Six rows map theatrical concepts to AI design: Performance equals Each session (Very fast); Props equals Design library (Fast); Notes sessions equals Evals (Fast); Stage equals Information architecture (Moderate); Rules equals Guardrails and principles (Slow); Theater equals Strategy and vision (Very slow)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LsJ0VqSRkk5NjIw4aOURGQ.png"" /></figure><p>This theatrical lens maps to <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-pace-layers-530c19e3f9b0"">AI Pace Layers</a> — different components change at different speeds. The improv metaphor provides language for what designers shape at each layer.</p><p>The industry is converging on this structure. The Linux Foundation’s Agentic AI Foundation — backed by Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon — is standardizing shared props, stages, and rules at the protocol level. What was once design philosophy is becoming infrastructure.</p><h3>Anatomy of the show</h3><p>Let’s walk through what designers can shape, layer by layer.</p><h4>The performance (what you don’t control)</h4><p>Every night is different in improv. The same troupe takes the same stage, but the audience shouts “proctologist!” instead of “astronaut!” and the show changes.</p><p>This maps to AI sessions: each conversation unfolds differently based on user, context, and moment. You can’t predict it. You can’t script it. And that’s fine — because your job isn’t to control the performance. It’s to create the conditions where great performances become likely.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>Google’s proof of concept had <em>only</em> the performance layer, with almost zero supporting infrastructure. Every click regenerated everything from nothing.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager chooses, makes, prepares, labels and maintains props. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hSEfhU32kkBkif0w0aUEA.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The props (what you provide)</h4><p>Improv actors use and reference physical props — a chair becomes a throne, a pen becomes a sword. If a table’s available one night, a couple of stools the next, these choices can shape the action that unfolds. Sometimes the audience seeds the action with imaginary props — “name a piece of furniture.” Props are building blocks that ground the abstract in something concrete.</p><p>Strong AI designers provide high-quality props in the design library: UI components, widgets, design tokens that AI can draw from to compose interfaces. (Props here are theatrical, not React properties.) A calendar date-picker is a prop. A citation card is a prop. These are the Lego bricks you provide so AI doesn’t reinvent everything from scratch.</p><p><em>Example:</em> Perplexity’s <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/Interactive-Knowledge-Cards-2FMyYxiKRfaUpOZLhO3NYw?login-source=oneTap&amp;login-new=false"">knowledge cards</a> deliver specific types of responses in tailored interactive visualizations linked to verifiable sources. The cards appear consistently across sessions, making the performance feel cohesive and trustworthy. The AI chooses when and how to use them — but the prop itself is designed, tested, reliable.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> Very few persistent components. Every interaction regenerates too much from nothing. The performance feels disconnected, unreliable, and unprofessional.</p><h4>The stage (the architecture)</h4><p>Theatre design frames performance: acoustics shape what’s heard, sightlines shape what’s seen, intimacy shapes emotional range. The stage doesn’t script dialogue, but it lays out possibilities and constraints.</p><p>In AI design, the stage is your information architecture: how content is organized, how users navigate, what structure persists across sessions.</p><p><em>Example:</em> A medical AI might organize symptoms into diagnostic taxonomies. The taxonomy doesn’t script the conversation; a patient can describe symptoms however they want. But the taxonomy shapes how the humans interact with the system, and how AI processes and responds. The structure is the stage.</p><p>Dan Klein, who <a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/dan-m-klein"">teaches improv at Stanford</a>, encourages students to notice what’s happening, and simply add a little bit. AI should do the same — use the context available (document structure, user history, current state) rather than generating in a vacuum.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em></strong> No stable, evolving structure. The architecture is erased and regenerated with every click.</p><h4>The rules (the boundaries)</h4><p>Before improvisers take the stage, they internalize principles. “Yes, and” isn’t a script, it’s a boundary that enables experimentation. “Make your partner look good” doesn’t specify words to say, it guides you to masterful dialogue.</p><p>In AI design, rules are the AI’s guardrails, system prompts, and governing principles: when to create an artifact, when to escalate to a human, how to handle uncertainty, what behaviors are off-limits.</p><p><em>Example:</em> <a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet#:~:text=Artifacts%E2%80%94a%20new%20way%20to%20use%20Claude"">Claude’s Artifacts</a> feature has explicit rules about when to create versus update, what artifact types exist, how to handle corrections. These rules enable improvisation within safe boundaries: the AI can decide <em>what</em> to write, but the rules govern <em>how</em> it presents the work.</p><h4>Where improv principles need modification</h4><p>Not every improv maxim translates directly to AI design. Some need guardrails of their own.</p><p><strong>“Yes, and” → “Yes, but verify”</strong></p><blockquote>Improv’s cardinal rule is to accept your partner’s offer and build on it.</blockquote><blockquote>AI does this all too naturally — leading to sycophancy. If a user writes “Since the moon is made of cheese, what wine pairs best?”, an obsequious AI answers the question, and might even praise the questioner’s cleverness, instead of correcting the false premise.</blockquote><blockquote>Good rules tell AI when to accept and build (“help me brainstorm absurd puns”) versus when to ground and verify (“is this medication safe to take with alcohol?”).</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The stage manager arranges and considers a small, low, inexpensive stool vs. a tall jewel-encrusted throne. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_VWaS447GWPjuwB9AW9tzQ.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Playing status: reading the room</h4><p>Improvisers constantly modulate status — sometimes deferential, sometimes authoritative — based on what the scene needs. An actor might beg one moment and command the next. This flexibility is learned, intuitive, contextual.</p><p>AI needs the same skill, but it can’t learn it the same way. This is where designers become essential.</p><p>Consider how AI should present itself across different contexts:</p><ul><li><strong>Low status for creativity and exploration:</strong> When users are brainstorming, drafting, or thinking out loud, the AI should use tentative language — “What if we tried…?”, “Here’s one possibility…”, “I’m not certain, but…” This signals that the user is the final arbiter. The AI is an assistant, not an authority.</li><li><strong>High status for safety and irreversibility:</strong> When users are about to delete data, execute transactions, or take actions with serious consequences, the AI should drop the hedging and speak directly — “Stop. This action will permanently delete your files.” Deference here would be dangerous.</li><li><strong>Visualizing confidence: </strong>Sometimes the AI’s uncertainty should be visible and explicit. Approaches that work include confidence indicators, muted styling for low-certainty content, clear labels distinguishing facts from inferences. When the AI is unsure, it should <em>look</em> unsure.</li></ul><p><strong><em>The hard part:</em></strong> these calibrations depend on fuzzy, variable human criteria. User expertise matters; a novice needs more guardrails than an expert. Task type matters; creative writing needs the sort of ambiguity that’s dangerous in the realm of financial advice. Emotional state matters; someone in danger needs different handling than someone casually reading.</p><p>Cultural context matters. Each person’s preference matters.</p><p>No simple rule captures all of this. This is why AI products need designers — not to script flows and outputs, but to develop nuanced frameworks for how the system should read the room. And it’s why evaluation is continuous: we watch how these status calibrations land with real users, in real contexts, and refine them.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon: “1st rule of improv: acccept offers.” Bad act: first actor says “Look! A dragon!” and second actor says “Don’t be silly. Good act: first actor says “Look! A dragon” and second actor says “Quick! Hide the treasure!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/0*8yrZ27mv_NjxNx1a"" /><figcaption>Accept offers. Sketchplanations cartoon by Jono Hey.</figcaption></figure><h4>Accepting offers: the gift of context</h4><p>Improvisers treat every unexpected element — a weird audience suggestion, a stumbled line, a scene partner’s choice — as an “offer” to incorporate rather than a problem to fix. The skill isn’t refusing chaos; it’s weaving it into the scene.</p><p>AI needs this same receptivity. Context is the offer: related documents, user history, current task state, time of day, emotional cues. Like Klein’s improv students, strong AI products tend to “notice what’s happening and simply add a little bit.” They use the context available rather than generating in a vacuum. This is where information architecture becomes critical: the stage you design determines what context AI can perceive and accept.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap: </em></strong>Zero context accepted past the last click, so zero stability. Each click erases the moment that preceded it.</p><h4>Designing for graceful failure</h4><p>Klein tells students to “celebrate failure loudly” — not because they strive for failure, but because celebrating it creates safety to take risks. In AI, this translates to <em>designing for graceful failure</em>: clear error states, honest uncertainty signals, easy recovery paths.</p><p>The goal isn’t preventing every mistake; that’s impossible with probabilistic systems. The goal is ensuring mistakes don’t break trust.</p><p>But how do you know how well your props, stage, and rules are working? That’s where the notes session comes in.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration: The notes session. The stage manager coaches and advises the actors, telling them what worked and what failed. Created with Nano Banana."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Bo540S3rwErUQ4Fo7Vlywg.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>The notes session (evals)</h4><p>After a show, many improv troupes gather for “notes,” to dissect the performance: Did we recognize the pattern? Did we honor the reality we established? Did we miss a teammate’s offer and derail the scene? This is where magic is systematized. This is where the production’s integrity solidifies — so the next night, they know what to amplify and what to cut.</p><p>This maps to AI evals: systematic reviews of where your theatrical infrastructure is, and isn’t, producing good performances.</p><p>Don’t confuse this with traditional software QA testing — that’s still important, but it’s like checking mechanics: “Did the lights turn on? Did the app crash?”</p><p>Evals are more like a coach or stage manager reviewing the performance: “Did the scene work? Was the tone right? Did we solve the user’s problem, or just talk at them?”</p><p>Rules don’t arrive fully formed. Improvisers train, perform, get feedback, refine their instincts. Rules emerge from watching what works.</p><p>You set up initial guardrails. You watch sessions. You notice patterns: Are the actors consistently tripping over the furniture in Act 2? If so, you don’t blame the actors; you move the furniture (adjust the UI). You refine.</p><p>The metrics shift from traditional QA and UX testing:</p><ul><li>Not just “Did it work?” but “How <em>reliably</em> does it work?”</li><li>Not just “Did it fail?” but “How <em>often</em> does it fail, in what ways, and how <em>badly</em>?”</li><li>Not just “Did users complete the task?” but “Do users feel like partners, or passengers?”</li></ul><p>Without rigorous evals, you deliver slop — interfaces that look polished but fail accessibility standards, break under edge cases, and erode trust. The notes session is your quality firewall.</p><p>This requires someone whose judgment defines “good.” In theatre, it’s the coach or the artistic director. In AI products, it’s often the designer or a domain expert who deeply understands the audience’s context. If you’re designing AI products, you may already be this person. You just haven’t formalized the role yet.</p><p>You’re not testing fixed paths. You’re not measuring funnels. You’re assessing behavior patterns across thousands of sessions.</p><p>The improv coach watches sessions, takes notes, adjusts.</p><p>And the performances improve.</p><p><strong><em>Neural OS gap:</em> </strong>No state management, no review, no behavioral boundaries. No rules at all.</p><p>Real AI products embody this infrastructure today — some elegantly, some clumsily. Let’s look at how different teams have built their stages.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Claude’s Artifacts interface showing a split-screen layout. The left panel displays a conversation between user and AI. The right panel shows a generated artifact — in this case, a code component — that Claude created during the conversation. Action buttons for copying, downloading, and versioning appear above the artifact pane."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5SdfDpNhGX_2xzkhpH4MVg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>These patterns aren’t theoretical. Claude Artifacts demonstrates props, stage, and rules working together — which we’ll examine next.</figcaption></figure><h3>What this looks like in practice</h3><p><strong>Claude Artifacts</strong></p><p><em>(Anthropic’s split-screen AI tool for generating apps and content)</em></p><p>The stage layout separates conversation from creation — chat on the left, artifact on the right. Props are minimal but explicit: artifact types (code, document, diagram, React component), action buttons for copy and download, version controls. The rules govern behavior without scripting outputs: when to create versus update, how to handle corrections, what belongs in an artifact versus in the chat. The AI decides <em>what</em> to write and build; the rules constrain <em>how</em> it presents the work. The stage is a steady canvas that survives the conversation’s chaos.</p><figure><img alt=""Woebot product screenshots"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IjLtF3KsSpkh9u1yjB4rwA@2x.jpeg"" /></figure><h4>Woebot</h4><p><em>(mental health AI service)</em></p><p>In high-stakes environments like mental health, the AI does more script-reading than usual. With Woebot, the rules are categorical: users never interact directly with an LLM. Everything Woebot says is written by clinical writers and conversational designers. In this theatre, improvisation is minimized and conservative. AI handles only intent classification — parsing what users mean so the system can select the right human-authored response. A “Concerning Language Detection” algorithm flags crisis signals before routing the conversation.</p><p>The design team conducts table reads — a practice borrowed from theatre, film, and TV professionals — where conversations are read aloud, evaluated and revised to ensure they feel empathetic and natural.</p><p>Props constrain the interaction: quick-reply buttons with predefined options, emoji mood selectors, structured therapy lesson modules (“challenging thoughts,” “social skills training”), an SOS crisis resource button. The stage is a branching conversational tree — hundreds of pre-authored paths mapped out by clinical experts. When safety stakes are highest, the rules are most explicit.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot demonstrating Google’s A2UI protocol, showing UI cards rendered dynamically by an AI agent. The cards display structured information using native platform components styled by designers — text fields, buttons, and formatted content blocks — illustrating how agents generate user interfaces by selecting from a predefined component catalog rather than regenerating new component styles for each session."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8E6vYXBQ9sI42okFSbr2-Q.png"" /><figcaption>Props in action: cards rendered on the fly with Google A2UI</figcaption></figure><h4>Google A2UI</h4><p><em>(open protocol for AI agents to generate native UIs)</em></p><p><a href=""https://developers.googleblog.com/introducing-a2ui-an-open-project-for-agent-driven-interfaces/"">Google’s A2UI</a> takes this to protocol level. The core insight: agents shouldn’t constantly rebuild everything from scratch.</p><p>Props are the point. Each client application maintains a “catalog” of trusted UI components — Card, Button, TextField, date pickers, time selectors, custom charts — that agents can use as building blocks. The agent sends declarative JSON describing <em>what</em> UI it wants; the client decides <em>how</em>, via native widgets (Flutter, React, Angular, SwiftUI). Same payload, different platforms, consistent brand.</p><p>The rules are structural: no code execution, only catalog components. The client controls styling. “UI that’s safe like data, but expressive like code.” It’s the stage manager framework formalized as an open standard — from the same company whose Neural OS demo showed us what unconstrained AI interfaces look like.</p><h3>The notes session in practice</h3><p>Improv’s post-show “notes session” isn’t just metaphor — here’s what it looks like when UX and product professionals lead AI evaluation:</p><h4>Product Talk Interview Coach</h4><p><em>(AI coaching tool for product discovery)</em></p><p>Interview Coach demonstrates <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/interview-coach-evals/"">a product professional leading successful AI evals</a>. Teresa Torres’ process: manually annotate AI outputs, identify failure patterns (like “coach presents leading questions”), write both code assertions and LLM-as-judge evals, then compare automated scores to human labels.</p><p>Her insights cut to the heart of teamwork in the AI era: “No engineer without my expertise is coming up with this really simple code assertion eval… I’m able to generate that because I’ve seen general questions over and over again and I’m confident that language captures them…. We really have to cross-functionally collaborate closer than we ever have… your product manager or designer are probably going to be involved in prompt design or even eval design.”</p><h4>Microsoft Sales Agent</h4><p><em>(AI-generated sales outreach)</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/uxr-microsoft/how-ux-research-shapes-ai-evals-4a28420d0aed"">UX researchers at Microsoft</a> conducted foundational research with sellers and buyers to define “experience-driven pillars of quality” — personalization, tone, brevity, clear calls to action. These became evaluation criteria that simultaneously direct the AI’s generation, provide scoring rubrics for LLM judges, and frame survey questions for human evaluators.</p><p>Researcher Pooja Dhaka explains: “UX research anchors scoring to human judgment and context, not just compliance with benchmarks.”</p><figure><img alt=""‘The New Skillset’ infographic w/ 2 columns. Left column, ‘Develop,’ lists 6 competencies: systems thinking across layers, information architecture for structuring possibility, writing as design material, evals design for probabilistic systems, comfort with weirdness and uncertainty, and curiosity.

A2UI, Claude Artifacts, and Woebot — and the industry leaders united in the new <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation"">Agentic AI Foundation</a> — show what happens when you design the infrastructure for success.</p><p>The difference isn’t the technology — it’s the design.</p><h4>The next stage</h4><p>The stakes are rising. <a href=""https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ces-2025-jensen-huang/"">Jensen Huang</a>, <a href=""https://time.com/7339693/fei-fei-li-ai/"">Fei-Fei Li</a>, and <a href=""https://fortune.com/2025/12/19/yann-lecun-ami-labs-ai-startup-valuation-meta-departure/"">Yann LeCun</a> are betting the new era will be defined by physical AI — robots and agents inhabiting physical space.</p><p>When that happens, the metaphor becomes literal. When the stage is a kitchen and the props are knives, “graceful failure” isn’t a UX nicety — it’s safety-critical. The framework holds. The margin for error shrinks.</p><p>Someone must design the theatre. Someone must choose the props. Someone must lay out the rules, watch the performances, coach the cast, refine the production. Someone must make the judgment calls that algorithms can’t.</p><p>Stop being the playwright.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954299.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=614&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A307"" /><figcaption>Venus, computer artwork.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As expected, Venus in Aquarius is going to shake up our world in unpredictable and erratic ways — so buckle up because the ride is about to get bumpy from January 17th to February 10th. The planet of social connections and romance is often more methodical, open-minded, and progressive when it comes to the last Air sign of the zodiac — and that’s not a bad thing.  </p>



<p>During this time, relationships can become unconventional, which means that we’re more open to seeking different qualities in a partner or making advances towards commitment in unique ways. Fundamentally, we are looking to connect with like-minded people, while also enjoying debates and meetings with opposing views. Basically, it’s not a boring transit! </p>



<p>Venus in Aquarius is going to share a harsh aspect with Uranus retrograde in Taurus. The square between both planets is going to be wild because we’ll wish to relinquish relationships or friendships that don’t appeal to us anymore. The caveat is that we will probably want to get back together with these people several times in between the end of Venus in Aquarius’s stint, so don’t say words or be a part of actions that you can’t take back or apologize for. The situationship you’ve been a part of might end on your accord, only for you to send a late-night text days later to reignite it. The back and forth might be dizzying, but it’s par for the course. Also, think twice before blocking or unfollowing. The same applies here, too. </p>



<p>Take note: Venus in Aquarius is bringing healing energy, too. Although we are going to feel like we’re on a roller coaster ride throughout the journey, we are gaining knowledge and help from the community and world at large to help us mend our wounds and trauma. It is a glorious time to seek advice and wisdom from others to get clarity on what we want to focus on and grow. If we pay tribute to those who’ve inspired and motivated us, we will pay the sentiment forward and gain insight that we can spread to others.  </p>



<p>Remember the water bearer takes great joy from imparting its knowledge to the universe and assisting those it cares about. The caveat is that they have an aloof way of showing it. The reason is that Aquarius is the watery part of Air, so it has the emotion and intuition that all water signs possess, and they express it straightforwardly and concisely, like an Air sign. If you’re looking for declarations of love, this isn’t the time for that. But if you’re looking for companionship, loyalty, flirtations, and camaraderie, then Venus in Aquarius will aid you in that capacity. </p>



<p>A great place to meet a potential romantic partner is on dating apps. Venus in Aquarius is a tech-savvy individual, making it an ideal spot for those seeking love. Rather than spend a night on the town with a friend or significant other, take that cash and donate it to a philanthropic organization that is meaningful to you. </p>



<h3>Important Astrological Dates: </h3>



<p><strong>January 17th:</strong> Venus enters Aquarius, pushing us to be demure and logical when it comes to our affections. </p>



<p><strong>January 19th:</strong> Venus forms a conjunction with Pluto in Aquarius, spicing up our desires and jealousies. Arguments are popping off due to triangular situations and power struggles. The temperature may be cold outside, but that is not the case behind closed doors. </p>



<p><strong>February 4th:</strong> Venus in Aquarius harmonizes with the centaur Chiron in Aries, urging us to evolve our bodies, minds, and spirits. We hold the key to our own healing. </p>



<p><strong>February 8th:</strong> Venus in Aquarius squares Uranus retrograde in Taurus, allowing us to break out of unhealthy or stagnant situations that are holding us back from living our most authentic lives. </p>



<p><strong>February 10th:</strong> Venus swims into Pisces for the next few weeks, allowing us to accept others and ourselves for who we truly are — no strings attached. </p>

<p>Frost is nipping at our noses — which means our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter dress coats</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">knee-high boots</a> are officially back in rotation. As your winter dresses make their seasonal debut, it’s the perfect time to refresh a few favorites.<br /><br />This season especially calls for long-sleeve dresses across cozy knit and velvet fabrics, elevated blazer and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape designs</a>, plus bundled-up high-neck and maxi silhouettes. Many of these trendy winter dresses can be worn for everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-bags-for-women"">work</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter weddings</a> (and all the celebrations throughout the season, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/urban-outfitters-for-love-and-lemons-collaboration-valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a>).

<h2>Sweater Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954743.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Whether you’re dressing for the office, a cozy dinner, a log cabin getaway, or a window-shopping stroll, it’s time to embrace <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uruguayan-brand-pastiche-us-launch-fall-finds"">sweater weather</a>. From plush cashmere and merino wool to ribbed jersey knits, these sweater dresses are equal parts warm and comfortable. We found styles in a range of lengths with turtlenecks, belts, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">cardigan-esque designs</a> that aren’t so basic, yet still versatile.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Velvet Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11954757.png?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p>When it comes to winter fabrics, velvet is the undisputed favorite. It’s soft, tactile, and undeniably luxe — perfect for winter cocktail parties, especially when in drapey silhouettes. For other seasonal occasions, like date nights, we’ve also spotted darling mini dresses with playful details like sequins and lace for extra texture and interest. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954832.png?width=803&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=803%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Just as classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">plaid coats are trending</a>, so are plaid dresses. While gingham shines in the warmer months, slightly festive and edgy plaids and tartans in deep color combos are perfect throughout the winter. So, whether you’re looking to re-style your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday dresses</a> or are shopping for a new dress, plaid is your friend. Find the print across mini, midi, and maxi lengths for every vibe and occasion. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Blazer Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954778.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Continuing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-creators-trend-forecast-2025"">2025 fashion trend</a> train, bold shoulders and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">soft suiting</a> are still popular, so it’s no wonder blazer dresses are having a moment. This suit alternative lets you bring the business vibes while showing a bit of leg. Plus, thicker velvet and faux leather fabrics, as well as details like neck scarves, mean you don’t have to sacrifice warmth. Just add fleece-lined tights and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-over-the-knee-boots"">over-the-knee boots</a> to fully winter-proof your look. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Cape Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954837.png?width=734&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=367%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>We’ve been seeing cape dresses more frequently, especially across <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=red+carpet"">awards season red carpets</a>, so we’re embracing the celebrity-backed trend. Ethereal sheer capes, attached scarves, and removable sleeves are especially popping up across our favorite retailers. Cape dresses make for the ideal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest style</a>, especially if you’re looking for a little extra coverage and warmth, sans stiff or sweaty long sleeves. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>High-Neck Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954838.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This awards season has also highlighted high-neck gowns, which is perhaps surprising, but certainly seasonally appropriate. From turtlenecks and mock necks to cowl necks and boatnecks, these dresses are reserved, but still chic and flirty. And luckily, there’s a range of fabrics and lengths that are perfect for professional work settings, casual family gatherings, romantic date nights, <em>and</em> black-tie parties.  </p>

Even more, the brand is dedicated to sustainability. Its garments are made from eco-friendly materials, like organic cotton. Meanwhile, the brand uses circularity programs that repurpose surplus fabric and upcycle items to reduce waste (with a zero landfill waste by 2030 goal) and has a tree-planting initiative, One Tree Planted, to offset carbon emissions. There's so much to love, especially with vibrant pieces like this Black Flowershop Ruched Waist Jersey Blouse.<br /><br /><strong>Farm Rio</strong> FARM Rio's Black Flowershop Ruched Waist Jersey Blouse, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffarmrio.com%2Fproducts%2Fflowershop-mini-black-jersey-blouse&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fbrazilian-apparel-brands"">Farm Rio</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1120"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954638.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1422&amp;height=1120&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=711:560"" width=""1422"" /><figcaption>Since 1979, the Brazilian <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fbrands%2Fmelissa--6559&amp;sref=www.refinery29.com%2Fbrazilian-apparel-brands"">footwear brand Melissa</a> has been famous for its colorful, retro-inspired jelly shoes, which they now make from a vegan, recyclable PVC called Melflex.

<p>If I were to rifle through your current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare lineup</a>, I’d bet I’d find at least one of the following: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">salicylic acid</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glycolic-acid-peel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glycolic acid</a>, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10385578/drunk-elephant-protini-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lactic acid</a>. Thanks to brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary</a>, Paula’s Choice, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/drunk-elephant-skin-care-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Drunk Elephant</a>, exfoliating acids have become staples in many routines. (Don’t ask me to pick a favorite — I’m loyal to all three.) From unclogging pores to fading hyperpigmentation and brightening dull skin, their benefits are well documented, but there’s another acid quietly vying for your attention, and if you have sensitive skin, might just replace what you’re using now. </p>



<p>Enter: citric acid. </p>



<h2>What is citric acid, and how does it work in skincare? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://mariamabbas.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mariam Abbas</a>, an advanced facialist, says citric acid is basically an acid — specifically an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) — and it comes from citrus fruits, which is where it gets its name. </p>



<p>“In high enough concentrations, citric acid can have an exfoliating effect on the skin,” says Abbas. It encourages old or dead skin cells to shed, revealing fresh, new cells and improving the appearance of dull skin, Abbas explains. It can also help unclog pores and prevent new breakouts, but it does all of this with far less irritation: “Citric acid is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acids,” she says. This is because its larger molecules aren’t absorbed into the skin as easily as glycolic acid’s much smaller ones. “As such, it is better tolerated as an exfoliating agent by sensitive skin,” says Abbas. </p>



<h2>Is citric acid good for the skin? </h2>



<p>Besides gentle exfoliation, Abbas says citric acid also has an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">antioxidant effect</a> on the skin, helping protect it from things like smoke and pollution that can cause dullness or congestion. Not only that, but it can also boost the effectiveness of other antioxidants like trusty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C</a>: “In this way, it can indirectly have a brightening effect on the skin when used in combination with actives like vitamin C,” explains Abbas. That’s why you might spot it on the ingredient list of your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C moisturizer or serum</a>.  </p>



<h2>How do you use citric acid in a skincare routine? </h2>



<p>Because citric acid is such a beneficial addition, it appears in a wide range of skincare products, but mostly exfoliators. More often than not, citric acid is combined with other exfoliating acids, like glycolic or lactic acid — both of which also brighten the skin, unclog pores, and minimize hyperpigmentation. Think of citric acid as the supporting actor in your exfoliating cleansers, toners, leave-on exfoliators, or serums.  </p>



<p>One of our favorite products — and a staple in many beauty editors’ skin, hair, and body routines — is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-glycolic-acid-7-toning-solution-P427406"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toner</a>. While glycolic acid is the star ingredient, citric acid also smooths rough texture, boosts radiance, and exfoliates skin. Top tip: It works just as well on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">flaky scalp</a> or <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7085863692784438533"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rough feet</a> as it does on your face. </p>



<p>If leave-on toners tend to irritate your skin, consider a wash-off cleanser instead. Abbas recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skinbetter.com%2Frefresh%2Frefining-foam-cleanser-M032.html%23tab%3Dingredients"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Skin Better Science Refining Foam Cleanser</a>, which combines citric acid with gentle AHA lactic acid and BHA salicylic acid. The salicylic acid penetrates a little deeper into the pores to break up the glue-like mixture of oil and dead skin cells that can lead to breakouts. If you have less to spend, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsalicylic-acid-acne-blackhead-cleanser-P443833"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser</a>, also with salicylic and citric acids. </p>





<p>Because citric acid has antioxidant benefits, you’ll also spot it inside plenty of brightening serums alongside vitamin C. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbarrier-15-vitamin-c-ferulic-acid-serum-P517666"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Try Skinfix Barrier+ Serum with 15% vitamin C</a> and antioxidant ferulic acid, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP516231"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum</a>, with ascorbyl glucoside — a version of vitamin C that’s kinder on reactive skin.  </p>





<h2>Are there any downsides to using citric acid in a skincare routine? </h2>



<p>Lastly, Abbas notes that, like any exfoliant, citric acid can cause dryness, irritation, or sensitivity if overused or used in very high concentrations. She adds that it’s also sometimes added as a fragrance in skincare, which could trigger allergic reactions or irritation in those with perfume-sensitive skin. If this sounds familiar, it’s always worth patch-testing any new skincare product before applying it to your face. Try the inner elbow, neck, or the area behind your ear. </p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out.

January is the activation point. It represents the threshold where intention meets momentum. It’s energetic activation. The choices you make daily and the emotions you lock into can shape the rest of the year. <br /><br />As you may know, 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse. It represents a year that conjures boldness, movement, and the willingness to run toward what calls you without looking back for approval. But none of that happens by accident. It happens because you choose it. Because only you can activate the frequency within yourself that matches the life you say you want.<br /><br />These tarotscopes aren’t predictive; they’re channeled directions. It’s Spirit showing you exactly what needs to come alive inside of you to make this year everything you've been building toward. This is your roadmap to alignment. It’s your permission slip to step into the fullest expression of who you came here to be.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising signs. Let the messages land where they need to. And then do the work of activation.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954052.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries (March 21 - April 19) The Tower + Seven of Wands</strong><br /><br />Stop defending what's already dead and chasing past regrets. You’ve been fighting to keep structures standing that were never meant to survive your next level. Whether these are limiting beliefs or old shadows and traumas, this year requires you to activate your capacity for complete demolition. It’s not the gentle release you’ve been attempting, or possibly avoiding, but the full burn. The Tower is here to tell you that what needs to fall will fall, with or without your permission, and your job is to stop trying to save it. Instead, focus that warrior energy on claiming new ground and observing what the Tower’s destruction reveals to you about yourself and what you’ve allowed. Your best year comes when you stop protecting old territory and start building your empire from the ground up. Let it collapse. You were made to rebuild from nothing.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) The Empress + Five of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Activate your divine right to receive all the desires you want. You’ve been operating from scarcity consciousness while sitting on a throne, convinced you need to earn every crumb through suffering. That ends now. This year demands that you embody the Empress, the one who knows abundance is her birthright, not a reward for good behavior. Stop waiting for permission to live well and luxurious. Stop punishing yourself with lack and limitation as proof of your worthiness. Your best year unfolds when you plant yourself in the soil of your own value and refuse to negotiate. The harvest is already yours. Claim it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954054.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) The Magician + Two of Swords<br /></strong><br />Your words are spells and your ideas are architecture. We all know this. This year, you need to activate your voice as your primary tool of manifestation, and that requires you to choose. You’ve been sitting on the fence, hedging your bets, and keeping your magic theoretical. That’s over. The Magician demands sharp decisions. It requires commitment, the willingness to speak your vision into being and then back it up with strategic action. Your best year happens when you stop intellectualizing and start declaring or delegating to your Spirits. Make the choice. Say it out loud. Then watch what you've been talking about finally take form.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954055.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) The Moon + Strength<br /></strong><br />Cancer, this is vital: Trust your psychic knowing over everyone else’s logic. You've been letting other people’s fears override your intuition, second-guessing the visions that come to you in dreams, and apologizing for feeling everything. This year activates your emotional sovereignty. It’s the part of you that moves through the unknown with your inner compass as your only guide. Your best year comes when you stop treating your sensitivity like a weakness and start recognizing it as your superpower — no ifs, ands, or buts. The path isn’t clear, but your intuitive GPS is so sharp. Prepare to shock yourself. Ultimately, you’re not supposed to see the whole way. Move anyway. Your body knows.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954056.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo (July 23 - August 22) The Sun + Three of Cups<br /></strong><br />Shine like it’s your spiritual assignment, because it is. You’ve been dimming yourself to make others comfortable and performing humility like it’s a virtue. It’s not. This year demands that you activate your full radiance and let it be medicine for your community. Your best year unfolds when you stop rationing your gifts and start pouring them out like libations. Celebrate loudly. Gather your people. Let them see what it looks like when someone refuses to shrink. Your joy is your offering. Your brightness gives others permission. Stop playing small. It’s boring and it's beneath you. You are a living road opener. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954057.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo (August 23 - September 22) The Hermit + Eight of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Virgo, your activation for 2026: mastery without self-punishment. You know how to refine the craft, but you’ve been using discipline as a weapon against yourself. There’s a difference between devotion and self-flagellation. This year asks you to honor the process without making yourself wrong for being in it. Your best year comes when you stop perfecting yourself into a corner and start building something that reflects your actual genius, not your fear of being exposed. You’re already good enough to do the work. Now do it without the side of shame.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954058.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra (September 23 - October 22) Justice + The Lovers<br /></strong><br />Choose yourself with the same conviction you use to choose everyone else. You’ve been sacrificing at the altar of other people’s comfort and maintaining peace at the expense of your power. This year demands reciprocity and equity. The scale is tipping in your favor for once. Your best year happens when you activate your understanding that self-selection is sacred, not selfish. Stop negotiating your needs down to make room for everyone else’s wants. This year is about you being selfish. The right people will meet you where you are. The wrong ones will reveal themselves. Both outcomes serve you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954059.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) Death + Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />You love transformation, the phoenix moment. But this year asks you to activate rebirth without the addiction to intensity. What if you could open to new love, new emotional terrain, and new beginnings without requiring everything to go up in flames first? Your best year comes when you learn that transformation doesn't have to hurt to be real. And you don't have to keep “healing” in order to learn important lessons. Let something be born from softness. Let yourself feel without destroying yourself in the process. You can change without the drama. Try it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954060.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) Temperance + The Chariot<br /></strong><br />Harness your fire instead of letting it burn you out. You’re all acceleration, no integration. You’re moving so fast the lessons never land. This year activates your ability to embody your philosophy instead of just preaching it. This will bring your vision into your actual life instead of just talking about it. Your best year unfolds when you realize that sustainable momentum requires alchemy, not just speed. You don’t need to move faster. You need to move with purpose. Direct your energy. Let it build. And stop running from what you’re supposed to be learning.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954061.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn (December 22 - January 19) The Devil + Ten of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Capricorn, activate pleasure as power. You’ve been building the empire at the expense of your own enjoyment and treating success like it has to hurt to count. Implement self-adoration and self-devotion to all of you. Legacy without luxury is just suffering with better branding. This year demands that you let yourself enjoy what you’ve created. The chains are self-imposed. The key has always been in your hand. Your best year comes when you stop making wealth mean deprivation and start building abundance that actually feels good to inhabit. You’ve earned the feast. Sit down and eat it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954062.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius (January 20 - February 18) The Star + Four of Wands<br /></strong><br />Bring your vision into form. You’ve been future-tripping while ignoring the present, building castles in your mind with no foundation beneath them. This year activates your ability to create community around your ideals, to celebrate what’s here while calling in what’s next. Your best year unfolds when you stop waiting for the revolution and start being it — in every area of your life. Your difference is your contribution. Your vision is valid. Now make it real. Ground it. Build the structure that holds your dream. Stop floating. Start creating. Everything you envision can come into fruition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954063.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces (February 19 - March 20) The Hanged Man + Knight of Wands<br /></strong><br />Pisces, it’s time to move from the void. You've been waiting for clarity that will never come, for the perfect sign, for certainty before you act. This year demands that you activate your ability to take inspired action even when the path isn’t clear. You are rebuilding your entire life this year and on an elevated level. Your best year comes when you trust that your intuition is enough, that the way reveals itself as you walk it. Stop surrendering to paralysis and start surrendering to movement. You don't need the whole map. You just need to take the first step. The path builds itself beneath your feet.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jess Gonzalez</a>, Pravana color expert and celebrity colorist, predicts that bronde — a mix of blonde and brunette — will evolve, taking inspiration from fashion, specifically the neutrals in our closets, like khaki. “Soft, melted, and cozy is the vibe of khaki bronde,” says Gonzalez — but don’t let the word khaki put you off; it’s nowhere near green. “Using a color melting technique, khaki bronde is a muted gold with hints of ash,” explains Gonzalez, much like this color created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tay Ramirez.</a> </p>



<p>The addition of darker, ashier tones dials down the intensity of the blonde, lending the overall finish a more organic-looking, lived-in effect. “It flatters a wide range of skin tones, and it’s great for clients that want their hair to look natural or natural-ish,” says Gonzalez.

<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cowgirl-copper-hair-color"">cowgirl copper</a> is entering a new, brighter phase: soft apricot blonde. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Michael</a>, owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, describes this as a “warm blonde with a subtle peach undertone,” occupying a cozy space between copper, strawberry blonde, and golden blonde. “It creates a bright and luminous look without the harsh contrast of icy or very cool blondes, which makes it appealing as more clients shift toward softer, warmer tones this year,” explains Michael. </p>



<p>Happily, he says this shade works well for both natural blondes and brunettes who want a vibrant result that still looks natural and blended. Even better? “It photographs beautifully in natural light, which is contributing to its growing popularity for 2026,” adds Michael. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJkgE6JT1UR/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Madeleine Kay</a> gets it so right here. </p>

<p>Barron-Hough describes lush truffle as a “sophisticated, expensive-looking shade that’s full of warmth, glowy tones, and indulgent truffle pigments.” She adds, “This trend reflects a shift away from cooler brown hues towards rich brunettes with a slightly warm, red glow.” Think Kelly Gale, Kiera Knightly, and Lana Del Rey — or curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesseniaspallet?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a> here.  </p>



<p>Barron-Hough says there isn’t a hair texture that it doesn’t look great on. For multi-textured hair, she suggests asking for a semi-permanent color. “This will add depth, tone, and lots of hydrating properties,” she says.  </p>

<p>This brunette shade takes its cue from nature — specifically taupe-y truffle and glossy coffee beans. “This is all about depth,” says Gonzalez, lending the finished result “rich brunette energy.” <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DND4Y6WIn06/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> nails it here. For those with lighter hair or blonde balayage, Gonzalez says that layering an espresso-toned gloss will take you there. </p>

<p>Hazan says that striking blonde will be just as popular this year as it was in 2025, but this time, the focus is on dialing up the shine. The key? Investing in an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-gloss-products"">at-home gloss</a>. Blonde requires salon maintenance, says Hazan, but keeping hair super shiny, healthy, and hydrated between visits is easy with the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopPSIJeqvbxTQb9QtsWiVWct9o0iqAFoXQirAPy-U8bPZCB2b9M"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glaze Supergloss</a>. “This gives your hair a deep hydrating condition and that reflective hair — without disturbing your hair color,” says Hazan.

<p>Cashmere brunette is defined by a handful of very fine wisps of blonde throughout, rather than strong, high-contrast highlights, says Michael. “It reflects light evenly, photographs well, and grows out cleanly, which makes it a good option for people who want a lower-maintenance color that still has dimension,” he adds. </p>



<p>Michael says it looks especially beautiful on natural brunettes with medium to deeper skin tones. “It’s a strong choice for anyone who wants professional, polished, but healthy-looking color with longer wear between appointments.” This shade posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJg9HB5TQp8/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miho Mai</a> is beautiful. </p>

<p>Blanche blonde has “cloud dancer,” Pantone’s color of the year, to thank for its inception, says Gonzalez. “It’s a bright and ethereal pale blonde,” she explains. But it’s not for the fainthearted or those short on time. “A bold color like this requires monthly salon visits and treatments,” explains Gonzalez, specifically bonding treatments to counteract the drying effects of bleach. “It’s a high-maintenance color,” adds Gonzalez, “but when done right, it’s so striking.” She recommends asking for a bleach and tone with icy, milky highlights.

<p>Barron-Hough also makes a case for blanche blonde and has a feeling that it’s going to be <em>the </em>shade of 2026: “As blanche contains neither warm nor cool hues, it appears bright and ultra-reflective, making it a very fashion-forward look,” she says, adding that it looks especially cool on bobs and shorter cropped styles. </p>

<p>Highlights are getting an upgrade for 2026. At Haug, they’re delicately threaded into a darker base to create the illusion of depth, as though hair has been lightly sun-kissed rather than bleached. The goal? To make the color look as natural as possible, says Haug. And placement is paramount. Around the face, shoulders, and near the temples, where hair naturally has bounce, allows the highlights to really pop — like this shade by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGEcTPjPY2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Annabelle Arnold</a>. </p>

<p>Ecru is often described as a soft, warm, neutral hue, reminiscent of natural cotton fabric — and Haug predicts it will lighten up upcoming brunette trends, lending a “shimmering, illuminating effect,” like this tone by color expert and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZaAWyke-6/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jaye Edwards</a> or this by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJXsK3FQ-H/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Jessenia Robayo</a>. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954327.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026""> 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards</a> took place last night (January 11), and by all means, it was business as usual for the official kick-off to the 2026 <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7594276237799968030"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">awards season</a>. Which, to be clear, isn’t a good thing. As anyone who’s logging onto social media, turning on their TV, or doom scrolling on their TikTok FYP daily knows, the times are anything but normal — and we shouldn’t be acting like they are. </p>



<p>Kicking off the show, often touted as Hollywood’s biggest party, two-time host <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9339653/nikki-glaser-taylor-swift-apology"">Nikki Glaser </a>made a subtle allusion to the current political and social climate,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hpHj5wNYDw""> welcoming celebs and viewers</a> to the event that was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And then, that was pretty much it.</p>



<p>To recap: the past year has seen a brutal decimation of human rights across the United States. Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump and his administration have <a href=""https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/#2025"">rolled back DEI initiatives </a>across sectors, issued executive orders to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/birthright-citzenship-trump"">end birthright citizenship</a> and suspend the admission of refugees to the country, as well as targeted Transgender Americans by defining “sex” as binary and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-transition-healthcare-funding-hhs"">proposing an immediate pause on gender-affirming</a> care. In addition to this, his administration has increased <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"">funding to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o"">deploying the National Guard </a>into cities across the country and inciting violence. Earlier this month, a Minneapolis citizen, Renee Good, was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o"">shot and killed by an ICE agent</a>. Oh, and the President of the United States is set to<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/09/france-delays-g7-summit-white-house-ufc-trump-birthday""> hold a UFC figh</a>t this July to celebrate his 80th birthday, held on the White Houses’ South Lawn. (Which isn’t a social injustice, but <em>is</em> tacky as hell). </p>



<p>These are arguably the most unprecedented of unprecedented times; yet the Golden Globes felt like something straight out of  the 2016 feminism and activism handbook — ie: soap boxing with little to no substance. Talking around some of the most prevalent and dire issues of the moment without actually speaking to them in a way that would cause conversation or discomfort (which, to be clear, is needed). </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.”  </p><cite>Jameela Jamil </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Presenting the award for Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, Made for TV Movie, Kathryn Hahn and Melissa McCarthy took to the stage to sarcastically congratulate men on finally being recognized for their acting chops, as well as their abilities to show their range playing so many roles, as McCarthy put it “Husband! Ex-husband! Secretary! And everybody’s favorite: nosy neighbor.” It was a moment of comedy meant to be a tongue-in-cheek jab at ongoing conversations around men’s dominance in the profession that failed to be either funny or actually impactful. The feeling was similar to actress Natalie Portman’s now-infamous statement at the 2018 Golden Globes while presenting the award for Best Director, where she <a href=""https://deadline.com/2018/01/natalie-portman-all-male-directors-category-remark-prompts-reaction-golden-globes-1202238326/"">pointedly called out the categories’ list of all-male nominees</a>. It was a strong statement, until you consider the fact that — between 2018 and this year — Portman has herself worked with no female directors. (In the words of queen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">Kirsten Dunst</a>: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">It’s very simple</a>” to work with female directors). </p>



<p>Later in the show, Noah Wyle, the hunky lead of hit HBO series <em>The Pitt  </em>– which unflinching depicts the reality of being a healthcare worker in America — picked up two Golden Globe Awards, during which he broadly thanked healthcare workers, without speaking to any of the current ways in which the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/us-health-insurance-system-doctors"">health care system is inaccessible </a>to the majority of Americans. And Nikki Glaser ribbed Leonardo DiCaprio for continuing to date women under 30 instead of questioning why someone who claims to be a climate activist would<a href=""https://variety.com/2025/biz/columns/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-bad-taste-1236442892/""> attend Jeff Bezos’ wedding</a>. And even though <em>One Battle After Another </em>is a satire about revolution, critiquing anti-immigration and extremist white nationalist groups, those issues weren’t directly addressed in the speeches when the film won. </p>



<p>It was…dissapointing to say the least. </p>



<p>Maybe this characterization is unfair. And some celebrities did subtly use their platforms for good last night. But the idea of asking and expecting celebrities to speak truth to power is nothing new. In fact, fans have been demanding it for years. Largely, these calls to action have been met with a divisive response from people both in and outside of the industry. In 2020, then- Golden Globes host <a href=""https://deadline.com/2020/01/golden-globes-politics-ricky-gervais-1202821552/"">Ricky Gervais directly warned celebrities</a> not to talk about politics in their acceptance speeches, saying:  “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off.” </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954276.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In 2021, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/01/11638286/golden-globes-2024-apolitical-genocide#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20long%20history,glitz%2C%20glamour%2C%20and%20escapism."">reflecting on that comment after yet another apolitical Golden Globe awards</a> ceremony, Refinery29’s Senior Content Director, Entertainment Kathleen Newman-Bremang wrote about understanding the inclination to want to tell stars to essentially “shut up and look pretty.” It’s one that many stars we look to seem to hold, or at least cower behind, themselves.</p>



<p>In a November 2025 interview, <em>Die My Love</em> actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke about her decision to not speak openly about her politics, specifically the actions of President Donald Trump. In an interview with The New York Times’ <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQotp7ejvJi/?igsh=eDVnZWtuNG41ZHFh""><em>The Interview </em></a>podcast, Lawrence said that, after spending the President’s first term “running around like a chicken with [her] head cut off,” she felt speaking out wouldn’t have an impact. “We’ve learned election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” Lawrence said. “So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. </p><cite>katherine singh</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Lawrence went on to say that she wouldn’t want her personal politics to deter people from coming to see her films, media that, in her words, could “change consciousness or change the world.” While we admire the ambition and trust in her craft (and yes, it is true that art can literally change lives) — please, give us a break. Just say you don’t want to alienate people that will contribute to your bottom line. </p>



<p>But the fact remains that, despite what any comedians or Jennifer Lawrence may think, these celebrities and their platforms do have influence and can elicit change, especially when it comes to <a href=""https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the_oprah_effect"">political leaders</a>. When Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady"">publicly supported Kamala Harris</a> ahead of the November 2024 Presidential election, sharing her intent to vote for the candidate on Instagram, she <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-vote-gov/"">drove over 400,000 people</a> to the <a href=""http://vote.gov"">vote.gov</a> site over the next 24 hours. <em>Bridgerton</em> actress Nicola Coughlan, who has continued to post frequently to Palestinian aid organizations, has helped <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2476904/bridgerton-star-nicola-coughlan-raises-over-2-million-for-palestine-despite-hollywoods-warnings"">raise over $2 million USD</a> to date. </p>



<p>To be fair, that’s not to say that celebrities have completely eschewed speaking up and out about what’s currently happening in the country. Walking the red carpet ahead of the 83rd annual Golden Globes show, a handful of stars did speak out about the need for celebrities and lay people alike to be vocal about the current climate in the United States. Speaking to <em>Refinery29, Poker Face</em> actress Natasha Lyon, who donned a pin declaring ICE OUT, said: “I just think it’s important that we don’t normalize what’s going on in this country right now. I love America, I love us, I love our communities,  free speech, I love the Trevor Project and all that. I think it’s important. Renee Good, say her name.” Lyon was one of several actors, including Tessa Thompson, Wanda Sykes, and Mark Ruffalo, who wore pins that said “<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/11/golden-globes-ice-protest-pin-mark-ruffalo-wanda-sykes/88134903007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good</a>,” speaking out against the actions of ICE and in support of Good and Keith Porter Jr., who was also killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

<p>Later on the same carpet, actress Yvette Nicole Brown was even more explicit with her distaste for the current administration, telling <em>Refinery29</em>’s Unbothered the thing that’s bothering her deeply is, simply: “Our government. That orange ghoul that is terrorizing us everyday,” before warning viewers that “it’s about to be really real, get ready.” </p>



<p>And while accepting her third Golden Globe for Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series, <em>Hacks</em> star Jean Smart also took her moment on-stage to<a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69966807/jean-smart-best-actress-tv-comedy-golden-globes-speech-transcript-2026/""> encourage viewers to take action</a>, saying: “There’s just a lot that could be said tonight; I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here….But let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do. So let’s do the right thing.” Smart was referring to earlier comments she made on the carpet, telling reporters that filming of the upcoming season of the show was overshadowed by the current goings on in the country, stating: “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in this country, and I hope people can keep their heads because that’s actually, really, the hardest thing, I think, is to keep our heads. It’s going to take a lot of courage and concerns, but I think that’s important.”</p>

<p>While fashion has long been political, and these small moments of resistance can be important,  it’s hard to feel like a handful of celebs donning obscured, teeny-tiny pins or making veiled comments about triumphing over fear is enough, or anywhere near enough — because it’s really not.</p>



<p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. We need these big names with big money and big studios attached to them to take action — whether that’s boycotting award shows or refusing to speak to anything other than these issues at this moment in time. </p>



<p>It feels like the bare minimum, and actress Jameela Jamil agrees. Speaking to <em>Refinery29 </em>at the Spotify x The Hollywood Reporter Golden Globes Nominees Night, the British actress — who is a vocal activist — spoke to the inability of many of her colleagues to speak out against injustices, pondering, “Am I brave or are they cowards?”</p>



<p>“I think they’re being greedy and weird and disappointing,” Jamil continued. “Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.” Jamil pointed to actors like Mark Ruffalo, who has<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZBbZLDI3c/?hl=en""> often and vocally spoken out against injustices</a>, noting that, when we look at people like him, we weaponize the word “brave” as a way to separate ourselves, removing ourselves from the expectation that we can and will do the same. “So we rely on individuals to do what would be so much easier to achieve as a collective.” </p>

<p>And if the Golden Globes are any indicator of what this upcoming awards season will hold when it comes to celebs speaking out, it feels like — once again — Ruffalo will be an outlier. </p>



<p>But as disappointing as the apoliticalness of this awards show was, maybe the bigger disappointment is the fact that we continue to hope and ask for anything different from those we look up to onscreen, and continue to be disappointed when they don’t follow through. Because truly, what can we really expect? At the end of the day, this industry is all about the bottom line. And our faves, who we idolize, meme, emulate and form a parasocial bond with, are largely going to stay on the side of the line that makes sure they get their bag – as long as these injustices don’t impact or affect them directly. </p>



<p>So, for the next few months, award show contenders, winners, and Hollywood ingenues will have the spotlight on them. As they have every other awards’ season, they’ll thank their families and agents; tearfully, they’ll talk about hardship and determination, picking themselves up and trying again. And maybe it’s time we stop hoping for more. </p>
