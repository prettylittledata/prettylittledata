<p style=""text-align: left;"">Are you ready to dive head first into the enigmatic sea of Mars in Pisces? From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/march-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">March 2nd to April 9th</a>, we’ll be trying to keep our heads above water when the planet of passion and ambition, Mars, swims in Pisces, bringing a whirlwind of desire and excitement. For the next several weeks, self-care and preservation will be essential. </p>



<p>Mars in Pisces <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/confrontation-friendships-relationships-trust"">doesn’t like to be confrontational</a>. This astrological placement would rather avoid having arguments with others by swimming away from a situation and avoiding dealing with the person. Mars in Pisces urges us to leave the drama on read and send calls to voicemail. The vibe can be frustrating if you’re on the other end of it, because resolving matters is impossible during this transit. </p>



<p>This is why when we want to fight, instead of directly discussing the matter with the person who is frustrating us, we will choose to go behind their back and do shady things, like provoke their enemy (after all, our enemy’s enemy is our best friend) or talk behind their back. The reason is that Mars in Pisces likes to play games and pretend they didn’t have a hand in stirring the pot, rolling the dice, or shuffling the cards. Mars in Pisces is too slippery to get caught in the act, but if it does, prepare for gaslighting or bear the burden of the blame, since Mars in Pisces rarely takes responsibility for having a role in a situation.</p>



<p>The answer is simple: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">We must use our intuition</a> and empathy to understand that, while we may wish to do devious things for vengeance, it’s not worth it. Using compassion to understand what others are going through will help us comprehend the motives. Giving people grace proves that we are evolving into evolved beings, which is what Mars in Pisces urges us to become. Picking up on a sentiment can lead us down the right path, allowing us to handle matters with TLC. Kindness and sympathy for what our friends and loved ones are going through are more necessary than ever, especially given the world’s current divisions.</p>



<p>The celestial currents of Mars in Pisces have many great attributes, such as creativity and altruism that pushes us forward. We will infuse our imagination and talents into projects, helping us achieve harmony and peace — not only with others but within ourselves. Also, we’ll believe in fate and karma, letting go of anything or anyone that doesn’t flow with the cosmic waves. Finding serenity in our lives leads us to a state of calmness because no one can activate us. Shielding our aura from negativity is key to having the life we dream of. </p>



<p>And yet, this year, Mars in Pisces brings a reversal of fortune. Ten days after March 3rd’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a>, on March 13th, and in the middle <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Mercury retrograde</a>, Mars links up with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces, challenging the events that are unfolding from the lunar eclipse. We will be able to take action on the story that unfolds, leading to disagreements and conflicts within our inner circle. Once we see who people are beyond the veil, it’ll be hard to make an about-face and forget. Mars in Pisces is a sponge; therefore, it remembers and retains information and memories — the good, the bad, and the ugly. </p>

<p>R29 babes, welcome to the first week of March. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Eclipse season is reaching</a> its peak, and the emotional volume is turning up. Before the main event, though, the sky is fully drenched <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces energy</a>. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, joining <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mercury (currently retrograde)</a>, Venus, and the North Node in this dreamy, intuitive sign. This creates a powerful Pisces stellium right in the middle of eclipse season.</p>



<p>Mars here doesn’t push forward aggressively, it moves through feeling, intuition, and emotional truth. During this six-week transit, motivation may come in waves rather than steady bursts. You might feel more sensitive, spiritually tuned in, or pulled toward rest, creativity, or emotional processing. The lesson is to move with your energy, not against it. In a season this watery, forcing productivity will only lead to burnout. Listening to your intuition is the real power move.</p>



<p>Then comes the main event. On March 3rd (3/3) — a numerological powerhouse and so-called ascension portal — we experience a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo. Lunar eclipses are emotionally intense, and this one shines a spotlight on control, perfectionism, and the pressure to hold everything together. While the recent Aquarius solar eclipse asked you to break free and think bigger, this Virgo eclipse asks the harder question: what are you still gripping tightly out of fear? Wherever you’re trying to micromanage outcomes, expect life to loosen your grip. This isn’t punishment, it’s recalibration. If anxiety rises, take it as information about where you’re overextended or running on empty. This is a powerful moment to ask for help, delegate, rest, and release the belief that you have to do everything alone.</p>



<p>Just a few days later, the emotional waters get a spark of fire. On March 6th, Venus enters Aries, shifting the relational tone from reflective to bold. After weeks of deep feeling and nostalgia, this transit brings a fresh wave of confidence, desire, and initiative in love, creativity, and self-worth. You may feel more willing to go after what you want instead of waiting for signs. The shadow? Aries energy can lean impulsive, impatient, or a little me-first. The medicine is balance: honor your needs without bulldozing someone else’s. In a sky full of Pisces softness, this fiery shift is energizing, reminding you that after the emotional release of eclipse week, it’s safe to move forward again… this time with your heart and your courage aligned.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your ruling planet Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, shifting your energy inward for the next six weeks. Instead of your usual go-go-go momentum, you may feel slower, more sensitive, or less motivated to push forward aggressively. That’s not a problem, it’s the point. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and the North Node also in Pisces, this is a powerful period for spiritual healing, rest, therapy, meditation, and honest emotional processing. If your body asks for more sleep or your intuition tells you to pause, listen. The more you work with<em> </em>this quieter energy instead of fighting it, the more clarity and strength you’ll build for the next chapter.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo activates your health, wellness, and daily routine sector, bringing a serious reality check. This eclipse can spotlight burnout, anxiety, or habits that are quietly draining you. If you’ve been ignoring your body’s signals, they may get louder now. Think practical care: schedule that physical, dental visit, or mental health check-in you’ve been postponing. Small changes to your routine, hydration, sleep, movement, boundaries at work, will go further than dramatic overhauls. Virgo energy isn’t about perfection. It’s about sustainable care, one manageable step at a time.</p>



<p>The mood lifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, putting you back in the spotlight. After weeks of emotional processing, your confidence and magnetism return, and people notice. This is a powerful time for attraction, style upgrades, dating, and going after what (or who) you want. You’re glowing. Just be mindful of the shadow of Venus in Aries: moving too fast or sending mixed signals because you’re excited by the attention. Be clear about your intentions and lead with honesty. When you combine this new confidence with emotional clarity, you become a powerful magnet for the kind of love and opportunities you actually want.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the energy this week turns your attention toward your social world as Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, activating your friendship, community, and technology zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and Venus (your ruling planet) already in Pisces, this part of your life is under deep review. You may feel motivated to reconnect with certain friends, step back from draining group dynamics, or rethink how much time you spend online. Old connections could resurface, while others may fade naturally. Let this be a period of intentional alignment. Your circle is shifting to match the person you’re becoming, and your energy belongs where it feels emotionally safe and mutually supportive.</p>



<p>On March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lands in your fellow earth element, activating your realm of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing. This eclipse can bring a turning point in dating, a creative project, or a situation involving children or personal passions. Something may reach a culmination, transformation, or emotional truth point. The challenge here is control. Virgo energy wants to fix or manage the outcome, but eclipses ask for surrender. If something shifts or ends, trust that it’s clearing space for a more authentic expression of love and happiness.</p>



<p>The tone turns inward on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, moving your ruling planet into your spirituality and healing zone for the next four weeks. After the social intensity of Pisces season, you may crave more solitude, rest, and emotional privacy. This is a powerful period for therapy, creative reflection, spiritual practices, or simply stepping back from constant stimulation. Think of it as a quiet reset for your heart. The more you honor your need for peace now, the more magnetic and grounded you’ll feel when Venus returns to your sign next.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, your public life and long-term direction take center stage as Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, activating your career and reputation zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this area of your life is under deep reflection rather than fast expansion. You may feel motivated to pursue a goal, but progress could come through revising, reconnecting, or rethinking rather than launching something brand new. Old professional opportunities or unfinished projects may resurface. Move intuitively and stay flexible. Right now, alignment matters more than speed.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major emotional moment around home, family, or your living situation. This fellow Mercury-ruled energy can feel intense, especially if you’ve been juggling career demands with personal needs. Something around your emotional foundation may need to shift, whether that’s a boundary with family, a living arrangement, or simply acknowledging burnout. The key is to release the pressure to hold everything together perfectly. Ask for support where you need it and give yourself permission to rest.</p>



<p>The energy lightens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your friendship and community zone for the next four weeks. After a heavy focus on responsibilities, this brings a refreshing social boost. You may feel more outgoing, inspired by your network, or ready to collaborate on shared goals. It’s a great time to reconnect with friends, expand your circle, or show up more confidently online. Just be mindful of overcommitting. Choose connections that energize you, not ones that drain your already busy mind.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, the emotional waters deepen in a way that actually feels supportive this week. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your expansion, travel, learning, and big-picture vision zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, you may feel pulled toward spiritual growth, journaling, therapy, study, or revisiting a dream you once put on hold. Instead of rushing into a brand-new direction, let this be a period of intuitive recalibration. The path forward is becoming clearer, but it’s unfolding through reflection, not force.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your communication and mental health zone. This can feel like emotional overload if your schedule, inbox, or daily obligations have been piling up. A conversation may reach a turning point, or you may realize you’ve been carrying too much mental responsibility alone. Virgo energy here is asking you to simplify. Prioritize fewer things, say no where needed, and give your nervous system space to reset. Not every message needs an immediate reply, and not every problem is yours to solve.</p>



<p>The mood shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your career and visibility zone for the next four weeks. After a reflective start to the month, this brings a welcome boost of confidence and recognition. You may feel more motivated to go after a professional opportunity, advocate for yourself, or step into a leadership role. Just watch the shadow of this transit: moving too fast or taking on more than your energy can sustain. Lead boldly, but stay emotionally grounded. When your ambition and intuition work together, your presence becomes magnetic.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week pulls your energy inward in a way that may feel unfamiliar but ultimately empowering. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this is less about external momentum and more about emotional and financial recalibration. You may be revisiting conversations around boundaries, debts, investments, or the give-and-take in close relationships. Old feelings or trust issues could resurface, not to derail you, but to be processed and released. Move slowly here. This is deep emotional housekeeping, not a race.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major reality check around money, self-worth, and sustainability. This eclipse may highlight where you’ve been overworking, overspending, or tying your value to productivity or external validation. Virgo energy asks for practical care: budgeting, simplifying expenses, and creating systems that actually support your long-term stability. If anxiety shows up, treat it as information about where your foundation needs strengthening, not as a sign that something is wrong.</p>



<p>The energy lifts on March 6th, when Venus enters fellow Fire sign of Aries, activating your expansion, travel, and adventure zone for the next four weeks. After the emotional depth of early March, this transit brings fresh confidence, optimism, and a desire to say yes to new experiences. You may feel inspired to travel, learn something new, or take a bold step toward a bigger vision for your life. Just watch the impulsive side of this energy. Excitement is great, but thoughtful action will take you much further than rushing ahead.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, the spotlight is intense this week, and it’s asking you to balance sensitivity with self-protection. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your partnership zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, relationships are under deep review. You may feel heightened emotions with a partner, collaborator, or close friend, or find yourself revisiting old conversations and expectations. This isn’t the time to force clarity or make ultimatums. Move slowly, listen to your intuition, and allow dynamics to reveal what’s sustainable and what isn’t.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in your sign brings a powerful personal turning point. Lunar eclipses in your sign can feel emotional and physically draining, as if the universe is asking you to release the pressure to hold everything together perfectly. You may suddenly recognize where you’re burned out, overextended, or trying to control outcomes that are no longer yours to manage. Prioritize rest, hydration, and nervous system care. This eclipse is less about doing more and more about letting go of what your body and spirit can’t carry anymore.</p>



<p>The energy shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your intimacy and shared resources zone for the next four weeks. After such a personal release, this transit brings opportunities for deeper emotional connection, financial collaboration, or healing within close bonds. You may feel more open to vulnerability, but be mindful of rushing emotional or financial commitments too quickly. Let trust build gradually. When you move at a steady pace, this period can strengthen both your relationships and your sense of security.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, the emotional tone of the week asks you to slow your pace and listen to what your body and spirit have been trying to tell you. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your wellness, work, and daily routine zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your schedule, energy levels, and work-life balance are under review. You may feel more sensitive to stress, workplace dynamics, or the way your daily habits affect your mental health. Instead of pushing through, this is a time to simplify, rest where possible, and rebuild routines that actually support your well-being.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your rest, closure, and subconscious zone, bringing emotional material to the surface. This eclipse can feel heavy if you’ve been carrying anxiety, unresolved feelings, or burnout beneath the surface. Think of it as a release valve. Prioritize sleep, quiet time, and space away from overstimulation. If something feels overwhelming, it’s likely a sign you’ve been holding too much on your own. Let this be a moment of emotional clearing rather than trying to stay productive at all costs.</p>



<p>The energy shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your partnership zone for the next four weeks. After the inward focus of early March, this transit brings renewed momentum in relationships. You may attract attention, feel more direct about your needs, or experience fresh energy with a partner or collaborator. Just be mindful of the shadow of Venus in Aries: impatience or reacting quickly instead of responding thoughtfully. When you balance honesty with consideration, this period can bring exciting new movement in your connections.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week brings a shift from emotional intensity into something lighter and more life-giving. On March 2nd, Mars enters fellow Water sign of Pisces, activating your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, you may feel inspired to reconnect with what actually makes you happy, not what you think you should be doing. Old passions, creative ideas, or even people from the past could resurface. Let yourself play, flirt with new possibilities, and follow what feels emotionally energizing rather than forcing productivity.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo activates your friendship and community zone, bringing a turning point within your social circle or long-term goals. You may realize you’ve outgrown certain dynamics, taken on too much responsibility for others, or been stretching your energy too thin trying to keep everyone happy. Virgo energy asks you to be honest about where your time and emotional labor are going. If a group situation shifts or a connection fades, trust that it’s creating space for more aligned support.</p>



<p>The mood turns more focused on daily life when Venus enters Aries on March 6th, activating your work, health, and routine sector for the next four weeks. This transit brings motivation to get your life organized, improve your habits, or take a more proactive approach to your physical well-being. Just watch the shadow of this fiery energy: doing too much too fast and burning yourself out. Small, consistent actions will take you further than an all-or-nothing approach. Balance discipline with the playfulness Pisces season is encouraging.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week pulls your energy inward, asking you to focus less on the outside world and more on your emotional foundation. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your home, family, and inner stability zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this area of life is under deep reflection. You may feel more sensitive to your environment, revisiting family dynamics, living situations, or the emotional patterns that shape your sense of security. Instead of pushing outward for new adventures, this is a time to strengthen your roots and create a space, physically and emotionally, that actually supports you.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major turning point in your career and public life. Something around your responsibilities, reputation, or long-term direction may reach a culmination or reality check. If you’ve been overworking, carrying too much pressure, or trying to meet everyone’s expectations, this eclipse may reveal where adjustments are needed. Virgo energy here is about sustainable success, not burnout. Focus on what’s essential and release the pressure to do everything perfectly.</p>



<p>The mood shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters fellow fire sign Aries, activating your romance, creativity, and joy sector for the next four weeks. After the emotional heaviness of early March, this transit brings a welcome spark of fun, confidence, and playfulness. You may feel more flirtatious, inspired, or ready to say yes to experiences that light you up. Just be mindful of impulsiveness or chasing excitement without considering the follow-through. When you balance spontaneity with intention, this energy can reignite your passion for life.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the pace of life picks up mentally and emotionally this week, but the key is not trying to manage everything at once. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your communication, learning, and daily logistics zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your mind may feel busy but not always linear. Conversations, plans, or short-term projects may need revisiting rather than pushing forward. Old emails, unfinished ideas, or past contacts could resurface. Move slowly, double-check details, and give yourself extra time to process before committing.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a turning point around your long-term vision, travel plans, education, or belief systems. You may realize that a path you’ve been pursuing isn’t sustainable, or that your goals need refinement to match your current reality. Virgo energy here asks for practical alignment rather than blind ambition. If something shifts or gets delayed, treat it as a course correction, not a failure.</p>



<p>The emotional tone softens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your home and emotional foundation zone for the next four weeks. This transit encourages you to focus on comfort, personal space, and the relationships that make you feel safe. You may feel motivated to refresh your living environment or spend more time with family. Just watch the shadow of this energy: reacting quickly to emotional triggers. Creating stability now comes from slowing down, not trying to control every outcome.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week brings your focus back to the basics, but in a way that asks for emotional honesty, not just practical strategy. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your money, self-worth, and values zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your finances and your relationship to security are under review. Motivation around earning or stabilizing your resources may come in waves, but progress now comes from reassessing, not rushing. Old income ideas, pricing structures, or financial conversations could resurface. Move slowly and make decisions based on what feels sustainable, not just urgent.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a deeper emotional turning point around shared resources, debts, or energetic entanglements. This eclipse may reveal where you’ve been overextending yourself financially or emotionally, or where a dependency dynamic needs to shift. Virgo energy asks for clarity, boundaries, and practical solutions rather than avoidance. If something feels intense, focus on what you can organize, repay, renegotiate, or release.</p>



<p>The energy lightens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your communication and social zone for the next four weeks. After the heavier financial and emotional themes, this transit brings confidence in your voice and a desire to reconnect, share ideas, and move more freely in your day-to-day interactions. Just be mindful of speaking impulsively or reacting too quickly. When you combine honesty with a little patience, this period can open doors through conversations you’re brave enough to initiate.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, you’re the main character of the sky right now, and the energy this week feels personal in every sense of the word. On March 2nd, Mars enters your sign for the next six weeks,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects""> joining Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces. You may feel a surge of motivation, emotion, and sensitivity all at once, like your inner world is louder than usual. Mars here isn’t about pushing harder, it’s about moving with intention and honoring your intuition before you act. With Mercury retrograde, this is a time to recalibrate your identity, your direction, and even how you present yourself. If your energy feels inconsistent, that’s your cue to rest, reset, and move only when something truly feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your partnership zone, bringing relationship truths to the surface. Lunar eclipses reveal what’s out of balance, and this one may highlight where you’ve been overgiving, overfixing, or holding yourself to impossible standards in your connections. Something in a relationship dynamic could shift, clarify, or reach a turning point over the next few weeks. Virgo energy asks you to release the need to control outcomes and instead focus on healthy boundaries, mutual effort, and emotional honesty.</p>



<p>The mood shifts on March 6th, when Venus leaves your sign and enters Aries, activating your money and self-worth zone for the next four weeks. After weeks of emotional processing and personal focus, this transit helps you reconnect with your value, your confidence, and your ability to attract resources. Just watch for impulsive spending or tying your worth to external validation. The real glow-up now comes from knowing your value first, then letting opportunities match the energy you’re embodying.</p>

<p>After more than 10 years in beauty, I’m usually the go-to for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare recommendations</a> in my friendship circle. But if the past few months are anything to go by, they’ve been the ones schooling me, because lately, there’s only one brand on their lips — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fbrand%2Fmedicube"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">and it’s Medicube</a>. </p>



<p>Skincare enthusiasts — or anyone whose thumbs are never far from their TikTok feed — probably already know (and love) the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare brand</a>, which launched in South Korea in 2017. But it’s managed to cut through the noise (read: the tens of other brilliant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aestura-atobarrier-365-cream-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean brands</a> that have also made their way into <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ulta Beauty</a> and <a href=""https://amzn.to/4rFMdiR"">on Amazon</a>) to become one of the most talked-about and exciting names in the space. No, really. At a recent Medicube event, I’ve never seen my fellow editors more intrigued by a brand — specifically the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED Booster</a>. (They didn’t care that they were wearing makeup; the handy red-light tool went straight on their faces.) </p>



<p>With spring right around the corner, my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> was in need of a complete overhaul, so I swapped everything out for a full collection from Medicube. Here are all the products I’d recommend. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore Pad, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961481.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is one of Medicube’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top-reviewed products at Ulta</a> and the one I was most excited to try. First off, I love that it comes with a handy pair of tweezers, which makes light work of picking up each pad — a very helpful addition if you have long nails like I do. The pads themselves — 70 of them, by the way — are soaked in two exfoliating acids. </p>



<p>First up, 4.5% lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that exfoliates the top layer of skin. This gentle acid makes skin smoother and brighter over time by chipping away at dead skin cells and fading hyperpigmentation. Besides exfoliating, it also boosts hydration. Then there’s 0.45% salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). While also gentle, it seeps deeper into pores, breaking up the paste-like mix of oil and dead skin that contributes to pimples. One side of the pad is smooth, while the other is slightly rougher for manual exfoliation.</p>



<p>Happily, because the acids are relatively low in concentration, the pads don’t sting, even on my reactive skin, and they can be used daily. I’ve been using them for over three weeks at night, and I realized they really worked magic on my skin when I caught myself in my apartment mirror one evening and saw my skin literally glinting under the warm light. It’s a lot clearer and smoother, too. One thing I’m not sold on is the name. Pores are completely normal — you can’t shrink them or get rid of them. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-collagen-gel-mask-pimprod2053540"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Collagen Gel Mask, $19.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961478.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>These masks spotlight one of K-beauty’s most promising ingredients: PDRN. Without turning this into a biology lesson, it stands for polydeoxyribonucleotide — essentially DNA derived from salmon. Research suggests PDRN can <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11994882/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">help regenerate skin tissue</a>, promoting healing, reducing inflammation, and increasing collagen, the protein that keeps skin strong and supple. </p>



<p>I’ve been using one mask a week for a month, and the main difference I’ve noticed is how much more hydrated and juicy my skin looks afterwards — so much so that I don’t feel the need to follow with any other skincare. If you’re after that “glass” effect, this will definitely help you get there. I also love watching the mask shift from pink to transparent, a sign that your skin has drunk up all the goodness. Beyond the hydration boost, it’s simply a nice, relaxing ritual. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcollagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream, $22</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961507.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is my new favorite AM and PM moisturizer. As for the texture, the clue is in the name — it’s a transparent jelly rather than a gel-cream. I underestimated it, convinced it wouldn’t be enough to quench my thirsty cheeks and occasionally flaky forehead, plus keep pimples at bay, but my skin always feels smooth, hydrated, and comfortable. </p>



<p>It takes a second to stop feeling tacky, but the finish is matte, and it makes the perfect makeup primer. While I don’t necessarily believe topical collagen can boost your own supply, I do know it’s a fantastic hydrator — especially alongside moisturizing squalane and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oil-reducing niacinamide</a>. </p>



<p>I use this everywhere: under my eyes like eye cream, down my neck, and on the backs of my hands. I’m also really impressed by how much you get for the price. The tub houses an impressive 110ml of product. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-sa-clear-capsule-facial-deep-cleanser-pimprod2054911%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore SA Clear Capsule Facial Deep Cleanser, $16.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961480.jpg?width=996&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=249%3A256"" /></figure>



<p>I’ve gone through two of these cleansers in recent months, and I’m almost certain my skin is clearer because of it. Like the Zero Pore Pads, it contains exfoliating acids — salicylic and mandelic — both of which help unclog pores and gradually fade post-acne marks. While it also contains tiny exfoliating particles, they’re very soft, and I barely notice them.</p>



<p>Happily, the second ingredient on the list is glycerin, a deeply moisturizing humectant, so it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. Since it’s a foaming face wash, I only use it in the evening after removing makeup with micellar water. In the morning, I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prefer something creamy and gentle</a> to avoid stripping my skin. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-peptide-serum-pimprod2053536"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961508.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>If you really want to maximize the benefits of PDRN, this gentle daily serum is your best bet over a one-and-done face mask (though the mask is undeniably fun). Alongside PDRN, it contains no fewer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">five peptides</a> — short chains of amino acids that form the building blocks of proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep skin bouncy. </p>



<p>The inclusion of palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is what makes it stand out. Together, they’re often dubbed “Botox in a bottle” and can help smooth skin texture over time. Since slotting it into my routine, I’m convinced my forehead lines look less obvious — at least to my eye. The matte finish helps, too, and means makeup glides on like a dream. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbooster-pro-pimprod2053433%3Fsku%3D2645355"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Booster Pro, $220</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961503.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This tool has all my beauty editor peers talking. There are four modes in total. First up, Booster Mode, which gently vibrates to help your skin better absorb your chosen moisturizer or serum. Second, MC Mode, which uses low-level microcurrent technology to stimulate facial muscles, giving skin a temporary “lift.” Third, Derma Shot Mode, which uses red <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED light</a> to encourage healing and support elasticity. Lastly, Air Shot Mode is designed to refine texture and pores. Personally, I don’t think it’s strong enough to actually exfoliate, but it does feel like a refreshing cool shot — especially nice if your skin gets inflamed or red after cleansing. </p>



<p>The catch? Consistency is key. You’ll only see results if you stick with it. I like to use the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red and blue light modes</a> for five to 10 minutes at a time when I have large hormonal pimples. I’m convinced it helps reduce their size and ease the soreness. </p>

<p>We’re diving into the biggest handbag trends that we’re seeing translate from the runways to our favorite stores and the streets.<br /><br />Looking to both the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">Spring/Summer 2026</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Fall/Winter 2026 collections</a> that debuted across global fashion weeks, we’ve narrowed down the most prominent handbag styles on showcase. For the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hilary-duff-nostalgia-concert-tour"">nostalgia lovers</a>, 2016-esque chain bags are having a major moment. For the those with traditional-with-a-twist aesthetics, undone-yet-ladylike bags are in. And for those who could never understand how people carry mini bags, spacious bowling bags are a popular choice.<br /><br />All of these trends build on our up-to-the-minute dispatch on the runway trends that we saw at Winter 2026 New York Fashion Week, as well as our forecasting of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">top 2026 color trends</a>, best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">denim silhouettes</a>, and emerging <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">shoe styles</a> to step into throughout the year.<br /><br />Ahead, see the purse shapes, fabrics, hardware, and colorways that some of our favorite designers have sent down their runways — cementing them as the handbag trends we’ll be seeing (and wearing) all year long.  </p>

<h2>2016 Is Back &amp; So Are Chain-Strap Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960941.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The mass nostalgia for 2016 is also infiltrating today’s fashion scene, and quickly. “Crossbody bags defined this era,” creative director and celebrity stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/scotlouie/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scot Louie</a> tells Refinery29. “Think: The Gucci Marmont and Dionysus, the Chanel Boy Bag, Valentino Rockstud… Bags from this era are tied to a moment when fashion felt expressive, visible, and communal, which is why they resonate again now.”<br /><br />Also of note? These bags all feature chain straps. And while chain-strap handbags have never really left Chanel’s runway (yes, they were prominent at the <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/chanel-spring-2026-couture-1238526043/chanel-spring-2026-couture-56/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2026 Spring Couture show</a> just weeks ago), more brands are embracing the old-school style, too. From Valentino’s chunky shoulder bags and Chloe’s frilly leather pouches to Stella McCartney’s XL totes and Ferragamo’s oblong clutches, chain straps are popping up across your favorite brands and on all types of bags.<br /><br />Why the nostalgia push? Self-declared Chief Bag Officer and creator of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/y2kbags/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@y2kbags Instagram account</a>, Alejandro V has a simple explanation: “All of us who once aspired to wear those designer pieces now actually have the means to purchase them — hence why the 2016 aesthetic has come roaring back in rapid-fire fashion!” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Under-Arm Candy: Oversized Clutches</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960945.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Keep your shoulders free from the weight of your belongings and instead opt for an oversized clutch that can comfortably nestle under your arm. Many models carried these bags during the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, though the details varied. Designers are leveraging luxe leather, feathers and fringe, and belted and buckled silhouettes to update your typical <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">wedding guest</a> clutch. In other words, they aren’t exclusively meant for eveningwear attire.<br /><br />“Holding onto something so precious just feels fabulous and chic,” says Alejandro V. “I truly believe clutches are forever and should never go out of style — but I’m very happy they’re having a major comeback moment.” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Woven Leather Bags (All Year Long) </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960948.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/woven-bag-baskets"">Woven leather bags</a> seem to peek out of people’s wardrobes in the spring and summer, so there’s no doubt that they’ll be everywhere again when the weather gets warmer. The most recent Fashion Month, however, has made a case for the versatility and timelessness of this high-quality style.<br /><br />“The Bottega Veneta influence here is undeniable,” notes Alejandro V. “From Daniel Lee to Matthieu Blazy, they did an incredible job reintroducing this silhouette and reminding people how timeless it really is. We’re at a point where consumers understand that great design can live forever.” <br /><br />Louie agrees — though he notes that the target market is shifting slightly, too. “There will also be more emphasis on men wearing bags, which continues to shift how these silhouettes are styled and perceived,” he said, giving a particular shoutout to a certain movie star and noted Bottega Veneta lover. “Thank you Jacob Elordi.”<br /><br />A woven bag — whether finished in leather or suede, and shaped as an oversized shoulder bag, utilitarian tote, or a trend-forward bucket bags — can tag along for nearly any activity. (I personally wear a woven suede tote as my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-bags-for-women"">work bag</a> throughout the year!) “You can dress it up or down, and there’s even the idea of passing it on someday as a family heirloom,” Alejandro V suggests. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Unzipped “Ladylike” Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960943.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">“ladylike” trend</a> as a whole re-emerged in 2025, the ladylike bag specifically will shine in 2026, top handles and all. There’s a crucially modern update at play, however: The traditionally dainty style (typically featuring a single strap or handle) is now being reimagined with unzipped, unclasped, and undone details.<br /><br />“I think this ties back to the [Hermès] Kelly being such an eternal icon — the ultimate single-strap, ladylike bag,” explains Alejandro V. More signature styles like the Dior Lady Bag have new interpretations too, like the <a href=""https://www.dior.com/en_us/fashion/news-fashion-shows/folder-news-and-events/dior-cigale-bag"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cigale bag</a>. You’ll also find the unfastened, single-strap style across Loewe, Fendi, and Toteme’s collections.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>(Non-Leopard) Animal Print Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960940.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Animal prints</a> will likely never go out of style, but there are points when they’re especially in vogue. Such patterns have been all over the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, most frequently presented through handbags. Even more interestingly, leopard print isn’t the most popular choice Instead, zebra and tiger prints, snakeskin, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cowhide</a> dotted several designers’ collections — and they’re far more versatile than you may think.<br /><br />“Most animal prints are basically neutrals,” Alejandro V notes. “You can wear tiger and zebra print with almost anything! Cheetah, obviously. Or giraffe print à la early Dooney &amp; Bourke.” Typically available in neutral color palettes, these prints can be paired with your favorite wardrobe stapes to add a pop to any outfit.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>From The Office To The Alley: Doctor &amp; Bowling Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960942.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Spacious and structured handbags have solidified themselves as the trend of all trends to carry around. On the runways, they’ve predominately popped up in leather, suede, and even snakeskin variations, and silhouettes ranging from the professional-looking house <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-summer-2025"">doctor style</a> to the sportier <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-spring-2025"">bowling bag</a>.<br /><br />These boxy and/or bulbous bags are perfect for all-day wear, though they’re particularly useful as your work bag. “These bags fit everything—and then some,” says Alejandro V. “A book, an iPad, a Hydro Flask… it’s truly the perfect chic little schlep bag without feeling overwhelmingly massive.” In other words, gone are the days of mini bags (though we’re sure that won’t last very long). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Playful Pastel Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960946.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>There isn’t just one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">trending color</a> that will cement itself as a 2026 handbag must-have. Instead, a rainbow of pretty pastels will be taking over. Expect to find <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellows</a>, baby pinks, mint greens, lilac purples, and frosted blues across every handbag category (including in some of the trending styles seen above ). See: The pale yellow cylindrical shoulder bags at Coach; the pink, purple, and blue pouches at Prada; as well as the pink lady bags and yellow quilted chain bags at Dior.<br /><br />Pastel purses will no doubt make their biggest presence during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-roller-rabbit-collaboration-lookbook-shop"">the spring months</a>, but they can also add unexpected brightness to fall and winter outfits that need a bit of cheering up. </p>

(L to R) Devonta Anderson, Brittany Wicker in episode 1008 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of the most popular topics of discussion on the internet is the “<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-kaleidescope/202507/is-male-loneliness-a-new-epidemic-or-an-age-old-struggle"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Male Loneliness Epidemic.</a>”  Many refer to it as the reason we have  <a href=""https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/alpha-male-podcast-bros-and-their-grip-on-young-minds/163897/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Alpha male” podcasts</a> and an increasing number of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red pill-type content targeted towards Gen Z</a> and Gen Alpha young boys. Women are noticing that the men they date are participating in and exhibiting behaviors that make them very unlikeable and undatable. Loneliness is a serious subject, but when paired with misogyny and contempt towards women, it has become a punchline. When a woman posts about a bad dating experience or a <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/i-love-my-husband-who-hates-me.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wife posts about</a> her careless and clueless husband, the jokes ensue. After each of these instances, I think the same thing:<em> straight men are simply not lonely enough. </em>The bar is on the floor, and these men can’t even meet that low standard. Maybe loneliness is what they deserve. </p>



<p>Watching this season of<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11854927/love-is-blind-season-8-diversity"">Love is Blind</a>,</em> I am beginning to understand the male loneliness epidemic more and more. In the last batch of episodes of the dating reality series, I watched these men unravel and say things to their fiancées that were deeply concerning. The humiliation ritual masquerading as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-is-blind-couples"">reality show</a> that we all binge-watch with glee is back with <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/love-is-blind-season-10-cast-instagrams"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Season 10, set in Ohio.</a> As <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2023/04/11340331/love-is-blind-4-couples-therapy"">Love Is Blind</a> </em>grows, there is always the question: “Are these people here for the right reasons?” I think there are better questions like, “are these men ready for commitment at all?”, “are they truly ready to let another person into their lives?”, and “are they willing to actually do the work it takes in a relationship?” For all of the aforementioned questions, the answer is giving a glaring no. Don’t they know this show is supposed to end in marriage?  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-season-10-keya-kevan-tyler-love-triangle-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kevan is a great example</a> of someone who is not ready for the commitment that this experiment requires. His indecisiveness puts him in a love triangle with Tyler and Keya. In Episode 4 during the pods (the part of the series where couples are not allowed to see each others’ faces yet), Kevan says that he needs to “do the mature decision,” because he wants the “best for everybody” and “doesn’t want to let anybody down,” which made me roll my eyes and wish he would make up his mind. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Overall, the men on this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">podcast </a><em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">What’s the Reality</a></em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">? </a>with<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ad-love-is-blind-red-flags""> LIB Season 6 contestant AD</a>, Tyler revealed that what we didn’t see was Kevan’s admission that he was not ready to be married, and saying that if he were her, he would run. So, she did. All of Kevan’s flakiness led both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vDBrw6KIgE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tyler and Keya to leave him</a> in the pods. Throughout those episodes, Kevan seemed like he just didn’t want to lose the game he was playing. </p>



<p>In the pods, Emma was very vocal about <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/love-is-blinds-emma-addresses-awkward-kid-talk-with-mikes-parents-excl/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">not wanting kids</a>, but her fiancé, Mike, kept trying to convince her she would be a great mom. He even explained this to her family by using the nonsensical analogy that if she can take care of a puppy, she can take care of a baby. This man should be alone until he can listen to a woman’s choices and respect them.  It was baffling when, in the same scene, Mike said he was open to what Emma wants, then backtracked and said having kids was non-negotiable. If it was so important to him, he should not have proposed to Emma. Mike said he was really banking on Emma her changing her mind and that he thought he could be the one to change it, if she could just see his “passion for wanting kids.” This is disrespectful to her wishes and a waste of both of their time.  <strong>  </strong></p>



<p>In true <em>Love Is Blind </em>fashion, many couples are having issues revolving around their physical appearances and the men feeling disappointed that the women they chose are not their “type.” We’ve seen this before on <em>Love is Blind</em>. We saw it in Season 2 with Shake &amp; Deepti and in Season 3 with Bartise &amp; Nancy. Of course, we know that people are human and physical attractiveness does matter in a relationship, but the show is called LOVE IS <em>BLIND</em>. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961368.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. Alex Henderson in episode 1008 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>This season, this dilemma plagues three couples: Brittany and Devonta, Ashley and Alex, and Jessica and Chris. Brittany consistently told Devonta she didn’t feel secure in their relationship because he was not physically and verbally affectionate. He excused the distance by saying he was dealing with the death of his grandfather (who <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427931/love-is-blind-season-10-why-devonta-broke-no-phones-rule-in-pods"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">passed while the show was being filmed</a>). But Devonta also revealed that Brittany is not his physical “type” and that he has never dated a woman of color. Brittany is Black and Latina. When I interviewed Brittany, I asked how she felt watching the episodes back and hearing how Devonta felt about her and she said that in the back of her mind she felt Devonte’s distaste towards her.  Don’t worry girl, we could all feel it too. Devonta seems to be a self-hating mess and should be in therapy, not on reality TV. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The worst man of all is Chris. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Ohio, Ashley told <a href=""https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/02/25/love-is-blind-alex-henderson-donald-trump-vote/88707804007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">self-proclaimed Trump supporter</a> and alleged<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindNetflix/comments/1r8bj6t/i_think_alex_is_a_con_man/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> scammer Alex</a> that their intimacy was lacking. She brought up that they had not been intimate since arriving home from Mexico. He told her he was the one who initiated physical intimacy in Cabo and that now it was her turn. He then went on to say he was unaware that he could initiate sex with her while she is on her period. AGAIN, MEN AREN’T LONELY ENOUGH. Alex spends a majority of Episode 10 gaslighting Ashley because he can’t keep his story about his past exes straight. While Alex reassured Ashley that he is attracted to her, he told her to her face that she is not his typical “type” which is a horrible thing to repeatedly tell your partner. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961381.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. (L to R) Chris Fusco, Jessica Barrett in episode 1009 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>The worst man of all is Chris. By now, you’ve probably seen <a href=""https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/love-is-blind-chris-fusco-crossfit/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the scene that has gone viral</a>. It shows Chris sitting across from his partner Jessica, a doctor, and telling her that he is not attracted to her because <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/chris-tells-jessica-hes-used-to-dating-women-who-work-out-all-the-time/1393006055935790/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she doesn’t work out enough</a>. The audacity of this man. In the scene, Chris says to Jessica that he is not enjoying their sex life because he’s, “used to girls who do Pilates every day.” Mind you, in my opinion, Chris is a short five (and that’s being generous) with tiny hands, and Jessica is a hot doctor. </p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Chris also tells Jessica that he might be happier with Bri because he is more attracted to her. The more he explains himself as the episode goes on, the more openly disrespectful he becomes toward Jessica. He even loudly confesses to Bri and the other girls that Jessica was the worst sex he has ever had. Later in the evening, Chris even makes a sad attempt at reconciling with Jessica. He continously tries to get her to know he wasn’t trying to be mean all the while not understanding why what he said was so hurtful. Chris deserves worse than loneliness.  </p>



<p>Overall, the men in this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. The <em>Love Is Blind </em>casting directors need to find men who actually <em>like</em> women. We live in a time when <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/07/trump-spurs-global-rollback-rights-women-and-girls"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">women’s rights are being stripped </a>away, when <a href=""https://counciloncj.org/new-analysis-shows-8-increase-in-u-s-domestic-violence-incidents-following-pandemic-stay-at-home-orders/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">domestic violence is on the rise</a>, and when even in our highest moments, we <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/25/distasteful-joke-us-hockey-star-hilary-knight-responds-to-trump-comments-on-womens-team"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">become the butt of the joke</a>. At the very least, we want to be able to enjoy our silly dating reality show without having to watch men degrade and disrespect the women they supposedly love.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Watching this season, it feels as though the men would rather treat the women more like experiments than human beings. They expect the women to bend, break, and mold themselves into who they want them to be, instead of seeing them for who they are and accepting the women they spent time getting to know in the pods. These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. I would rather all of them just tell the truth and say, “This is not for me. I have some work to do.”   </p>



<p>At the end of these episodes, it is clear these men are not ready for marriage, for falling in love at all, or for considering their partners’ needs and wants. We have one more week before the wedding episodes and I hope Emma, Ashley, and Brittany follow Jessica, Keya, and Tyler’s lead and run for the hills!  There may be a male loneliness epidemic, but Season 10 of <em>Love Is Blind</em> is proving that maybe men are not nearly lonely enough. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>March opens like a dream you’re half-awake inside. Mars enters Pisces, and suddenly motivation doesn’t look like grinding harder, it looks like following a feeling, a nudge, a quiet “this way.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and Venus finishing her time in Pisces, the pace of life may feel slow, foggy, or oddly emotional. Plans drift, conversations may get blurry, and your energy comes in waves. Instead of forcing clarity, March begins by asking you to move differently… the vibe is softer, more intuitive, a little less obsessed with productivity and a little more curious about what your energy is actually trying to tell you.</p>



<p>Then comes March 3rd, when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> delivers a reality check with a highlighter and a to-do list. Virgo energy doesn’t care about the aesthetic of your life, it cares about what’s sustainable. This eclipse may expose burnout, perfectionism, control habits, or the quiet anxiety that comes from trying to hold everything together alone. Think of it less as chaos and more as a cosmic edit. Something inefficient, draining, or overcomplicated is ready to be simplified. If emotions spike, it’s probably because something in your life has been running on “I’ll deal with it later” for way too long.</p>



<p>The energy shifts noticeably after March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, bringing heat back into a very watery sky. Desire gets louder. Confidence comes back online. People start saying what they actually want instead of hinting. And on March 10th, momentum returns for real as Jupiter turns direct in Cancer after nearly five months retrograde. This is timeline acceleration energy. Opportunities that stalled begin moving. Emotional growth you’ve been doing quietly starts showing tangible results. If the first part of the year felt like therapy, this is where the plot starts moving again.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the New Moon in Pisces closes the eclipse chapter on a much gentler note. Where February’s Aquarius eclipse felt like a sudden break or shock (especially with its tense square to Uranus), this Pisces New Moon forms a harmonious connection to Uranus. Translation: the change sticks, but it feels supportive now. Less disruption, more alignment. Many people will notice emotional closure, creative clarity, or a quiet realization of how much they’ve actually grown. This new moon sets the tone for the next six months, and it carries a rare kind of hope… the grounded kind, not the delusional kind.</p>



<p>Then the real reset arrives. On March 20th at 10:46 a.m. EST, the sun enters Aries, marking the equinox and the start of the astrological new year. Even better? Mercury stations direct at 3:33 p.m. EST (yes, the numerology is doing the most). If the Fire Horse year that began in February felt like it hadn’t fully kicked in yet, this is the ignition. Energy moves forward. As the month closes, Saturn in Aries forms a supportive sextile to Pluto in Aquarius, signaling structural change behind the scenes… the kind that fuels real-world revolution. From immigration justice to protecting children from abuse to collective movements demanding accountability, this is slow power organizing itself. March ends on a softer note, though: Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, where she thrives. Comfort, stability, pleasure, and tangible love return. And honestly? After the emotional marathon of eclipse season, that kind of beauty feels earned.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, if you’ve been trying to push through exhaustion, anxiety, or that low-level feeling of being “on edge for no reason,” March is the month your body calls a meeting. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo lands in your wellness realm, and it’s less about dramatic endings and more about honest ones. Something about your daily rhythm, workload, or mental health habits has reached its limit. You might realize you’ve been running on adrenaline instead of alignment. This isn’t a failure moment, it’s a recalibration. What needs to be simplified? What actually supports you instead of just making you feel productive? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Eclipse season is peaking</a>, and for you, the real power move is choosing sustainability over burnout.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the Pisces New Moon deepens a story that’s been building all month, especially with Mars moving through Pisces, your spiritual and healing zone. Translation: your energy isn’t meant for constant output right now, it’s meant for emotional processing, closure, and quiet breakthroughs that nobody else sees. You may feel more sensitive, more reflective, maybe even a little nostalgic. Lean into it… rest is productive. Therapy, journaling, long walks, random crying that actually feels good after… all valid. This new moon helps you release old emotional weight so you’re not dragging it into your next chapter.</p>



<p>And that next chapter? It arrives loud and clear. When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, it’s your solar return, your personal new year, and honestly, a full rebirth moment. After weeks of slowing down, clarity starts to click. Your energy comes back online, your confidence returns, and people notice you again. Just remember what the first half of the month taught you: your power isn’t just in your drive, it’s in your self-awareness. Move forward boldly, but don’t abandon the softness you fought to reclaim. This time, you’re not just starting over, you’re starting wiser.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this month is asking you to get honest about where your joy has started to feel like pressure. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, bringing a turning point around what (or who) truly lights you up. Something may culminate in your dating life, a creative project, or even your relationship with your inner child. If you’ve been performing happiness instead of actually feeling it, the eclipse will make that impossible to ignore. The lesson isn’t to control the outcome. It’s to release the need for things to look perfect and let your joy evolve into something more real, even if that means closing a chapter you once loved.</p>



<p>As the month unfolds, the emotional tone deepens. The March 18th Pisces new moon, amplified by Mars moving through Pisces all month, activates your friendship and community zone. You’re rethinking who you want around you, what spaces feel aligned, and where your energy actually grows instead of gets drained. Some Taurus placements may feel pulled to step back from certain social circles, take a quiet social media break, or reconnect with people who feel safe and inspiring. This isn’t isolation, it’s refinement. And because this new moon forms a supportive sextile to Uranus in Taurus, the changes you make now can feel surprisingly liberating, helping you step more confidently into a version of yourself that feels authentic, future-oriented, and unapologetically different.</p>



<p>When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, the energy turns inward, beginning a deeply restorative period for you. Think closure, healing, and tying up emotional loose ends before your birthday season arrives next month. You may crave more solitude, more sleep, more time to process everything this eclipse season stirred up, and that instinct is worth honoring. This is your cosmic reset phase. And as the month closes, Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, bringing your ruler home and turning the spotlight back on your magnetism, confidence, and capacity to attract what you’ve been quietly preparing yourself to receive.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, March is less about moving faster and more about realizing which direction is actually worth your energy. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lands in your home and emotional foundation zone, bringing a turning point around living situations, family dynamics, or your inner sense of stability. Something may culminate, shift, or simply become impossible to ignore. If you’ve been pushing through without tending to your emotional needs, this eclipse calls a timeout. You don’t need to have everything figured out. You just need a space, physically or emotionally, where you can exhale and be honest about what security actually looks like for you now, not what it looked like before.</p>



<p>Career and visibility become the deeper storyline as the month unfolds. With Mars moving through Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your professional zone, asking you to dream bigger about your path, but also to align your ambitions with meaning. You might feel pulled toward work that feels more creative, compassionate, or purpose-driven, even if the practical steps aren’t fully clear yet. This is less about forcing momentum and more about letting a new vision take shape. And because the energy has been slower, more reflective, you may notice that opportunities or ideas coming in now feel more intuitive than strategic. The real turning point arrives on March 20th, when the sun enters Aries, kicking oﬀ the astrological new year, and your ruler Mercury finally stations direct after its retrograde.</p>



<p>For you, this feels like mental fog lifting almost overnight. Conversations that stalled begin moving again. Decisions that felt confusing start making sense. Plans for your future, your community, or your long-term goals gain traction. The key is not to rush just because the momentum returns. You spent the past few weeks reassessing your direction for a reason. Now, you get to move forward with clarity instead of just speed.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this month begins with a truth you can’t scroll past or emotionally sidestep. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your communication and mindset zone, bringing a culmination around conversations, decisions, contracts, or the way you’ve been speaking to yourself. Something you’ve been overthinking, postponing, or sugarcoating reaches a turning point. You might finally say what you’ve been holding in, receive news that shifts your perspective, or realize that your mental load has been heavier than you admitted. If your anxiety spikes, that’s your cue to simplify. Not everything deserves your emotional bandwidth. Choose clarity over people-pleasing and honesty over emotional buffering.</p>



<p>Zooming out, this is a growth month for you. With Mars moving through Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your expansion zone, pushing you toward new horizons in travel, education, publishing, or entrepreneurship. But this isn’t chaotic growth. It’s intuitive growth. You may feel drawn to learn something new, share your voice more publicly, or take a leap that feels spiritually aligned, even if it doesn’t make perfect logical sense yet. Because Mars has been energizing this area since the start of the month, this new moon feels like the green light to act on the vision that’s been quietly building.</p>



<p>Momentum really returns on March 20th, when the sun enters Aries, lighting up your career and legacy zone, and Mercury stations direct the same day. After weeks of emotional processing and big-picture reflection, things start moving forward professionally. Conversations about promotions, launches, visibility, or leadership may finally gain traction. The energy shifts from “What do I want my life to feel like?” to “Okay… let’s make it real.” Just remember, Cancer, your power this month isn’t in pushing harder. It’s in trusting that when your emotional alignment is right, your external progress follows.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, March opens with a reality check that’s less dramatic than you expected and more empowering than you realized you needed. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a culmination around income, pricing, spending habits, or the way you’ve been valuing your time and energy. Something becomes very clear: where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or tying your worth to external validation. This eclipse isn’t here to stress you out financially, it’s here to recalibrate your standards. Think less “budget panic” and more “CEO energy.” What stays, what goes, and what actually reflects your value now?</p>



<p>At the same time, there’s deep emotional movement happening under the surface. With Mars in Pisces all month, the March 18th Pisces new moon activates your intimacy, healing, and shared-resources zone. Because Mars has been stirring this area since early March, you may already be processing trust issues, financial entanglements, emotional bonds, or old fears around vulnerability. This new moon helps you reset the story. It’s about merging wisely, not blindly. Whether that looks like restructuring debt, deepening a relationship, starting therapy, or finally releasing emotional baggage, the energy supports transformation that feels intentional instead of overwhelming.</p>



<p>Then the mood lifts. On March 20th, the sun enters Aries, opening up your expansion and adventure zone, and Mercury stations direct the same day. Plans around travel, education, publishing, or a bold new direction start moving forward again. You’ll feel your confidence return, but this time it’s grounded in the emotional and financial clarity you just gained. And honestly, Leo, that’s the glow up this month is really about: not louder confidence, but quieter certainty that you actually know your worth and where you’re headed next.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this month’s March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in your sign is personal, powerful, and, if we’re being honest, a little exhausting. You’ve been part of the Virgo–Pisces eclipse storyline for nearly two years, and this moment feels like a turning point in how you see yourself. Something about your identity, your habits, or the version of you that’s been operating on overdrive is ready to be released. For many Virgos, the hardest part isn’t the change itself, it’s letting go of the need to control the outcome. This eclipse asks you to loosen your grip, to trust that not everything needs to be optimized or analyzed before it unfolds. What feels like disruption is actually liberation. You’re not losing control, you’re outgrowing the pressure to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Two weeks later, the March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your partnership zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month and the North Node is already pulling you toward deeper emotional growth here. This isn’t just about romance, though love could absolutely be part of the story. It’s about rewriting your patterns around closeness, boundaries, and receiving support. If you’re used to being the reliable one, the fixer, the emotionally organized person in the room, this lunation asks you to name your needs and let someone meet you there. This is one of the most powerful resets for love, connection, and mutual care that you’ve had in years, but only if you allow vulnerability to be part of the equation.</p>



<p>By the time Aries Season begins on March 20th, kicking off the astrological new year, the focus turns toward emotional courage and deeper transformation. You may feel less interested in surface-level dynamics and more drawn to honesty, intimacy, and energetic alignment in every area of your life. This season pushes you to release what drains you, financially, emotionally, or energetically, and invest your time where there’s real reciprocity. The version of you emerging now isn’t the one who manages<br />everything perfectly. It’s the one who trusts their timing, their intuition, and their worth enough to stop carrying what was never theirs to hold in the first place.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, if the past few weeks have felt like an emotional detox you didn’t exactly sign up for, you’re not imagining it. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo activates your rest, healing, and closure zone, bringing something behind the scenes to a turning point. Old stress, quiet resentment, burnout, or even a pattern of overgiving without replenishing yourself may come to the surface now. This isn’t a dramatic external eclipse for you, it’s an internal one. Your system is asking for less noise, less pressure, and more honesty about what you’re carrying that no one else even sees. If you feel the urge to pull back, sleep more, or cancel plans, listen. This is release work, not retreat out of weakness.</p>



<p>The March 18th new moon in Pisces resets your wellness, work, and lifestyle zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, building momentum around your habits, energy levels, and boundaries with your time. This is your chance to redesign your schedule so it actually supports your nervous system instead of draining it. Because the North Node is also in Pisces, this isn’t just about productivity, it’s about alignment. Where are you overcommitting? Where are you saying yes out of obligation instead of capacity? Small changes made now, to your routine, your workload, or your self-care, can shift your entire quality of life over the next six months.</p>



<p>By the time Aries Season begins on March 20th, marking the astrological new year, your attention turns fully toward relationships. This is your partnership zone lighting up, and after the emotional clearing you’ve been doing, the dynamic between you and others may start to look different. You’re entering a period of renegotiation, not necessarily conflict, but honesty about needs, effort, and balance. The key is to bring the same energy you’ve been learning privately into your connections: clearer boundaries, clearer communication, and less people-pleasing. The version of you stepping into this next cycle isn’t here to keep the peace at your own expense, it’s here to create relationships that feel peaceful for you too.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this month opens with a reminder that your future is changing because your circles are changing too. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lights up your community, friendship, and long-term vision zone, bringing a turning point around who you’re aligned with and where you’re headed next. Some connections may naturally drift, a group dynamic could shift, or you might realize a goal you’ve been chasing no longer fits the person you’re becoming. This eclipse isn’t about isolation, it’s about alignment. If something feels like it’s falling away, it’s likely making space for people and opportunities that actually match your current frequency, not your past one.</p>



<p>As the emotional dust settles, the energy gets sweeter, lighter, and honestly, more fun. The March 18th new moon in your fellow Water sign of Pisces activates your romance, creativity, and joy zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, already stirring your desire to express yourself more freely. The North Node here suggests this isn’t just a mood, it’s growth. You’re learning how to take pleasure seriously again, whether that means dating, creating, performing, flirting with life, or reconnecting with your inner child. This is one of the best new moons of the year for opening your heart, but the real magic happens when you stop waiting for the “right time” and let yourself be seen as you are.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks in, your focus shifts toward your daily life, work rhythms, and physical energy. The question becomes: <em>how do you build a lifestyle that supports the version of you that’s emerging? </em>This is where inspiration meets structure. You may feel motivated to change your schedule, set stronger boundaries around your time, or commit to habits that protect your energy instead of draining it. Just be mindful of the shadow here, trying to do everything at once and burning out in the process. This season isn’t about proving your strength. It’s about creating a routine that lets your strength last.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, March opens with a moment that puts your public life under a very real spotlight. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your career, reputation, and long- term direction zone, bringing a culmination around your work or the role you’ve been playing in the world. A project may wrap up, recognition could arrive, or you might suddenly realize that a path you’ve been pushing toward doesn’t actually reflect who you are anymore. This eclipse isn’t here to create chaos, it’s here to clarify your definition of success. If something shifts or ends, it’s because you’re outgrowing performative ambition and moving toward purpose-driven direction.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, your emotional foundation is also being rewritten. The March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your home, family, and inner-security zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been in Pisces all month, stirring movement around living situations, boundaries with family, or your need for a space that truly feels like yours. With the North Node here, this isn’t just logistical, it’s emotional growth. You’re learning what stability actually means for you, not what it’s supposed to look like. Whether that means redecorating, relocating, repairing a family dynamic, or simply protecting your peace more intentionally, this new moon supports creating a life that feels safe enough for your next chapter to grow.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th, kicking off the astrological new year, the mood shifts dramatically, and you’ll likely feel it immediately. Your creativity, confidence, and romantic energy come back online. After the heavier emotional and professional recalibrations of early March, this season reminds you that life isn’t just about responsibility, it’s about joy, expression, and taking risks that feel exciting again. Just watch the shadow of overcommitting to every opportunity or chasing thrills without pacing yourself. The real power of this moment is choosing what actually lights you up and putting your energy there, instead of scattering it everywhere just because you can. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, March begins by widening your perspective, whether you asked for that expansion or not. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in fellow earth sign Virgo activates your growth, travel, education, and belief zone, bringing a turning point around the direction you see your life heading. A plan may change, a mindset you’ve relied on could be challenged, or you might realize you’ve outgrown a path that once felt secure. This eclipse isn’t here to destabilize you, it’s here to stretch you. If something shifts unexpectedly, the deeper question isn’t “How do I control this?” but “What new possibility is trying to open that I couldn’t see before?”</p>



<p>At the same time, your day-to-day world is getting busier, faster, and more emotionally charged. The March 18th new moon in Pisces resets your communication, learning, and local environment zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been moving through Pisces all month. Conversations that have been building finally move forward, ideas gain momentum, and your schedule may fill up quickly. With the North Node here, this isn’t just about staying busy, it’s about using your voice differently. You’re learning to communicate with more intuition, more softness, and more honesty instead of defaulting to efficiency or restraint. What you say, write, or share now could shape your path over the next six months.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks in, your attention shifts inward toward home, family, and emotional stability. This energy can feel tense at times, since Aries forms a challenging angle to your sign, bringing pressure around where you live, how you rest, or how much responsibility you’re carrying for everyone else. The growth here is learning that strength doesn’t mean holding everything together alone. If emotions run higher or domestic matters demand your attention, it’s an invitation to build a foundation that actually supports you, not just the version of you who keeps everything running. This next chapter isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about making sure the life you’re building has space for you inside it.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, March opens with a deeper emotional storyline than you might normally prefer to sit with. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> activates your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglement zone, bringing a turning point around trust, finances, or energetic exchanges. Something may come to light about who or what you’ve been investing your time, money, or emotional bandwidth into. This eclipse isn’t about loss, it’s about balance. If a dynamic feels heavy, one-sided, or draining, it’s asking to be renegotiated or released. The real growth here is recognizing that independence doesn’t mean avoiding vulnerability, it means choosing connections that feel safe and reciprocal.</p>



<p>The energy then shifts toward rebuilding your sense of stability and self-worth. The March 18th new moon in Pisces activates your income and values zone, and it’s amplified by the fact that Mars has been moving through Pisces all month, already stirring movement around your finances, spending habits, or how you price your time and talent. With the North Node here, this isn’t just about making more money, it’s about aligning your work and income with your actual worth. Opportunities could emerge over the next six months, but the real reset starts internally: what you believe you deserve, and what you’re no longer willing to undervalue.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks off, your pace picks up quickly. Your communication, networking, and daily movement zone comes alive, bringing more conversations, ideas, short trips, and opportunities to connect. You may feel mentally energized and ready to move things forward after a slower, more reflective start to the month. Just be mindful of the shadow of Aries here, saying yes to everything and scattering your energy. The power of this season isn’t in doing more, it’s in choosing the conversations, projects, and connections that actually move your life in the direction you’ve been quietly preparing for.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this month is personal, defining, and a little bit emotional, even by your standards. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lands in your partnership zone, bringing a turning point in a close relationship or in the way you show up in one-on-one dynamics. A connection may deepen, shift, or reach a moment of truth where the balance between giving and receiving becomes impossible to ignore. This isn’t necessarily about endings, but it is about clarity. Where have you been overextending, accommodating, or hoping someone would meet you halfway without actually asking for what you need? This eclipse pushes you toward healthier reciprocity, even if the conversation feels uncomfortable at first.</p>



<p>Two weeks later, the new moon in your sign on the 18th marks a powerful personal reset, and it carries extra weight because Mars has been in Pisces since the beginning of the month, building your momentum, confidence, and drive. With the North Node also in Pisces, this isn’t just another birthday-season intention moment, it’s a six-month turning point in your identity and direction. You may feel the urge to change your look, your routine, your goals, or even the way you introduce yourself to the world. The energy is asking you to stop waiting for permission and start acting like the version of you you’ve been imagining.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks off, your focus shifts toward money, stability, and self-worth. After such a personal reset, the question becomes practical: how do you support this new version of yourself financially and energetically? Opportunities to increase income, renegotiate your value, or take your talents more seriously may start to appear. Just watch the shadow of impulsive spending or jumping too quickly into financial risks. This next chapter’s about building something steady that reflects the confidence you’re finally stepping into.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961267.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead</em></strong>: There’s a moment in <em>56 Days</em> when the show’s central con is revealed: Ciara (Dove Cameron) didn’t meet Oliver (Avan Jogia) by chance at the supermarket. She planned it. She’d been watching him, taking <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bring-back-physical-photo-albums"">photos</a>, keeping notes. She orchestrated the entire encounter to get close to a man she had reason to hate. By any definition, this is manipulation. This is the setup for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/what-is-love-bombing"">love bombing</a> scenario, or worse. And yet, by the end of the show, we’re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together. To build a life and to have their happy ending.</p>



<p>Dove Cameron is aware of this contradiction. When asked directly if audiences will excuse the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/green-flags-not-red-flags-dating-relationships"">red flags</a> both characters exhibit, she doesn’t hesitate: “I don’t think they’ll excuse any of it. They shouldn’t.” But then she pauses, because she knows what actually happens.</p>



<h3>The attractiveness loophole</h3>



<p>There’s this recurring theme in <em>56 Days</em>: one where Oliver does something genuinely alarming, or Ciara reveals another layer of her deception, and the camera lingers on their faces. Both of them are beautiful, the tension is unbearable, and somewhere in that moment, the audience’s moral objections start to soften.</p>



<p>“I don’t think the audience will completely brush it off,” Cameron says when asked about whether attractiveness gives characters a pass. She’s repeating herself because she knows it’s not true. Or rather, she knows the nuance: audiences <em>shouldn’t</em> excuse it, but they will. “But I do think they’ll start to excuse it more and more as it is clear that they’re both exhibiting red flags,” she continues. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I think when the playing field gets more levelled, it’ll be like, oh, so these two are just fucked up. They’re perfect for each other.</p><cite>DOVE CAMERON</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This is the moment the show wins; the psychological shift happens for the audience when both people are compromised equally. When neither one is the victim, and neither one is the villain, audiences stop trying to pick a side. And in that refusal to judge, they actually end up rooting for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/dating-trends-tinder-2026"">relationship</a>, not despite the red flags, but because of them.</p>



<h3>The con works because we want it to</h3>



<p>Ciara’s plan to get revenge on Oliver, the man she believes destroyed her family, doesn’t survive first contact with reality. She falls for him, or she decides to love him anyway. The show intentionally leaves this deliberately ambiguous. But what’s not ambiguous is what happens next: she kills his abusive therapist to protect him and then she chooses him and they run. Oliver, meanwhile, carries his own devastating secret: he killed someone in high school and let his best friend take the fall. Oliver’s been living a lie his entire life, with his abusive therapist weaponising that secret to control him.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961024.png?width=1024&amp;height=538&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A269"" /></figure>



<p>Neither of them is redeemable in any conventional sense; both have done deeply unforgivable things. And yet the show ends with them together, with a child, living in hiding. Not because they’ve been punished or because they’ve atoned, but because they’ve chosen each other.</p>



<p>That confusion in that inability to pin down who’s hurting whom, who’s the predator and who’s the prey, is precisely where the audience’s judgment collapses. We’re not meant to figure it out; we’re meant to accept the ambiguity, and we do. Because they’re beautiful and they’re damaged in interesting ways, where we as the audience almost want to save them. But to be blunt, that’s because they’re hot and the chemistry between them is undeniable.</p>



<h3>The moral we’re actually learning</h3>



<p>The uncomfortable truth <em>56 Days</em> presents is this: we say we want to identify red flags and that we want to protect ourselves from manipulation. But when presented with two attractive, deeply flawed people who are essentially destroying each other and everyone around them, we don’t actually want to look away, and we don’t necessarily want them to be held accountable.</p>



<p>Cameron’s honesty about this is refreshing. She doesn’t pretend the show is teaching us something virtuous. She doesn’t argue that we <em>should</em> root for these characters. She just acknowledges what’s actually happening: “I think that’s when we’ll get into a zone of more, like, I have no idea who’s got the upper hand here.” Jogia agrees and goes further. “You can have all the red flags in the world, but sometimes it doesn’t matter who they are,” he says. “In some cases, they usually go hand in hand with a real connection.”</p>



<p>Jogia points out that he’s not saying to ignore the flags, he’s highlighting that the presence of red flags doesn’t automatically disqualify a relationship from being real. That genuine feeling can coexist with genuine danger, and that when both people are compromised, when both are beautiful and broken in the same ways, the red flags become almost irrelevant to whether we believe in the connection. We reach a point where the question of who’s manipulating whom stops mattering. And at that point of moral surrender, the show achieves something genuinely dark: it makes us complicit in the fiction that love, real, genuine love, can exist in a space of pure mutual corruption.</p>



<p>Maybe it can. Maybe that’s even true in real life, sometimes. But <em>56 Days</em> doesn’t let us off easy by pretending it’s beautiful. It just shows us that we’ll accept it anyway. As long as everyone involved is attractive enough.</p>
