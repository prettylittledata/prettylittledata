There’s so much to love about autumn: the crisp air brushing against our skin, the kaleidoscope of crunchy leaves under our boots, and the scent of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">pumpkin and spiced candles</a> drifting through homes, cafés, and bookshops. It’s the season of cozy dinners, pumpkin patch adventures, spooky nights with friends and family — and, of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">timeless fall outfits</a>.<br /><br />And nothing complements the warmth of turtlenecks, blazers, and cardigans quite like a leather handbag. This season, some of our favorite brands have released stunning collections of satchels, totes, mini bags, crossbodies, and weekenders in rich browns, deep reds, forest greens, and burnt oranges. <br /><br />Whether you love the polished feel of genuine leather built to last, prefer reimagined pieces crafted from recycled materials, or choose vegan alternatives to lighten your carbon footprint, we’ve curated our favorite fall handbags from Latine-owned and Latin American-operated brands that embody craftsmanship, culture, and style.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

The PETA Award-winning brand crafts handbags from premium vegan leather materials like polyurethane, which not only look and feel like genuine leather but are also cruelty-free, eco-conscious, and designed to minimize environmental impact.<br /><br />Right now, I’m loving the Rue Burgundy Recycled Vegan Top Handle Bag. This structured bag features a deep burgundy recycled vegan leather exterior, a sturdy top handle, and a detachable crossbody strap for versatility. Meanwhile, gold-tone hardware, a zip-top closure, and a roomy interior make it as functional as it is gorgeous. Its warm, rich color and classic silhouette make it the perfect accessory to complement fall’s warm layers and seasonal tones.<br /><br /><strong>Melie Bianco</strong> Melie Bianco's Rue Burgundy Recycled Vegan Bag, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meliebianco.com%2Fproducts%2Frue-burgundy-top-handle-bag&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Ffall-leather-handbags-latine"">Melie Bianco</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1042"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938123.png?auto=webp&amp;width=914&amp;height=1042&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=457:521"" width=""914"" /><figcaption>The biggest fashion trends often start in Black and Latine communities, so it’s no surprise that <a href=""https://madebyciriaco.us/"">CIRIACO</a>, the asymmetrical it-bag of the moment, was born in the Bronx, New York, from Black Dominican-American designer Ashley Ciriaco. Handcrafted in premium vegan and genuine leathers and sustainable materials, the self-taught designer resists the fast-fashion cycle, creating bold, statement handbags that are ethically made and built to last.<br /><br />Currently, I can’t get enough of the Woven Ashley Minimalist Baguette. Its rich brown woven leather, sculptural crescent silhouette, and structured top handle make it a perfect companion for fall. Whether tucked under your arm at a coffee shop or draped over a blazer for evening outings, it’s a statement piece that will add warmth and sophistication to any autumn outfit.<br /><br /><strong>Ciriaco</strong> Ciriaco’s Woven Ashley Minimalist Baguette, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmadebyciriaco.us%2Fproducts%2Fwoven-ashley-minimalist-baguette"">Ciriaco</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1220"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938157.png?auto=webp&amp;width=890&amp;height=1220&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=89:122"" width=""890"" /><figcaption>After quitting her corporate fashion career in 2020, Puerto Rican-born designer Mónica Santos Gil founded <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsantosbymonica.com%2F&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Ffall-leather-handbags-latine"">Santos by Mónica</a>, a New York City-based brand celebrated for sustainable apparel and handbags crafted from cactus leather. Collaborating with Desserto, a Mexico-based supplier of plant-based materials, each piece is handmade to order in the U.S.<br /><br />Sustainable and timeless, the Agave Triangular Tote in Green is perfect for the cooler months. Its triangular silhouette and structured body make it both visually striking and practical, while the rich forest-green cactus leather adds a warm, autumnal touch.

From the beginning, Nicole’s goal was to create a brand that was 100% Mexican — and she has. From suppliers to leather craftsmen to metal workers, every one of her small-batch collections is made entirely in her home country. For her, this ensures that “every collection and every bag is truly única.”<br /><br />If you’re looking for a new staple for your closet, I’m currently obsessed (no, literally) with the Carolina Bag in Merlot. This bold, ‘90s-inspired shoulder bag combines style and functionality. Despite its compact size, it offers ample space for all your essentials. Crafted from high-quality full-grain cowhide leather and featuring 24k gold-dipped hardware, the Carolina Bag stands out while complementing any outfit. Its rich Merlot hue adds a polished touch, making it perfect for year-round wear, especially during the autumn months when deep, warm tones are in vogue.<br /><br /><strong>Única Leathers</strong> Única Leathers' Carolina Bag in Merlot, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funicaleathers.com%2Fcollections%2Fbags-more-bags%2Fproducts%2Fthe-carolina-bag-in-merlot"">Única Leathers</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1184"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938131.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1068&amp;height=1184&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=267:296"" width=""1068"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcuyana.com%2F&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Ffall-leather-handbags-latine"">Cuyana</a>, a San Francisco-based fashion brand, gets its name from a Quechua word meaning “to love,” honoring co-founder and CEO Karla Gallardo’s Ecuadorian roots while signaling to buyers how much they’ll cherish wearing its pieces.<br /><br />While Cuyana creates stunning clothing and jewelry, it is best known for its timeless leather bags. This fall, the brand launched the Forma Satchel, a gorgeous and functional bag crafted in Turkey from Italian pebbled leather with a soft microsuede lining. Designed to carry your essentials with ease, its spacious interior fits laptops, water bottles, phones, and even a change of shoes, making it ideal for day-to-night wear or travel as your personal item.

Driven by a deep concern for the environmental impact of the fashion industry, her brand <a href=""https://matergea.com/"">Matergea</a> utilizes plant-based and bio-based materials such as cactus leather, fique fiber blended with coffee waste, and fabrics made from hemp, organic cotton, recycled cotton, and PET bottles. Meanwhile, its accessories feature handles crafted from tagua (vegetable ivory), bamboo, jute, and wicker.<br /><br />This autumn, I’ve got my eye on the Senda Purse Coffee Grains Waste Handle. This elegant piece is crafted from a unique blend of fique fiber and coffee grain waste, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional leather. The purse features a distinctive handle made from repurposed coffee grains, adding a touch of eco-conscious luxury. Its rich, earthy tones make it a perfect accessory for the fall season, complementing cozy sweaters and warm hues.

Drawing inspiration from their family’s passion for fashion, they established Esthera with a vision to create handbags that transcend the ordinary. Like the brand's name, derived from “estrela” — Portuguese for “star” — the designers want users to feel exceptional while wearing their pieces.<br /><br />Esthera’s debut collection, AM | PM, captures the essence of daily life and is made to transition from day to night seamlessly. Each bag is named after specific times of the day. My fave is the 4PM Mini Handbag in Caramel. This structured leather bag boasts an architectural design with a cubic silhouette and precise proportions. It features organic cutouts inspired by the hourglass, Esthera’s signature symbol. Crafted from premium leather, it’s finished with tubular handles that adapt comfortably to the wearer, allowing it to be carried by hand or worn over the shoulder. Meanwhile, the rich caramel hue adds a warm, autumnal touch. <br /><br /><strong>Esthera</strong> Esthera's 4PM Mini Handbag Caramel, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Festhera.com%2Fproducts%2F4pm-mini-handbag-caramel&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Ffall-leather-handbags-latine"">Esthera</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3600"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938257.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=3600&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://bysentient.com/"">SENTIENT</a> was founded in Mexico City by Jimena Suárez Ibarrola, a Mexican environmental lawyer turned ethical fashion entrepreneur, with a vision to reshape what it means to wear luxury. The name Sentient underscores a core belief that all beings — human or animal — can feel, and that beauty in fashion shouldn’t require cruelty of any kind. <br /><br />All its pieces are handmade by skilled artisans in Mexico, using “next-generation” vegan materials like cactus leather, bamboo leather, apple leather, and other plant-based alternatives. The materials are chosen to reduce water usage, pesticide impact, and carbon emissions compared to conventional leather. <br /><br />My favorite fall look from SENTIENT’s timeless collection is the Panthera Tote in Olive Green. This structured tote is crafted from cactus leather, giving it a firm silhouette that holds its shape beautifully. The olive green tone feels warm yet versatile, making it ideal for autumn’s camel trenches, cream knits, and rich terracotta tones. The bag features dual shoulder straps and clean lines, offering both elegance and everyday functionality while elevating your seasonal look.<br /><br /><strong>Sentient</strong> Sentient's Panthera Tote in Olive Green, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbysentient.com%2Fproducts%2Fpanthera-tote-olive-green-desserto"">Sentient</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3722"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938140.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2515&amp;height=3722&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2515:3722"" width=""2515"" /><figcaption>Founded by queer Mexican designer Alejandro Miramontes, <a href=""https://sangredemar.com/"">Sangre de Mar</a> is a handbag and travel accessories brand that embodies the vibrant spirit of Mexico’s Pacific coastlines. Growing up in Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta, Miramontes joined his mother as a runner, helper, and salesperson for her leather goods business, selling leather jackets, belts, bags, and more. “Those experiences not only shaped my creative spirit, they gave me an unshakable respect for creativity, resilience, and the power of building something from nothing.” <br /><br />After working in the corporate fashion industry in Mexico, he moved to Vancouver, Canada, driven to design leather pieces inspired by both his mom’s resilience and Mexico’s coastal beauty. That’s when Sangre de Mar was born. Crafted from recycled and plant-based leathers, each piece is designed to last and created with respect for the land, the people, and the ocean that inspired it.<br /><br />This fall, Sangre de Mar is adding a new color to its Riviera Weekender: a deep, warm orange reminiscent of fallen leaves and seasonal pumpkins.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937942.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Melissa Butler, founder of <a href=""https://www.target.com/b/the-lip-bar/-/N-hw51c"">The Lip Bar</a>, knows what it’s like to experience failure — and on a <em>very</em> public level, too. When her inclusive beauty brand was three years old, she went on a national reality TV show to pitch The Lip Bar to a panel of investors…only to be told that her business would never grow. “They were so mean to us, they were so cruel. They said, ‘One of the big guys would crush you like the colorful cockroaches you are,’” she says in the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, recounting that devastating moment. “A lot of people have praised me for continuing: What gave you the courage to keep going forward? And I tell them: ‘I didn’t start my business for them, so I wasn’t going to end it for them.’”</p>



<p>Now, a decade later, The Lip Bar, is hugely successful, with its line of shades that complement *and* celebrate dark-skinned women available on the shelves at <a href=""http://target.com"">Target </a>nationwide. But Butler credits her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) education for preparing her for the realities of entrepreneurship, for helping her develop the fortitude to keep going and to strive for excellence, and for equipping her with the tools to ultimately succeed.</p>



<p>As a graduate of Florida A&amp;M University, Butler says that the competitive spirit at her school inspired her to push herself. “HBCUs remind you that there are no handouts, that you will have to work twice as hard,” she says. “Everyone knows that HBCUs are fun, for sure, but HBCUs have a unique ability to prepare students for the real world, and that’s the beauty of an HBCU — there’s that perfect balance.”  </p>



<p>And that’s precisely the subject discussed at length in the most recent episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, done in partnership with Target. Butler is joined by Kathleen Newman-Bremang, the senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29 (who went to a Predominantly White Institution); Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered (who attended a PWI that was really an unofficial HBCU), and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered (who’s a proud HBCU alumna). </p>



<p>Listen to the podcast in its entirety to learn more about Butler’s story (and how she learned more from her time as a student at her alma mater than on Wall Street), the unique cultural experience that is Homecoming at an HBCU, and so much more. </p>

<p>I count down to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11741501/bridgerton-michaela-stirling-francesca-queer-backlash"">new season of <em>Bridgerton</em></a> like football fans count down to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11853433/super-bowl-lix-parties-recap-new-orleans-2025"">Super Bowl</a>. They are 108 and 118 days away, respectively. The official release date for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11860364/bridgerton-season-4-netflix-black-characters""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4</a> was just announced so now we know that on January 29, 2026 — with part two dropping in February —  we’ll get to see the romance play out between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Benedict (Luke Thomspon)</a> and his new love interest <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha)</a>. We’ve already watched <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10243310/bridgerton-netflix-sex-scenes-daphne-actress-interview"">Benedict’s older sister Daphne</a> burn for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10244470/bridgerton-review-blackness-representation"">Simon the Duke of Hastings</a>, his big brother <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10926918/bridgerton-season-2-review-sex-chemistry"">Anthony find love</a> with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCj2XlHVGI"">bane of his existence</a> and object of all his desires Kate Sharma, and his little bro <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96vIHgSgwU"">Colin take a memorable carriage ride</a> and trip down the aisle with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview"">Penelope aka Lady Whistledown</a>. Throughout those seasons, Benedict was the aloof middle brother, too busy drinking too much and partaking in gender-indiscriminate dalliances to want to settle down. That’s all going to change in January, starting with a masquerade ball and a chance meeting. </p>



<p>Fans of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview""><em>Bridgerton</em> books</a> have been waiting patiently for Benedict and Sophie’s story since theirs is considered one of the strongest of Julia Quinn’s storylines. And even if you aren’t a <em>Bridgerton</em> book truther, Benedict has consistently been one of the most intriguing characters on the show. He hasn’t found much romantic luck so far, but he also hasn’t wanted to. He’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview"">a queer king</a> who’s been prioritizing freedom over commitment. What will make Sophie the person that changes his mind? And how will <em>Bridgerton </em>incorporate Sophie and her family — the first major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/11/11813897/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">East Asian characters</a> — into its cinematic universe? </p>



<p>Below, here’s everything you need to know about <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4, including the plot, release date, teaser trailer, and what the cast and crew have said about the upcoming season. </p>



<h2><strong>How did <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 3 end? </strong></h2>



<p>At the end of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982332/bridgerton-season-3""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 3</a>, Colin (Luke Newton) and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) have worked through the issue of Penelope being the town gossip who repeatedly sullied the good Bridgerton name with her pen — as a fellow petty bitch, I am a Penelope apologist — and Colin refusing to see his best friend as the baddie she is, and are finally happily married with a baby boy. After ditching Lord Debling and getting well acquainted with the woman in the mirror, Penelope reveals herself as Lady Whistledown and realizes the value in the writing empire she has built. In Julia Quinn’s <em>Romancing Mister Bridgerton</em>, this reveal also marks the end of Lady Whistledown’s column. While the future of Whistledown is unclear in the show, the Queen and Penelope seem to come to an understanding.“If [the Queen] affords me the chance to continue, I aim to wield my quill more responsibly,” Penelope says in the final episode of Season 3. “What is life without a little gossip?” the Queen responds and it’s safe to assume that Penelope Bridgerton will be allowed to keep writing. </p>

<p>As for the other budding romances, at the end of Season 3 <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11738825/bridgerton-season-3-lady-danbury-storyline"">Lady Danbury</a> gives her blessing for Lady Violet Bridgerton and her brother Lord Marcus Anderson to stop staring at each other longingly and actually start dating –  her reasoning being that she owes Violet for that time she had sex with her dad (a plot point from prequel series<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/queen-charlotte-a-bridgerton-story-review-race""> <em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that I’m still trying to forget). Francesca and her new husband Sir John Kilmartin are headed to his estate in Scotland with Eloise and his cousin, Michaela Stirling (a character gender swapped from the books). My faves Anthony and Kate are headed to India to have their baby because <s>Jonathan Bailey and Simon Ashley are booked and busy</s> Anthony sweetly says he wants his children to know that part of their heritage. The Mondrichs, the only Black couple in the BCU, have mostly adjusted to their newfound wealth and status and — thank god — are as happily married as ever.</p>

<p>Season 3 ends with Benedict breaking up with Lady Tilley Arnold after a threesome with her friend Paul Suarez. Lady Tilley catches feelings for Benedict (if there’s one thing we know about the Bridgertons, they got that good D) but he’s just finally figuring out his sexuality and exploring himself so he opts to stay single and enjoy his freedom. </p>



<h2><strong>What is the plot of <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s what we know from the season’s official logline: “The fourth season of <em>Bridgerton</em> turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” In a teaser clip released from the season, we learn that the mysterious Lady in Silver is<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4""> Sophie Baek</a> (<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Yerin Ha</a>) and when they meet at Lady Bridgerton’s famed masquerade ball, Benedict is immediately down bad. In this Cinderella story, Benedict (with the reluctant help of his sister Eloise), sets out to find his masked lady. The twist: Sophie is actually a maid working for the lady of the house,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview""> Araminta Gun (Katie Leung). </a></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938185.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. (L to R) Isabella Wei as Posy Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gao, Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s what else we know about the Season 4 plot, <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news"">thanks to Netflix</a>. Sophie Baek is “a resourceful maid for a demanding employer, disguises herself to attend Violet Bridgerton’s masquerade ball, where her life changes drastically after meeting Benedict Bridgerton.” As for Benedict: “While managing Bridgerton House’s affairs during Anthony’s honeymoon, Benedict, eager for new adventures, becomes the focus of Bridgerton’s fourth season, remaining reluctant to settle down unlike his married brothers, until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” </p>



<h2><strong>Which Bridgerton sibling is leading Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton</em> series diverged from the order of the books last season when they opted to focus on Colin and Penelope instead of Benedict. Now, it’s Benedict’s time. It’s exciting not just because Thompson has proven he is a wonderful actor and I’m betting the best leading man we’ve had since Anthony (Coughlan carried Newton last season) but also because it’s the first time we’re getting a queer lead character in a <em>Bridgerton</em> season.</p>



<p>“We had talked a lot in Season 1 and 2 about whether or not Benedict might be queer. But we felt like we didn’t want to just tell that story as a side story,” Showrunner <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-3-ending"">Jess Brownell says to Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “We wanted to give it a little bit more space, and we wanted to get to know the character and develop him first.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful… To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering.</p><cite>yerin ha to tudum on changing sophie’s last name </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Benedict has been developed and I think he is the most fully formed and fleshed out character we’ve had as a lead so far. As the seasons progress, that’s natural, but it’s also clearly an intentional choice from the creative team. While we don’t know yet who will be the lead in Season 5 (it’s a toss up between Eloise and Francesca), we do know that every single Bridgerton sibling will get their moment to shine. </p>



<p>“Everybody’s going to have a main arc every season,” executive producer Shonda Rhimes <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a41734448/inside-bridgerton-book-shonda-rhimes-betsy-beers-interview/"">tells Town &amp; Country</a>. “There’s going to be one for each one of the Bridgertons. We laid out the story in a way that felt right and necessary for us. And, eventually, every last one of those Bridgertons is going to have a love story.”</p>



<h2><strong>What has the cast said about <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 4? </strong></h2>



<p>One of the most exciting parts of this season will be the introduction of Baek and her family, the first East Asian family in <em>Bridgerton</em> history. And because of Yerin Ha’s casting, they changed the character’s last name from the books. “A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner… It’s a really nice way for me to feel like the role is fit for me, rather than me having to fit a certain mold. It’s amazing what it can do just in a psychological sense. So it means a lot that Jess did that for me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938186.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. Yerin Ha as Sophie Beckett in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ha is a Korean-Australian actor who starred in <em>Halo</em> for two seasons and will be seen in the upcoming prequel series <em>Dune: Prophecy. </em>Playing Ha’s employer Lady Araminta Gun and the “evil stepmother” equivalent in the Cinderella archetype is Katie Leung, but Leung swears her character is just misunderstood. “I would never call her evil because I adore her — I think she’s absolutely fabulous. She’s just heavily misunderstood,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">Leung says to Refinery29</a>. “But if there’s anything that I can say, I mean, the costumes. They’re always brilliant on that show, but hers are something else.” </p>



<p>Along with the costumes, we can’t wait to see the dynamic between Lady Araminta Gun and Sophie play out. What we know so far is that Sophie is going to have some challenges, and her working for Lady Gun will be one of them. “What drew me to Sophie was that she immediately has obstacles — something that she constantly has to overcome,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Tudum</a>. “Whether it’s this battle around social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict.”</p>



<p>Speaking of Benedict, here’s what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Thompson says about the new season</a> to Shondaland: “The main thing we can expect is that it’s a really nice mix of fairytale and reality. It’s a fairytale love story but it’s also got the Bridgerton element of trying to tether it to some sort of reality as well. We’ll see how that pans out.” Ha adds: “You can expect this an emotional tug of war, this push-and-pull between what their heart desires and what society desires for them.” </p>



<p>And yes, you can expect all your favorite Bridgertons to be back. Colin and Penelope will be deep in their happily ever after, according to what Luke Newton <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a60803762/bridgerton-season-4-penelope-colin-romance-nicola-coughlan-luke-newton-interview/"">says to Town &amp; Country</a>: “I’m excited for the happily ever after and to see what that brings… I have so much trust in Jess [Brownell, the showrunner] that it will always be interesting and always be exciting. That’s also the joy of being in the Bridgeton family: There’s always going to be drama. There’s always going to be something I get to help out with or causing mischief or whatever it is.”</p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong><em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32159989/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a></em> is a perfect Oscar-bait film. Filled with hefty dialogue, emotional scenes and topical questions, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/challengers-zendaya-josh-oconnor-mike-faist-interview"">Luca Guadagnino</a> draws out incredible performances from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/my-best-friends-wedding-julia-roberts-25-year-anniversary"">Julia Roberts</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/07/11919489/the-bear-sydney-ayo-edebiri-emmy-nominations-comedy"">Ayo Edebiri</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/men-hair-transplants-restoration"">Andrew Garfield</a>. The drama follows Yale University professor Alma Imhoff (Roberts), who is caught in the middle when her student protégée, Maggie Resnick (Edebiri) accuses Alma’s friend and colleague, Hank Gibson (Garfield) of sexual assault. For over <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">two and a half hours, <em>After The Hunt</em> is unrelenting, making audiences feel increasingly uncomfortable with its </span>blurred lines and unanswered questions. There’s no comic relief or light moments to take you away from the tough topics, which makes<em> </em>Guadagnino’s piece stick with you long after the credits have finished rolling.</p>



<p>Roberts and Garfield’s characters have a will-they, won’t-they style relationship throughout the film, with Hank making it clear that he adores Alma. While Alma is married to Frederik Imhoff (Michael Stuhlbarg), the pair eventually break into a round of passionate kissing near the end of the film. It’s raw and hard to watch, with Alma changing her mind halfway through and having to yell at Hank to stop and push him off her. </p>



<p>When <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> spoke to Roberts about <em>After The Hunt</em>, she surprised us by revealing the actors had decided not to use an Intimacy Coordinator for this scene. There was no nudity involved, which may have contributed to the decision. “They asked us if we wanted [an Intimacy Coordinator], I said no, Andrew said no,” Roberts explains. “Andrew and Luca and I had a lot of conversations, we had a lot of rehearsal that morning, and then Andrew and I, when we were back at the dorms where we get ready, he came to me and was like, you know, ‘Is there anything you are not comfortable with?’ And I said, ‘Between the two of us, I am completely at ease’.”</p>



<p>Guadagnino is famous for preferring fewer takes when it comes to making films, so Roberts and Garfield only shot one take of the scene. “All this conversation, and then it was like 35 seconds and then over. It was crazy,” Roberts adds.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>[Andrew] came to me and was like, you know, ‘Is there anything you are not comfortable with?’ And I said, ‘Between the two of us, I am completely at ease’.</p><cite>Julia Roberts on her Intimate Scene with Andrew Garfield</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The role of an Intimacy Coordinator was popularised in 2018, after the #MeToo movement took hold, and it focuses on keeping actors, directors and sometimes crew safer when it comes to intimate scenes. “An Intimacy Coordinator position interrupts the production power dynamics and provides a confidential space for actors, directors and producers to discuss concerns and potential barriers to consent,” Michela Carattini, SAG-AFTRA-accredited IC Trainer and Company Director of <a href=""https://www.keyintimatescenes.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Key Intimate Scenes</a> tells <em>R29</em>. “An intimacy coordinator provides risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies to support the actors, the director, the production, and in some cases, the crew. ‘Intimate scenes’ can vary in definition, but universally include scenes with simulated sexual activity (including sexual assault) and/or nudity.”</p>



<p>Carattini notes that in Australia, while it’s recommended to use an Intimacy Coordinator when there are intimate scenes, it’s not currently mandated. However, due to Screen Safe Australia adopting Australia’s National Intimacy Guidelines into Work, Health and Safety mandates, productions are left open to “negligence or duty of care claims” if anything goes wrong. </p>



<p>In terms of Garfield and Roberts’ decision to forgo using an Intimacy Coordinator on <em>After The Hunt</em>, Carattini says this can be “perfectly valid” depending on the circumstance. “The decision not to use an intimacy coordinator has to be made by the production, the director and all the actors involved in the intimate scene together, in terms of whether they are all willing to take steps to minimise risks. It is comparable to a decision not to use a stunt coordinator for a scene involving stunts,” she explains. “It is important to remember that the purpose of an Intimacy Coordinator’s work is to support consent, empowerment and safety. If those things have truly been supported for everyone involved, it is perfectly valid not to use an Intimacy Coordinator — although I grant it would be much harder for those without expertise to assess this accurately.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> It is important to remember that the purpose of an Intimacy Coordinator’s work is to support consent, empowerment and safety. If those things have truly been supported for everyone involved, it is perfectly valid not to use an Intimacy Coordinator.</p><cite> Michela CarattinI, SAG-AFTRA-accredited IC Trainer</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Some viewers may also wonder why you would consider an Intimacy Coordinator for a kissing scene without nudity or simulated sex, but Carattini says the question should always be asked. “Whether or not to use an Intimacy Coordinator for a kissing scene only is an open question, and very much depends on the director’s vision and the individuals involved. Each actor brings their individual history and lived experience, possibly including trauma, to their roles and with their bodies,” she tells us. “For some, kissing is less psychologically safe than simulated sex, and from a physical safety perspective, bodily fluids are being exchanged — which they are not for simulated sex without mouth to mouth kissing.”</p>



<p>On a film which broaches the heavy topic of sexual assault, it’s important that <em>After The Hunt</em> producers offered Roberts and Garfield the chance to work with an Intimacy Coordinator should they require it. The more normalised the position becomes, the more protected those who feel vulnerable or unable to speak up will be.</p>

It’s finally time for Target’s annual designer collaboration, and this one stands out from its most recent slate, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-kate-spade-collaboration-shop"">Kate Spade</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-diane-von-furstenberg-collaboration-lookbook"">DVF</a>. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has partnered with the nearly 200-year-old <a href=""https://www.woolrich.com/us/en/"">outdoor lifestyle brand Woolrich</a> on an ultra-cozy, adventure-ready, and dare we say: lumberjack-chic collection. <br /><br />Beyond buffalo-check womenswear and menswear — which Woolrich popularized — you can fully embrace your adventurous side out on the trails or in your humble abode with a range of Target-exclusive accessories, homeware, outdoor gear, and food and drinks. Think: <a href=""http://goto.target.com/55rXmn"">landscape-printed fleece zip-ups</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/GKWAoE"">sheep-covered pillows</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5GX"">binoculars</a>, and new <a href=""http://goto.target.com/2aDGXD"">maple syrup Kodiak pancake mix</a>.  So while Woolrich’s high-quality and durable apparel may typically cost you a pretty penny, this Target collaboration makes the heritage brand’s designs (and expanded categories) more accessible to a broader audience — with most price points falling under $40.<br /><br />“Woolrich x Target is all about fashion meeting function to help consumers embrace the outdoors in style,"" said Jill Sando, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, apparel &amp; accessories, home and hardlines of Target in a press release. ""From the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/e1zOBg"">Quilted Sheep Tote Bag</a> to the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/mOMDrD"">Buffalo Check Outdoor Wearable Throw</a>, to the amazing<a href=""http://goto.target.com/jebM2a""> inflatable kayak</a>, and so much more, I love how Target and Woolrich have worked together to create something that's fun and affordable.""<br /><br />The classic utilitarian aesthetics and functional features get a playful Target spin à la vibrant colorways, playful sheep graphics, printed reversible styles, and even a campaign shot in New York to show how Woolrich’s designs can translate into “modern urban style.” So whether you break up your buffalo check ""Pennsylvania tuxedo” with a graphic tee, cargo pants, or quilted skirt, you’ll look and feel confident taking on camping sites <em>or</em> bustling crowds. <br /><br />Woolrich’s creative director, Heekyun Kim, said in the release: ""This collaboration with Target represents an exciting opportunity to introduce our iconic designs, like our legendary buffalo check, to a new generation of explorers. We are proud to create a collection that honors our archives while making the Woolrich spirit of adventure accessible to all.”<br /><br />The collection officially drops on <strong>October 18</strong>, but you can preview the 100-plus item range now. And, for the first time, Target Circle 360 members can shop three limited-time styles — the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/nXM9ba"">Patchwork Plaid Throw Blanket</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/vPMoON"">Sheep Shaped Throw Pillow</a>, and <a href=""http://goto.target.com/N9LnmN"">Sheep Print Beanie</a> — <strong>between today and October 16 </strong>only.<br /><br />Click on to preview the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5xX"">Target x Woolrich collaboration</a>.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>Venus’s movement into Libra couldn’t be happening at a better time! The days between October 13th and November 6th is pivotal to shaping our relationships and emotions as we couple up and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moving-for-love-experiences"">look for lasting love</a> that fills us with optimism and happiness, whether it’s with another or for ourselves.<br /><br />Venus is extremely content in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-zodiac-sign-characteristics-personality-traits"">idealistic Libra</a>. This placement is the airy part of Venus, allowing us to be concise and direct about what we want — a desire for equitable partnerships. We are looking for someone with juxtaposing views and perspectives, allowing us to balance energy and find a middle ground. Opposites attract now, more than ever. </p>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11129292/venus-in-libra-september-2022-meaning-effects"">Venus flirts through Libra</a>, we’ll try to avoid conflict, which may be challenging. The universe promotes chill vibes, rizz, communication, and gentleness — so focus on centering the vibe. The best day to call these energies into our lives is November 1st, when Venus and the fortunate star Spica meet up in the sky, granting our wishes and bringing in magic. This particular celestial encounter happens once a year, so use it to your advantage by setting amorous intentions. The universe will provide, if you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifest your passions</a>.  <br /><br />A really special moment is when Venus creates a grand air trine with Uranus retrograde in Gemini and Pluto retrograde in Aquarius on October 14th. This energy will bring out our creative side and we will work hard to bring our artistry to the world. On a romantic level, we might find ourselves fighting for who we love the most, leading to stepping up our game and showing how much we care. Power struggles and manipulation tactics might appear in partnerships because we want to be in control. Step back and find an even playing field to make the relationship last.<br /><br />Not all is doom and gloom with this astrological transit. A grand air trine is a rare and magical aspect. To use it to one’s advantage, consider the type of friendships, family alliances, and romantic connections you wish to have. It’s essential to focus on who embraces your strengths and quirks (the same goes for your ideas about those you care for). Those who allow you to feel seen and understood are worth keeping around. Know that you are loved in all ways, especially for your wit, intellect, and personality above anything else.</p>



<p>Overall, Venus in Libra will be a whimsical time to embrace our affections and aspirations for a select group of special people or one individual in particular. Although we might not see it at first, this is a magical moment to make commitments and to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/define-the-relationship-advice"">define our relationships</a>. Yes, we may have to take a stand to assert our needs and defend our values, but doing that is a way to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">state our boundaries</a> and to ensure we aren’t being taken for granted. Love is a two-way street, and the person/people we are fawning over must reciprocate the sentiment; otherwise, we are outie. Don’t stress, because they will. Who can resist you?<br /><br />Important Dates: <br /><br /><strong>October 13th:</strong> Venus in Libra forms an opposition to Neptune retrograde in Aries. Watch out for misinterpretations of emotions and feelings of inadequacy. Don’t let delusions (especially those planted by gaslighters) guide your thoughts and heart. Know that you are fabulous. You deserve the best!<br /><br /><strong>October 14th:</strong> Venus in Libra links up with Uranus retrograde in Gemini, urging us to be more spontaneous and lighthearted. Break out of a rut by being open to novel approaches toward love and by being less codependent.<br /><br /><strong>October 14th:</strong> Venus in Libra gently trines Pluto retrograde in Aquarius, making us feel jealous and desirous at the same time. Use the cosmic energy to your advantage by healing and transforming dynamics.<br /><br /><strong>November 2nd:</strong> Venus in Libra squares Jupiter in Cancer, intensifying and expanding the need for commitment in our lives. Simply put: We want it all and won’t stop until we get it in matters of the heart.</p>

October is marked as a month of deep integration and refinement. After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/september-tarotscopes-solar-eclipse"">September’s eclipse season</a> brought a sudden transformation, we’re left standing in a new landscape — stripped of illusions, but holding unexpected treasures. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solar-eclipse-in-aries-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Eclipse energy</a> is notorious for clearing that which cannot follow us forward, and this month is about understanding what was removed, what was revealed, and what has been gained in the process.<br /><br />This is not a season of rushing. It is a season of processing, polishing, and integrating. Think of October as a pause where we gather the fragments, sift through the rubble, and realize which pieces of gold were buried in the dust. It is in this month that the vision becomes clearer, sharper, and more honest. Utilize this month’s tarotscopes to help you gain further clarity over what has transpired, what is still being put into place, and what is still needed to be released. <br /><br />May these scopes help you align with your highest path.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938002.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />This month is about being intentional with selecting specific communities to align with in this next chapter<strong>.</strong> The eclipses cleared out false alliances, leaving you with the partners, mentors, and communities that truly see your vision and support your glow up. It has revealed to you the importance of collaboration, community, networking and vocalizing your ideas. The 3 of Pentacles asks you to let others add value to your work, polishing your craft through synergy instead of solo effort. It is also a period of building something stronger and sustainable, what you envision can come to fruition through the help of others that can add on value.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938003.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Sun</h2></strong><br /><br />October brings you sudden revelation after the intensity of eclipse season. With The Sun, illusions fall away and the light returns, illuminating where you’ve been hiding and where your true joy lies. This is a month of refreshing clarity. You’re being shown what is real, what is lasting, and what is only shadow. This can be a time when you stand up for yourself more than ever; your authenticity is not only magnetic but life-changing. Allow your radiance to be seen, celebrate yourself and your progress, and trust in the blessings unfolding. What remains in your life is meant to be. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938005.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />This month is instilling a new level of wisdom, patience, and presence. The aftermath of the eclipses has reminded you that sometimes you must let the Universe take the wheel rather than force your own plans and agenda into place. October isn’t about speeding ahead but rather finding the comfort, grace, and clarity in slowing down and paying extra attention to the magic in the present moment. You will be carried to where you want to go, but the route will be much more different than you anticipated. Trust the process. There are reminders about what you must resume and be consistent in, and other areas of your life that are calling for an extra dose of discipline and dedication. Show devotion to yourself and let the magic unfold organically.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938006.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: Queen of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Your gift this month is the ability to cut through illusions and distinguish the truth from the noise surrounding you. The eclipses have shown you where you’ve been carrying dead weight or entertaining half-truths, and now the revelation is undeniable: you thrive when you lead with precision, honesty, and boundaries. This is a month of calling things as they are. Trust your judgment, speak with authority, and protect your energy from distractions. Work on simplifying your commitments, polishing your communication, and making choices that are rooted in truth, not obligation. Balance being wise and uncompromising.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938007.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: Queen of Cups</h2></strong><br />October opens your heart after the intensity of eclipse season, inviting emotional discernment and deeper self-trust. You’re being guided to sit with what you feel, without judgment and without rushing to fix anything, so that true emotional intelligence can emerge and provide you with clarity. The revelations now are emotional, subtle, and impactful. You can finally sense what your spirit has been trying to tell you all along and trust your intuitive gifts even more. Swim in your inner waters and listen more than you react so that you can be nurturing rather than controlling. Flow, don’t force. Your intuition is your greatest ally, and it gets stronger when you honor it consistently. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938008.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 10 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />October will bring a powerful ending that clears the way for your renewal. The 10 of Swords marks the final stage of an old karmic cycle, one that may have tested your spirit, drained your energy, or revealed who and what no longer serves your path. Eclipse season successfully stripped away what was false, and left behind what will journey with you onto your next chapter. This is a period of releasing and re-birthing the self; allow this month to liberate you. Sometimes that means accepting closure without resisting it. Allow any endings that come to sharpen your wisdom and prepare you for what is meant to be in your life.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938009.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: 7 of Wands</h2></strong><br />The aftermath of eclipse season serves to remind you that not every battle deserves your fire, but the ones that do require your full conviction. This month is all about learning where to direct your energy, where to hold your ground, and where to stop defending what no longer aligns with who you’re becoming. You’ve leveled up, and this process will always come with new levels of both internal and external resistance. Choose to meet it with observation instead of reaction. This chapter is about new boundaries and a deepening of your inner peace. Stay rooted, and trust that the version of you emerging now can no longer be shaken by old tests. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938010.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: King of Swords</h2></strong><br />This month’s theme is all about mastering your thoughts and words so they serve as a sword in your favor. Clean up the aftermath of eclipse season and its remains by cutting through emotional noise, analyzing situations with wisdom, and choosing truth over comfort. The eclipses have revealed where you’ve been too lenient, too patient, or too quiet about your needs. Now, you’re invited to speak with authority and to lead your life from logic aligned with spirit. Define your standards clearly, make strategic decisions, draw sharper boundaries, and communicate from power rather than reaction. You are being called to become your own powerful leader without compromising your truth or vision. Your voice is a tool of alignment. When you express yourself with precision, the universe responds in return.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938013.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: 2 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />You may still be juggling multiple priorities, trying to stay balanced as life demands both focus and flexibility — especially after these recent eclipses. September may have shown you where your energy was stretched too thin, and now you realize you can do many things but not everything at once. This month is about bringing more structure to your flow. Reorganize your routines, adjust your expectations, place boundaries, and realign your commitments so they serve your long-term vision. Focus on what truly deserves your energy and where you’ll get the most energetic gain and let go of what scatters your life force. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938014.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: Knight of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Refine your ability to move with precision and channel your drive intentionally without scattering your energy. Post-eclipse season is showing you how much being in tunnel vision, with focus and precision, can help you win and accelerate your achievements. Impulsivity is out; implementing strategy is in. It’s time to be bold and aggressive, but that doesn’t mean reckless and aimless. Experiment with infusing every word, move, and plan with intention. Watch how your momentum builds up and you can execute all the downloads that were presented to you the month prior. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938015.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: The Empress<br /></h2></strong><br />Post-eclispe season has you blossoming with so much potential and the space to generate more abundance than ever. This month you win by slowing down and embodying that magnetism that knows it cannot fail in attracting opulence with ease. Allow abundance to knock at your doorstep versus seeking for it yourself. You are overpouring with creative juices and ideas, so start generating from that and see where it takes you. Fuel your inner child with love, adorn your soul with sensual pleasure, and know that less you do, the more you receive. Pleasure is the key to having more. Know your worth and act on that. Softness is your new power.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938016.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: King of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Eclipse season may have revealed how your sense of security depended on others or on external validation. You are the key to your own abundance. Your new revelation is that managing your energy, banking on your ingenuity, and flowing with what life gives you will all lead you to wealth. You have magnificent gifts that are now revealing themselves. Play with them and see where they lead you. Begin to tend to yourself like a garden and be devoted to your own curiosity, well-being, and growth. Consistency and dedication are how the rewards will pay off. The ability to turn your dreams into reality is apparent more than ever. Allow your inner alchemist to shine and prove others wrong. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>POV: You slept just <em>okay</em>, and it was one of those mornings where you hit snooze and begrudgingly forced yourself out of bed. As much as I prioritize sleep — and it has been documented that I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nighttime-sleep-routine-editors-picks"">very much do</a> — sometimes, you can’t help feeling tired. And for me, my eyes are an undeniable tell; when I’m low on <em>zzz</em>‘s, my undereye area is puffy and purplish (I am not genetically prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-under-eye-cream"">dark circles</a>, so I know it’s bad when I need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/color-correcting-makeup-review"">color-correct</a>). I’ve consciously uncoupled from eye creams, but still love a lightweight <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-peptide-eye-serum-review"">eye serum</a> or better yet – an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/under-eye-mask"">undereye patch</a>.</p>



<p>At first look, eye masks more or less seem the same across the board: Usually made from a hydrogel or lyocell and/or bio-cellulose material, saturated with a serum-like goo to help soothe, brighten, and hydrate under the eyes. Well, not only are they very much not created equal (many that I’ve tried simply feel nice, but that’s about it), but I’m here to report that I’ve found an unlikely favorite in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">Rhode</a>‘s new <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937967.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Remember what I said earlier about a lot of patches just feeling nice but not actually doing much? Not these. Hailey did her big one with these, because <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a> doesn’t only contain peptides (somewhat of a hero ingredient for Rhode), but also caffeine, sodium PCA (an amino acid that works similarly to hyaluronic acid to trap and lock in moisture), and glycerin to visibly depuff, brighten, and moisturize under the eyes. After a night of too many cocktails and not enough sleep, I put these on while walking my dog the following morning. Right away, these felt instantly cool and refreshing (even without putting them in the fridge), and the symmetrical bean shape meant that I didn’t have to play a guessing game of how to properly place them. (There is somewhat of a hotly contested debate over the Nike <em>swoosh</em>-shaped ones, and whether the tapered end should face your inner or outer end of the orbital area.) </p>





<p>When I got back to my apartment about 10 minutes later, I removed them and inspected the results. To my surprise and delight, my puffiness was nearly gone, and my dark circles visibly less noticeable. But perhaps most noteworthy is that I actually felt like my overall eye area was perked up and <em>felt </em>awake. I’ve liked most Rhode products that I’ve tried, and admit that at first, I thought these logo-printed patches were just a viral beauty moment — and a clever one at that. But after trying these out a few times, I have to say that I’m impressed. Peptide Eye Prep definitely earned its spot in my airplane beauty routine as well as my makeup bag before getting ready for a night out. Are they a bit pricey at <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">$25 for six</a> (or <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/the-peptide-eye-prep-set"">$47 for 12</a>)? Well, yes — but not at all unheard of for premium eye masks. (My other fave, <a href=""https://www.wanderbeauty.com/products/baggage-claim-eye-masks"">Wander Beauty’s Baggage Claim</a>, are similarly priced at $26 for a set of six.) The individual packaging adds to the cost, but makes them infinitely more travel-friendly in my opinion — which I personally am willing to pay more for. And the Rhode-club selfies you’ll post while wearing ’em? Priceless.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>At first, Sandra Campos hesitated about joining the TikTok trend taking over her feed. In the five years since immigration officers had dropped her off at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-border-stories-art-joy"">the Mexican border</a>, she had chosen to keep her life-altering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">deportation story</a> off of her social media page, fearing rejection. </p>



<p>But as deportation videos multiplied across social media platforms under President Donald Trump’s second administration, she found that deportees, like herself, were picking up their phones and telling their side of the story. In May, she joined the trend with a playful, 6-second clip.</p>



<p><a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSUrXrQBx/"">In the video</a>, Campos whips her long hair in disbelief. The on-screen text reads: “When you get deported after living in the U.S. for 20+ years and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10971837/no-sabo-kid-meaning-new-definition"">barely know Spanish</a>.” </p>



<p>To her surprise, the response was massive. The video quickly went viral, racking up more than 14 million views and 12,000 comments. While some messages were negative, most were supportive, wishing her luck or sharing that their own loved ones had been deported, too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page. But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page,” 28-year-old Campos told Refinery29 Somos during a video call from Guanajuato, a colorful city nestled in the mountains of central Mexico. “But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p>



<p>Campos is part of a growing wave of deportees using TikTok to reclaim their stories and shed light on a side of immigration rarely seen: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11180964/undocumented-daca-immigrants-leaving-us"">what happens after<em> </em>deportation</a>. Through hashtags such as #LifeAfterDeportation, creators share clips about finding work, struggling with Spanish, enrolling their kids in school, and other challenges of rebuilding a life in an unfamiliar place.</p>



<p>“ When I got deported, it wasn’t really big,” said Campos. “Now, everybody’s talking about it.” </p>



<p>For Campos, who was deported in 2020 under the first Trump administration, opening up about such a traumatic event wasn’t easy. “I feel like I was a bit embarrassed about what happened,” she explained. That year, police stopped her for a traffic violation and handed her over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p>



<p>Despite qualifying for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10003291/daca-trump-supreme-court-immigrant-experience"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA), the program that allows for deportation protection and work permits for immigrants who were brought over as children, Campos said that her lawyer had advised her not to renew her permit, which she now regrets. Although Campos fought her case, she was deported to Mexico after having lived in Missouri since the age of two.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Thinking about it now is just crazy, but I hated my life so much [after deportation],” Campos said. “I missed everything about the U.S. I didn’t wanna be here for another minute.”</p>



<p>After spending almost a year with distant relatives in Mexico City, she moved to Guanajuato, found a job as a server, and pursued social media more seriously. Earlier this year, she discovered that what people most resonated with on TikTok was her deportation story. Since her first post in May, she has gained 23,000 followers and received an outpouring of support.</p>



<p>“They say things like, ‘I’m really glad you put your story out there.’ And I’m like, ‘Dang!’ I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do,” she said.</p>



<p>Anna Garcia, a 35-year-old mother of five, knows that feeling well. In 2018, she was arrested at a custody hearing in Utah and deported to Mexico, with $40 in her pocket. Forced to restart her life far from her children felt “like a death sentence,” she told Somos. “I felt like my life was over.” </p>



<p>But over the next year, she pieced her life together in Puerto Vallarta, a city on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, with the goal of regaining custody of her kids. She began <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx"">documenting her journey</a> on TikTok, gaining half a million followers and becoming a prominent voice for deportees.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions.”</p><cite>Denise Serrato</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""http://tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7200468260947578154?_t=ZS-90Qzv7ESaRR&amp;_r=1"">One of her most viral videos</a> captures her reunion with her kids, with a teary-eyed Garcia embracing her children in the Puerto Vallarta International Airport. It’s a moment that might have otherwise gone unnoticed offline, but on TikTok, it allowed for thousands of followers to hold space for her.</p>



<p>One user responded: “So happy for you…I wish you and your babies the best!”</p>



<p>Another said: “My kid’s dad got deported when they were 2 and 6 mo. They are now 6 &amp; 8. I pray they get to reunite with their father one day.”<br /></p>



<p>Denise Serrato, a mental health clinician who often works with immigrant clients, says it’s unsurprising that people who have been affected by deportation are connecting with these stories. “When someone sees deportation stories online, it can trigger a sense of ‘I’m not alone.’ Social media gives visibility to experiences that are often silenced or stigmatized,” she said.</p>



<p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions,” she added.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p><cite>Anna Garcia</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>While Garcia has used the #LifeAfterDeportation hashtag for years, she said that interest has picked up in recent months as more deportations make headlines and anti-immigrant rhetoric intensifies. “ I’ve seen a huge influx of the same type of content,” she said.</p>



<p>For Garcia, who experienced backlash when she first shared her story, seeing more deportation stories online feels like a breakthrough. “It was kind of shameful back then. I have seen a lot of people more comfortable with talking about it now and being empathetic hearing these stories.” </p>



<p>Garcia said that some followers are also reaching out seeking legal advice for loved ones facing deportation. While she tries to offer individual support, she now shares videos offering useful resources for deportees, such as how to access immigration records from the U.S. government or how to seek assistance from Mexican authorities following deportation.</p>



<p>Wanting to help immigrants has motivated Garcia to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney. In August, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7538154075041352990?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-90Q7KhU9lm1"">posted a video</a> celebrating the completion of her first year as a law student. The text read: “Watch me turn pain into purpose and grow into a law student in my home country.”</p>



<p>Her message, she said, is simple: life doesn’t end with deportation.</p>



<p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p>
