<p>Yet another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">cool-girl fashion collaboration</a> has entered the chat. This time, model Alexa Chung is celebrating her <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">long-standing relationship with Madewell</a> — 15 years after their first collaboration — with a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/feature/alexa-chung-collection/"">holiday collection</a> that pays homage to the East Village <em>and</em> East London.<br /><br />“We’ve been on a journey together, me and Madewell,” Chung tells Refinery29. “I’ve always made an effort to make things super personal, but this is definitely the most personal collection that we’ve collaborated on. It’s very vintage inspired and it’s also quite musically led, so it’s really specific to my tastes. I am thrilled with it.”<br /><br />From tried-and-true winter styles like oversized sweaters, crochet scarves, lacy slip dresses, and herringbone dress coats, to more <em>unexpected</em> styles like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/soccer-jersey-outfit-ideas-women"">football jerseys</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/white-jeans-styling-outfit-ideas"">white jeans</a>, and “We’re Witches Bitches” graphic tees, the collaboration perfectly reflects Chung’s “eclectic, specific, and cool” aesthetic.<br /><br />The nostalgic and romantic 31-piece collection also spans distressed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11495317/madewell-plus-size-denim-review"">Madewell jeans</a> and leather skirts and jackets, as well as giftable accessories like crew socks, hooded scarves, and floral brooches. Chung specifically recommends gifting one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-statement-belts-women"">statement belts</a> for the holidays. “I love <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY939/?ccode=EX0001"">this belt</a> because it can cinch your waist over a dress, slung low with baggy jeans, or wear it over loads of coats. I love the idea of jewelry over outerwear, so I’d probably get someone one of the belts.”</p>

<p>And in terms of her winter wardrobe staple, Chung highlights the <a href=""https://www.madewell.com/p/NY883/?ccode=WR2252"">collection’s peacoat</a>. “The navy blue coat is my non-negotiable winter coat. It’s genuinely warm. It’s a classic silhouette. It’s a bit oversized, it’s quite boxy, but you can fit your sweater underneath. It just makes you feel quite handsome and powerful when you put it on,” she explains.<br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for $24 brooches to gift to your fashion-loving friends or a $598 leather jacket to treat yourself, every piece will help you channel It-girl Chung’s signature style… and perhaps even Meg Ryan’s? The model says that if any fictional character would wear this nostalgic collection, it would be one of Ryan’s rom-com characters from ‘90s-era movies like <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em>, and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>.<br /><br />What more could we want from a cozy-season collection? We’ll have what Alexa’s having!</p>

Winter is long, and having cuddles on tap sounds quite nice. Hence <a href=""https://bumble.com/the-buzz/what-is-cuffing-season"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cuffing season</a>: the period when people “cuff” another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friends-to-lovers-stories"">into a relationship</a> for the colder months. Sometimes we cuff or get cuffed consciously, other times less so — you may be cuffed and not realize the other person’s intentions. Either way, something about this time of year makes us want to shack up and be cozy with someone else.<br /><br />This feels like a lot of work, to find someone now and put in the effort for a relationship that will probably end with the change in seasons. Some research has put it down to a desire to avoid feeling lonely — as many as <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/datingcom-found-that-online-activity-hits-peak-season-during-cold-winter-months-300926222.html"">60% of people</a> turn to dating apps in winter for this reason. Where summer can be socially full-on and active, the prospect of an emptier calendar during winter might make swiping for dates more attractive. <br /><br />Like all relationships, some end horribly, others are over as quickly as they began and some manage to go the distance, like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Ahead, Refinery29 spoke to five women about their own cuffing season relationships — how they went, how they ended (or didn’t), and how they felt about it. <figure><figcaption><strong>Lila, 26, New York</strong><br /><br />I entered into a cuffing season relationship three to four months after breaking up with my boyfriend of two years. We talked for half of September, started seeing each other at the end of September, and went on dates until the end of November. We were intimate and I really liked the guy, although I thought things were too good to be true. <br /><br />I eventually went to look him up on social media at the end of October and saw he was anti-immigration, slightly MAGA and very incel-leaning (at least his Twitter likes were). I had made my politics very clear. I am very liberal and was actively outspoken at the time about Palestine and leftist ideals. It was so weird to see [his online activity] and I showed a bunch of my friends to make sure I wasn't crazy. <br /><br />Before I got to break up with him, he reached out and said he just wanted to be friends. He contacts me every so often with memes about my profession, and now he has become my seafood hookup (he works at a seafood market and whenever I want expensive seafood like scallops and oysters for free, I text him and he brings it to me. Nothing sexual there, he just hooks me up with free seafood!). Honestly, he was a rebound who should have never happened. I deleted the apps soon after that because I centered my interests towards engaging in my weekly therapy sessions.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Tiphani, 35, Mississippi</strong><br /><br />My last cuffing season relationship was hot and heavy. It started at the beginning of January and ended in February. We got snowed in together and he made an effort to Uber or Lyft back to my house if he had to go into work. He would cook every day. And we would lie around and watch movies and talk until bedtime. I didn’t think it was going to be temporary. I thought we were on the same page.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the snow melted, the relationship also became a puddle. I tried to keep it going but the communication became almost nonexistent and I just had to block him, move on, and let it go. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Olivia, 28, London</strong><br /><br />I dated someone for four months who categorically did not fancy me. I don't think I really fancied him either. We met in September and in January he dumped me over text as soon as my plane landed back from Christmas break. New year, new him, I guess. I think I knew deep down there wasn't attraction — we barely connected physically and I told myself he was just shy and my self-esteem was low. It was low, but going out with someone who isn't attracted to you will do that. <br /><br />I realize now this was the end result of a ""year of dating"" I put myself through. I pressured myself to put in more time and effort and go on more dates, and by September I was exhausted and the nights were drawing in. So the first person who consistently asked me out on dates (and was not cheating on someone with me, or another such horror story), I just leapt at. We did all the seasonal winter stuff as he'd just moved to London, but I wish I'd spent more time doing that with my friends. I realized that a year on dating apps had set my bar so low that someone consistently asking me on the next date had become incredibly impressive. <br /><br />This season I feel just as burned out by dating if I am honest, but I realize going out with someone who doesn't like me is not the answer to that. I've joined a stand-up comedy course instead. <br /><br />Last week my friend informed me she ""doesn't date from October to April, it's just too cold"" and honestly? I might join her. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Kerry, 47, Melbourne </strong><br /><br />My cuffing season story goes back 10 years. We met doing a casual security stint at a comedy festival. Our relationship ended up lasting for a couple of years, on and off. Sometimes I'd get random calls saying, ""Guess who this is?"" after a break.<br /><br />He'd tell me I was very beautiful but that I was too old for him, especially in his Indian culture where this was frowned upon. I'm unsure if that was to placate me but he did find me attractive. We'd hook up at my place. Once it even happened at a work site!<br /><br />I got into this relationship knowing it was temporary. I wasn't fussed at all. We both knew that. Long term would have been too complicated. And that casualness wouldn’t work on me these days. My standards are much higher! The casualness worked at the time. Also, at the time it gave me confidence and boosted my self-esteem. Much later down the line though, when we were both married, he gave me a call. This annoyed me; it was as if he was expecting me to be alone, and I thought it a betrayal of his wife. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><strong>Shriya, 25, Virginia</strong><br /><br />I ended up getting in a cuffing season relationship two years ago with someone who turned out to be the love of my life and we're planning on being engaged soon. It was my most successful cuffing season of all time!<br /><br />We originally met in undergrad at the University of Pittsburgh. His best friend and I were friends so we crossed paths but we never had any conversations or expressed interest in each other. A couple years went by and we graduated. During the pandemic, a large group of our friends would finish work together on Zoom every night (about 30 people) and we joined in. He and I started talking on the side. We had a <em>really</em> long talking phase for months during cuffing season where neither of us said anything or even made the first move but you could tell we were clearly interested in seeing where it went. We just didn't know if we were going to see each other since he was in Kansas and I was in Virginia, so no one attached any hopes to the situation. Even when he asked me on our first date, he said, ""Hey, I'm coming to DC to see a couple friends, would you like to meet up?"" and I had to ask if it was a date to clarify. But once we went on the first date, it was game over. We've been together ever since.<br /><br />Everyone says when you know, you know, and it's very true. He asked to meet my parents the weekend of our first date, and a few weeks later he asked me to meet his. I think it was easier for us to jump in because our talking phase was so long that we had a chance to really know each other and vet the person first before jumping into a physical date.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings… we thought we were coasting to the finish line of 2025, but baby, the cosmos said, “Not so fast.” This week kicks off with a <em>mind maze</em> of epic proportions as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">on November</a> 9 at 2:02 p.m. EST, and it’s happening in none other than Sagittarius — the sign of bold opinions, big dreams, and spontaneous “let’s go to Bali” texts. <br /><br />But under Mercury retrograde? Yeah… your GPS might glitch halfway through the journey. Sag energy loves to think big picture, but Mercury is trying to zoom in and say, “Wait, did you really mean that? Or were you just avoiding the details?” This is the kind of transit that makes you question your own hot takes. So if you suddenly backpedal on that workshop you were going to launch or rethink that long-distance situationship you were convinced was <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moon-phases-meaning-astrology"">soulmate-level</a> last week, you’re not flaky… you’re realigning. </p>



<p>The upside? Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius helps us relearn how to tell the truth, not the curated one, but the gut-level, soul-naked kind. You might revise that book pitch, backtrack on those travel plans, or finally admit that your “freedom” narrative was really a fear of intimacy in disguise. Don’t rush. Let yourself unlearn what you thought was the truth. Just double-check your emails, avoid signing contracts unless necessary, and be open to divine redirections. A closed door is a cosmic yes in another language. <br /><br />Then comes a major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">energetic shift on 11/11</a>, a sacred astro-numerological portal, and this year it hits different because Jupiter, planet of expansion, luck, and vision, begins its retrograde journey in Cancer at 11:41 a.m. EST. This is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter’s first retrograde in Cancer</a> in over a decade, and it’s pulling our energy inward, homeward, and backward. Think: ancestral roots, childhood patterns, and that “do I even want to live here anymore?” conversation that keeps circling your brain. The answers come slowly, but they’re sacred. You might be called to downsize, simplify, or renovate — not just your space, but your lifestyle. Maybe you thought you wanted a bigger house, but now you crave a cozier, quieter one. Maybe you thought you wanted to raise kids in the city, but now you’re craving ocean air and moonlight. This isn’t about contraction. It’s about rooted expansion. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer reminds us that the dream isn’t real if you can’t rest in it. </p>



<p>On November 12, the Last Quarter Moon in Leo flares up the tension between your public self and your private desires. This is a shedding moon — one that asks: <em>Is the persona you’re performing still aligned with who you’re becoming?</em> Leo moons can make us crave attention, validation, and applause, but this one’s got a little edge to it. You might feel hyper-aware of who’s watching, liking, or not responding at all. But instead of spiraling, try this: let it go. Use this quarter moon to release the pressure to be seen and instead commit to <em>seeing yourself</em>. The right people will always feel you. And the rest? Dust. </p>



<p>The week wraps with the Virgo Moon taking over from November 13 to 15, bringing a calming wave of discernment; not the perfectionist kind, but the cleansing, clarifying kind. This is the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">get your life together</a>” moon, but with softness. There are only six weeks left in 2025. This moon isn’t here to shame you for what you didn’t get done… it’s here to help you see what’s still worth doing. Let it highlight what’s still alive in your spirit. Where are you still passionate? Where are you tired for no reason? With Mercury retrograde ruling Virgo from fiery Sagittarius, this is your reminder that just because something once excited you doesn’t mean it still fits your values now. This week is a reclamation. Of your voice, of your truth, of your energy. <br /><br />You can be wise, wild, and well rested. Let that be your mantra as we enter the final stretch of the year.  <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, buckle up because Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius (starting November 9) is throwing some fire back in your direction… but not the type you can just power through. This retrograde hits your sector of expansion, travel, and publishing, so if you’ve got big plans, launches, interviews, or even far-off journeys on deck, double- and triple-check the logistics. You might feel misunderstood or even dragged online for something you said with the best of intentions — but instead of spiraling into defensiveness, use this time to ask yourself: <em>What do I actually believe, and is it still true for the version of me I’m becoming?</em> You’re not meant to shrink; you’re meant to refine. Editing your message, rethinking your audience, and getting clear about your voice doesn’t make you a sellout — it makes you someone with staying power. Think: slow down to go global. <br /><br />And then comes the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 portal</a>, where Jupiter begins retrograding in Cancer, your sector of home, family, and emotional roots. <em>Whew</em>. That one might hit a little deeper than you expected. Whether it’s your literal home or your internal sense of safety, this retrograde is asking you to pause and reflect. Do you still want to live where you are? Are you ready to build something new — or rebuild something old, but on your terms this time? Some Aries might suddenly crave a simpler life, downsizing their lifestyle or revisiting childhood patterns that shaped how they seek comfort. Others might feel pulled to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/november-tarotscopes-messages-ancestors"">connect with their ancestors</a>, mend family dynamics, or even reimagine what “home” means — especially if the old definition was wrapped in performance or pressure. You don’t have to fix it all right now. But <em>feel it</em>. Jupiter’s reminding you that true growth starts at the root. </p>



<p>By the time the Virgo Moon arrives (November 13 to 15), your spirit’s like, <em>okay, enough existential spiraling</em>, let’s get back in the body. This earthy moon moves through your health and wellness sector, giving you a stabilizing moment in an otherwise reflective week. The good news? This moon doesn’t want you to perfect anything — it just wants you to notice. Notice where you’ve been neglecting routines that actually help you feel more alive. Notice the little habits that need tweaking. And more than anything, notice what your body has been trying to tell you, especially as your mind has been zooming into big-picture questions all week. This is your mid-month grounding ritual. Drink the tea. Stretch your back. Cancel the plan you didn’t want to go to anyway. You’re allowed to rest even in the middle of the chaos. Especially then. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury’s retrograde in Sagittarius</a> beginning November 9 might stir up more than just philosophical questions — it’s nudging you into the shadows of your own psyche, your intimacy sector, where power, vulnerability, and shared resources live. And yeah… it could get a little messy. Old debts (emotional or financial) might resurface. Someone you thought you were “done” with might pop back in with a question or an apology. Or maybe it’s you who’s suddenly feeling called to unpack past decisions — especially the ones you’ve quietly judged yourself for. <br /><br />This retrograde isn’t about punishment, it’s about integration. What part of you have you been hiding out of fear of rejection or loss? You’re being invited to reclaim it. Reclaim your power, even if that means fumbling your way through some uncomfortable convos or realizations. Growth rarely comes wrapped in silk — sometimes it shows up with receipts and a mirror. </p>



<p>Then, on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, activating your communication and mindset zone — and that’s a big cosmic green light to slow your roll and listen more deeply. This isn’t about talking less, it’s about being more intentional with your voice. If you’re writing something big, launching something, or trying to have heart-to-hearts, give yourself space to revise, reword, or even re-feel what you’re trying to express. Childhood memories or old stories about your intelligence or communication style might resurface — not to haunt you, but to be rewritten with compassion. Are you speaking your truth… or the truth you think others expect from you? This is a powerful time to reconnect with your inner narrator and ask: <em>Is this the story I want to keep telling about myself?</em> If not, 11/11 is a beautiful portal for rewriting it. </p>



<p>By the time the Moon lands in Virgo from November 13 to 15, your creativity and joy sector becomes the stage for a mid-month emotional check-in. This isn’t about productivity — it’s about pleasure with purpose. Have you forgotten what makes you laugh? What makes you play? If you’ve been stuck in a loop of “doing the work,” this Moon invites you to remember why you’re doing it at all. Maybe it’s time to reconnect with your inner child, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/creativity-art-therapy-classes"">tend to a creative project</a> that’s been whispering your name. Maybe you just need to dance around your room with your phone on airplane mode. </p>



<p>Whatever it is, don’t wait for permission to delight in being alive again. You’ve been deep in the waters all week — now let this Virgo Moon offer you earth to stand on, and joy to reach for. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, let’s be real: Mercury’s retrograde starting November 9 is going to hit different, because it’s happening in your relationship sector (in the sign of Sagittarius), and Mercury’s <em>your</em> ruling planet. So yeah, you’re gonna feel it. Expect some double-texting energy, some “Wait… what did they <em>really</em> mean by that?” vibes, and maybe a ghost or two reappearing just when you thought you were emotionally vaccinated. This isn’t about drama for the sake of drama, though. It’s about clarity. If you’ve been unclear about what you want in love, business partnerships, or even creative collaborations, this retrograde could shake the dust off that indecision. Misunderstandings may happen, but they’re revealing what needs to be refined. And hey, if an ex pops up and you’re tempted? Ask yourself: Is this curiosity, closure, or an escape from what’s actually available to you right now? <br /><br />Then there’s 11/11 — a major portal, and the same day Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, which lights up your money and self-worth sector. This is deep. Like, ancestral beliefs about abundance deep. You might find yourself revisiting <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/starting-investing-real-stories"">decisions around savings, investing</a>, or even the ways you’ve been undervaluing yourself in business or relationships. If you’ve been hustling for approval or centering others’ needs out of fear of rejection, this week will lovingly (or not so lovingly) ask you to stop. You are not a backup dancer in your own life. Jupiter here says: <em>take up more space — but the retrograde says, first, check where you’ve been shrinking</em>. Maybe it’s time to raise your rates. Maybe it’s time to cut off a draining energetic tie that’s been taking more than it gives. Either way, your value isn’t negotiable, even if your pricing strategy is. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your home and emotional roots sector, and it’s basically a cosmic reminder to stop skipping the warm-up. You don’t have to be “on” all the time, Gem. You don’t even have to be figuring things out. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-look-happier-trend-embracing-messiness"">You’re allowed to simply be: messy</a>, soft, still. Clean your space if that helps you breathe easier. Make your bed like it’s an act of devotion. Call someone who reminds you of who you were before the world told you to hurry. This isn’t a weekend to impress; it’s a weekend to nourish. Let the Virgo Moon guide you back to rituals that restore your nervous system and ground your ideas. The clarity you’re craving isn’t out there — it’s in the quiet corners you’ve been too busy to visit. Go home to yourself. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Mercury retrograde begins in your wellness, work, and routines sector on November 9, and let’s be real — if your body’s been whispering (or screaming) for rest, this is your sign to listen. This transit is like a cosmic timeout, forcing you to re-evaluate what “productivity” even means to you. Maybe you’ve been running on autopilot, saying yes out of guilt or fear instead of alignment. Maybe you’re craving a slower, softer pace but worried that if you stop, everything will collapse. Spoiler: it won’t. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius</a> is clumsy and chaotic, yes… but also philosophical. It invites you to pull back from the grind and ask: What’s the point of all this effort if your joy and peace aren’t part of the equation? <br /><br />Then comes a cosmic curveball and blessing wrapped in one: Jupiter begins its retrograde in your sign on 11/11, and Cancer, this is <em>big</em>. You’ve been expanding so much this year, maybe even faster than your inner world could keep up with. This retrograde is here to help you integrate. To help you reclaim what you’ve given away in the name of growth, people-pleasing, or perfection. You might revisit decisions you made earlier this year with fresh eyes, and this time, you’ll choose differently. You may downsize, cancel a major plan, or close a door that once felt full of promise — not because you’ve failed, but because you’ve evolved. Think of this as a soul homecoming: a re-rooting. And with your planetary ruler, the Moon, lighting up your sector of self-worth during the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus Full Moon</a> just days ago, your standards have risen — including the standards you hold for <em>yourself</em>. </p>



<p>As the Virgo Moon arrives November 13 to 15, things get even more introspective, but in the best, most clarifying way. This lunation activates your communication and learning sector, so consider it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-say-no-to-friends"">your permission slip to say no</a>, mute the noise, and re-curate your reality. Read something that expands your mind. Journal without editing. Take a walk without your phone and let your own thoughts be the soundtrack. Even if retrograde chaos swirls around you, you’re building something quieter and more grounded inside. </p>



<p>Something sacred. The second half of the week is like a mid-month recalibration: Where do you need to simplify? What ideas need breathing room? Virgo wants you to declutter your mind, and Cancer, that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">starts with choosing peace</a> over performance. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Mercury starts its final retrograde of the year on November 9 in your creativity, joy, and romance sector, and let’s just say, things might get <em>messy-hot</em> or <em>hot-messy</em> real quick. You might reconnect with a past lover (or crush), find yourself rewriting an old creative idea, or even second-guessing the ways you express your joy. Retrogrades aren’t meant to stall you, they’re meant to rewire you, so if your flirt game feels off or your passion projects aren’t clicking, don’t force it. Play. Revisit your old journals, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inner-child-healing"">revisit your inner child</a>. This retrograde wants to remind you that your creativity doesn’t have to be profitable, and your love doesn’t have to be performative. It just has to be <em>real</em>. <br /><br />Then on 11/11, a deeply emotional shift arrives: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer</a>, your sector of healing, rest, and closure. This is not the time to push. This is the time to soften. Some Leos may realize they’ve been carrying emotions that aren’t even theirs. Others may find themselves shedding ego identities that once felt protective — the performer, the leader, the strong one — in favor of deeper truth. You’re realizing that being seen isn’t always about being loud or perfect; it’s about being honest. Jupiter retro in Cancer helps you make peace with the past, with the versions of yourself you no longer need to be. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself yearning for solitude, sacred spaces, or spiritual nourishment. Let that be your compass. </p>



<p>As the Moon shifts into Virgo from November 13 to 15, you’ll feel a subtle but steady return to your values, money, and worth. You may be tempted to “fix” everything that feels off: your budget, your habits, your schedule, but the deeper ask is to center what actually sustains you. Not just financially, but emotionally, spiritually, physically. This Virgo Moon is your mid-month check-in: What’s been draining your light, and what’s been keeping it alive? The answers may not be flashy, but they’ll be <em>true</em>. Let simplicity lead. Let pleasure be enough. Let this week be a sacred act of recalibration — not so you can perform again, but so you can live more fully from your own center. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Mercury, your planetary ruler, begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations. This one’s going to feel personal. You might feel the urge to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">declutter everything in sight</a>, rearrange your furniture, or suddenly feel overwhelmed by family dynamics you thought were behind you. This isn’t regression; it’s excavation. If old patterns arise, especially around caretaking, over-functioning, or needing to be “the responsible one,” pause before reacting. Mercury retrograde wants to rewire your foundation from the inside out — so let yourself grieve, journal, question, and even nap more than usual. You’re making room for the version of home that feels more chosen than inherited. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, the ascension portal cracks open as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer</a>, illuminating your community and friendship sector. You may start to ask: Who really holds me? Who sees me when I’m not performing? Who do I trust to witness me in my becoming? This transit invites you to slow down your networking pace, rethink the roles you play in your social circles, and re-evaluate what solidarity actually looks like for you. Some Virgos may reconnect with old friends or communities that once brought joy, while others may realize they’ve outgrown certain connections — and that’s okay. Jupiter in retrograde is a cosmic blessing in disguise: it peels away the performance and leaves the soul. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon moves through your sign, and you’ll feel it like a subtle inner drumbeat returning you to yourself. It’s a reminder that you don’t need to do more or fix more to be worthy of ease. This is your mid-month reset. Instead of obsessing over what isn’t working, focus on nourishing what is. Ground yourself in rituals that feel like medicine — whether it’s meal prepping, doing absolutely nothing, or getting lost in a book. Let yourself be the thing you take care of this time. The world can wait — your healing can’t. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Mercury retrogrades in Sagittarius on November 9, lighting up your communication, learning, and local environment sector. So let’s be real: your words may trip over themselves this week, even when your heart is clear. That brilliant idea? It might need a few more rounds of refinement before you hit publish. The text you didn’t mean to send, the meeting you show up to on the wrong day… it’s all part of the cosmic comedy. But beneath the mix-ups, something deeper’s being rewritten. What are you <em>really</em> trying to say, Libra? What truths have you been avoiding out of politeness or fear of rocking the boat? Mercury’s slowdown invites you to get honest — not just with others, but with yourself. You don’t always have to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">translate your intuition</a> into something digestible. <br /><br />Then on November 11 (11/11 portal), Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your career and public image sector. If it feels like the outside world is slowing down just as you were picking up steam… that’s not a glitch, it’s divine timing. This retrograde asks you to <em>redefine success</em> on your terms. Maybe you’re not as excited about that promotion as you thought you’d be. Maybe a long-held goal no longer fits who you’re becoming. Jupiter in Cancer wants to root your ambitions in emotional truth, not external validation. You might find yourself craving a softer, more sustainable way of showing up in the world — one that honors your boundaries, your rest, your art. Let the discomfort guide you home. </p>



<p>The Moon in Virgo from November 13 to 15 activates your healing and subconscious sector, making this a powerful time to retreat, recalibrate, and listen to the whispers within. You don’t need to explain your absence. You don’t need to earn your stillness. Let this lunar energy be a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/staycation-digital-detox-personal-essay"">permission slip to say no, log off, close the tab</a>, and take the long way home. You are allowed to rest in the in-between. The clarity will come — but not if you chase it. Let it find you in the quiet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio</a>, Mercury begins its retrograde in Sagittarius on November 9, in your money, values, and self-worth sector, and this one’s hitting close to home — literally and emotionally. It might bring some financial delays or confusion: think forgotten payments, tech glitches with invoices, or miscommunications around collaborations. But beyond the surface-level chaos, this is a deeply clarifying period. Mercury’s slowdown is asking: What do you <em>actually value</em>? Are you hustling out of fear instead of alignment? This retrograde wants to help you reassess your entire relationship with abundance. Maybe what you need isn’t more… maybe it’s a better understanding of what “enough” means for you now. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter begins its retrograde in Cancer, in your expansion, travel, and spiritual wisdom sector — and this is big. You may feel a sudden urge to cancel a trip, re-route a plan, or pull back from something you once thought was your “big break.” Let it happen. Jupiter’s moonlit retrograde is less about going somewhere and more about <em>returning</em> — to a truth, a purpose, or even an ancestor’s whisper you’ve been too busy to hear. You don’t have to chase enlightenment. You can live it in the quiet rituals, the daydreams, the pauses. This is the kind of transit that asks: What beliefs are outdated? What stories about yourself no longer fit who you’re becoming? </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendships"">energizes your community, friendship</a>, and long-term vision sector, and it’s here to help you sift through the noise. You’re realizing which social circles genuinely support your evolution and which ones subtly hold you back. Take stock of who you’re spending your precious time with. Are your connections reciprocal, or are you always the one holding space? Let the Virgo Moon guide you to organize your goals into tangible steps — no need for perfection. Just discernment, honesty, and a soft plan to carry you through these retrograde waters. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year in your sign on November 9, and you’ll likely feel it in your bones before you can name it. You might suddenly second-guess things you once felt 100% sure about: your image, your direction, even how you’ve been showing up lately. This isn’t a punishment, it’s a mirror. Mercury retrograde in your sign is like a cosmic mic check: Are your words aligned with your beliefs? Have your intentions kept up with your growth? If you’re misunderstood or if your message gets lost in translation this week, don’t panic. Take it as a signal to fine tune, not silence. You’re evolving. Your truth is too. </p>



<p>Then on 11/11, Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional entanglements, and things get deep. A past entanglement, contract, or collaboration might resurface, and it’s not necessarily to restart it, but to reflect. This could be about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/personal-loans-real-examples"">money you loaned</a>, energy you overextended, or emotional investments that didn’t yield what you expected. Jupiter’s message here is loud: It’s time to reclaim your power by reexamining the places where you’ve over-given or under-valued your own needs. You might also feel a pull to tend to ancestral healing — themes of trust, survival, and legacy could come up, and they’re not here to haunt you, but to free you. </p>



<p>As the Moon moves through Virgo from November 13 to 15, your career and reputation sector lights up with earthy precision. While everything else may feel foggy or slowed down by retrogrades, this lunar transit helps you <em>ground your goals</em>. Clean up your calendar. Edit that proposal. Check your online bios — they might need updating. It’s not about doing more, it’s about doing better. You’re learning to build a life that fits the version of you that’s emerging, not the one who was hustling out of habit. Let this week guide you to work smarter, live slower, and speak more intentionally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Mercury begins its final retrograde of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of spirituality, solitude, and endings. This one’s a little slippery. You may feel unusually foggy, sleepy, or overstimulated and disoriented all at once. It’s because your mind is trying to do what your spirit hasn’t caught up with yet. This is a week for remembering that not everything needs to be shared, explained, or understood immediately. Mercury retrograde is asking you to hit pause on external obligations and listen to your inner world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Dreams may get weirder</a>. Gut instincts stronger. You’re shedding thought patterns you didn’t realize were weighing you down. Let it happen in layers. </p>



<p>Then on the sacred 11/11 portal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde shifts into Cancer</a>, in your sector of relationships and contracts. Whether it’s a romantic partner, a business agreement, or an old commitment that’s expired, this transit is here to bring it all back to the surface. If something feels unfinished — it is. But this is not about reopening old wounds just to relive them. It’s about integrating what you’ve learned. This transit may challenge you to confront where you’ve overextended yourself in partnerships or allowed resentment to fester under the surface. On the flip side, it may illuminate where you’ve been too guarded to let real intimacy in. Either way, the invitation is to reimagine how you relate — not from survival, but from reciprocity. <br /><br />From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lights up your sector of truth, travel, and expansion. You may find yourself craving an escape, but not necessarily a physical one. This might be the week you get lost in a book, sign up for a course, or revisit a philosophy that once anchored you. It’s the perfect time to assess what you’ve outgrown and what still resonates. Virgo’s clarity will help you map out the next leg of your soul journey… just don’t rush to have it all figured out. Let your sense of direction come from stillness, not pressure. You’re growing in silence this week, and it’s exactly what you need. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury begins its final retrograde</a> of the year on November 9, in Sagittarius, your sector of community, vision, and long-term goals. If you’ve been go-go-go with big ideas, collaborations, or social media visibility, this is your cue to pause and reassess. Are you creating from your truth, or just trying to keep up? Mercury retrograde might bring a few tech glitches, scheduling delays, or misunderstandings among friends or team members. But it’s also a golden opportunity to get real about where your energy is going and why. Use this transit to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">revise your vision board</a> — metaphorically or literally. Who are you becoming, and who do you need around you to help make that future feel real? </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, the astro-numerological portal, and with it, Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, your sector of wellness, service, and daily rituals. This is less about productivity and more about sustainability. Jupiter here wants you to zoom out and ask: Is the way I live each day aligned with how I say I want to feel? Are you overgiving at work or neglecting your body’s requests for rest, nourishment, and movement? Maybe it’s time to simplify your routine, or even re-evaluate the kind of work you’re doing entirely. This transit might stir memories of past jobs, health routines, or caretaking roles that shaped your current reality — not to haunt you, but to help you release what’s no longer needed. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo lands in your sector of intimacy, trust, and emotional transformation. You may find yourself quietly craving deeper connection, not just with others, but with the parts of yourself you’ve avoided. The Virgo Moon wants you to cleanse. This could look like journaling through a fear, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/budgeting-tools-spending-diary"">organizing your finances</a>, or even deleting an old situationship’s number once and for all. Let this be a ritual of release. Mercury may be retrograde, but clarity is still available — especially when you’re honest about what you’ve outgrown. Make room for intimacy that feels like ease, not performance. You deserve that. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mercury begins its retrograde journey in Sagittarius on November 9, activating your career, visibility, and life direction sector. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">could feel like déjà vu</a> in the workplace, where past projects resurface or delayed recognition finally makes its way to you, but with strings attached. You may find yourself rethinking your goals or even reconsidering what “success” looks like for you. Are you chasing someone else’s version of accomplishment? Or is it time to give yourself permission to redefine what lights you up? Double-check important emails and deadlines, but also check in with your higher self — she might be whispering a totally different route forward. </p>



<p>Then comes 11/11, and your planetary ruler Jupiter retrogrades into Cancer, in your sector of creativity, romance, and self-expression. This is where the magic gets personal. A love from the past could resurface, not necessarily for reunion, but for reflection. You might feel pulled back into old creative dreams you once abandoned, wondering, “What if?” Jupiter’s slow dance in Cancer invites you to nurture your inner child and revisit the art forms or love stories that once brought you joy. If you’re a parent or mentor, this could be a healing period for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-aunts-uncles-nibling-social-media"">bonding with the young people</a> in your life, or with your own youthful spirit. Let yourself be moved. </p>



<p>From November 13 to 15, the Moon in Virgo illuminates your relationship and one-on-one connection sector. It’s a clarifying lunar moment that may reveal where boundaries need adjusting, or where walls need softening. Whether you’re single, partnered, or in something undefined, the Virgo Moon brings discernment without coldness. Take this time to have the talk, send the email, or write the letter (even if you never send it). You’re learning to show up more authentically in partnership, but also to honor your solitude. Clarity is not closure, it’s a doorway. Walk through with grace. </p>

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> said “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she wasn’t referring to only the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-impactful-tv-shows"">moments in history</a> that feel like sunshine and roses. The iconic singer and activist meant the dark and ugly parts, too. </p>



<p>Lately, however, there’s been an alarming trend of people in power <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVG7PNTZbtM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">censoring art that reflects reality</a>. Just recently, Apple TV postponed the release of <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/""><em>The</em> <em>Savant</em></a><em> </em>in the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The series follows an investigator (Jessica Chastain) who interferes with white supremacist organizations before mass shootings occur. In a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"">Deadline</a>, a spokesperson for the streaming platform said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” adding that it would be released at a later date. <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain expressed her disappointment</a> on Instagram, stating that “we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States” since they began making the show five years ago. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942017.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=427&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A427"" /></figure>



<p>This is just one example of Hollywood executives <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">canceling or suspending shows</a> and movies seemingly in immediate response to headlines of the day. Their statements may be broad, and their actions may do little more than appease shareholders, but the consistent <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">attacks on freedom of speech</a> and expression through the arts do nothing but hold the entertainment industry — and society — back.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth praising the TV shows and films that confront the times instead of running from them. These are the best series and movies that have refused to shy away from the social and political climates they were made in. </p>

<h2><strong><em>Fruitvale Station </em></strong>(2013)</h2>







<p>The world was introduced to the genius of Ryan Coogler through <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a poignant film that highlights the final day of Oscar Grant’s life. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, Grant was <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-years-since-oscar-grant-s-death-what-13489585.php"">killed at age 22</a> on New Years Day in 2009 by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer Johannes Mehserle. The killing occurred in Oakland, California — Coogler’s hometown — but the film resonated across the nation, and with timely reason: It debuted one year after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an event that sparked protests nationwide and ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in a formal way. State-sanctioned and racist violence was all too common, yet it had been long ignored on the silver screen. Coogler’s directorial debut shined a light on the deadly cost of institutionalized racism that the United States has yet to contend with. <strong><em>Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Watchmen </em></strong>(2019)</h2>







<p>Regina King is the true hero of this HBO limited series, adapted from the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name. Though <em>Watchmen</em> is set in a present-day alternate universe, it’s based on the true horrors of the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years_n_60a574b2e4b0313547925c09"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, in which white supremacists targeted an area of town known as Black Wall Street for its thriving Black-owned businesses. Unlike in reality, the descendants of the massacre receive reparations, leaving resentment amongst the white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry. King is a masked vigilante on a mission to put an end to the group’s pattern of racial violence. <em>Watchmen</em> also stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, and Jean Smart as their characters must confront their own ethics in ways they’ve never had to before.. This nine-episode series is a masterclass in rich, nuanced storytelling about the traumas that wounds inflicted from racism hold — and the inherited pain that ensues if not addressed head-on. With the resurfacing of white nationalism and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/us-black-history-dei"">erasure of historical facts </a>on federal and state levels, this prescient show is absolutely worth a rewatch today. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>One Battle After Another </em></strong>(2025)</h2>







<p>There’s a reason Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest has been heralded as one of the best films of 2025 while also spinning <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/one-battle-after-another-conservative-reactions-1236394128/"">conservatives into a tizzy</a>. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti, and highlights the cost and complexities of serving as part of a revolution. Though <em>One Battle After Another</em> doesn’t specify what the protagonists are fighting for other than freedom, it’s evident that patriarchal and white supremacists systems are a known enemy. (Sound familiar?) The film tackles racism, sexism, xenophobia, and classism as the main characters reunite after decades of inactivity in the effort to save the daughter of one of their own. A secondary plot focusing on immigrant rights reflects the reality of so many people and families who have recently been targeted by ICE raids under Trump’s regime; markedly, the film spares no punches in its depiction of this violence. <strong>One Battle After Another<em> is in theaters now with a digital release date of November 20.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Morning Show </em></strong>(4 seasons, 2019-present)</h2>







<p>Season after season, this Apple TV series understands the assignment. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, <em>The Morning Show</em> is a novel depiction of the inner workings of the media, this time from a nationally syndicated morning show on a major network. Each season, these journalists are impacted personally and professionally by major events happening in the world, from the #MeToo movement to the pandemic to the rise of artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, they must contend with a changing media landscape that leads to layoffs and a challenging environment for journalism to thrive. Watching this four-season show can be triggering for those working in the industry. Binge at your own risk.<strong><em> Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Adolescence</em></strong> (2024)</h2>







<p>This Netflix original is an uncomfortably ugly ride that exposes the life-threatening dangers of the digital manosphere. Owen Cooper plays a 13-year-old named Jaime, who — despite coming from a solid home with a seemingly normal foundation — is arrested for killing a female classmate who declined his advances. The four-episode series is a devastating depiction of how the dark corners of social media and the internet at large are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"">radicalizing young men</a> today. <strong><em>Stream now on</em></strong> <em><strong>Netflix.</strong></em></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Her</em></strong><strong> </strong>(2013)</h2>







<p><em>Her</em> isn’t a horror film — but it might soon become a documentary, as a recent Vantage Point Counseling Services study showed that almost a third of Americans have admitted to having an <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/americans-romantic-relationships-ai-chatbot-study-b2838217.html"">intimate or romantic relationship</a> with an AI chatbot. That is more or less the premise of this film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely and introverted Theodore Twombly. Fresh off a divorce, Theodore falls in love with Samantha, a chatbot voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Though the Spike Jonze feature premiered more than a decade ago, it eerily predicted the moment in time we currently live in, particularly as a <a href=""https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it"">loneliness epidemic</a> and advancements in generative AI converge. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong> (6 seasons, 2017-2025)</h2>







<p>Watching this dystopian Hulu series is sombering, especially in a post-<em>Roe v. Wade </em>society. Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, the Emmy-winning series takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian nation that was once the United States. Its power-hungry men have made laws that subjugate women to follow an extreme set of laws that essentially gives the government total control of their bodies. It is illegal for them to read, vote, divorce, and freely express themselves in any way. June Osborne (Elizabeth Moss) is one of the few fertile women left in Gilead; for this, she is captured, enslaved, and forced to become a surrogate for a Commander and his wife. The torture, abuse, and dehumanizing conditions these characters experience make this show a hard watch, especially as lawmakers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/health/usaid-contraceptives-destroyed-trump.html"">continue to police</a> <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/09/texas-abortion-pill-ban/"">and chip away</a> <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2025/09/birth-control-incorrectly-labeled-as-abortifacients-by-trump-administration.html"">at women’s reproductive rights</a> at the federal and local level. <strong><em>Stream now on Hulu.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></strong> (2019)</h2>







<p>Gentrification has been a hot button topic for quite some time, but seeing how it’s depicted in <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> gives the conversation around it a fresh lens. The film centers on Jimmie Fails, a third-generation San Franciscan holding onto the Victorian home his grandfather supposedly built despite it no longer belonging to his family. When the home’s white former tenants vacate, Jimmie moves out of his friend’s apartment in a low-income neighborhood that’s built on toxic waste and begins squatting. The realities of the movie continue to this day: As the cost of living in one of the country’s <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/income-needed-to-live-comfortably-in-most-expensive-us-cities.html"">most expensive cities</a> continues to rise, <a href=""https://capitalbnews.org/black-displacement-gentrification-watts-study/"">communities established by people of color</a> have only become whiter and whiter. This Sundance Film Festival winner maintains its relevancy as Black and Brown neighborhoods across the country contend with what “home” looks like when so many of their neighbors are being displaced. <strong><em>Rent now on Prime Video or AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em></strong> (2018)</h2>







<p>Barry Jenkins masterfully adapts James Baldwin’s novel of the same name into the beautiful love story. Fonny and Tish are a young, Black couple from Harlem. Their relationship is tragically interrupted when Fonny is falsely accused of raping a white woman and thrown in prison. Though the film depicts the tragedy of mass incarceration and corruption, it takes care to treat the families impacted by these systemic travesties with  sophistication and dignity. The moral of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> is that no matter what systems try to break love, its resiliency is undeniable.<strong><em> Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong> (2015)</h2>







<p>The housing crisis took place in 2008 but Adam McKay’s <em>The Big Short</em> still feels eerily relevant. Starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, it takes a comedic approach to explaining how a group of investors predicted that a crash was coming and bet against the banks. They won big while the rest of the country went into an economic downward spiral. The Oscar-winning film depicted the role Wall Street’s greed played in causing The Great Recession. While other factors certainly contributed to the economic realities of 2008 and the following years, the film still hits as today’s everyday Americans increasingly feel financial strain. <strong><em>Watch now on Paramount+</em></strong>.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Don’t Look Up</em></strong> (2021)</h2>







<p>As a comet hurls towards Earth, two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) try to warn the global population in this Adam McKay-directed film. Few are taking this death star seriously, however — including the U.S. president. <em>Don’t Look Up </em>follows DiCaprio and Lawrence’s charaters as they take matters into their own hands and warn the general public. Political hijinks ensues as the comet becomes a divisive issue rather than a rallying cry for action. Though a comet is the big threat in this film, it feels like a metaphor for many things, including the looming dangers of climate change and the gullibility of viewers who believe something is “fake news” because a politician told them so. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix. </em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Severance</em></strong> (2 seasons, 2022-present)</h2>







<p>This Emmy Award-winning Apple TV series premiered after the onset of the Covid pandemic and the work-from-home era, when many Americans had the time to assess their relationship with their work. Seasons don’t exist in the cold and dreary town run by Lumon, the company that sells the dream of a true work-life balance by literally severing their personalities into two. Their workplaces selves (innies) don’t know anything about their outside selves (outies). What initially seems like the ideal technology becomes an actual living hell for a group of employees who have effectively lost their free will. <strong><em>Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Wire</em></strong> (5 seasons, 2002-2009)</h2>







<p>A hallmark of prestige television since the moment it debuted in 2002, <em>The Wire</em> should be required viewing for anyone looking to pursue careers in law enforcement, journalism, local government, or the legal field. Set in Baltimore, the HBO original chronicles institutions on each side of the drug trade and examines how cops, drug dealers, reporters, lawyers, teachers, and blue-collar workers are all connected by the same system. Creator David Simon paints a vivid picture of the toll political corruption, racism, and addiction take on both individual people and the entire city. Though specific to the Maryland city in its accents and details, the show’s message easily applies to other urban cities across the country. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>After The Hunt</em></strong> (2025)</h2>







<p><em>After The Hunt</em> poses a frustratingly timeless question: Who gets to be the perfect victim? Ayo Edebiri stars as Maggie Price, a queer Black student at Yale University whose family is filthy rich. This complex background — a mix of privilege and marginalization — as well as her suspected missteps call her integrity into question after she accuses a male instructor of raping her. Julia Roberts plays Alma Olsson, Maggie’s professor and mentor, who has to make a decision: Support her mentee as Maggie seeks to hold her abuser accountable, or side with her colleague with whom she shares romantic chemistry. The film challenges assumptions as it holds an uncomfortable mirror to the ways in which modern society still views consent and cancel culture.<strong> After the Hunt <em>was in theaters in October and will be released digitally on PrimeVideo soon.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em><strong>I May Destroy You </strong></em><strong>(1 season, 2020)</strong></h2>







<p>The series created by and starring Michaela Coel premiered two years after bombshell allegations against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein thrust Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement into the national spotlight and sparked widespread conversations about sexual assault, harassment, and survivorhood. It’s a visceral but necessary watch. The show centers on three main characters as they navigate what it means to heal after being subjected to sexual violence. In just one season, <em>I May Destroy You</em> tackled the messy, dark, harrowing reality of what it means to process sexual assault and maintain a sense of your own agency as a survivor. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>

<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>

In November, the veil between the living and spirit realms is thin. This traditionally is a prime opportunity for us to tune into the silence and grasp the guidance that is being given to us through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">our ancestors</a> and spirit allies. Between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> and Gede Season, spirit reminds us that death is not an ending but an additional chapter in our lives. It’s a new beginning of sorts. <br /><br /> This month, our task is to listen to the direction we are being pointed to. This will help us sharpen our intuitive and psychic gifts that we’ve inherited from our ancestors and surrender to whatever is meant to shed from our lives so that a new beginning can arise. This is a time to celebrate your lineage, pour libations, and embody the prayers that made you possible. November’s tarotscopes will grant you clarity on your next steps during this season.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941368.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />This month is an emotional rebirth. Prepare to embody a more mature and abundant you. The ancestors and guides are pouring into you, whether that is through mirroring to you your truth and magnificence, providing juicy opportunities that will have your cup overflowing, or giving you the space to process your emotions and release in a safe way. Allow your heart to lead you. You’ve spent enough time surviving; now it’s time to receive. The Ace of Cups opens a new cycle of intimacy with yourself, your spirit, and the people who see you clearly. Don’t overthink. Let whatever is coming up to flow. What’s meant for you won’t require force. Your ancestors are blessing this new beginning. Drink from it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941369.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />This season implores you to slow down, milk the present moment, and seek the portal to all possibilities by enjoying the luxuries you have now. Find ways to devote to yourself versus rushing onto your next destination or attempting to control outcomes you have no control over. You are the wealth and success that you seek, so you do not chase something you already are. You are being asked to be disciplined on the homework your spirit guides have appointed to you. If you know doing something is for your betterment, commit to it. Be consistent. Everything you do, act on, say, think, and believe is sacred work. You are powerful. Focus on alignment and precision. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941370.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 7 of Wands<br /></strong><br />Your ancestors are fighting for you. They are carving pathways that you did not deem possible. They are defending your names behind closed walls and protecting you from unseen dangers and setbacks. Have you taken the time to thank them and to honor them? Have you considered what incredible qualities and characteristics you’ve inherited from them that you have yet to leverage? This season is about fighting back and ensuring that you will no longer play small or be taken for granted. Enough is enough. It’s time that you show the world what you are made of. Are you going to be a victim and just accept life’s circumstances as if you have no power of your own? Or will you invoke the flames of your ancestors to accept what is rightfully yours and enjoy every minute of it? </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941371.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: Justice<br /></strong><br />Behind the scenes, your ancestors are ensuring that justice is paid off and that the scales are balancing in your favor. This season, say that powerful prayer that is known to clear the roads of obstacles and unfavorable conditions. Ask your ancestors to remove any limitations, hindrances, and unwarranted energies in your life that are keeping you from reaching your next level and are not for your highest good. Prepare for the plot twist of your life and for a new chapter to emerge with more clarity than ever. Remain in integrity with yourself and the spirit realm. If you say you will do something, do it. If you receive benevolent guidance that will accelerate your life, act on it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941372.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 6 of Swords</strong><br /><br />You’ve got the green light to move on. You are being supported by the spirit realm to make this transition and shed that energetic weight with as least resistance as possible. Anything that has been making you stuck or showing no progress, will now be alleviating itself from your life. Your ancestors are guiding the boat now, steering you toward calmer waters. Don’t look back out of guilt or nostalgia. What’s ahead is peace, clarity, and spiritual renewal. Trust the transition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941373.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: The Star</strong><br /><br />It is safe to believe again. Prior to this month, you might have questioned your desires and possibility of you actually attaining them. You may have questioned the route you are taking and whether or not you are on the right path. This season you will be shown just how aligned you are. Your ancestors are lighting the path ahead, showing you what’s possible when you believe again. This is your season to rebuild your faith, not from fantasy but from alignment with your higher purpose. You are blessed and highly favored. It is time to believe and pour into yourself so heavily that no other assumption exists. Allow yourself to shine because it is your identity. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941374.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: 4 of Swords</strong><br /><br />Rest is sacred work, and it holds the key to you attracting all that you need. The guides want you to slow down and intentionally implement old and new ways of relaxing and resting because that's how they get to speak directly to you without resistance. You need to be open and receptive to the guidance that wants to stream through. The information and downloads you receive this month are paramount to your evolution in life. Call your energy back to you and engage in practices that bring your awareness back into your body. Catch how many times your consciousness begins to wander somewhere outside of you and gently pull it back. Pause because clarity comes in stillness. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941375.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: 5 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You’re being asked to let go. Stop replaying what didn’t work or who didn’t stay. Something more glorious and aligned is on the horizon, but grief is keeping you from tapping into it. Give your sorrows, frustrations, and angst to your ancestors. Allow the emotions to be fully felt and embraced, but don’t hang onto them too long that they become a hindrance. This season, choose acceptance over attachment and seek peace. Mourn and release. Then lift your head, because the blessings ahead need your full presence and anticipation, not your pain.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941376.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 10 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />This season is about cementing your legacy through bold quantum moves. You’re not just acting from this timeline but from four timelines above it. Envision the person who already has what they want: what would that version want, and what would that other version want, and so on and so forth. Act from that space because leaping above the mundane is what’s going to set you apart and rapidly accelerate the attainment of your desires. You are not making yourself proud but breaking barriers for your entire lineage. The abundance is overflowing from you because you are secure in the embodiment of it. The amount of value you exude and provide is tremendous. Know that you are the answered prayer and everything you do moving forward will expand. Celebrate yourself and how far you’ve come. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941377.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 2 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You are being invited to learn more about yourself through your interactions and relationships with others. Your ancestors are sending mirrors: people and situations showing you how you give and receive love. Take notes. This is a time to consider if you have been providing the right energy that will foster supportive harmonious relationships and if you’ve been poured into as well from the other end. This is an optimal opportunity to allow old dynamics to shed and transform into beneficial supportive partnerships but also to call in new community and relationships that you desire. Prepare for the truth to be revealed to you and don’t run from it. Lead with your heart. You’ll know what to do. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941378.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: The Sun <br /></strong><br />You are the center of your own universe and the source of all abundance, so move like it. This is your glow up season where all eyes are on you, but, most importantly, you are shining on yourself like no other. This period is going to bring visibility, praise, recognition, joy, creative expansion, orgasms, and the successful results of doing the inner work and embodying your highest timeline. The ancestors are celebrating you and clearing the path so you are free to live your best life and, through example, show others that they can do it, too. Trust that so much is coming your way, and you will be perpetually making room for it all. You deserve it all.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941379.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Luxury is your birthright. Don’t you forget it! There are so many ways that you will choose to indulge in luxury this season that it becomes the baseline and the standard of your reality. Your ancestors are reminding you where you come from and how to shift struggle and turn it into gold. Your ability to generate abundance will be evident by the way you glow and live your life. You’ve cultivated this season of abundance through discipline, healing, and divine timing, so enjoy it! Don’t shrink your shine or apologize for your success or for choosing joy over suffering. Dress well, move with grace, and own your softness as power. You are walking proof that self-worth attracts everything.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?
