<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens loud. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st is not subtle, not chill, and definitely not interested in you playing it cool. This is the kind of Full Moon that asks, “Are you actually proud of your life right now, or are you just busy?” Emotions are heightened, egos are tender, and everyone suddenly has a realization they <em>cannot </em>keep to themselves. The challenge is not letting every feeling turn into a performance. The gift is clarity. Something reaches a peak, a reveal, or a moment of truth that says, this matters more than you’ve been admitting. </p>



<p>Adding to the shake-up, Uranus stations direct in Taurus this week, and while it may not come with fireworks, it does come with a sense of momentum finally clicking into place. Think less chaos, more “oh… this is actually happening.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">Changes around money</a>, stability, values, or long-term plans may feel more real and less theoretical now. If something has been brewing quietly for months, this is when it starts to move forward without asking for permission. The key is flexibility. Taurus energy loves comfort, Uranus loves disruption, and this week asks you to find a middle ground between clinging and completely blowing things up. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, the vibe softens as Mercury enters Pisces, giving the collective permission to stop over-explaining and start feeling things again. Logic takes a backseat to intuition, creativity, and emotional nuance. Communication becomes less about facts and more about tone, timing, and what’s <em>not </em>being said. This is a great week for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">dreaming, journaling, art</a>, and letting yourself be a little delusional in a hopeful way. Just remember, Mercury in Pisces can blur lines, so double-check details and be gentle with misunderstandings. Not everything needs an immediate answer. Some things just need space to unfold.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, are you ready to admit what actually lights you up instead of reacting to every spark that comes your way? This week starts with the Leo Full Moon, and for you it feels like a creative or emotional mic drop. Something you’ve been working on, flirting with, or quietly hoping for hits a peak, and suddenly you can’t pretend you don’t care anymore. This could be about love, joy, passion, or a project that feels very <em>you</em>. The temptation is to go full “all eyes on me” and burn yourself out trying to prove a point. The smarter move is choosing what deserves your energy instead of reacting to every feeling that shows up. Not every spark needs to become a wildfire. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus finally stations direct in Taurus, and you may notice a subtle but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">real shift around money</a>, confidence, or how secure you feel in your choices. This isn’t a lottery-ticket moment, it’s more like realizing you trust yourself again. Financial ideas or plans that felt unstable now feel workable, and you’re less interested in proving your worth to anyone. If something clicks this week, follow it, but don’t rush it. Momentum doesn’t need chaos to be powerful. </p>



<p>On Friday, Mercury enters Pisces, which is basically your cue to stop explaining yourself so much. Your intuition is louder than logic right now, and forcing clarity will only slow things down. You may feel more introspective, tired, or oddly nostalgic, even as big things are unfolding. Let that happen. This is a behind-the-scenes processing week, not a launch week. Trust that what you’re integrating now is quietly preparing you for a much louder chapter ahead.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, something you’ve been emotionally sitting with is ready to move and this week makes it impossible to keep pretending otherwise. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, and for you it lands right in your feelings. Home, family, living situations, and emotional safety are all under a bright spotlight. Something reaches a turning point, a realization, a boundary, or even a decision you’ve been avoiding because it felt “too much.” The temptation here is to dig your heels in or react defensively. The growth comes from being honest about what no longer feels supportive. You don’t need to blow anything up, but you do need to stop pretending everything is fine if it’s not. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus finally stations direct in your sign, and this is big, even if it feels quiet at first. After months of internal recalibration, identity shifts, and stop-start momentum, things begin to move forward with more confidence. You may feel clearer about who you are becoming, less reactive to other people’s expectations, and more willing to choose yourself without over-explaining. This isn’t about instant transformation. It’s about finally trusting the changes you’ve already made. If you’ve been waiting for permission to move differently, consider this it. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your mental pace and turning your attention toward friends, community, and shared dreams. Conversations feel more intuitive than logical, and you may crave emotional resonance over surface-level chatter. This is a great time to reconnect with people who <em>get </em>you or to daydream about the future without locking yourself into a plan yet. Just be mindful of mixed signals or vague commitments. You’re allowed to dream big this week, just don’t promise more than you’re ready to deliver. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, a conversation, realization, or idea is reaching a point where thinking about it is no longer enough. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and day-to-day interactions. Expect a conversation, realization, or announcement that feels bigger than you anticipated. Something you’ve been thinking about for a while finally needs to be said, shared, or decided. The danger here is talking just to fill the silence or reacting emotionally before you’ve processed the full picture. Choose intention over impulse. Your words carry extra weight right now, so make sure they reflect what you actually mean. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, intuition, and behind-the-scenes sector. This is less about external change and more about internal clarity. Insights may arrive in strange ways, dreams, random thoughts, or sudden emotional realizations that explain why you’ve been feeling restless or distracted lately. Instead of trying to logic your way through everything, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust what your intuition</a> is revealing. Something you’ve quietly outgrown becomes undeniable this week. </p>



<p>Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces on February 6th, shifting your focus toward career, reputation, and long-term goals. The vibe becomes less linear and more imaginative. You may feel inspired about your future but slightly fuzzy on the details. That’s okay. This isn’t the moment to lock in a five-year plan. It’s about letting yourself envision what success could look like without immediately editing yourself. Just double-check emails and expectations. Mercury in Pisces prefers poetry over bullet points, and misunderstandings are easier if you’re not paying attention.  </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this week asks you to get honest about what feels truly secure versus what you’ve been holding onto out of habit. The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">activating your money</a>, self-worth, and stability sector. As a moon-ruled sign, you’ll feel this one deeply. Emotions around finances, value, or what you’re giving versus receiving may rise to the surface. A purchase, payment, or realization could force you to ask, “Is this actually worth my energy?” The temptation is emotional spending or overreacting to temporary insecurity. The growth comes from recognizing how far you’ve come and choosing confidence over fear, even if things don’t feel perfectly settled yet. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. If social dynamics have felt unpredictable or exhausting over the past few months, this shift helps things stabilize in a new way. You may feel clearer about who belongs in your inner circle and which group spaces feel aligned with your future. Unexpected opportunities through friends or networks could also reappear, this time with more follow-through. Stay open, but don’t overcommit. You’re learning discernment, not withdrawal. </p>



<p>Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, harmonizing beautifully with your Cancer energy. Your intuition sharpens, your imagination expands, and you may feel drawn to dream, plan, or reflect rather than act. Conversations take on a more emotional tone, and you may feel inspired to think about travel, education, or spiritual growth. Just be mindful of assumptions. Mercury in Pisces is poetic, but not always precise. Let yourself dream big this week, but keep one foot on solid ground. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, the spotlight is on you and the real question is whether you want to perform or actually be seen. This is <em>your </em>week, Leo, and it starts exactly how you’d expect with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st lighting up your identity, confidence, and “this is who I am now” sector. Emotions are big, visibility is unavoidable, and something about you comes into full view, whether that’s a personal decision, a creative reveal, or a moment where you realize you’ve outgrown an old version of yourself. The shadow here is overreacting or taking everything personally. Not every spotlight moment requires a dramatic speech. Sometimes the power move is quiet confidence. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shaking things up in your career and public image zone, but in a way that feels more intentional than chaotic. If work, reputation, or long-term goals have felt unpredictable, this shift brings clarity around what’s actually worth building. You may realize you want something diﬀerent than you did a year ago, or that success doesn’t need to look the way you were taught it should. Expect subtle momentum rather than instant results. The key is staying flexible instead of clinging to a title or plan just because it once felt secure. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury enters Pisces, shifting your focus toward intimacy, trust, and emotional honesty. Conversations go deeper, feelings get softer, and you may crave connection over applause. This is a good time to talk about what’s <em>really </em>going on beneath the confidence, but be mindful of assumptions or mixed signals. Mercury in Pisces speaks in vibes, not bullet points. Let yourself feel without needing to define everything immediately. You don’t have to have all the answers this week. Being present is more than enough.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, the universe is quietly asking you to slow down long enough to notice what <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your body and intuition</a> have been trying to say. The week begins with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This is one of those Full Moons that doesn’t shout, it whispers… and then refuses to be ignored. You may feel more tired than usual, emotionally sensitive, or suddenly aware of something you’ve been pushing down. The temptation is to analyze the feeling away or stay busy to avoid it. The better move is rest. Seriously. Something needs closure, and clarity comes faster when you stop trying to control the process. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your expansion, learning, and belief sector. This brings forward momentum around plans involving travel, education, publishing, or a shift in perspective you’ve been circling for months. An idea that once felt too risky may now feel oddly doable. This isn’t about leaping without looking, but about trusting that growth doesn’t always come with a spreadsheet. Let curiosity guide you a little more than certainty this week. </p>



<p>As the weekend begins, Mercury, your ruling planet, enters Pisces, putting relationships and one-on-one dynamics into focus. Conversations feel more emotional and less linear, which can be… uncomfortable for you. You may need to read between the lines or sit with ambiguity instead of demanding immediate clarity. Misunderstandings are possible, but so is deeper connection. Listen with empathy, not just logic. This week reminds you that not everything needs fixing. Some things just need to be felt. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week reveals who and what actually belongs in the future you’re trying to build. The week kicks oﬀ with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, spotlighting your friendships, community, and long-term goals. A social dynamic, group project, or vision for your future reaches a turning point, and you may suddenly feel clear about who’s actually aligned with where you’re headed. The temptation is people-pleasing or trying to keep everyone happy. The growth comes from choosing authenticity over harmony-for-harmony’s-sake. Not every bridge is meant to be maintained. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. This brings a subtle but meaningful shift around trust, vulnerability, or finances tied to others. If certain emotional patterns or entanglements have felt unpredictable, this direct motion helps you regain balance and perspective. You’re less reactive and more grounded in what you’re willing to share and what you’re not. That clarity is powerful, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. </p>



<p>As the weekend kicks off, Mercury enters Pisces, turning your attention toward work, routines, and well-being. The vibe becomes softer and less structured, which may test your desire for balance and order. You may feel inspired to care for yourself in more intuitive ways, but it’s also easy to overcommit or blur boundaries. Be gentle with yourself. This is a week for adjusting rhythms, not perfecting them. Balance isn’t about doing everything, it’s about doing what actually supports you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready for things to finally click in your professional life without you having to overly control the process? The week opens with the Leo Full Moon on February 1st, lighting up your career, reputation, and visibility sector. Something comes to a head professionally, recognition, a decision, or a moment where you realize how you’re being perceived. You may feel pressure to perform or to prove yourself, but the real question is whether the path you’re on actually feels aligned. The shadow here is overworking or staying quiet about your needs. The power move is owning your accomplishments <em>and </em>your boundaries. You don’t need to downplay your talents to stay in control. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, shifting the energy in your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. If dynamics with a partner, collaborator, or close friend have felt unpredictable, this direct motion brings a sense of recalibration. Not everything is suddenly stable, but you’re clearer about what you want and what you’re no longer willing to tolerate. Conversations may feel more honest, even if they’re a little uncomfortable. This is about progress, not perfection. </p>



<p>Then on Friday the 6th Mercury enters Pisces, harmonizing with your Scorpio energy and softening the pace. Creativity, romance, and emotional expression take center stage, and you may feel more open than usual about what you want and feel. This is a great time to reconnect with pleasure, play, or a passion project, but be mindful of mixed signals or idealizing situations too quickly. Let things unfold naturally. This week reminds you that intensity doesn’t always need armor. Sometimes it just needs space. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to say yes to a bigger vision even if you don’t have all the details figured out yet? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your sector of growth, travel, learning, and belief systems, pushing a long-standing idea, plan, or desire to reach a moment of truth. You may feel inspired, restless, or eager to expand your world, but the shadow here is overpromising or assuming enthusiasm alone will carry you through. Let this Full Moon remind you that belief is powerful, but commitment is what makes it real. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing forward momentum in your work and daily routine sector. If your schedule, responsibilities, or job dynamics have felt inconsistent, this shift helps you regain traction. A new rhythm begins to form, one that asks you to work smarter, not harder. Small changes in how you manage your time or energy can have a big impact now. Stay flexible. The more open you are to doing things differently, the more freedom you actually gain.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>Then Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, drawing your attention toward home, emotional grounding, and personal space. You may crave comfort, nostalgia, or quiet reflection after a mentally busy week. Conversations with family or about living situations may feel more emotional than logical, so listen carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions. This is a good moment to slow down, recharge, and let your intuition guide you. Not every adventure requires movement. Some growth happens when you let yourself settle. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to stop carrying everything like it’s your personal responsibility to hold the world together? The Leo Full Moon on February 1st activates your intimacy, trust, and shared-resources sector, bringing a moment of truth around emotional or financial entanglements. This could look like a boundary conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or finally acknowledging where you’ve been over-giving. The shadow is shutting down or trying to control the outcome. The growth is letting yourself be supported without guilt. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, energizing your creativity, joy, and self-expression sector. If you’ve felt blocked, uninspired, or hesitant to take a risk with something you love, momentum starts returning. This isn’t about reckless leaps, but about remembering that pleasure and play are not distractions from success. They’re fuel. Let yourself experiment without needing a perfect plan. </p>



<p>As the weekend hits, Mercury enters Pisces, softening your communication style and inviting more emotional nuance into conversations. You may find yourself speaking from the heart rather than the spreadsheet, which is a shift, but a healthy one. Just double-check details and expectations. Not everything needs to be finalized this week. Some ideas just need room to breathe. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, yes, this week is about you, but not in the way you’re used to. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st lights up your relationship sector, bringing clarity around partnerships, situationships, or close collaborations. Something reaches a peak, a decision, a realization, or an emotional moment you can’t intellectualize your way out of. The shadow is detachment or defensiveness. The lesson is presence. You don’t lose your independence by being emotionally available. </p>



<p>Then on February 3rd, Uranus, your modern ruler, stations direct in Taurus, shifting energy around home, family, and emotional foundations. Things that felt unstable or uncertain start making more sense, even if they’re still evolving. You may feel clearer about where you belong or what kind of support you actually need. This isn’t about locking things down. It’s about choosing stability on your own terms. </p>



<p>As Mercury enters Pisces on February 6th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">your focus turns toward money</a>, values, and self-worth. Conversations around finances or priorities may feel less logical and more emotional. Trust your intuition, but don’t ignore practical details. This week asks you to align your values with your choices, not just your ideas. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week asks you to be honest about what’s draining you versus what’s actually sustaining you. The Leo Full Moon on February 1st illuminates your work, health, and daily routine sector, bringing a realization about habits, obligations, or responsibilities that need adjusting. You may feel called to do less, not more. The shadow is martyrdom. The growth is choosing yourself without needing permission. </p>



<p>On February 3rd, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing momentum to your communication, mindset, and learning sector. If conversations have felt stuck or plans unclear, things begin moving forward with more confidence. Ideas land diﬀerently now. You may feel more willing to speak up or share something you’ve been sitting on. Trust that your voice matters, even if it shakes a little. </p>



<p>As the weekend arrives, Mercury enters your sign, putting your thoughts, feelings, and intuition front and center. You’re more expressive, imaginative, and emotionally tuned in, but also more sensitive to tone and energy. This is a great time to journal, create, or talk things through with someone you trust. Just remember, not every feeling needs immediate action. Some insights unfold when you give them space. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956402.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=681&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A681"" /><figcaption>Full moon at midnight and dark blue sky with clouds. Spooky dark night sky view. The moon was covered with clouds and its reflection was on the water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Get ready to roar! The Full Snow Moon in Leo on February 1st demands that we take charge. How? By fighting for fairness and equality, while simultaneously asking us to care for others with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-are-not-an-empath"">compassion and empathy</a> (sharing this with our frenemies and nemeses will be hard, but valuable in teaching them to be kind). The remedy for upsets is to be sympathetic and fierce, making tough love the best approach. If we are going from a pure position, we can make the world and our lives a more magical and tender place to be. First, we have to be aggressive and loud to be effective in getting the word out about the causes we believe in to ensure people are listening. </p>



<p>The Snow Moon marks a time of renewal in the depths of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to the weather, the world slows down, allowing us to be more introspective and mindful of the world around us — particularly how we feel on the inside about partnerships and life. By tapping into our internal resources, we can find the strength to make the necessary changes and the stamina to carry them through the season. Centering our energy on what’s important helps us realize that a lot of what we focus on isn’t. Clearing our minds gives us the clarity we need to grow and evolve. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo is a divine time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifesting-magical-thinking-control-reality-goals"">set intentions and manifest</a>. If we are illuminating and honoring the repressed parts of ourselves that want to come out, we are on track. We can move forward and soldier on after we release the hidden aspects of our personality and creativity by putting them into play. We’re deciding not to back down and to strive for happiness — no matter how messy the journey is to get there. The destination is going to be bumpy, but worth it in the end.  </p>



<p>With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> opposing the Full Moon in Leo, it will be easy to get caught up in drama. Mars is known to instigate affairs, particularly by bringing up past situations. As a result, a line will be drawn in the sand, asking us to fight or take flight. We will be able to choose who is a friend or foe, and how we wish to participate in the matter. We might be pulled into a dynamic that pushes us to exert our frustrations or take the higher ground. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> quarrels for what it’s most passionate about — particularly social injustice. If we feel that there is something that isn’t right for the community at large or even for ourselves in personal relationships, then we will get on our soapbox and take a stand.  </p>



<p>The truth is coming out, allowing us to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. Our perception of others may change — not necessarily for the better. Knowing that we have been misled or need to step up protective measures might feel like a dagger to the heart, since we’ve been open and genuine with those who aren’t. Rather than dwell, use it as a learning curve. The lesson is to put a boundary on the relationship to ensure it never transpires again. Fool us once, shame on them; fool us twice, it’s not ever happening. Words of advice: Do not feel bad about your part; understand that you can and will overcome anything in time. Never dwell on matters that are in the rearview mirror. </p>



<p>Reflect on the matter at hand and conclude what or who deserves our attention and affection. Even though the Snow Moon is slightly chaotic, Leo energy focuses on our heartfelt sensations. Yes, there are letdowns, but the reason we’re feeling them so intensely is that we are hot-blooded creatures, full of emotions and passions. Our desires guide our actions, and our sentiments dictate our reactions. Do not hold back. Say what’s on your mind. Vocalizing the voice within is a great way to be heard and seen. If you’re using it, that is what counts most.  </p>

<p>Fashion is starting to undergo a major shift. In 2026, as with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2026-innovator-awards"">beauty</a> moving away from the pared-down “clean girl” makeup trend, fashion is moving away from the mainstream minimalism of recent years. In its place is a moodier and maximal sensibility. What does this mean for jeans? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2025"">Denim trends</a> are going to inspire you to have way <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">more fun as you get dressed</a> in the months ahead.<br /><br />One theme in particular is ruling over all popular 2026 denim: exaggeration. Prepare to take up space in baggy, inflated silhouettes with playful proportions. “Comfort is a huge factor, but there’s also something about the relaxed look that just feels more modern right now,” <a href=""https://www.pistoladenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pistola Denim</a> founder Grace Na tells Refinery29.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10820638/are-skinny-jeans-in-style-2022"">Skinny jeans</a> aren’t completely out of the picture — don’t let us stop you if they’re your favorites — but tight, figure-hugging styles certainly won’t be dominating the conversation this year. Ultimately: “Jeans should flex with how you feel, where you’re going, and who you want to be that day or even that moment of your day,” <a href=""https://lagence.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Agence</a> fashion director Tara Rudes Dann says. <br /><br />Ahead, meet the top 2026 denim trends to welcome into your wardrobe, as well as some useful shopping picks. But this isn’t an experiment you have to test alone: We spoke to the forces behind some of our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">favorite brands</a> to break down the looks, why they’re popular, and how to style them.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Barrel Jeans, With A Twist</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957183.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-barrel-leg-jeans"">Barrel-leg jeans</a> came into the zeitgeist just a few years ago as a funky denim trend with questionable longevity. Yet naysayers should take heed that this silhouette is very much here to stay. This fashion-forward style features a very noticeable curve from the hip to the ankle, and that distinct shape is only going to keep getting more visible in the months ahead.<br /><br />It’s worth noting that barrel jeans are also sometimes called a horseshoe or balloon jean, though the latter is a more exaggerated version of the look. “It plays with volume in a really fresh way and adds a bit of fashion energy without feeling too intimidating,” Pistola’s Na says of the barrel-adjacent balloon.<br /><br />Rather than intimidate you, you might find that barrel jeans are incredibly versatile when it comes to styling. Pair them with a blazer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-polo-shirts"">polo shirt,</a> and heels for an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">office-ready look</a>, or try them with a cool-girl leather jacket and sneakers for brunch with friends.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Wide-Leg Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957184.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>We’ve been seeing lots of volume in pants and jeans from plenty of brands, so it’s no surprise that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wide-leg-jeans-women"">wide-leg denim</a> will be all over your social feeds and in your favorite stores in 2026. This comfortable cut was, after all, the viral opening look in <a href=""https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/collection/metiers-art-2026/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel’s Métiers d’art 2026 show</a> — you know, the one held in a New York City subway station. Rather than hugging the body anywhere, this year’s class of wide-leg jeans shoot out from the waistband. These baggier silhouettes look great on everyone, and especially for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">petite wearers</a>, a higher-sitting waist can help elongate the legs.<br /><br />“The baggy jean can be styled with a heel for a tailored look or worn with a sneaker for a weekend-ready look,” <a href=""https://paige.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paige</a> co-founder and creative director Paige Adams-Geller says. The degree of baggy? Well, that’s buyer’s choice, and there’s a range of what’s available.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Straight-Leg &amp; Cigarette Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957185.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Skinny jeans may not be as ubiquitous as they were during the hipster heyday of the 2010s, but skinny-ish silhouettes are still in vogue. Straight-leg and cigarette jeans (darlings of the ‘80s and ‘90s) are the top nominees here. Though these two silhouettes are very similar, thanks to their slim fit that goes straight down the leg, they differ in one key spot: cigarette jeans taper at the ankle.<br /><br />The range of trends in the denim space are also a net positive for both your closet and a denim brand’s creativity. “It is exciting for us as designers but also for women because they can wear whatever suits them,” Tim Kaeding, co-founder of <a href=""https://www.motherdenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mother Denim</a>, tells Refinery29. “It isn’t like previous decades where one fit is dominating everything. It really is a cross-section between skinny and baggy.”<br /><br />Straight-leg and cigarette jeans work best in outfits that are all about clean lines — for one such example, look to <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/valentino-spring-2026-ready-to-wear-collection-1238281150/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valentino’s Spring/Summer 2026 collection</a>. Try adding a structured blazer or, for balance, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">soft cardigan</a>. If you’re on the shorter side, it can be extra helpful to have these jeans tailored at the hem to ensure there’s no pooling at your feet. In a pinch, wearing heels or using some iron-on hemming tape can also help.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Maxing Out</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957186.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mirroring the longer and looser denim styles ruling the year, skirts are going midi and maxi. (If you love your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-denim-skirts"">denim mini skirt</a>, simply stash it in storage — we’re sure it’ll come back in a few years.) The coolest denim skirts feature unique details like cool-enhancing asymmetric hems. Gravitating toward a more classic shape? Try a new-to-your-closet denim wash to mix things up.<br /><br />There are endless ways to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-skirts-over-jeans"">style these skirts</a>, whether girly, sporty, or something else. We like pairing ours with a moto jacket and combat boots for some edge. A button-up, on the other hand, projects a more polished vibe.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Contemporary Bootcut Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957187.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Raise your hand if you got  rid of any <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bootcut-jeans-women"">bootcut jeans</a> you had left over from the early aughts. (We did too.) Yet, while the style is one of the major denim trends to watch in 2026, the new class of bootcut styles is far more modern than the jeans of yore. Instead of a distinct slim-to-flare cut, the refreshed bootcut is more subtle. Best of all, comfortable high-waisted styles are as easy to source as low-rise inseams that all but scream “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/addison-rae-style-summer-outfits"">Y2K</a>.” <br /><br />“She’s confident, sexy and incredibly flattering,” L’Agence’s Rudes Dann says of the style. After all: “women want jeans that celebrate curves and command attention.”<br /><br />Making bootcut jeans feel current is also about how you style them — and no, you aren’t expected to only wear them with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">boots</a>. Rock these jeans with loafers or pointed-toe heels for an elevated silhouette. For a more casual outfit, pair them with a white T-shirt, cool jacket, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">skinny-soled sneakers</a>.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Think Beyond Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957188.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Your legs aren’t the only place where denim can make a maximum impact. Expect to see designers use the material for shirts, dresses, and accessories in 2026. <br /><br />Want to rock a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-festival-outfit-ideas"">Canadian tuxedo</a> or channel Britney Spears’ iconic <a href=""https://people.com/style/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-matching-denim-moment-20th-anniversary/"">denim-princess ballgown</a>? That’ll be easier than ever as brands continue to crank out shoes, bags, and outerwear all made with denim. Denim cowboy boots? Yes, (and thank you, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-outfits"">Beyoncé</a>). A crossbody bag made from the same material? Never no.<br /><br />“Denim jackets are showing up in sharper shapes in addition to the classic jean jacket,” Rudes Dann says of the all-denim everything trend of 2026. “Think bomber silhouettes and tailored blazers that feel structured but still easy and chic.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Jorts</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957191.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Think of today’s most popular <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anthropologie-pilcro-denim-jorts-review"">jorts</a> — a portmanteau for jean shorts — as wide-leg denim… for warmer weather. This style, which usually fits loose and hits below the knee if not right above it, is a seasonal interpretation of this year’s theme of comfort and ease. Style these with a snug shirt for proportional balance, or wear them with an oversized graphic tee to go full Adam Sandler. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Decorations &amp; Details</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957189.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Understated and unembellished jeans won’t ever lose their luster, but denim with an extra bit of flair is quickly becoming a favorite for the style-obsessed. Utility-inspired styles, like carpenter jeans, are staying mainstream, as are spunky styles that are decked out in embellishments. Pair these with a basic tee, jacket, and kicks to really let the jeans shine.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennettemccurdy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jennette McCurdy</a>’s memoir <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/relieved-dad-died-grief-after-emotional-abuse"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> left me in tears. So, when I heard that the actress turned author was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_dgS5rHts0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">releasing a new book</a>, her first novel, I was excited. <em><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366244-i-m-glad-my-mom-died"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> is brutally honest and refreshingly straightforward and I knew McCurdy’s first foray into fiction would bring the same energy. </p>



<p>The book, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">called </a><em><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half His Age</a></em>, follows Waldo, a 17-year-old who has a relationship with a teacher 23 years her senior. The book deals with the nuances and power imbalance of an age-gap affair and was partly inspired by a relationship McCurdy had herself. But at its core, the novel is about Waldo and her need for love, validation, acceptance, and how she fights for her own sense of power. </p>

<p><strong>Refinery29: Jennette, after writing your amazing memoir, <em>I’m Glad My Mom Died,</em></strong><strong> how did you decide that this was the next step in your journey as a writer?  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jennette McCurdy:</strong> Oh boy. I have a very writerly answer to this. I used to not understand when authors talked this way, but now I completely understand. It was a thing that demanded to be written. You know, I was actually writing another thing, and <em>Half His Age</em> was kind of like pushing itself up on me, and I couldn’t stop thinking about Waldo. I said, “You know, I’ll give it a week.” I’ll let it run its course. I’ll probably grow tired of it, and then I’ll just go back to this other thing. And then, 30 days later, I had a first draft, and I immediately went into a second draft, then a third, and fourth, until it was just finished. There was no choice. And I think that’s always a good sign, right? For me, that’s always an experience with creativity. The one that’s pushing itself up on me, it’s the one that gets done. That’s just how it goes. </p>



<p><strong>How much does Waldo believe that she has this relationship with her teacher under </strong><strong><em>her</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>control? And why is it important for you to show that nuance even tho</strong><strong>ugh </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>he’s</strong><strong> clearly not in </strong><strong>control because she’s a minor?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I really tried to avoid being moralistic in the writing itself and to be more subtle than that. Okay, this isn’t very subtle, but I’ll say it. Waldo is very aggressive and is very forward and is, at times, you know, throwing herself at this man. He is still a 40-year-old man who should know better. I never stated in the book, but I’ll state it here now. I really wanted to show this young woman who really believes she is in control and is really fighting to be in control and clawing for some form of power. She’s still so vulnerable. She’s still at an age that is so vulnerable. And yet at that age, you’re not necessarily aware of your limitations, of the places where you’re particularly naive or susceptible to outside influences. You don’t know those things. I really think it was so important to me to show it through her eyes completely because. Most of us reading it are going to be a bit older, and we know what it’s like to be 17. We know what it’s like not to be in that naive position, and to be that susceptible to influence. We have all been there. It was so important to me to do it completely through her eyes.   </p>



<p><strong>Yes. We also know what it’s like to think we know everything when we really know nothing. You’ve said that one of the main themes of this book is female rage. What do you mean when you say female rage? And why do you feel it’s important to explore that theme?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Thank you for this question. I would love to hear what female rage is to you. Female rage to me is having your boundaries violated over and over and over and over and over again, and not having access to the language, the tools to advocate for yourself. Being afraid to advocate for yourself. Told not to advocate for yourself, to be polite, to be nice, to make things easy, to not be difficult. So, you continue doing that and playing that role over and over again. Then your boundaries are still violated over and over and over again, and it compounds for years until, inevitably, the rage starts to crop up and come out in unexpected ways. There’s no choice but to start confronting it and understanding not only its roots, but also how to ideally channel it properly moving forward. This was such an important theme for me to explore. I think we all have a lot of female rage. You tell me if you disagree. Do you have it? </p>

<p><strong>JM: </strong>It’s something we all know so well, and yet I haven’t really felt the social conversation go there the way I wish it would. I think there’s so much value in our rage if we can access it, if we’re not hiding it and doing the thing where we’re suppressing and being polite and pretty and nice and whatever. If we’re able to go, I’<em>m fucking angry, and here’s what  I’m angry about.</em> Oh my God, that’s when it moves through you. That’s when it leads to decisions you can make that are actually helpful for your life. And Waldo is not there yet. She’s not at the place where she can make those helpful decisions. She is 17. She’s in the throes of it, and she doesn’t even realize the extent of it. And it is fueling her decisions so much without her even realizing it. Her drive for sex. Her need for Korgy. Her need for things. For clothing. All of it is so charged by rage and shame. I really hope it will open up a broader conversation about what we can do with our rage and how we can find empowering ways of utilizing it.  </p>



<p><strong>Yes, I think that is something we should talk more about. We should be allowed to feel pure anger. There are so many things set up to make us angry, and I should be allowed to curse somebody out.  </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> There are some lovely men. All gays are great. There are some straights who are lovely. <em>[laughs]</em> I’m with an amazing one.  But I think a lot of times, their fear of our emotions can really cause us to sort of suppress and wanna be polite and keep going in that inauthentic way. Who can hold our rage? A) Ourselves and B) Other women. I have never felt more at ease and safe in my rage than when I explore it with other women and talk about it. Having those deep, thoughtful conversations about what it is we’re so angry about, what the root of it is, what it might be actively that’s in our life that’s causing it to resurface, and how we can move forward in a way that is productive and healthy. </p>

<p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat is the best way for us to express our female rage? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I think it can be different for everybody. Something that might be somewhat universal, I’d say, is having a creative outlet. For me, it’s writing. I think I write really effectively from a place of anger. It’s when I do the most charged writing that I think connects the most. It can be a variety of things, but I think creativity is one place. A genuine conversation is another place for it. Surprise!<em> [laughs]</em> That shouldn’t be shocking. Just talking it out and not pretending to be <em>happy, happy, happy</em> and <em>grateful, grateful, grateful</em> all the time. That is crazy making. </p>



<p><strong>It is, as they call it, toxic positivity</strong><strong>.  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Yes.   </p>



<p><strong>If you could explain</strong><em><strong> Half His Age</strong></em><strong> using the five senses, what would they be? For example, it sounds like this, it feels like this.   </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Ooh, okay. It feels like skin. Sweaty skin, particularly sweaty, hairy skin. It sounds like a train, like the force of a train. Potentially about to crash. We see a train coming the opposite way. The two trains are coming at the same time. That’s what it sounds like.  </p>



<p><strong>If train A sta</strong><strong>rts </strong><strong>here and train B starts there, when will they collide</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>JM:</strong> Exactly. What does it smell like? My mind went to sweat again, but I’ll say it smells like… I can’t say where my mind was <em>[laughs].</em> I’ll say it: it smells like a certain bodily fluid. It tastes like sour patch kids. And it looks like desolate landscapes of Alaska, and then I’m thinking extreme close-ups of sex. It’s not like we’re seeing a romanticized shot where it’s hot and steamy. It’s like we’re seeing a close-up of an arm. We’re seeing that gut. We’re just seeing the body hanging by itself. We’re seeing cellulite, we’re seeing makeup-less faces, we’re seeing lips, and we’re seeing drool. Just kind of the visceral, disgusting elements of sex.   </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957147.jpg?width=779&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=779%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>What is it like to be so vulnerable publicly and share so much of yourself? Does it make it easier or harder that you’ve been in the spotlight for so long?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I’m really glad that I had years where I was not in the spotlight. No social media app was on my phone. I was in a cave writing for quite a few years. Not even considering the public eye in any way, shape, or form. And then being back into it as an adult has been really interesting, fun, and at times complicated, but I do lead with vulnerability. Honesty is an important value of mine. Authenticity. It’s just who I am. It would feel so bad to show up here, sit opposite you, to be somebody who I’m not. Be some performative thing that I’m not. And then after the fact, you know, closing the Zoom and shutting the laptop and then being a completely different person. It wouldn’t work for me, to be honest. I certainly have things for myself and things I keep to myself, but I do believe vulnerability is useful to others and an important value of mine.   </p>



<p><strong>Since this book is inspired by a real-life experience </strong><strong>you’ve</strong><strong> had, where does Jennette start, and where does Waldo stop? </strong><strong>How are you similar to each other</strong><strong> and h</strong><strong>ow are you different from each other</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I was in a significant age-gap relationship. When I was 18, I had my first foray into the world of relationships. On a personal level, that influenced some aspects of Waldo’s relationship with Korgy and a lot of my unprocessed anger from that relationship. Waldo is entirely her own character. This story is entirely its own. And there’s something really  freeing and really fun about it that I loved. I certainly want to write more fiction. I’m sure people will project me onto it in certain ways, and that’s fine if people do, but I really hope that if they can, they read it entirely as its own piece of work in its own world. It’s own set of characters. I think it would be a misread to put too much of me on it, to be honest.   </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I hope [<em>Half His Age]</em> makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable… I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p><cite>jennette mccurdy</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I think </strong><strong>it’s</strong><strong> great that you </strong><strong>can</strong><strong> tell people, “No,</strong><strong> Waldo is a character. This is fiction.” Who would you say this book is not for, and who is it for?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM: </strong>I wanna say it’s not for somebody who’s suppressing a lot and has sort of muted emotions. I don’t think it would work for them. I think it’s certainly for people with big emotions. For anybody who’s ever embarrassed themselves or humiliated themselves in a relationship to try to have their needs met, to try to win the affection of somebody who didn’t love them back the way that they needed or so craved. It’s for anybody who’s ever felt deeply lonely. I think there’s so much loneliness that comes through in this. You know, we mentioned rage. Anybody with unprocessed or processed rage. All rage is welcome here. </p>



<p><strong>What do you want people to take away from this book after they put it down? </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> closing it. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> done. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> crying. What am I taking away? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> A theme of this conversation has been rage, and I don’t want to harp on it too much. But I do hope it helps people process some of that, and that it leads to conversations about rage. It’s a hope of mine that anything I write will help people find closure, maybe in places where there wasn’t any, and in their own experiences. I hope it’s a source of connection, and I hope it’s a place to process uncomfortable feelings. I hope it makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable and so much to glean from that. So, I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p>



<p><strong>You have to sit in the uncomfortable to find the comfortable. Can’t just have one without the other. I think that’s what people forget. </strong> </p>



<p><strong>Your TV adaptation of <em>I’m</em></strong><strong><em> Gl</em></strong><strong><em>ad </em></strong><strong><em>My Mom Died</em></strong><strong> is in the works. Congratulations! How is that process going? Are there any secrets you can tell me?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I don’t think I can share any secrets. Top-level, locked-in-a-box stuff <em>[laughs]. </em>It’s been really interesting. I can say I have a really clear vision for what the show is. I have had this vision for years. It’s not only my life story; it’s inspired by the memoir, and knowing that the memoir has touched so many people in such a significant and profound way is so important to me to get the adaptation right. To me, that means making sure every member of that team fully understands that vision and that we’re all on the same page. And I’m not in any rush. It doesn’t matter to me how long it takes. It’s gotta be done right.   </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957041.jpg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m not <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-marriage-proposal-celebration-anxiety"">engaged</a>. And yet, somehow, I took my boyfriend to what might be our future wedding destination. I had started wedding planning without meaning to.</p>



<p>When the invitation to visit <a href=""https://ranchosantana.com/""><strong>Rancho Santana</strong></a> landed in my inbox, the subject line stopped me in my tracks: <em>Nicaragua</em>. It wasn’t a place I had ever imagined myself visiting let alone falling in love with, but I’m always down for the ride. So I said yes, packed my bags, and invited my boyfriend along to help photograph the trip.</p>



<p>From the moment we landed, the experience felt elevated. A private car service picked us up and drove us two hours through the countryside of Nicaragua, eventually arriving at a secluded paradise I didn’t even know existed. At Rancho Santana, we were greeted with welcome drinks, cool towels, and the kind of hospitality that instantly makes you exhale. The entrance alone felt cinematic: a hacienda-style courtyard opening up to sweeping ocean views. That was my first thought: <em>This place feels heaven-sent.</em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957061.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>What I didn’t realize and what my boyfriend found out shortly after we arrived was that the rest of our group consisted entirely of wedding planners and wedding photographers. The side-eye was immediate. I promised him it wasn’t a setup, but once you experience Rancho Santana, the confusion makes sense. This is the wedding venue of your dreams. Whether you’re envisioning a beach ceremony, an intimate chapel moment, or vows exchanged at golden hour, the resort offers every version of romance that is thoughtfully designed and effortlessly executed. Our group included some of California’s most talented wedding and event planners, including <a href=""https://www.rheefined.com/"">Jason Rhee</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charleybluebell/?hl=en"">Charley King</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artandsoulevents/"">Jessica Carrillo</a>, <a href=""https://thomasbuilifestyle.com/"">Thomas Bui,</a> and <a href=""https://nahidglobal.com/services-2/"">Nahid Farhoud</a>, along with photographers <a href=""https://emilywren.com/"">Emily Wren</a> and <a href=""https://clanegessel.com/"">The Clane Gessel Studio</a>. As the only journalist on the trip, I felt incredibly honored to be with such great talent.</p>



<p>And then there was the itinerary… which did <em>not</em> help my case.</p>



<p>Our room had a private terrace (by the way, every room does), mornings started with oceanfront breakfasts while surfers rode the waves below, and evenings were filled with sunset cocktail hours followed by candlelit dinners with gorgeous table decor. Night one felt less like a welcome dinner and more like an engagement dinner, for guests we hadn’t invited.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957134.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The next day, we toured the full property, and that’s when everything clicked. In addition to resort rooms, Rancho Santana offers over 20 private residences that can accommodate anywhere from six to eighty guests. It’s an ideal option for weddings or milestone celebrations that feel both intimate and expansive. Guests still receive full access to the resort’s amenities, including butler service, three restaurants, a café, a pool bar with cabanas, and a local market.</p>



<p>One night, we attended an all-white themed dinner at one of the restaurants. Between the unreal sunset backdrop and the stunning decor by local designers, you couldn’t convince me it wasn’t a rehearsal dinner. At one point, we were on the dance floor and the entire group cheered us on as the “newlyweds for the night.” I was nervous about how my boyfriend would react,  until I looked over and saw that he was having just as much fun as I was.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957075.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The running joke throughout the trip was that he might as well just marry me right then and there. The planners were ready. The photographers were on site. The venue was flawless. Low-key, I was like, “yesss, let the inspiration marinate!” And while I was joking, I was also quietly taking notes.</p>



<p>Beyond the romance, the resort delivers unforgettable experiences like horseback riding along the beach, bird and monkey nature tours, surf lessons, sandboarding, and a hands-on ceramics class. Each day somehow outdid the last.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957077.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our final day, they staged a full wedding — complete with a bride, a chapel ceremony, a saxophone player, cocktail hour, and a reception dinner inside one of the eight-bedroom homes. There was a live band. a private chef, and a level of detail that felt impossible to top.</p>



<p>By the end of the trip, we were both joking (but lowkey serious) about living there someday. I’ve always known I wanted a destination wedding. I just didn’t know where. Without realizing it, I spent five days experiencing exactly what that dream could look like, in a country I had never considered visiting. Nicaragua <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/singapore-vacation-travel-experience-black-woman"">surprised me</a> in the best way. Between the people, the culture, and the undeniable magic of Rancho Santana, I’d recommend it for a wedding, a milestone birthday, or simply a luxurious reset. As for my boyfriend? Let’s just say manifestation is real. Now the only thing left to figure out is how I accidentally plan my way onto a private jet next.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor, it’s my job to test beauty treatments, but there are only a handful that I’m really obsessed with. Sure, there are tons of interesting options out there, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED facials</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skinvive-injectable-moisturizer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">injectable moisturizer</a>, but few are genuinely innovative and game-changing (in my opinion, the single most overused phrase in the beauty industry).  </p>



<p>Without a doubt, one of those innovations and my can’t-live-without product is builder in a bottle, which you may also know as BIAB nails. I’ll even bet money on you trying it and loving it. Here’s everything you need to know about the new nail treatment sweeping salons everywhere. </p>



<h2>What are BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>BIAB (also known as builder gel) was developed by the brand <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Gel Bottle</a>. Creative nail expert and content creator, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/SadieJNails/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sadie Jordan,</a> always uses BIAB on her clients: “It’s a [curable] gel nail enhancement designed to add strength and structure to your natural nails, helping them to grow out without breaking as easily,” says Jordan. She adds that BIAB is more viscous than gel polish. “It allows you to build an apex — the highest part of a nail enhancement, most visible from the side angle — which is what makes your nail more durable.”  </p>



<p>BIAB is layered on top of your natural nail (whatever the length) to lend strength and prevent breakage. BIAB comes in a range of different colors, but the most popular tends to be clear or neutral pink. It can be used as a base coat (with gel polish layered over the top, including nail art) or applied on its own.  </p>

<h2>What are the benefits of BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>The main benefit of BIAB is the ability to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">grow your natural nails</a> underneath. Even long-term nail-biters, or those whose nails are prone to breakage, tend to have success with growth. What’s more, countless BIAB nail looks can be achieved without glue or plastic tips, says Jordan. This means you can have long-lasting manicures with a similar removal process to regular gel by simply filing away the top layer and soaking off the product with acetone. </p>



<p>Another benefit of BIAB is that it can be used alongside <a href=""https://www.thegelbottle.com/shop/37364-pro-nail-forms.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">nail forms</a> (a paper or foil tip) to repair chipped corners. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between BIAB nails, traditional gel, Gel-X nails, and acrylics?  </h2>



<p>It can be hard to tell, but there are differences between BIAB, traditional gel, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/apres-gel-x-nail-extensions"">Gel-X</a>, and acrylics. </p>



<p>Gel nail polish was <a href=""https://www.cnd.com/"">developed by CND</a> under the brand name Shellac and is a liquid polish that is cured and hardened under a UV lamp. Curing makes gel polish chip-resistant and gives it a longer wear.  </p>



<p>BIAB is a form of gel polish that has a stronger base — this is why it assists growth. An upside of BIAB is that it can be soaked off just like gel polish. Both gel polish and BIAB give that incredible, long-lasting shine that regular nail polish can’t achieve. </p>



<p>Gel-X is a gel nail extension system developed by Aprés Nails, where full-cover tips are bonded to the natural nail with gel and cured under a UV lamp, then shaped to your preference. BIAB doesn’t require tips. Instead, it’s applied onto the natural nail.  </p>



<p>Acrylics are created using liquid monomer and powder polymer, which should be mixed carefully by your nail tech. Acrylics don’t need curing under a lamp and harden within a few minutes. If you’re someone who loves really long nails, acrylics tend to be a sturdier option. One similarity between BIAB and acrylics is that once the nail starts to grow out, you can get an infill (where product is applied to the nail growth area).  </p>



<p>So what’s the best technique? It all depends on your budget, what your nail tech offers, the outcome and length you’re looking for, as well as your activity level, or how much you use your hands. </p>

<h2>How long do BIAB nails last? </h2>



<p>Luxury nail artist and beauty professional <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charlotteemilybeauty_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Emily</a> explains that most of her clients come in every three weeks to maintain their BIAB nails. But she notes that if there’s proper nail prep, a BIAB set can last for much longer. That said, keeping BIAB nails on for longer than four weeks isn’t recommended, as lifting can allow water to get trapped beneath the gel and encourage bacterial growth. After three or four weeks, BIAB nails can either be infilled or soaked off.  </p>



<h2>Is there anyone who shouldn’t have BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>Both Emily and Jordan note that those with extremely damaged nails (for example, very thin, extremely brittle, and lifting away from the nail bed) shouldn’t get BIAB nails. In some cases, those with conditions like psoriasis may also want to avoid BIAB nails. “Applying BIAB directly to a severely damaged nail bed can cause heat spikes — a stinging sensation on the nail bed — and the product should not come into contact with skin,” says Jordan.  </p>



<p>A qualified nail tech will let you know whether you’re a suitable candidate for BIAB and can create a treatment plan that’s best suited to your nails. Happily, Emily said she’s never had to turn anyone away from BIAB nails.  </p>

<h2>Are there any downsides to BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>“BIAB does take a little longer to soak off compared to gel polish,” says Jordan, but as long as the top coat is filed and broken down, this isn’t a major issue. “It can also make your nails grow out very fast,” she adds, “so you may need to have manicures more frequently if you don’t like the look of regrowth.”  </p>



<p>At present, BIAB has no downsides for Emily. “My clients and I are happy with the results, and it has created a low-maintenance manicure which is great for a busy lifestyle,” she says.   </p>

<h2>Where can you get BIAB nails, and how much do BIAB nails cost?  </h2>



<p>Today, BIAB is just as widely available as gel polish — if you’re unsure, simply call your local nail salon and ask specifically for the treatment.  </p>



<p>The cost of nails always depends on where you live, with cities being the most expensive. In New York and LA, for example, a typical price range for basic BIAB is between $40 to $80. </p>

<p>Something’s been amiss when I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wash my hair</a>. Instead of the odd few strands escaping — totally normal, by the way — my hands have been filled with near-chunks of hair. It’s a conundrum I can’t crack, because at a glance my hair still looks <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">long and healthy</a>; it just seems that I’m losing more of it. And I’m not the only one. Countless friends have texted me in a panic, convinced their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/female-pattern-hair-loss-baldness-experience"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair is coming out</a> more than usual. Interestingly, TikTok’s hair experts appear to have diagnosed it. Apparently, we’re all experiencing the big <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@abbeyyung/video/7546699386563120414"">winter hair shed</a>. </p>



<p>If I weren’t going through it myself, I’d have assumed winter hair shedding was a myth. I mean, how many more things — besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dry hands</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cracked lips</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dull-skin-causes-dermatologist-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dull skin</a> — can we take? But reaching out to my little black book of experts has proven otherwise. On the plus side, there’s usually nothing to worry about, but here’s everything I’ve learned from the pros about managing it.  </p>



<h2>Firstly, what is hair shedding — and is it normal? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dermatologist_adel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Aamna Adel</a>, consultant dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooOoT-AkJdIvdreb1LWiY2WzlEBHvpTercvOTYFAfbdSZM0Rq0Q"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute hair</a>, says that hair shedding is a normal part of the growth cycle: “Each hair on your scalp goes through phases of growth (otherwise known as anagen), transition (catagen), and rest (telogen).” Dr. Adel adds, “At the end of the cycle, the hair sheds to make room for a new one to grow in. So yes, some shedding is completely normal and happens continuously.” </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/afopeatoyebi/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</a>, a certified trichologist and cosmetic chemist, adds that on a healthy scalp, anything between 10 to 15% of total hairs are in the telogen or exogen phase at any given point in time, which means that some hair shedding is natural all year round. “It’s normal to shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day,” says Atoyebi, but she adds that this shouldn’t be confused with hair fall from breakage. “This is where the hair shaft fractures, as opposed to falls, from the root,” she explains. You can usually tell the difference because broken hairs are shorter, while hairs that have been shed naturally tend to have a white bulb at the end. </p>



<p>While some shedding is natural, Atoyebi says how much you lose can be influenced by things like stress, illness, nutritional deficiencies — including low protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B12 — as well as hormonal changes, such as pregnancy or certain forms of hormonal contraception. Dr. Adel says that if your hair is thicker or longer, or if you skip hair washing, shedding might appear more obvious. </p>



<p>Some evidence suggests telogen — the resting phase — varies slightly across ethnicities, says Atoyebi. But there’s no data showing that shedding changes with hair type. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but the increased shedding people might notice could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors like stress and nutritional deficiencies.</p><cite>certified trichologist Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Is winter hair shedding real? How can you manage it? </h2>



<p>Dr. Adel notes that many people notice increased shedding in winter, and that there could be a handful of reasons why. First, what she calls seasonal hair cycling: “Some studies suggest more hairs enter the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320509854_Seasonality_of_hair_loss_a_time_series_analysis_of_Google_Trends_data_2004_to_2016"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">shedding phase in autumn</a> and early winter, possibly as a delayed response to summer UV exposure,” says Dr. Adel.  </p>



<p>Second, a dry scalp and hair: “Cold air outside and central heating indoors strip moisture from the scalp, which can disrupt the scalp barrier,” explains Dr. Adel. Last, lifestyle changes: “Reduced sunlight (and therefore vitamin D), higher stress levels, and nutritional changes during winter can all play a role,” says Dr. Adel. She emphasizes that winter shedding is usually temporary, not true hair loss. </p>



<p>Atoyebi says that winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but she echoes that the increased shedding lots of people might notice in winter could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors: “Think stress, illness, and hormonal and nutritional imbalances that commonly accompany the season,” says Atoyebi. Depending on where you live, a lack of sunlight might also be a factor. Reduced sunlight can impact your body’s circadian rhythm — basically, your internal body clock. This could then reduce your quality of sleep. “All of which can impair the immune resilience your body needs to ward off and recover from said triggers,” says Atoyebi.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, you can support your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. </p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>How can you prevent winter hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, Atoyebi suggests supporting your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. “This includes prioritizing a nutrient-dense diet and correcting common deficiencies associated with hair shedding, particularly iron (ferritin), vitamin D, zinc, B12 or folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and ensuring adequate protein intake,” she says. </p>



<p>While I’m not deficient in iron myself, a blood test showed that I needed to increase my vitamin D and folate intake. I also take omega-3, 6, and 9 daily — and I’m noticing a positive difference in my hair shedding.</p>



<p>Besides addressing deficiencies, Dr. Adel suggests prioritizing scalp care, since a healthy scalp supports better hair growth. She recommends using scalp-focused treatments and conditioners to lock in moisture, while avoiding over-scrubbing or harsh exfoliation. I love the ritual of applying <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/products/serum?srsltid=AfmBOopKhDFqOD3FYXENxfKnMQEtdQkxG2VScpENuPF5ZdcdWbFx-5Om"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute’s Density &amp; Repair Scalp Serum</a>, which moisturizes, exfoliates, and soothes the scalp with panthenol, salicylic acid, and niacinamide. Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopbtKLBw_Cnqztua7eIW4TNy2aF4O66SWfl-xcaHqGHwN4WyAbH"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum</a>, with baicapil, an ingredient proven to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">strengthen hair follicles</a>. </p>





<p>Dr. Adel continues, “Don’t avoid washing your hair out of fear of shedding, as this can actually make things worse. Instead, use gentle shampoos, focus on the scalp [when washing], and try not to use overly hot water.” Since I’ve started washing my hair more regularly — every two to three days, and focusing more on the scalp than the lengths — I’ve noticed far less hair shedding each time.</p>



<p>Dr. Adel adds that aggressive towel-drying, tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and even friction from tight scarves and hats can all encourage breakage, so it’s important to be mindful. I swear by a gentle <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmicrofiber-hair-towel-P507559"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">microfiber towel.</a></p>





<h2>When should you see a doctor about hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Atoyebi shares a note of encouragement to those experiencing winter shedding: “Although it can be very unsettling, diffuse shedding [where hair sheds evenly across the scalp] does not lead to baldness,” she says. “Provided that the underlying trigger is addressed, this kind of shedding is completely reversible, with regrowth starting as soon as three months after addressing the trigger.” </p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re worried about the rate at which your hair is shedding, Atoyebi recommends seeing your doctor or a certified trichologist for a blood test: “This can help identify emerging deficiencies or hormonal imbalances, allowing for appropriate, clinician-guided supplementation,” she says.  </p>
