<p>On Saturday at 4am, I found myself en route to see Taylor Swift’s <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/taylor-swift-release-party-of-a-showgirl-uk-ireland-box-office-1236541930/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</a></em> cinematic experience. In all my years as a diehard fan, I wouldn’t say experiences like this are out of the ordinary. For example, in 2012, my friends and I were handpicked out of the crowd at the <em>Red</em> stadium tour by Andrea Swift to enter the VIP pit, where I was so close I was able to <em>touch </em>Taylor when she walked into the crowd. I was on the front page of the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> for successfully buying <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488663/taylor-swift-eras-tour-non-swiftie"">Eras Tour</a> tickets. I was there at the <em>Speak Now</em>, <em>1989</em> and <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""><em>Reputation</em></span> tours. I weathered backlash during the great Kimye V. Taylor feud of 2016;  I held my head high during the <em>ME!</em> video premiere. In terms of being a Swiftie, I’ve seen it all. </p>



<p>I truly <em>adore </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-swift"">Taylor Swift </a>— I think she’s brilliant and truly one of the greatest songwriters of all time. I love her “brand” and the projection of what “Taylor Swift” signifies. Her records mean a lot to me, and I’ve loved studying every element of evolution, as I’ve grown up with her — in many ways, she is the older sister I never had. Her DNA is in the fabric of literally every single pop girl making waves right now (no matter how much certain ones try to deny it), and her impact on the music industry is historic. </p>



<p>My drive to the cinema, however, was filled with mixed feelings, as less than 12 hours before, I’d had an extremely lukewarm reaction to Swift’s 12th record, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl/1838810949"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Life of a Showgirl</a></em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-life-of-a-showgirl/1838810949"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> I wasn’t the only one who’d picked up on a significant vibe shift and lack of…pizzazz that was promised from the Max Martin-produced record, marketed as a behind-the-curtain reflection on the pomp, grandiosity, chaos and confusion that comes with being a showgirl. <br /><br />Instead, the record reads more like an attempt at appearing nonchalant towards the negative noise, while simultaneously only focusing on it, sandwiched between a few peppy love songs. Unlike the defined sonic-directions of Swift’s previous 11 records, there’s little through-line between the palette, and at times, the writing leaves little to the imagination. To me, there’s a distinct lack of yearning on this record — a defining trait in Swift’s lyricism. </p>



<p>It’s captured best in classic songs like “White Horse,” “Mirrorball”<em> </em>and<em> </em>“Enchanted,” to name a few. The characters she’s written about — whether fictional or real — have always been written from the point of view of an observer. Someone who’s invited to the party, but doesn’t fit in. An onlooker who romanticizes historical figures as projections of her most idealized self. Now that Swift is the be-all and end-all of pop, are those days gone? Or, is her pen yet to catch up with the character she’s become?</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936999.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Fans on TikTok are posting edits that watch like an obituary, grieving an <em>actual </em>old, “dead” version of Swift. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/03/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl-review"">Critics have called it dull </a>and noted its lack of <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-the-life-of-a-showgirl/"">compelling songwriting in comparison </a>to her previous material. Others have called out the boring marketing campaign based around flogging variants in order for Swift to finally beat the record for the biggest opening sales week for a female artist in history (currently held by Adele, which she is likely projected to break). </p>



<p>So, why does this album feel so different? In a career so perfectly executed, where does a misfire like this come from? Is it billionaire arrogance? Is it the confidence that comes after exiting the most successful tour in music and successfully buying back your masters? Is her team currently full of yes-men high on her supply?</p>



<p>It’s hard not to compare Swift to other stadium-pop acts to gain perspective on where her career ‘should’ be placed at this stage. Bruce Springsteen’s twelfth album <em>The Rising, </em>released in the wake of 9/11, was considered by fans and critics to be somewhat of a return to form after a lengthy career break. Pitchfork referred to large chunks of Madonna’s 12th record, MDNA as “shockingly banal” and Paul McCartney’s 12th album, Driving Rain, was the lowest-selling of his career at the time. Swift’s most modern contemporary, Beyoncé, is only eight albums in, and frankly, most current groundbreaking artists probably won’t get to that stage in their career. </p>



<p>Swift’s career has now spanned three decades. Where her millennial pop peers have failed to retain relevance, Swift has managed to manoeuvre through the popsphere while rewriting the playbook of the genre. The catapulting of her already immense influence and popularity into something bigger began with the release of <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore</em> in 2020. The luscious indie rock-inspired records captured hearts and minds everywhere amidst pandemic moodiness and capitalized on the bubbling underground of female-centric indie folk in the vein of Phoebe Bridgers and Big Thief. Then came the re-recordings of Fearless and Red, forcing critics (and haters) to reevaluate the impact of those records. A pivotal moment from this time was the release of “All Too Well (10 Minute Version)” and it’s visually stunning music video directed and written by Swift. It proved her dominance as a multidisciplinary artist, and gave us a look into some of her non-musical inspirations, like the films of John Cassavetes. </p>



<p>Then came the Eras tour and its endless parade of celebration and number-crunching. Her opening acts like beabadoobee, MUNA, Paramore, HAIM, Phoebe Bridgers and girl in red each represented different ways in which Swift’s oeuvre has touched different parts of the musical landscape, from fuzzed-out modern grunge, to bouncy 80s-inspired indie pop. <em>Midnights</em> once again showcased her effortless transition into moody and sultry lo-fi synth-pop and <em>Tortured Poets</em> may just go down as her most experimental album yet. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936998.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>These events all created a completely unexpected phenomenon (as a long-time fan) — it became cool to like Taylor Swift. Coolness, the most elusive, fleeting and important quality in this cultural zeitgeist to obtain.  Aside from that, it also firmly positioned Swift as both the most fully frontal influence and the carrier of the pop current frontier. Those made in her image — Olivia Rodrigo, Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter and others, have all begun forging careers that have followers wondering who the pop baton will be passed on to — if allowed. </p>



<p>Swift has established herself as the ultimate Pop Imperialist. She has laid out the expectation that all of her eras are to be treated with the utmost significance and that each era would give a glimpse into her ever-developing taste and skill as a songwriter and sonic curator. Unfortunately, it seems like the fans have decided that <em>The Life Of A Showgirl</em> does not compete in this exact frontier she created. It’s clear she wanted to capitalize on the momentum of the last few years in an attempt to prove her all-encompassing influence. Between the album’s hollow theme, mindless marketing and meh-worthy lyricism, it all feels just too tired. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Unfortunately, it seems like the fans have decided that <em>The Life Of A Showgirl</em> does not compete in this exact frontier she created.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In any other genre, when the crown is passed to the next generation of greats, the legends can sit back and rest on their laurels and find their lifestyles through anniversary tours and middling albums that pass enough to justify a tour. As a lifelong fan of emo and pop punk, I know this game well. However, Swift has never been one to retire to the trophy room. Swift simply refuses to pass this baton, and her kung fu grip on pop’s crown handicapped this record and watered down her best qualities. In some ways, as a devotee of hers, I admire her delusion and chutzpah. On the other hand, it has led to this whole rollout feeling empty. </p>



<p>In saying this, I do believe some of the criticisms being thrown at the album are genuinely unfair. Some have said that the track “Wi$h Li$T” (which features one of the album’s best chorus top-lines), which thematically dives into wanting to get married and have kids, peddles a Republican ‘trad wife’ narrative. Personally, I think the supposed Charli XCX diss-track “Actually Romantic” is one of the better songs on the record. Is it a little corny? Yes. Is it supposed to be? I think so. There are also glimmers of beauty on the album — the bridge of “Eldest Daughter” is classic Swift-exuberance, the <em>Fearless</em>-esque bounce of “Ruin The Friendship” is pure whimsy, and the witty, playful lyricism of the title track are reminders of what we love most about her. </p>



<p>Watching the music video and its behind-the-scenes content in cinemas was also <em>so much </em>fun. Seeing Swift at work directing the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia” likely just months after wrapping the Eras Tour encapsulates her second-to-none work ethic and boundless imagination. She also provides an explanation behind the inspiration of each track, giving fans a glimpse into her ever-awkward, cutesy and funny persona. However, during these explanations, at times, it did feel like even Swift was at a loss in describing themes and inspirations. It’s one of the more shallow reflections on her songwriting we’ve ever been given, in comparison to, say, the <em>Long Pond Sessions</em>.</p>



<p>Haters will use this moment as a “gotcha” to prove their thoughts that she’s “actually bad” and her fame is a “scam”. Obviously, this is inherently incorrect. Is this album a cultural misfire? Yes. Will it completely tarnish Swift’s legacy overall? No. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Is this album a cultural misfire? Yes. Will it completely tarnish Swift’s legacy overall? No. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Swift herself has said that there won’t be a tour off the back of this record (which should be terrifying news for economists everywhere, and thankful news to the wallets of fans). She also squashed the “deeply offensive” rumors that she’ll hang up the boots once she’s married. I am almost certain Swift’s 13th era will be her biggest yet — it just wouldn’t be right if it wasn’t. It is undeniable that culture is moving at a rapid and alarming rate. There is potential that Swift may not have the leverage to pull off numbers akin to the last few years by the time this rolls around. But, if there’s one thing Swift has proven through every cultural pivot, is that sharing the scariest and most raw parts of growing up and navigating the world is what truly connects — and there’ll be real fans waiting with excitement to see what the next era brings. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936939.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s been two weeks since <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">Bad Bunny</a> teamed up with <a href=""https://music.amazon.com/"">Amazon Music</a> for <a href=""https://music.amazon.com/live/events/L0ZYE8MCOT"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más,”</a> a special encore concert added to his 30-show, sold-out <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">residency in Puerto Rico</a>. The event took place on September 20 — the anniversary of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/209761/hurricane-maria-anniversary-puerto-rico-women-experience"">Hurricane María</a> — and was live-streamed globally via the Amazon Music app, Prime Video, and Twitch. With countless fans tuning in from around the world, the broadcast broke records, becoming the most-watched single-artist performance in Amazon Music’s history and drawing more than 340,000 live viewers on Twitch alone.</p>



<p>But that concert was just the beginning of a much larger collaboration. Bad Bunny’s 31st performance marked the launch of a long-term partnership between Amazon and the Puerto Rican artist that aims to invest in his homeland through initiatives centered on education, disaster relief, and cultural empowerment.</p>



<p>“It was always intentional,” Rocío Guerrero, Director of Music, Latin-Iberia at Amazon Music, tells Refinery29 Somos. “That everyone all over the world could go to Benito’s house, from their houses. The intention was to bring attention to Puerto Rico: the culture, the history, the resilience, and all of the different things we saw during that live-stream.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“The intention was to bring attention to Puerto Rico: the culture, the history, the resilience, and all of the different things we saw during that live-stream.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Stepping into Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio’s “casita” meant a virtual journey into Puerto Rico itself — visually and emotionally transporting viewers to the archipelago that has shaped much of Bad Bunny’s artistry. Guerrero says that was the central goal from the start: to use the platform not only to entertain but to redirect global attention toward Puerto Rico and its people.</p>



<p>“From the very beginning, when we met with [Bad Bunny’s team], it was always all about Puerto Rico, from both ends,” she adds. “For us, as Amazon, we’re trying to help and support communities, not just artists. And for Benito, he didn’t want to make this about himself. They were very clear about this. They wanted this to be about Puerto Rico.”</p>



<p>The multi-year collaboration between Bad Bunny and Amazon is structured around three main pillars that the artist and his team prioritized: education and technology, agriculture, and economic development. Together, Amazon, Fundación Rimas (founded by Bad Bunny’s management team), and <a href=""https://www.goodbunnyfoundation.org/"">Fundación Good Bunny</a> (the artist’s nonprofit) are developing new programs both on the island and online.</p>



<p>The first phase focuses on education. The partnership will fund the creation of STEM education centers across Puerto Rico, where teachers and students will have access to training, courses, and tools like Amazon Fire tablets. In times of natural disaster, these centers will also serve as public shelters, an intentional tie to the anniversary of Hurricane María, which devastated the archipelago in 2017.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“From the very beginning, when we met with [Bad Bunny’s team], it was always all about Puerto Rico, from both ends.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, through <em>comPRa Local</em> — a soon-to-launch, curated storefront on Amazon.com — global consumers will be able to directly support Puerto Rican artisans, brands, and businesses. The store will highlight locally made food, products, music, books, and everyday goods, all marked with a new “Hecho en PR” badge that distinguishes items produced on the archipelago.</p>



<p>Additionally, Amazon is working with its partners to leverage its logistics infrastructure to support local farmers and improve access to fresh produce across the archipelago, where agricultural systems are fragile.</p>



<p>“So we are bringing together music, customers, and commerce into one place, and the tangible impact is the more people buying this store, the better the economy for Puerto Rican vendors,” Guerrero says. </p>



<p>According to Guerrero, these efforts represent just the beginning — not only of what’s to come from the multi-year collaboration with Bad Bunny but also of a broader strategy for how Amazon Music plans to collaborate with artists moving forward.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Our mission from the beginning, at least since I’ve come in, has been elevating Latin music, showcasing the different genres from the communities, and cultures, and the idiosyncrasies. It’s not just one genre. It’s a wide spectrum of genres, nationalities, and even languages. And we take that job very seriously.”</p><cite>Rocío Guerrero</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Our mission from the beginning, at least since I’ve come in, has been elevating Latin music, showcasing the different genres from the communities, the cultures, and the idiosyncrasies. It’s not just one genre. It’s a wide spectrum of genres, nationalities, and even languages. And we take that job very seriously,” Guerrero adds, pointing to Amazon Music’s <a href=""https://music.amazon.com.mx/live/events/LBZR0HZEC5"">La Música Que Nos Conecta campaign</a>, an initiative that has celebrated Latin American music genres from across the region since 2023.</p>



<p>But for Guerrero, music has always been a means to a deeper purpose: using its global reach to educate audiences about the diversity and richness of Latin American and Caribbean cultures.</p>



<p>“When I first joined Amazon, I remember this is what I was hoping would happen: to utilize the power and the universe of Amazon to do something with artists that could have an impact on culture and society,” she says. “So this means everything. I’m so proud.”</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the week where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">eclipse season</a> officially closes — and it doesn’t end with a whisper, it ends with a roar. On October 6th, the Aries Full Moon rises, bringing to culmination storylines that began back on March 29th, 2025, when the Aries Solar Eclipse cracked open new paths for us. If the spring invited you to name what you want, this week asks: have you fought for it, stood by it, and honored your needs without apology? Expect recognition — whether internal or external — for the seeds you dared to plant months ago. Aries energy doesn’t let you hide. It pushes you onto the stage, spotlight blazing, reminding you that your desires and boundaries matter as much as anyone else’s. <br /><br />And this isn’t just any Aries Full Moon. It’s ruled by Mars, who is currently swimming through the depths of Scorpio. Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are both in Scorpio</a>, turning the collective vibe into fiery lava: molten, raw, unmissable. Add Juno, the asteroid of commitment, in Sagittarius, another Fire sign, and you get this rare alchemy of passion, clarity, and intensity. It’s the kind of week where individuals realize their superpowers, and the collective realizes its power to unite. Think strikes, movements, protests, declarations of love, or simply saying “no more” where you’ve stayed quiet too long. Aries + Scorpio = power reclaimed. </p>



<p>But what goes up must eventually ground. From October 8th through the 10th, the Moon shifts into Taurus, cooling the lava into fertile earth. These are the days to slow down, process, and stabilize whatever breakthroughs the Aries Full Moon lit up. Taurus energy reminds us that no matter how wild the firestorm, change only sticks if it’s sustainable. And then comes 10/10, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-numerology-meaning"">numerological Ascension Portal</a>, aligned with the Moon’s entrance into Gemini. This is your green light to share, teach, write, or create with levity — all the intensity has prepared you to communicate with both fire and grace. <br /><br />So yes, this is not your typical full moon week. It’s a Mars-ruled supercharge wrapped in Aries initiation, Scorpio intensity, Taurus grounding, and Gemini curiosity. Individually, you’re closing one eclipse chapter and stepping into a braver version of yourself. Collectively, we’re realizing that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/speak-up-be-vocal-mental-health-awareness"">when we speak up</a>, move with conviction, and refuse to shrink, the Universe shifts with us. Stand tall, cosmic beings. You’re entering this week not just as yourself — but as your most unapologetically empowered self yet. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>This week is your cosmic mic-drop moment, Aries. The Full Moon in your sign on October 6th feels like a personal rebirth, one that’s been building since the solar eclipse in Aries back on March 29th. Think of it as six months of shadow work, self assertion, and courage, now culminating in a fiery climax. You may feel lit up and raw, like your entire being is under a spotlight. And yes, that comes with shadows: you might demand intensity or depth from people who just can’t meet you there, or you might project your own restless transformation onto relationships. Be mindful not to burn bridges unnecessarily… you’re leveling up, but not everyone’s on the same timeline, and that’s okay. The lesson here is to honor your growth without needing everyone else to validate it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury has joined your ruler Mars in Scorpio, activating your sector of shared resources, intimacy, and deep transformation. Money talks could get very real: paying off debt, applying for grants, negotiating contracts, or finally clarifying joint financial agreements. Don’t shy away from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/inexpensive-prenup"">these conversations</a>: your clarity is power right now. Venus is spending its final week in Virgo, lighting up your health and wellness zone. It’s a reminder that love doesn’t just show up in romance, it shows up in how safe your body feels in someone’s presence. As you celebrate how much you’ve grown these past six months, practice discernment without nitpicking — both in relationships and with yourself. You’re not meant to feel “done”; you’re meant to feel alive, in motion, and deeply committed to your own evolution. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Be honest, Taurus: when was the last time you truly unplugged? This Aries Full Moon is hitting your sector of rest and surrender, so if your body is screaming “nap!” this week, it’s not laziness… it’s literally the astrology of the week. The eclipse season finale is pulling you inward, like the Universe put a “do not disturb” sign on your aura. That might feel weird for a sign that loves stability, but here’s the gag: your growth right now comes from letting go of control. Watch for the shadow of self-sabotage: overworking, overthinking, or staying too available to people who don’t give the same back. <em>What if the most radical move you make this week is saying no, logging off, and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/protect-your-peace-resolutions-2025""><em>protecting your peace</em></a><em>? </em><br /><br />At the same time, Mercury and Mars are stirring your Scorpio house of partnerships, making convos with bae, besties, or biz partners way spicier. Someone might drop a truth bomb that changes the whole game. Lean into it — this is how bonds deepen or dissolve. Venus is finishing up in Virgo, reminding you in your romance + pleasure zone that love should feel like <em>chill joy, </em>not an exhausting performance review. Who makes your nervous system purr instead of spike? That’s your answer. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Aries Full Moon is calling BS on your social life, Gemini. Who’s really in your corner? Who’s just here for the memes and vibes, and who’s showing up when it counts? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-blood-corn-moon-lunar-eclipse-in-pisces-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Eclipse season</a> closing out in your community sector feels like a group chat cleanse. You don’t have to ghost everyone, but you do need to notice where your energy gets hyped versus where it gets drained. And here’s the kicker: sometimes the crowd you crave isn’t even on your current radar. Aries wants you to initiate — join that movement, DM that creative, sign up for that workshop. Stop waiting for the invite. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are dragging you back to your daily grind, asking: are your routines giving “organized queen” or “chaotic scroll hole”? This is the perfect week to ditch distractions and commit to systems that actually make life smoother. The shadow side? Burning yourself out trying to do <em>all </em>the productivity hacks at once. Venus in Virgo closes out in your home sector, so cozy-fying your nest or setting firmer fam boundaries could be the ultimate form of self-care. Reminder: you don’t need a thousand followers — you need the right ones, both online and IRL. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Career plot twist incoming, Cancer. This week’s Aries Full Moon is at the very top of your chart, and it’s giving <em>main character energy. </em>Spotlight. Recognition. Maybe even a “wait, you do <em>what </em>for work?!” moment from people who’ve been underestimating you. But the catch is this: Aries doesn’t do small talk. If you’ve been hiding your ambition or waiting for permission to shine, this lunation is snatching the excuses away. Shadow alert: don’t let the hunger for external claps drown out your own inner compass. Your worth isn’t up for debate. <br /><br />And oooh, Mercury + Mars are heating up your Scorpio creativity zone, so your muses are LOUD right now. Think late-night writing sprees, love notes that accidentally turn into poetry, or suddenly realizing you want to launch that project you’ve been lowkey scared of. Romance also feels extra magnetic, but again, this isn’t casual; it’s deep, consuming, maybe a little dramatic. Venus ends its Virgo run in your communication house, polishing your words with discernment. Translation? You’ve got receipts and you’re not afraid to use them, but you also know when to speak with grace. By week’s end, you’ll realize: your evolution isn’t about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11649504/safe-settling-job-security-career-progression"">playing safe in the corner</a>. It’s about stepping on stage, mic in hand, saying, “This is me — deal with it.” </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week’s Aries Full Moon is practically daring you to stop shrinking and step into a bigger world. It’s firing up your sector of travel, philosophy, and long-term dreams — aka the part of your chart that screams, <em>go live your main-character montage already. </em>This lunation wants you to risk, expand, and chase the thing you’ve been side-eyeing for months. Shadow check: don’t confuse “bold” with “chaotic.” Just because you feel unstoppable doesn’t mean you need to max out a credit card on a random trip to Bali (unless…). </p>



<p>Mercury and Mars are deep-diving in your sector of home, family, and foundations, so the drama may hit closer to your couch than your passport. Conversations at home could be sharp, revealing, or… a little spicy. Lean in without turning everything into a power struggle. Meanwhile, Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your money and values sector, reminding you that financial glow-ups require discernment. Translation: treat <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-wallet-benefits-saving-money"">your budget like a canvas</a>, not a cage. Yes, you can splurge, but do it on something that makes your soul and your spreadsheet happy.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, the Aries Full Moon is lighting up your sector of intimacy and shared resources, and the question this week is: what (or who) are you really willing to merge with? This lunation brings clarity around money, debt, emotional bonds, or sexual ties — basically anything that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">requires deep trust</a>. Shadow side? Expecting 100% transparency from others while still keeping your own cards close to your chest. Aries energy says: honesty first, then decide if the connection is worth your time. <br /><br />On top of that, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of communication and learning, so your words are carrying extra punch. Be mindful: you can deliver truth without accidentally stabbing someone with it. Venus is closing out its time in Virgo itself, putting <em>you </em>in the spotlight one last time. That means your aura is magnetic right now, but it also means your inner critic could get loud. Please remember: refinement is cute, self-shaming is not. Own how much you’ve grown since March without nitpicking the parts still in progress. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week’s Aries Full Moon is glowing up your partnership sector, which means relationships — romantic, platonic, business, you name it — are center stage. This is the kind of lunation where ultimatums get dropped, confessions spill out, or you finally say “enough” to the dynamics that have been draining you. Shadow check: don’t outsource your self-worth to someone else’s reaction. The Aries Full Moon’s magnetic energy reminds you: your “yes” and your “no” both carry power. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are igniting your money and resources sector, so expect conversations about finances, investments, or even overdue payments to heat up. This isn’t the week to avoid your budget; it’s the week to get <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">clear about what’s yours</a> versus what’s theirs. Venus is closing its run in Virgo in your private, spiritual sector, softening the edges and reminding you to take space for yourself amidst all the relational fireworks. The more grounded you feel in your own company, the clearer it’ll be who’s meant to walk beside you. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the Aries Full Moon is setting fire to your sector of work, health, and daily rhythm this week, so if your routines feel like they’re getting a cosmic performance review, you’re not wrong. This lunation is a wake-up call to check in on what’s actually supporting you versus what’s draining you. Maybe you’ve been overextending yourself or letting perfectionism dictate your schedule, and now your body is like, <em>we need balance, fam. </em>The growth here comes from realizing that efficiency isn’t about doing more… it’s about aligning your energy with what matters most. Don’t just “push through”; redesign your days so they work <em>for </em>you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars are in your sign</a>, which is basically you with a bullhorn: louder, sharper, and less afraid to confront what’s been lurking in the shadows. This gives you the edge to tackle conversations you’ve been avoiding, whether it’s asking for more resources, setting firmer boundaries, or admitting what you actually want. The shadow side? Over-intensity. Not everyone can meet you in the depths, so know when to pull back. Venus is finishing its stay in Virgo in your friendship sector, helping you notice which connections feel nourishing versus which feel transactional. The takeaway: the right people support your growth without draining your spark, and you’ll know exactly who those people are by week’s end. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is turning the spotlight on your sector of romance, joy, and creative fire… basically the part of your chart that screams <em>fun, fun, fun. </em>This lunation wants you to reclaim pleasure in the ways you may have pushed to the side since March. Think about what hobbies, relationships, or artistic projects make you lose track of time, and then ask yourself why you’re not giving them more space in your life. The shadow side of this moon is overindulgence or chasing thrills just for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9810670/dopamine-fasting-quarantine"">dopamine hit</a>, but Aries energy wants you to commit to what feels <em>real </em>and life-giving. Your creative spark is valid, so stop minimizing it. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are activating your spiritual and subconscious sector, making your inner world louder than ever. You might notice dreams getting wilder, intuitive nudges arriving out of nowhere, or buried fears resurfacing. Instead of dodging them, lean in… clarity lives on the other side of discomfort. Venus in Virgo is closing out in your career sector, making this a stellar week to tidy up your professional image or cut ties with draining projects. One more thing: your public life and your private imagination are feeding off each other right now, so pay attention to the subtle ways your creativity wants to shape your next big move. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the Aries Full Moon is sparking change in your sector of home, roots, and emotional foundations, and the question is: do you feel safe where you are? This lunation can feel like a release point around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-women-healing-panic-attacks"">family patterns</a>, living situations, or the ways you’ve been carrying everyone else’s weight. Shadow side: thinking you have to fix everything and everyone before you allow yourself to rest. Aries energy reminds you that your healing and your sense of home deserve to be a priority, not an afterthought. When you build safety within, everything else can grow from there. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars in Scorpio are energizing your community and friendship sector, which could mean dynamic conversations with your crew or joining a collective effort that feels bigger than yourself. It’s a great week for networking, collaborations, or speaking out, but watch your delivery, Scorpio’s intensity can turn into stingers if you’re not intentional. Venus is wrapping up in Virgo in your adventure sector, encouraging you to expand through learning, travel, or fresh perspectives. Don’t just dream about getting out of your comfort zone; take one concrete step toward it. This week shows you that home is both where you are and where you dare to go next. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week’s Aries Full Moon is blasting open your sector of communication and self-expression, and your inbox might as well be on fire. This lunation wants you to speak your truth without watering it down — whether that’s sending the text you’ve been drafting in your head, pitching the idea no one saw coming, or simply telling yourself a new story about what’s possible. Shadow check: watch out for impulsive words that land like grenades. Just because you feel it strongly doesn’t mean you need to hit “send” at 3am. Ask yourself, <em>is this honest or is this just heat-of-the-moment? </em>That extra breath can save a friendship. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mercury and Mars are stirring your sector of career and reputation, which means you’re hot on people’s radar. Power meetings, sudden opportunities, or straight-up confrontations with authority figures may pop this week. This is your cue to own the spotlight instead of side-stepping it — you’ve earned it. Venus is closing its stay in Virgo in your intimacy and shared resources sector, asking you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">refine your boundaries</a> around money, sex, and emotional labor. Who drains you, who fuels you, and how are you honoring your own value? By the end of the week, you’ll see clearly: your voice matters, and your boundaries protect the brilliance you’re here to share. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week’s Aries Full Moon is illuminating your sector of money, values, and self-worth, so let’s talk coin and confidence. This lunation might highlight what you’ve been hustling for since March — where the financial wins are real and where leaks still need plugging. Shadow side of this full moon? Equating your value to your bank account, or blowing cash to feel validated. Ask yourself: <em>am I </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/labubu-plushie-charm-popularity-high-spending""><em>spending to escape</em></a><em> or to expand? </em>Aries wants you to know your worth first, then act from that grounded place. </p>



<p>At the same time, Mercury and Mars are activating your sector of expansion, meaning your inner philosopher is <em>loud</em>. Big conversations about travel, education, or spiritual growth could spark, and you’re craving experiences that stretch your perspective. Just don’t burn out trying to chase every single path… depth beats scatter right now. Venus finishes its run in Virgo in your partnership sector, highlighting what balance and reciprocity really feel like. Are your connections supporting your growth, or pulling you into old patterns of over-giving? This week, your finances and your relationships both point back to the same truth: when you honor yourself, everything else starts to align. </p>

There have been some stellar <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2024"">book-to-screen adaptations</a> so far in 2025, from <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81751137"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Thursday Murder Club</a></em> to <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Caught Stealing</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mIvD-GN-p4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> While we're slowly inching our way to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">Christmas</a>, there are still many more delightful book adaptations to come.

Just look at how massive <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hunger-games"">The Hunger Games</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/twilight-renaissance"">Twilight</a></em> became, with <em>Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping</em> due to land in 2026. Ahead, here are all the book-to-screen adaptations that will be released in 2025. <figure><figcaption><h2>The Lost Bus<br /></h2><br /><em>The Lost Bus</em> is based on <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">Lizzie Johnson's 2021 book <em>Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire</em>.

<p>Now that <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending""> Season 3 has wrapped up</a>, it feels like there’s a hole in our hearts. Instead of spending our Wednesday nights with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Conrad Fisher</a> and Belly Conklin, we’re impatiently waiting for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty </a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">movie</a> to come our way. It’s disappointing to lose yet another <em>escape-the-world</em> show, where the messy universe of Cousins Beach and cheating scandals could take your mind off life admin and grown-up problems. Luckily, there are a plethora of other shows to fill the gap — whether you’re after more teenage angst, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">book-to-screen adaptations</a>, or even another series about a girl torn between two brothers.</p>



<p>From other YA series to classics that still hold up today, here are 9 shows like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> to add to your watchlist. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>My Life with the Walter Boys</em></h2>







<p>Lovingly dubbed the “yeehaw version” of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> by fans, Netflix’s take on the brother-love-triangle trope is just as addictive as <em>TSITP</em>. Based on a YA Wattpad novel by Ali Novak, it follows recently orphaned teen Jackie (Nikki Rodriguez). After moving from the big city to a country ranch in Colorado, she begins to adjust to life with her mother’s friend and her 11 children. She begins to have feelings for brothers Cole Walter and Alex Walter at the same time, leading to turmoil and angst. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>XO, Kitty</em></h2>







<p>From the mind of Jenny Han, creator and writer of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, comes an original spinoff from her <em>To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before </em>trilogy. Following Lara Jean’s (Lana Condor) younger sister Kitty Covey (Anna Cathcart) as she settles into boarding school in Seoul, South Korea, this show provides the perfect mix of K-Drama and what we all loved from the <em>TATBILB </em>movies.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Outer Banks</em></h2>







<p><em>Outer Banks (OBX)</em> is one of Netflix’s biggest hits, with four seasons already on the streaming platform. If you’re looking for a beachy vibe like <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>, add this to your watchlist. </p>



<p>It follows a group of friends in North Carolina on a treasure hunt tied to John B’s (Chase Stokes) father. Expect car crashes, characters being stuck on desert islands, murder and other dramatic storylines.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Tree Hill</em></h2>







<p>If you’re craving love triangles involving brothers, we’ve got another one for you. <em>One Tree Hill</em> follows half-brothers Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty) as fierce basketball rivals, who are also after the same romantic interest, Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton). This show has some of the most heartwrenching cliffhangers and horrifying storylines for a teen drama in history, so if you want to go on a wild ride, add this to your watchlist.</p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>HBO Max</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Heartstopper</em></h2>







<p>Another book-to-screen adaptation, <em>Heartstopper</em> captured, well, our hearts when it landed on Netflix. Following a teen romance between Charlie Spring (Joe Locke) and Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), Season 1 and 3 boast a perfect score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. Like <em>TSITP</em>, the series will conclude with a feature film titled <em>Heartstopper Forever</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Dawson’s Creek</em></h2>







<p><em>Dawson’s Creek</em> is the OG teen series, which paved the way for love triangles, angst and drama. Fans have consistently compared Belly’s love triangle with Conrad and Jeremiah to the messy relationships between Dawson, Joey and Pacey. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>We Were Liars</em></h2>







<p>Prime Video’s newest book-to-screen adaptation hit our screens in June this year, and it’s gripping from beginning to end. Starring Aussie Joseph Zada — who’s leading <em>The Hunger Games: Sunrise On The Reaping</em> — and <em>One Tree Hill’s</em> Barbara Alyn Woods’ daughter Emily Alyn Lind, this mystery thriller will keep you on your toes. It follows Lind’s character Cadence Sinclair, after an amnesia-causing accident, as she tries to piece together what happened last summer. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>One Day</em></h2>







<p>If you thought Belly and Conrad’s slow-burning relationship spanning five years was agony, <em>One Day</em> focuses on a relationship between Emma (Ambika Mod) and Dexter (Leo Woodall) across 14 years. Playing heavily into the <em>will they, won’t they</em> trope, <em>One Day </em>is both infuriating and romantic, and could very well have you in tears by the end. </p>



<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>Never Have I Ever</em></h2>







<p>Mindy Kaling’s original show <em>Never Have I Ever</em> tackles many of the same themes as <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. Exploring grief, finding yourself, love and more, Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) is the heart of this show — much like Belly. Plus, Devi finds herself in an impossible love triangle between her fierce rival Ben (Jaren Lewison) and the hottest boy in school Paxton (Darren Barnet), with hijinks along the way.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936090.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the famous saying goes, “Don’t just dream it, be it!” This expression rings true during October 6’s Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries. This rioting lunation brings us back to ourselves and helps us redefine our lives. We hold the power to become the person we are meant to be by<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2025""> transforming the way we view ourselves</a>. Without drama or fear, we are ready to spark our hearts and embrace ourselves with compassion and kindness. When we look in the mirror, we’ll adore the person we see. We hold the key to this amazing state of mind and glory. <br /><br />A supermoon occurs when the Moon is at perigee to Earth. You may be scratching your head, trying to figure out what the astronomical term means. I’m gonna save you a trip to Google and explain. Simply put: The Moon is closer to Earth than usual, making it appear larger than normal. So, if you’re looking at the night sky and thinking about why the Full Moon is bigger and brighter, it just means it is in a closer orbit to our planet. However, note that the emotional effects of the lunation might hit hard. This season has three supermoons: October 6, November 5, and December 4. </p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-september-2023"">Harvest Moon</a> is the Full Moon that occurs closest to the Fall Equinox (which was on September 22). This lunation is a time for farmers to secure their bounty and crops as we transition toward the year’s colder months. Spiritually, the Harvest Moon offers celebration, abundance, and blessings. We thank the Earth for its bounty and beauty before heading into the darker days. The Super Full Harvest Moon provides us with a moment of reflection and gratitude, in which we can move towards our inner cravings by balancing out our emotions. It’s a glorious time — no wonder Neil Young’s been crooning about this lunar glow-up for decades.<br /><br />The day of the Harvest Moon has a lot going on, astrologically. For starters, the communication planet, Mercury, dives into Scorpio. Mercury in Scorpio likes to have meaningful and intense discussions. This Mercurial placement is often suspicious of others, leading us to proceed cautiously when trusting others. Our passions will be ignited, even if we have trouble discussing them, as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the water sign</a> is less conversational and more intuitive.  We’ll lean into our emotions and gut feelings — especially when Mercury creates a minor frustration with Neptune retrograde in Aries. If something is off, listen to the voice within and move away from it.</p>



<p>Uranus retrograde in Gemini shares a gentle aspect with the North Node of Destiny, making us run away from the mundane and embrace change. Uranus is walking us up from the daze and haze we’ve been under, allowing us to revolutionize our personal philosophies about how we live and spend our time. We want to seek excitement and joy at all costs by throwing caution to the wind. Be careful not to get too reckless and impetuous because we may regret our decisions later and blame the Moon for our actions. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">The asteroid Ceres</a> (which represents nurturing and TLC) links up with the Moon in Aries, urging us to put self-care and self-love at the top of our priorities. Focus on ventures that make you happy, even if they don’t align with the status quo. Revel in the company of people who challenge your ideology and offer new concepts. Live boldly and greatly — most importantly, unapologetically! <br /><br />The takeaway from the Super Full Harvest Moon in Aries is that we should exist on our own terms. Those who wish to silence us aren’t the people we need to surround us. We can create the dynamics we want and never settle for anything less than what our hearts deserve and desire. The energy will be high, pushing us to rush through our choices and jump into the next best thing or person that catches our fancy. However, it is advisable to watch matters unfold.  March to the beat of your own drum and embrace the most authentic versions of yourself. Cheers to that!</p>

<p>If epic pop culture moments like <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-fashion-collaborations"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> </em>have taught us anything, it’s that a timely, well-executed collab can work wonders to transport and immerse viewers into the world of their favorite big- and small-screen characters. And if last year’s countless <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations"">Wicked</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-movie-brand-collaborations""> brand collections</a> are any indication, we’re gearing up for another season of green and pink everything with the forthcoming release of <em>Wicked: For Good</em>. And naturally, we can’t begin to talk about <em>Wicked </em>collections without mentioning Ariana Grande’s own makeup brand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10946075/ariana-grande-rem-beauty-ulta"">r.e.m. Beauty</a>.</p>



<p>If you, like me, have been voraciously consuming every morsel of <em>For Good</em> content as the November premiere date approaches, prepare yourselves; <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">r.e.m. Beauty x </a><em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is the ultimate beauty collection for you to <em>obsessulate</em> over. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">limited-edition capsule</a> features nine products, spanning blush trios, plumping lip glosses, metallic eyeliners inspired by the Emerald City, and a very special 12-pan eyeshadow palette inspired by the Ozian Forest — a locale that’s featured prominently in the sequel. Also noteworthy: Two makeup sets inspired by <em>For Good</em>‘s leading ladies, Glinda and Elphaba, with four full-size products each. </p>





<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936079.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I personally consider myself a Glinda rising, Elphaba sun, and Nessarose moon, so I immediately gravitated towards the moody, earthy tones in the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Elphaba Makeup Set</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elphaba-makeup-set-pimprod2054985?sku=2645275"">Ozian Forest Eyeshadow Palette</a>. For an everyday fall look, I used a couple matte neutral shades from the palette — a pale beige called “Confusifying,” “Witching Hour” (a warm tan), and “The Grimmerie” (a milk chocolate) in the crease. Then, I applied a plummy lip &amp; cheek tint from the Elphaba set (the shade is “Braverism,” which…love) as a lipstick and blush, and added the glossy balm in the shade Wickedness (a sheer brown with golden-magenta micro glitter) to round out the lip combo. I already happened to be wearing a green cardigan and my hair in a long braid, which totally brought the Elphaba vibes to life.</p>



<p>Another favorite from the collection is the greenish-gold “Elphie” shade of the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/starlet-liquid-eyeshadow-pimprod2051262?sku=2637766"">Starlet liquid eyeshadows</a> (my all-time favorite product by the brand), worn underneath the gold metallic shade (“All Roads Lead To The Wizard”) from the Ozian Forest palette, paired with curled lashes and mascara for a statement eye look. </p>





<p>I was already a fan of r.e.m. Beauty, but if you haven’t yet tried the brand, I for one can’t think of a better time to get acquainted than now. You can already shop the full <em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">Wicked: For Good</a></em><a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""> collection</a> on <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/lfYFCBB7E0flV3rwtzfnt2ZwHP?domain=rembeauty.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rembeauty.com</a>, and at Ulta Beauty stores and <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/featured/rembeauty_art2_wicked25"">online</a> on October 5. As for me? I’m already planning my premiere look…</p>
