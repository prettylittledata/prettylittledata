<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4jx0Xgc_Pc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Is This Thing On?</a> </em>may not seem like a movie where you’d find Grammy-award winner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10442765/andra-day-oscars-beauty-hair-makeup-nails"">Oscar nominee Andra Day</a>. It’s about a white man doing stand-up comedy after all. But the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bradley-cooper"">Bradley Cooper</a>-directed divorce dramedy starring <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/culture/film-and-tv/film/article-stand-up-guy-bradley-cooper-gives-will-arnett-the-role-of-a-lifetime/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/153024/laura-dern-interview-daughter-jaya"">Laura Dern</a> wouldn’t be complete without Day, who brings some brutal honesty and a delightful groundedness to the film. She plays Christine, the best friend to Dern’s Tess, and the wife of Cooper’s Balls (yes, that’s really his character’s name). Tess is going through a divorce with Arnett’s Alex, who turns to stand-up comedy to cope with their breakup. Day is so good as Christine in every scene, it feels like you’re eavesdropping on old friends who can’t help but tell each other the truth — no matter how uncomfortable. </p>



<p>Cooper handpicked Day for the role and was sure she’d say no. “I was just crossing my fingers with Andra,” Cooper says in the <a href=""https://press.searchlightpictures.com/is-this-thing-on"">film’s production notes</a>. “I just knew she would say no, but I had to offer it to her. When I saw<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10332763/is-united-states-vs-billie-holiday-drugs-arrests-death-accurate"">The United States vs. Billie Holliday</a>,</em> I was floored. I was like, ‘Look, I apologize that the real estate is going to be small here, but here is the terrain. Would you please come do this with me?’ It was a huge coup to get her.” And with the small real estate Day is given, she builds a brick house. It’s a no-bullshit performance that leaps off the screen, leaving the audience wanting more of Christine. And the dynamic between her and Tess “makes for a delicious, spiky friendship,” Dern says. </p>



<p>Here, Day talks about Cooper’s support, building rapport with Dern, singing with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanhayes/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Hayes</a>, and why she’d never get back together with an ex.</p>



<p><strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Refinery29 Unbothered</a>: I love this movie so much. I was surprised by how much I was moved by it. I know that Bradley Cooper said he had to convince you, or that when he asked you to do this, he didn’t think you would say yes. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Andra Day:</strong> Is this what he’s telling people?<em> [laughs]</em> He did not have to convince me of anything! He just popped on the screen and he was Bradley Cooper and I was like, “great idea, let’s work together!” He’s so funny. I genuinely was very excited to be a part of [this movie]. I’m a huge fan of his work as an actor. I’m a huge fan of his work as a director. I just think he’s just shown he’s just such a brilliant director. He’s just a great filmmaker. So I was excited. I was like, “I’m actually looking forward to being in your hands and seeing what you put together with this cast.” I’m so glad you love the movie. And maybe I’m biased, but I love the movie too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth… We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. </p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tell me more about why you chose to take on this role</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I was really moved by [Bradley Cooper’s] support. I also knew that he was really supportive of two other movies I had done. So for him to back up that support with the offer to play this character, I thought was really, really special. And then he starts describing the movie to me. It’s <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/is-this-thing-on-review-will-arnett-laura-dern-1236397884/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett’s baby</a>, and they’ve been friends for such a long time. So I love that it was he [cast] himself as [the character] Balls, because who else better to play Will’s best friend than his actual best friend? I love the dynamic of the friend group. I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth. I think it’s so funny. We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. So I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. And then Bradley mentioned the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. And I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>They are all just so great. It was a dream cast to work with and it was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p>

<p><strong>I love what you just said: “we always talk about growth, but we don’t allow each other to change.” That was a bar! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>You know, maybe I was a little rapper in my past life<em> [laughs].</em> Nah, I’m just kidding but I think it’s true! </p>



<p><strong>I want to talk about that cast that you mentioned, because there are some heavy hitters. You play Laura Dern’s best friend, Christine. Talk about building that rapport with Laura Dern, because it does feel like you’re just dropped into this years-long friendship. How did you build that rapport?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>It’s amazing to feel like you were just dropped in this relationship. I think that’s a testament to the great writing, the great direction and how it was shot, but also the truth.  Bradley absolutely requires truth. That’s the thing we’re looking for. But working with Laura, first of all, I’m just such a huge fan of her work. Laura plays such an array of characters, and so, of course, you walk into her space and you’re intimidated at first. You got to make sure you show up and support and you’re present but beyond that, being able to work with Laura and discovering,<em> oh, wow, she is amazing. </em>She’s great at what she does, and a huge part of that is how generous she is on set, how generous she is with not just the director and her co stars, but everyone on set, every actor, personnel on set and and how honest and open she is about herself as a human, and how much of that she brings to the character. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950918.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Laura Dern and Andra Day in IS THIS THING ON?

<p><strong>Christine is such a protective friend.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I love that you see that! <em>[laughs] </em></p>



<p><strong>She’s like, don’t mess with my girl! How protective of a friend are you? Could you relate to that in Christine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD:</strong> No, I have ADHD, so I can’t focus on shit. Most of the time I don’t even remember. <em>[laughs] </em>I’m just kidding! No,I think I am a protective friend.<em> [gestures off camera]. </em>Look, I have a friend in the room that’s nodding her head “yes” and laughing right now.</p>



<p>I think I am definitely a protective friend, for sure. What I like about Christine, though, is that she is a protective friend, but she will also protect you from yourself. I think that what I love about her character is her brutal honesty. I think what makes it so not just digestible, but actually endearing, is the fact that she is equally as brutally honest with herself. That’s really the only way to be honest with someone, that’s the only way they can actually trust your advice or your critique, if that they know that you hold yourself to that same standard. I think we’re similar in that way. I can be very protective, and not just physically, but also emotionally when it comes to friends and people that I love.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Bradley [said] the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>It was a dream cast to work with. It was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Stand-up comedy is the beating heart throughout this film. Is stand-up something you’ve ever thought about doing? Did this movie change your opinion of it at all? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Stand-up comedy is never something I ever thought about doing, and still have never thought about doing because it looks terrifying to me. You know what’s funny, I was saying  about the movie that it makes me laugh when we describe <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50ze1xn0zo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Bishop</a> [who inspired] Will Arnett’s character, Alex Novak, and they’re like, “Yeah, he just kind of did this stand-up because he didn’t want to pay the cover.” And I’m like, “guys, that’s not normal.” <em>[laughs]. </em>Like, if it were me, and someone was like, you can either pay the cover or you can go do stand up. I’m either coming out of my pocket 15 bucks or I’m going to the restaurant down the street. I’m not going to do a set of stand-up for $15!  It’s too terrifying. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950919.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Will Arnett with director Bradley Cooper on the set of IS THIS THING ON? Photo by Searchlight Pictures/Jason McDonald, Courtesy of Searchlight Pictures. © 2025 Searchlight Pictures All Rights Reserved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think it takes something inherently in you to do that. But what I learned was about the community of stand-up. I think it’s an incredible community. Bradley [Cooper] has always loved stand-up. And I think we all have, right? The Richard Pryors, Eddie Murphys. But the connectedness and the camaraderie were amazing to me. It used to be a lot more competitive. Now, when you dip into the culture, you realize that they’re doing, like, 3 to 6, clubs<em> a night,</em> which is insane. The grind is such that I’ve always admired stand-up comics, I loved to see how connected they are. And I think that Bradley [Cooper] and Will [Arnett] did an incredible job of showing this community, how they support each other, how they joke, and how honest they are as people.</p>



<p><strong>There’s this incredible scene where you and Sean Hayes sing “Amazing Grace.” How did that come to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>First, I love singing with Sean. I love Sean’s voice. Twas an amazing scene to shoot. It was amazing because it wasn’t written in the script. The night before, I got a call from Bradley that was like, “What do you think about singing ‘Amazing Grace’?” I was like, “Sure!” That was one of the later scenes we shot and I was, I was used to us being on set and being able to pivot. Who knows if it would be amazing or if it’d be really cringe and weird? I didn’t know. But it worked.</p>



<p>That scene, for me, and a lot of the Oyster Bay scenes, helped me to feel much more a part of this group. It just felt like we just were enjoying each other’s presence while we were on set filming that scene. And then I think it translated for the audience — them singing Amazing Grace added like, 10 or 15 years to their friendship. </p>



<p><strong>We’re going to end on a little game. I’m going to give you scenarios — based on the movie — and the answers are either “Bothered or Unbothered.” Your partner decides to become a stand up comedian later in life, bothered or unbothered? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered! I’m an artist in that way. I’m just kind of like, “you’re fine. Try it if you love it!”</p>



<p><strong>You don’t like your best friend’s husband: bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Super bothered! Super duper bothered! </p>



<p><strong>Telling your best friend’s man you used to have a crush on him.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Oohh. This is where I differ from my character. I’m a little more bothered about that.</p>



<p><strong>Getting back together with an ex.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered, bothered, bothered! You an ex for a reason.</p>



<p><strong>Your friend doesn’t tell you she got back together with her ex. Bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered. Not because you got back with your ex — unless he’s a toxic ex — I’m like, sis, what are we doing? Bothered, because if he’s a decent person, then what am I doing that made you feel uncomfortable to talk to me about that? If we’re best friends and I’m a confidant, then I’m bothered a little bit with myself and the situation.</p>



<p><strong>When people announce their breakup on social media or publicly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I don’t care. Unbothered. I’m like, do you! Who cares?</p>



<p><strong>Finally, using your personal life as fodder for art or comedy, bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered, that’s actually art and comedy. I’m bothered when you don’t use it at all. You know what I’m saying? That’s when I’m bothered.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950003.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Highly detailed “Supermoon” Pink Moon image with a star field background</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In true form, the New Moon in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-december-14-to-20-meaning-effects"">on December 19th</a> is going to be a wild roller coaster of emotions. It’s officially the last new moon of 2025 and it’s going to bring high energy and a truly uplifting lunar reset.</p>



<p>But just when we thought we had escaped confusing and ambiguous times brought on by a season of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">five planetary retrogrades</a>, the New Moon in Sagittarius arrives and shakes up our emotions and relationships — once again. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-sagittarius-november-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a>, Saturn in Pisces, and Neptune in Pisces aspect the New Moon, creating a mixed bag of emotions. Venus’ alignment gives us hope to enhance our love lives, while Saturn limits and Neptune heightens our fantasies — so, we may feel as though we are <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">stuck in a situationship</a> that’s holding us back, but have faith that things will get better soon. Add in a minor frustration from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a>, and the vibe gets both saucy and sassy. </p>



<p>As a result, our intuition will prove to be powerful. It’ll be easier than ever for us to comprehend matters on a spiritual level. The flip side is that we might also be paranoid or delulu in certain matters. Finding a balance between embracing our instincts and logic is pivotal to ensure we don’t go overboard in one direction over another. It’ll be challenging to remain centered, which is why grounding exercises such as connecting to the body through yoga or a walk in nature will do us good. This activity will clear our minds and remind us to remain present — no matter what the universe throws our way.</p>



<p>The need for change is strong, as we yearn to evolve in our love lives. The lessons Saturn imparts on us are going to rock our worlds for the better. The fog brought on by Neptune might hold us captive, but it will dissipate soon. Trusting our hearts and others unthinkingly can lead us to question what we want and whether we are making the best choices, but we’ll see that our innate divine wisdom and knowledge hold the key to our happiness. Ignoring outside noise and opinions of others helps guide us to the right space and place. Venus and the New Moon push us to roll the dice and bet on our feelings. We have to “know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em.”</p>



<p>The following day, Mercury in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo lunar axis. It’ll be hard to find the best way to move forward without drama or arguments, since we are bewildered about what the best path is. The mutable T-Square is causing our nerves to heighten. Our anxieties might reach a fever pitch as we continue to ruminate over the avenue we wish to pursue. Before getting into a headspin and over matters, take a step back and contemplate through meditation. If we are lucky, the universe will grant us both clarity and self-discovery.</p>



<p>In moments like this, it’s always great to reflect and take stock of our desires and progress. The Temperance tarot card (which aligns with the sun sign Sagittarius) represents this sentiment, since it focuses on how we can find our calm in turbulent times. Patience ignites the dream to come alive. Therefore, we shouldn’t make impetuous decisions. Moderation is essential to finding our deepest feelings, motives, and passions. Even though we are caught in the middle of the storm, we can navigate it. The only way out is through — we won’t realize it immediately, but we are in the driver’s seat. Let your senses and heart be the map that you listen to.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/j-shape-haircut-trend"">haircut trends</a>, the choice is overwhelming, but if we had to crown one cut as the current style du jour, it would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11823303/bob-haircut-trends-2025"">the bob</a>. </p>



<p>Its versatility is what gives <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kicked-bob-haircut-trend"">the bob</a> an edge over other cuts. Want to go really short? Consider <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"">the bixie</a>, aka bob-meets-pixie. Worried about losing too much length? Try <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/butterfly-lob-haircut-trend"">the lob</a>, or long bob. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, because hairstylists from London to Los Angeles are dreaming up new iterations of the cut daily — and we predict that, in 2026, there’ll be no escaping the temptation to brave the scissors.</p>



<p>With that in mind, scroll ahead for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/choppy-bob-haircut-trend"">bob haircut trends</a> top stylists predict will reign supreme in 2026 and beyond.</p>

<p>Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/georgecurranhair/?hl=en"">George Curran</a> bills the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"">Korean bob</a> as one of the most exciting haircut innovations. “The cut is designed so you can have a bob when your hair is tied or clipped up, and long hair when it’s worn down,” says Curren. It’s literally two hairstyles in one. “No extensions and all without committing to losing your length,” adds Curran. “It’s a clever optical illusion haircut using a specialist Korean cutting technique, and it’s perfect for anyone who wants versatility without compromise.” This video posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHhiQfwy0fw/?hl=en"">Timothy Ting</a> is mesmerizing. </p>

<p>“This blends charm and delicacy with a modern and lived-in edge,” says Devin Graciano is a professional hairstylist and CEO of <a href=""https://goldielocks.com/"">Goldie Locks</a>. She adds, “The style is lightweight, soft, and full of movement, which gives it that effortless, airy feel,” — but it boasts attitude and intention, too. “The bixie complements the playful and confident person who wears it,” says Graciano. “It’s a cut that feels both current and timeless, with room for personalization depending on texture and personality.” This cut <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DF0IrRkRFc7/?hl=en"">by Jordz</a> is perfect. </p>

<p>Curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/curlvision/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dusty Schlabach</a> predicts that the blunt curly bob will be everywhere. “It’s a zero-layer, ultra-clean blunt bob that sits right at the chin,” says Schlabach, adding, “It’s perfect for medium to low-density curls because it keeps the shape sleek without stacking or creating that Christmas tree effect at the baseline” — no triangular shapes here. Instead, the silhouette is “intentional,” says Schlabach, who suggests asking your stylist to cut your curls dry, exactly in their natural pattern. “Think a straight-across blunt line and no layers — just the slightest, almost invisible A-line so it sits clean at the chin,” says Schlabach. This cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2gbfBIrVs/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nadine Koca</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>Rather than a clean, blunt line, the ends of the shattered bob are point-cut or “shattered” by slicing into the hair vertically to create a “choppy, airy, slightly fragmented finish,” says Curran, like this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKNboCxibT3/?img_index=1"">Pam Mlunjwana</a>. “It has that effortless, undone vibe,” he continues. But make no mistake: “It’s a very technical cut that relies on precision and the right styling products.” Layering is essential to add movement, says Curran. “You want the hair to have body and flow, without slipping into that helmet-like shape. I remove a lot of weight through the layers, particularly around the [back], which gives the cut bounce and stops it feeling heavy or bulky.”</p>



<p>Curran says the shattered bob looks best when it’s relaxed and a little tousled. “That cool-girl, lived-in texture feels intentional but never overdone.

<p>When Curran thinks of a French bob, the words classic, timeless, and iconic spring to his mind. “In 2025, we saw this style evolve with softer layering around the face,” he says. “But as we head into 2026, it’s all about a more grown-out, effortless version of the look,” like this one by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C8txZwFMmA6/?img_index=1"">Faick Zekai</a>. According to Curran, it stays sophisticated thanks to a strong, heavy finish through the ends and very minimal layering throughout.</p>

<p>Coined by Graciano, the liquid bob is a “sleek, softly sculpted bob with seamless layers and polished ends that move like fluid.” It’s glossy, weightless, and intentionally refined, she adds. Simply ask your stylist for a “blunt-to-soft perimeter bob,” advises Graciano, complete with subtle internal layering. “Wearing it blow-dried smooth emphasizes shine and swing,” says Graciano.

<p>The bubble bob — aka rounded layered curly bob, according to Schlabach — is the total opposite of the aforementioned blunt bob. “This cut uses soft, intentional layers to create a rounder, more lifted shape that distributes weight evenly,” says Schlabach. “It’s ideal for dense curls that tend to build bulk at the bottom because the layers prevent heaviness and open up movement throughout the shape.” </p>

<p>The cowgirl bob has a strong ’90s influence, says Curran. “I think it’s going to be a big evolution from the French bob or the blunt, one-length, ultra-polished look à la Sofia Richie-Grainge,” he adds. The cowgirl bob has a few defining attributes: “It’s softer, shaggier, and more relaxed — for those who don’t want a super-sleek finish and prefer a bit more movement and natural texture.” Curran points to Alexa Chung as inspiration. “What I love most is how bespoke you can make it,” adds Curran. “You can tailor it completely to the client and frame the face with soft or grown-out bangs.”</p>



<p>To style it, Curran recommends using a curling iron to create a subtle kick through the ends. “This will enhance that relaxed, cowgirl-inspired movement,” he says. “I always finish with <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/LOr%C3%A9al-TecniArt-Panache-250ml-spray/dp/B07Q75GPTZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2UNY5RX8L9Z1X&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p9Dv2Em9KZ1dUuI0qurdCujclzhhzAyGiM37bmtAoSponvWcc6JMQfFW4ReafeK-15dJPdym1YQ9OQvrEVhyMYm41nwHab4lmw28sT1dwxT_FCQ3csuUtaKR5N-k4XLO1BQUR-YsN_ELojTrixV6rjgC66SwDg07Iekz87DrFn7RRt-BvH0yaJplQxCV6v8XsZXroBvUmUZUcI9oE12fr4zep0cLhz6OrQHUnezjdwlO3ULOUh38PY4NQq-yT3Gak9uJAR8Kn9xbn0mODyi1OEDPRLXr-StUPynDMkv9bXM.n-meX568iOuMTSxmPeqJSf-gb0exmG0f1d0m-ivdQIw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=L%E2%80%99Or%C3%A9al+Professionnel+Tecni+Art+Volume+Panache&amp;qid=1765471158&amp;sprefix=l+or%C3%A9al+professionnel+tecni+art+volume+panache%2Caps%2C81&amp;sr=8-1"">L’Oréal Professionnel Tecni Art Volume Panache</a> to keep the texture airy and full of body.

<p>This is a rounded, gently layered bob, which Graciano says is designed to enhance natural texture. “It keeps the shape airy and controlled, never bulky,” she says — just like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSH36HMDITs/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Faick Zekai</a>. “Ask your stylist for a bob that hits between the jaw and collarbone, with light internal layering and curl-by-curl shaping to maintain softness and movement.”</p>

<p>Brace yourselves: the pob, aka the pixie bob, is making a comeback — and Curran predicts it’ll be one of the standout cuts of 2026. “Think Scarlett Johansson circa 2015 or Victoria Beckham in her 2007 Posh bob era,” says Curran. He adds, “We’re seeing a real shift towards shapes that feel more architectural yet still wearable, and this cut ticks every box. I love the contrast it creates: one side sharp and cropped, the other slightly longer, sweeping, and sculpted.” Even better, Curran says it’s the ideal next step for anyone with a ’90s bob who wants to go shorter. “It’s bold, low-maintenance, and super stylish.” We adore this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMLMojRRPcg/?img_index=1"">Sheridan Holyoak</a>. </p>

<p>Schlabach says that the curly lob, or long bob, is a slightly longer version of the bubble and blunt curly bobs. “It’s a shoulder-grazing cut that keeps length while maintaining structure,” adds Schlabach, “and it’s often paired with thoughtful face-framing or a soft veil bang to open up the front and create natural movement.” Thanks to the additional few inches, this style works well across most curl types and densities, says Schlabach.

December is more than just the holidays. It’s also the beginning of the winter arc. If you’re unfamiliar, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-arc-tiktok-fitness-self-improvement"">winter arc</a> is a social trend centered on building healthy, grounding habits during the colder months. For some, that looks like locking in: doing a full physical and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/digital-decluttering-how-to"">digital declutter</a>, taking a financial audit of your 2025 plans, or creating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/taylor-cassidy-vision-boarding"">vision board</a> for 2026. Meanwhile, others are embracing a slower hibernation mode, like reading that final book on your TBR list, easing into restorative routines, or slowly crocheting a seasonal sweater.<br /><br />Whatever the approach, it’s all a form of preparation for the year ahead, another 365 days filled with opportunities, challenges, and moments of inspiration to plan for and look forward to. While it’s true that the seconds between December 31, 2025 and January 1, 2026 won’t magically transform our lives, there is a shift in energy that takes place. One that invites us to reflect on our wins, acknowledge the lessons, and give ourselves permission to start fresh in the new year.<br /><br />And while you don’t need anything fancy to tap into that New Year energy, there are tools that can make it easier to manifest, plan, organize, and track your progress. Below, we’re sharing stationery picks, motivational prints, and energy-clearing essentials to help you step confidently into your next chapter.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Palo santo, a fragrant wood traditionally used in South America, is known for its warm, resinous scent and its ability to create a grounding atmosphere. When burned, it releases a gentle aroma that instantly shifts the tone of a room. Incan cultures believed it offered medicinal and therapeutic benefits, like purifying spaces, and many continue to use it to cleanse and reset. Peruvian-owned lifestyle brand Luna Sundara works with local artisans who sustainably harvest high-quality Palo Santo smudging sticks.<br /><br /><strong>Luna Sundara</strong> Luna Sundara’s Palo Santo Smudging Sticks, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lunasundara.com%2Fcollections%2Fpalo-santo%2Fproducts%2Fluna-sundara-palo-santo-smudging-sticks-from-peru-sustainably-harvested-quality-hand-picked-100-grams-approx-25-sticks&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Flock-in-tools-2026"">Luna Sundara</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1420"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11949367.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1146&amp;height=1420&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=573:710"" width=""1146"" /><figcaption><strong>Bella Doña’s 2026 Planner<br /></strong><br />Next, get organized.

It’s also about self-discovery and deepening your relationship with yourself. It’s gaining clarity on who you are, your values, your interests, and your boundaries. It’s understanding what you want out of your life, not just your career or finances. It’s about reflecting, growing, and preserving the memories that matter most to you. The intimate, safe, free writing that comes with journaling makes it one of the easiest, most powerful, and inexpensive ways to do this.

Certain scents, like rosemary, peppermint, or eucalyptus, have been shown to improve alertness and concentration, while others, like citrus, vanilla, or lavender, are known to reduce stress and elevate mood. Whatever your preference or need, tapping into the power of scent can help you lock in.
