<p>I watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/entertainment"">a lot of TV.</a> It’s my job. And in all my years of b<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/binge-watching-habit-meaning-psychology"">inge-watching shows</a> for a living, I have never seen so many viral videos of people <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3-watch-party-blue-haven-nyc-scene-report"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">gathered together in bars simultaneously yelling</a> in reaction to major TV moments than I have this year. In the age of streaming, appointment TV was back and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-usa-watch-parties-community"">watch parties were bigger</a> than ever. Whether it was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7520444252002848055?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolandria’s Soul Ties kiss</a> (IYKYK), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11934118/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-ending-explained-review-belly"">king of yearning Conrad Fisher</a> finally getting his happily ever after, or a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSe15yhDuu1/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grand gesture from a gay hockey player</a> no one saw coming, TV lovers came together this year to obsess over their fave ‘ships and root for their beloved characters. And it was beautiful to witness. </p>



<p>In a year that felt endlessly chaotic and packed with horrific headlines, TV stepped up as our most reliable emotional support system. 2025 gave us shows that made us scream-text the group chat, cancel plans for<em> just one more episode</em>, and rethink everything from love, to friendship, to what counts as a satisfying finale. Whether you were into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/203712/best-2000s-shows-platinum-age"">prestige dramas</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-christmas-movies"">comfort watches</a>, or genre shows that completely rewired the formula, this year’s best TV did not disappoint. Below are the series that defined our screens, our moods, and cured our collective cultural brain rot.</p>



<p>These picks come straight from the watchlists (and our unhinged yet professional Slack chats) of Refinery29 editors. The criteria isn’t “high-brow only,” it’s <em>did this show fully consume us?</em> From series that demanded our full attention to reality TV that went from chaotic to comforting to culturally essential, we’re honoring the full spectrum of what great TV looks like. If it sparked a debate, delivered a meme, or made us feel something unexpectedly real, it earned its spot. </p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq8x47ky2Tw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>For some reason, I was never into Grey’s Anatomy, Scrubs, ER, or any of the popular hospital dramas even during their streaming resurgences. But after everyone from family to strangers recommended watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date""> </a>(starring and executive-produced by ER’s very own Noah Wyle) and being bombarded with interviews of Wylie talking about how his nurse mom influenced the storyline for more accurate depictions of what it’s actually like to work in a hospital, I finally gave in. And wow, was I stunned. </p>



<p>Each of the 15 episodes represent one hour of a consecutive 15-hour emergency room shift. It’s fast-paced and chaotic but has moments of levity, and manages to dive deep into each of the doctors, nurses, and residents’ eccentricities and back stories. I found myself instantly hooked and invested into the core doctors and incoming patients, no matter how likeable, unlikeable, long, or short their storylines were. The heavy, high-strung, high-stakes series is a must-watch. But to warn you, it is certainly not a show to wind down to after a hectic day!<em> <strong>– Victoria Montalti, Senior Fashion Writer</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a> </em>Season 7 </strong></h2>







<p>When an Irish friend first introduced me to <em>Love Island </em>via the show’s original UK iteration in 2022, I was equally horrified and intrigued by the sheer logistics of it all. The idea of committing to a show that airs a new episode six nights a week for two and a half months straight — featuring a revolving door of 30-or-so contestants and their constantly recalibrating romances — was a lot to wrap my head around. But, as someone who deeply appreciates lowbrow reality TV both as a form of sociological fieldwork and, obviously, for pure eye candy, I was up for the task. </p>



<p>This year, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> season 7</a> brought the country together in ways seldom seen before, becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon that revived the glory days of participatory reality TV. My roommate and I grew closer as we watched and voted together each night (and shrieked in horror at the show’s absolutely unhinged challenges). My colleagues and I raced to our Slack channels each morning to share hot takes. Even in New York City, where people famously mind their business, I’d find myself talking about the show with a friend on the street or subway, only to have strangers jump in mid-conversation to share their opinions.</p>



<p>What ultimately made season 7 feel like a classic was (most of) the cast’s emotional vulnerability. It gave us a hero’s arc in Amaya Papaya (née Espinal), who brought a rare level of authenticity and sensitivity to reality TV, a friends-to-star-crossed-lovers romance in Olandria and Nic, healthy debates about what it really means to be “a girls girl,” and enough memes to last a lifetime (Mamacita, anyone?). <em><strong>– Lia Tabackman, Senior Social Media Manager </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@hbomax/video/7583017214677241119"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rivalry</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I’m going to start with a quote from <em><a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rilvarly’s</a></em> creator, writer and showrunner, Jacob Tierney: “Putting queer sex on the screen in a celebratory and sexy way is not common at all… people were clearly craving that kind of thing,” <a href=""https://theankler.com/p/i-think-heated-rivalry-deserves-emmys"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tierney told The Ankler</a>. “They wanted to see sexually alive, queer people in a way that we kind of self-censor and don’t always do. I don’t think the show is popular despite the horniness; I think it’s popular because of the horniness.” Exactly. Recently, TV and film have been oddly sexless, seemingly scared to show erotism on screen and convinced audiences don’t want to see pretty people kissing. I beg to differ.</p>



<p>I’ve been pushing the horny TV agenda for years and finally, here comes a show to match my freak. But it’s not just about the beautifully tender, explicit, real, and <em>hot </em>sex scenes, <em>Heated Rivalry </em>contains some of the most heartfelt and romantic storytelling I’ve ever seen on TV. And that’s only after five episodes! I am already unhealthily obsessed with this show and I can’t wait for more. As someone who belongs to multiple romance book clubs, I’m so happy that a show based on a romance novel (written by Rachel Reid) is getting the love it deserves. Plus, a show about gay hockey players airing in 2025 — when male athletes would still face so much prejudice, homophobia, and an extremely hard time if they came out IRL — is not only bold and brave, it’s revolutionary.  – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em><br /></p>

<p>I admittedly didn’t watch much TV this year, but there was one show that had me in a chokehold: Season 3 of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty.</em> To be honest, I didn’t particularly enjoy this season. As Team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), a lot of it was insufferable, mostly because Conrad (Christopher Briney) remains an unbearable character to watch. He’s going to talk down to Belly (Lola Tung) and make her feel crazy for years AND do his brother like that, and they still want me to believe he’s not the villain in this show? (You ain’t gaslighting me, Connie Baby!). I also couldn’t stand the way the writers seemed determined to assassinate Jeremiah’s character. Still, to paraphrase a Taylor Swift lyric, Jenny Han really puts narcotics into all of her episodes, because no matter how much I wanted to look away, I just couldn’t. <em>– Raquel Reichard, Director of Somos</em></p>

<p>When I first started <em>The Hunting Wives</em>, I wasn’t prepared for what I signed up for. I assumed I would be watching a show about wives getting back at their cheating husbands. I was right, but also so wrong. I spent most of the time being mad at the main character Sophie (Brittany Snow), literally rolling my eyes at the screen at her antics. That said, I will be back for Season 2. –<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/secretlivesonhulu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSky3regZqi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</a> </em>was my favorite TV show of 2025 because it didn’t just understand the assignment, it overdelivered. TWO seasons in one year? Bravo could never. By breaking the fourth wall and letting the off-screen drama (hello, Fruity Pebbles) bleed into the show, it captured the same raw magic as early Vanderpump Rules seasons, back when the cast wanted fame at any cost and didn’t know, or care, to hold anything back.</p>



<p>Season 3 was filmed before Season 2 even premiered, giving us something almost unheard of in reality TV: reunions being taped, press tours unfolding, and cast dynamics shifting in real time as they reacted to public opinion. The timeline was messy, but for reality fans, that level of transparency was all we’ve ever wanted.</p>



<p>We watched marriages implode, secret affairs surface, and learned way too much about their sex lives. Not every storyline worked (the sexual assault allegations were uncomfortable and difficult to watch), but the drama was balanced by something real: raw, unprocessed trauma shared in a way that genuinely resonated.</p>



<p>Taylor Frankie Paul becoming the Bachelorette only cemented the show’s chokehold on pop culture, while Whitney Leavitt started the year as the ultimate villain and ended it as the main character of<em> Dancing with the Stars </em>and getting cast as Roxie Hart on Broadway. The range! And all of this unfolded in the hyper-specific, endlessly fascinating playground of Swig sodas, Utah curls, and Mormon culture—proof that you don’t need alcohol for reality TV gold.<em> – Taylor Loren, Social Strategist </em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81418639"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forever</a> </em></strong></h2>







<p>Mara Brock Akil’s <em>Forever</em> feels like it was made specifically for me — for the 16 year old version of me who needed to see herself, who longed for stories that reflected Black girlhood and humanity and the complexity of being a Black kid in a white space — and that’s only partially why I loved it so much. For the teenager in me who was messily figuring out her sexuality, Keisha and Justin would have been my fictional best friends. For the thirty-redacted grownup who needed an escape and just loves romance, <em>Forever</em> delivered in-depth, nuanced explorations of how sex can be absolutely everything and sometimes nothing at all. </p>



<p>Listen, I’m too grown to believe that representation will save us, but it does matter. And what this show represents (Black kids falling in love and finding themselves) is portrayed in such a caring, thoughtful way that as you fall in love with Keisha and Justin, as a Black person, you can’t help but love yourself more. This show loves us. It finds beauty in Blackness, in the nuances and flaws of youth. It lets Keisha be complicated and messy and Justin be introspective and vulnerable; two things that Black girls and boys aren’t typically allowed to be on TV. This show is my wildest dreams come true. It’s the show I wish I had when I was a teenager and I’m so grateful that Black teens get this show now. – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em><br /></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://abc.com/show/e4f28254-2fc4-4cc1-b9bb-eee0564c178e"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Abbott Elementary</a> </em>Season 5</strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10828529/abbott-elementary-show-review-quinta-brunson"">Abbott Elementary</a></em> is my comfort show when I want to just laugh and <em>not have to think</em>. I can usually jump into any episode in the season or binge several of the 22-minute episodes and still understand what’s happening. In the same style as cult-favorite comedies like<em> The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Rec,</em> this workplace “mockumentary” follows the staff of a Philadelphia elementary school and captures all the drama and antics you’d expect to happen during everyday life—in and out of school. The show is currently in the middle of season five and we see teachers Janine and Gregory’s relationship continue to develop. A few of the recent episodes have taken the setting out of the school, but my favorites are usually when the teachers and staff, especially Principal Ava Coleman and teacher Ms. Melissa Schementti, are just trying to get through the school day. For me, it’s easy sitcom watching. –<em> Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81427733"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Beast In Me</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>If I were putting together a dream team of prestige TV, I would immediately call up Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys for my starting five. Danes proved in <em>Homeland</em>, and throughout her storied career, that she can do a chin quiver like no other, and that there is no emotion she can’t convey through the careful crumpling of her face. And Rhys, along with his real-life wife Keri Russell, showed on <em>The Americans</em> that he can make even the most ethically-questionable character someone you can’t help but be intrigued by. In <em>The Beast In Me</em>, these two heavyweights come together for some of the best TV of the year. </p>



<p>Both Danes and Rhys are so compelling in <em>The Beast In Me, </em>you won’t be able to look away for all eight episodes. Danes brings her signature emotional precision, playing every flicker of doubt and defiance like a controlled burn, while Rhys does what he does best: make moral ambiguity feel devastatingly human. Together, they create a push-pull dynamic that’s an unsettling dissertation on good versus evil and what happens when the lines between the two start to blue. Their chemistry isn’t flashy; it’s claustrophobic, simmering, and kind that makes silence feel louder than dialogue and turns every shared glance into a threat. It’s prestige acting without the self-importance, and it’s exactly why the show gets under your skin and stays there. – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDFty5ipEg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Buccanneers</a> </em>Season 2</strong></h2>







<p>This past summer, I was indulging in some YA love-triangle drama and watching <em>TSITP</em> and<em> The Buccaneers</em> Season 2 on Apple TV. If you’re not familiar with The Buccaneers, it’s a period drama set in 1870s England following five gorgeous American women trying to find titled husbands and independence. Season 2 tries to resolve a love triangle set up in Season 1 between Nan, Guy, and Theo. New affairs and betrayals between the couples develop, and it’s guilty-pleasure watching, especially for period romance fans. Spoiler warning: season two ends in another cliffhanger but the show’s already been greenlit for a season three.<em> – Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://tubitv.com/series/300014710/the-z-suite"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Z Suite </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I know Tubi gets a bad rep for its content, but do NOT sleep on them. I loved everything about the Z Suite! The characters were fun. The plots were full of shenanigans. It fueled the Gen Z vs. Millennial fire in a way that leaves you with the idea, “we are more alike than different”. It had a sense of true comedic whimsy, while many other shows are just too serious. I am unsure if it will be renewed for another season, but I sure hope so! —<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/en-ca/browse/entity-2b4b8988-50c9-4097-bf93-bc34a99a5b4f"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradise </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jan/28/paradise-review-disney-a-whodunnit-with-wit-heart-and-sterling-k-brown""><em>Paradise</em></a> is a mystery series starring Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown about a secret service agent whose president is murdered and it’s so good, it got renewed for a <a href=""https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a64208545/paradise-season-2-news-date-cast-spoilers/"">second season</a> halfway into its first. So I’m just going to quote myself from March writing about <em>Paradise</em> just after it was renewed: “We’re in an age where a show with a Black lead gets written off by online trolls as ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">too woke</a>’ or full of ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">DEI hires</a>’ and anything that makes us feel our feelings gets denigrated as ‘silly.’ But the absurdity and sincerity of <em>Paradise</em> is its strength. And its hero? A Black man, the descendent of a Tuskegee airman and Black pilot, who took a bullet for the president, may feel a bit too nationalistic for the current moment, but it also harkens back to a time when that guy was the hero everyone welcomed, and the one TV wanted. Right now, Sterling K. Brown as Xavier Collins is the hero we need.” – <em>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.cbs.com/shows/ghosts/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ghosts</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>This year marked Season 4 and 5 of <em>Ghosts</em>, and it is consistently one of my favorite comfort watches. I literally force anyone who comes to my house to watch it with me. Season 4 gave the characters so much more backstory. Season 5 adds to that. If you want a good, wholesome chuckle, you should definitely watch this show. –<em> Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</em></p>

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style and ring in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-years-eve-nail-art-designs"">the new year</a> with a trendy winter coat. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and look out for versatile coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. (And be sure to also look out for non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.)</p>

I’m 13 years old and I’m on my way to what I <em>know</em> will be one of the craziest nights of my life: <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Justin Bieber </a><em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My World 2.0</a></em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Tour.</a> As I crank my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-straightening-tools"">hair straightener</a> up way too high (RIP to my ends), I pause mid-section and wonder: <em>What am I missing? What would truly make Justin fall in love with me? </em>And then it hits me: my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/favorite-perfumes-editors-picks"">vanilla cupcake perfume</a> from Claire’s.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fragrance"">perfume is aggressively sugary</a> and smells like straight icing. All my mom could hear from downstairs was <em>sksksksksks</em> as I drowned myself in it, fully convinced that if Justin couldn’t see me from the stage, he would at least smell me. And well, not to spoil the ending, but… he did not fall in love with me that night. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2018/11/217863/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-marriage-confirmed"">Congrats, Hailey</a>!</p>



<p>What <em>did</em> happen, though, was far more consequential: that was the night I fell in love with gourmand fragrances, specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla</a>. I never cared what brand it was, as long as the bottle starts with <em>buttery</em>, <em>whipped</em>, or <em>sugar</em>, I was in.</p>



<p>Life was going great until one day, a coworker casually mentions that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-editor-favorites"">favorite fragrance</a> reminds her of what it smells like to be a child. Suddenly, I was overthinking everything. Was I still that 13-year-old hoping to be noticed by JB, or did my signature scent simply need a rebrand?</p>



<p>Turns out, it was both.</p>



<p>When I heard that <a href=""https://thesoapandglory.com/""><strong>Soap &amp; Glory</strong></a> dropped a brand-new, mood-boosting fragrance line, I was intrigued. It covers pretty much every palette. There’s <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-tropical-sunrise/ID=300462740-product""><strong>Tropical Sunrise</strong></a> with pineapple and coconut, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-orchid-bliss/ID=300462734-product""><strong>Orchid Bliss</strong></a> with orchid and sandalwood, <a href=""http://walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-radiant-rose/ID=300462747-product""><strong>Radiant Rose</strong></a> with florals and bergamot, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-watermelon-spritz/ID=300462746-product""><strong>Watermelon Spritz</strong></a> for something bright and juicy, and of course <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-vanilla-licious/ID=300462744-product""><strong>Vanilla-licious</strong></a> with warm caramel and vanilla notes. With a set with this much range, it’s perfect for mixing and matching. And with each fragrance under $20, it felt like the perfect chance to find my signature scent and actually play around with layering.</p>

<p>Since I hadn’t elevated my fragrance in nearly 20 years, I tapped the internet’s favorite fragrance guru, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@paulreactss?lang=en""><strong>Paul Fino</strong></a>, for advice on how to layer scents and whether I can keep being a vanilla girl at my big age. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>Unbothered: So talk to me about vanilla. Do you think it’s having a moment right now? And do you think it’s one of those scents that transcends seasons, like a year-round thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Fino:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Vanilla is year-round for me because there are so many vanilla-adjacent scents. You can find vanillas that lean super creamy, more floral, or even more powdery. That said, vanilla is definitely most popular in fall and winter. People love warm gourmands in colder months, and in summer they usually want something more tropical, fruity, or fresh. But vanilla is not going anywhere. It’s had its moment and it’s become one of those things that just sticks around.</p>



<p><strong>My coworker said vanilla is childish. So when you see something like Vanilla-licious, which feels more grown and sexy but still has that inner-child sweetness, how do you elevate it? How do you layer it so you don’t smell like cupcake perfume from Limited Too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> I 100% get that. A lot of gourmand vanillas can lean artificial or very young. When people say they want a “mature” vanilla, I get it, but “mature” doesn’t mean grandma. It can mean deeper, sexier, more attractive. One of my favorite ways to elevate Vanilla-licious is pairing it with Radiant Rose. Radiant Rose is basically their iconic signature scent, but repackaged and made a little newer and fresher. Rose is romantic, and it deepens the vanilla. The musk in both helps them blend really beautifully. That vanilla-rose combination is gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>I feel like layering fragrance is like cooking. You wouldn’t put mustard and jelly together. So how do you know what works? What’s the science of scent layering, especially for someone new who wants to smell unique but still wearable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> It’s all about understanding notes and scent families. I can usually predict how something will smell based on the notes and how many fragrances I’ve experienced, but a simple rule is to keep things in similar scent profiles if you want to play it safe. Sweets with sweets, gourmands with gourmands. For example, vanilla with pineapple and coconut makes sense because it’s tropical sweet. Vanilla and coconut always work together, so Vanilla-licious with Tropical Sunrise is an easy layering combo.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952222.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What about combinations that are risky?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Sometimes mixing two different ends of the spectrum can clash, but sometimes a clash is exactly what makes it interesting. That’s how you get people to ask, “What are you wearing?” Also, fragrance wears differently on everyone, so experimentation matters.</p>



<p><strong>Are these meant to be layered only with each other, or can you layer them with perfumes too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> You can absolutely layer these with perfumes. They’re body mists, but they have really good projection and longevity, especially for the price point. They’re great as base layers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a method for layering? Like an order you follow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong>Yes. I do heaviest to lightest. I start with my deepest scent first, like a heavy wood or musk, then layer lighter scents on top. It’s kind of like how fragrance is built, with base notes, heart notes, and top notes.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952224.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>If someone just wants one scent from the line for self-care, like a shower that makes you feel calm and relaxed, which one is it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Orchid Bliss. Hands down. If you want truly relaxing and calming, Orchid Bliss is the one. It’s slightly sweet, it has sandalwood, and there are also notes like vanilla and pistachio in there, but they feel more subtle and deeper in the background. It’s like a spa in a bottle.</p>



<p><strong>Why not Vanilla-licious for calm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Vanilla makes me feel confident. Like, super confident. Orchid Bliss gives more calm spa-night energy. If you’re tired, overworked, and want the most relaxing shower, I’d do scrub, wash, body butter, and spray in Orchid Bliss, then top it with your favorite perfume if you want extra oomph.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>After talking to Paul, I realized it was never really about retiring vanilla. It was about wearing it with intention. It was about keeping the sweetness but adding depth. It’s time to let my inner 13-year-old have her moment, while my grown self makes my scent feel polished. So yes, I’m still a vanilla girl. I’m just a vanilla girl with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-vanilla-perfume""><em>range</em></a> now.</p>

<p><em>Music journalist Kelly Washington travelled to the Playa Pacha at the FIVE Luxe Hotel to profile <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a>, the queen of K-House and techno. </em></p>



<p>It is around midnight at the Playa Pacha openair nightclub in the <a href=""https://luxejbr.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"">FIVE LUXE hotel in Dubai</a>. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gerdjansonofficial/?hl=en"">German DJ Gerd Janson</a> has just dropped a remix of Stevie Nick’s “Edge Of Seventeen” when <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/dj-peggy-gou-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a> appears next to him, diamond-clad in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/q_millinery/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Q Park Millinery</a> sparkly bandana, with a cat on the front reading “Mew Mew,” paired with a black two-piece. I am standing behind the decks, watching her slink into the space with her entourage, as the crowd reacts to her presence. Someone next to me breathlessly exclaims “queen”, in a way that seems involuntarily. As the crowd howls in unison and Gou clasps their hands, I am struck by how comfortable she looks.</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that once upon a time, Gou was just starting out in the underground scene; she seems as if she was plonked down on earth, already a successful 34-year-old, with her knowing, winning smile and covered in patchwork tattoos, cigarette in one hand, tending to the decks with the other. The ‘female DJ’ as an archetype has gone through many iterations, but never before has she propelled herself into mainstream stardom the way Peggy Gou has. In a short space of time, she achieved global fame, headlined major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, created global hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCz5y84dwuA"">(It Goes Like) Nanana,</a>” and became the first Korean to play the <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/berghain-linux"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">world-renowned legacy club Berghain.</a> </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952202.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The FIVE LUXE hotel is flooded with Brits escaping the December chill at home, as well as Americans, Russians, and other European clientele. Backed by the hotel’s luxury ecosystem project, the FIVE LUXE has a “do more with less” ethos and is 100% solar powered, making it the world’s highest-rated 5-Star Hotel green building under LEED v4 (the international standard for high-performance green buildings). FIVE’s service is the best I’ve ever experienced (even my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-clothes-accessories-2025#slide-8"">battered Vagabond handbag</a> gets its own seat at every table), and I’m grateful I packed my <a href=""https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/swarovski"">Swarovski Loop ear plugs</a> (the only sparkly thing I own) so I just about fit in with the bold and flash crowd.</p>



<p>I ask Peggy to describe Dubai’s club scene in three words, to which she enthusiastically responds “energetic, diverse and growing!” Considering a huge 90% of the population are expats, she’s not wrong. FIVE’s Palm Jeremiah hotel (also in Dubai) even boasts its own recording studio, and with a club in Ibiza too, it’s clear the team has set their sights on Dubai as their next ultimate party destination. They have the cash, and they plan to spend it on the best talent money can buy; hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlcoxofficial/?hl=en"">Carl Cox</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marcocarola/?hl=en"">Marco Carola </a>and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/solomun/?hl=en"">Solomun</a> at Playa Pacha. </p>



<p>When she was 18, Peggy Gou went to study at the <a href=""https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/study-at-lcf?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332830344&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-G_q8pyDEQVeFZGpmfJ8Qdf3lAZE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82J0Y4h9qKJbh7cGoshAwRUZaq-07o72iJKm9Ca2eli2Uxv2PBe2o4sxoCvVEQAvD_BwE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London College of Fashion</a> with hopes of becoming a designer, then a photographer, then a stylist. But she’d always been passionate about music, and eventually found a way to use her skills in fashion promotion to fill a gap in electronic music. While most house and techno DJs dress understated, she knew her style would play a pivotal role in her success once she began producing music and cutting her teeth at small venues in London and Berlin. I ask her why these grassroots spaces are important right now, and her critical eye shines: “Club culture continues to influence many aspects of creative industries far beyond music. Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it,” Gou says. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it.</p><cite>dj peggy gou</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Above all, Gou is a strategic and smart producer, and is incredibly intentional about what she puts out and why. Back in July 2018, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Manchester in the UK, and a label called Defected Records reigned supreme among most of my friends who were into house music. It was on this label that Gou released a remix of Shakedown’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“At Night (Peggy Gou’s Acid Journey Remix)”</a> that defined the summer. As catchy, accessible and pop-fluent as the chorus was, it never seemed to get old, and hit #1 on the UK Official Dance Singles Chart. Everywhere you went, the At Night remix was playing. The pulsing vocal could be heard from Manchester, to London, to party island Ibiza, often heard in a rendition similar to that of a football chant. With this single, Gou propelled herself into the dance music world, then onto the global stage, and hasn’t slowed down since. </p>



<p>Blowing up in electronic music as a woman, can be your best and worst nightmare all at once. Overnight, you are successful, impressive, and adored. But six months later you are likely to fall victim to criticism for <em>something</em>, like being too commercial or having rich parents. Her haters will say that she sold out, that once Peggy Gou had everyone feeling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“much better… at night</a>”, she was no longer the underground DJ sensation who cut her teeth in clubs in London and Berlin – they’d lost her to A-list status. Charli XCX touched on this in <a href=""https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-death-of-cool"">her recent substack </a>titled “The Death of Cool.” XCX wrote, “I have always rejected the idea that art, film, persona or music becoming commercial means it cannot also be considered cool. The rejection of commerciality ‘just because’ is such a boring and immature argument that is perhaps more suited to some mediums than others but in general I find to be elitist in a way that does not thrill me whatsoever,” she continued. “Disliking something purely because of its widespread popularity or links to commercialism comes with a distinctly art school type energy that is super triggering to me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952204.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Charli XCX is right, artists can’t take this chatter personally – just because some fans in the electronic music space have a habit of tarnishing those who rise to success quickly, especially if you’re a woman. At the same time, it is not wholly uncommon to witness legends (often male), playing what can only be described as the worst set you’ve seen in your life, on no sleep, without consequence or fallout in the scene.</p>



<p>When cool points are gained on the basis of youth and niche references, mainstream success can become the enemy in certain circles. Once something transcends the underground, it transforms into something else entirely. But Peggy never forgot her roots; a genre-blending selector with range, she’s known for her energetic but composed sets. She often plays a combination of pulsing house, techno and break beats, dropping tunes from artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dj_seinfeld/"">DJ Seinfeld</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andrezimmer_/?hl=en"">Andre Zimmer,</a> as well as hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dmx_krew/?hl=en"">DMX Krew</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/regularfantasy/"">Regularfantasy</a> on her label. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>… this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world.</p><cite>peggy gou on mentoring other djs</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Sure, it’s inevitable that those who are successful will be criticized. Someone’s song blows up, they get big, and then we get bored until they do something else remarkable. But in this corner of entertainment, it’s silly to dismiss a DJ because of their accolades. To paint a picture, a Berlin-based journalist I met recently told me (with a straight face) that because Gou is never seen in the local pubs in Berlin, it must mean she doesn’t actually live there (she does). So let’s set the record straight, aside from electronic music’s swirling pool of cool that has a habit of eating the principles it so vehemently defends, I can confirm that Gou is touring the world, looking sensational, and most importantly very, very good at her job. </p>



<p>To get a broader picture of how she shaped her taste, I ask Gou to name an album, movie and a book that was essential in her cultural education. For her movie she selects cult classic <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (which tracks with her style), the book is Nietzsche’s <em>Ubermensch </em>(there’s that critical thinking), and a true music head, she sites Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-d-the-catalogue-live/1572506374"">3-D: The Catalogue (Live) </a>as the ultimate education. Gou explains how she still tries to make it down to grassroots venues, “not just as a DJ but more importantly as a raver, which I always find inspiring and cathartic.” Her dedication to a range of culture shows in the sets she plays, so I think we can forgive her for not sharing a pint with us at the local boozer.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952205.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>In March 2019, Gou realized she wanted to own her own music and uplift other artists on the rise, so she created <em>Gudu Records</em> and released her own album titled “Moment”. A few years ago, I interviewed the<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/matisa.dj/""> Italian DJ Matisa</a>, who has released music on Peggy Gou’s label. When I asked her about her experience as a woman in the industry, she credited Gou as a brilliant mentor to herself and others in the dance music community, adding that she’s very hard working and down to earth. I ask Gou about her mission to lift up other DJs like Matisa, and she stresses the importance of not only supporting new talent via <em>Gudu</em> but also including the newcomers on her line-ups IRL, “this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world”. </p>



<p>With rising costs for venues and AI music creation causing a stir, who knows where 2026 will take electronic music. I ask Gou if she’s optimistic about where the industry is heading, in terms of building a better future for those that follow her success and she leaves me with a gem of hope that mirrors the energy she brings to the industry: “I’m optimistic for sure, but as with anything growing as fast as our industry, it won’t be without its challenges.”<br /></p>

<p>Forget tortoiseshell, leopard, and cow prints for a second — deer print is about to steal their thunder. It’s also one of the easiest prints to recreate. Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season. We love this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRHqxjPjZwm/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Sierra, also known as @thatglosssauce</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional.

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically.

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgiqAzkYj5/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a> always nails it.</p>

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson. This <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs24C3GoX3u/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">cut on Linasha</a> never fails to inspire. </p>

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<p>Some things remain constant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">every winter</a>: no matter how prepared you are, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">your skin</a> will feel the brunt of the cold, you’ll almost always hate the sweaters you bought in last year’s sale with every intention of wearing them, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cherry-perfume-fragrance"">the perfumes</a> that saw you through spring, summer, and fall just won’t feel right once the temperature drops.</p>



<p>Luckily, perfumers have been busy whipping up all manner of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-only-human-fragrance-review"">winter-appropriate fragrances</a> to suit every winter mood, whether you want to feel cozy, confident at parties, or refreshed on gloomy mornings. </p>



<p>Scroll ahead for the most inviting winter perfume trends and tips on how to wear them this chilly season — and beyond.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>



<p>Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.neimanmarcus.com%2Fp%2Fbalmain-beauty-balmain-cuir-elysees-edp-50-prod284410126"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain Cuir Élysées Eau de Parfum</a>, which blends raspberry with moody leather and enveloping sandalwood. If berries aren’t your thing, consider <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fjo-malone-sandalwood-spiced-apricot-cologne%2F8558395%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoraoEdGbW_5g9CjthQuB_RAWQYbSCQ5JIh4cnkd3OBbzQUVD6pM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jo Malone Sandalwood &amp; Spiced Apricot Cologne</a>, which pairs an otherwise summery fruit with rich, dark cardamom.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>



<p>Try layering <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcherry-ambition-eau-de-parfum-P508411"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition</a> (cherry, plum, vanilla marshmallow) with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP518376"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali Freedom Musk Latte Eau de Parfum</a> (latte, chocolate musk, and cinnamon). Returning this year, we also love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fjo-malone-london-ginger-biscuit-cologne-P509028"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jo Malone Ginger Biscuit Cologne</a>, featuring lemon, roasted hazelnut, and tonka bean with hints of vanilla and tobacco.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>



<p>Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbuttercream-haze-eau-de-parfum-P517278"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Buttercream Haze Eau de Parfum</a>, featuring buttercream icing and tonka bean. So crave-worthy, Stegemann says this “foodie fragrance” sold out in 48 hours in more than 60 Sephora stores and immediately became the number two fragrance on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2F7-virtues"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sephora.com</a>. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>



<p>You might also like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fher-elixir-de-parfum-pimprod2034780%3Fsku%3D2599353"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry Her Elixir de Parfum</a>, which features strawberry, warm amber, and earthy sandalwood. Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we least expect <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-are-5-love-languages-meaning"">it, love appears</a>. Venus in Capricorn is going to bring a lot of rizz to our hearts, allowing us to elevate our romantic game. The last week of December 2025 and first week of January 2026 are going to be filled with tenderness in its purest and deepest form; the planets aren’t fooling around when it comes to committing. Rather than playing games, we’ll be inclined to be direct and honest with what we require in partnerships. So, ramp up your profile on the dating apps, clear the cache, and get hyper-specific about what you’re looking for, because things are about to get interesting in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cuffing-season-relationship-experiences"">of cuffing season</a>.</p>



<p>Typically, the transit of Venus and Capricorn allows us to take a mature approach to romantic relationships. We state our intentions in the beginning to ensure that we’re on the same page with others. There are no hidden agendas or shadiness when it comes to what we’re giving and pulling in, meaning that our agenda is clear: we want to be a part of a union and take steps towards advancing it in the simplest ways without any drama. Building a life together, with our crush/boo, with structure and shared goals, is essential. We are willing to combine resources to create a strong foundation that can’t be broken.</p>



<p>When it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">comes to friendships</a>, we will not settle for the company of those who treat us unjustly and unkindly. Having people around us who respect and honor our time, as well as our qualities, is important. After all, we don’t want to give our energy to those who aren’t going to reciprocate fairly, which is another core theme of Venus in Capricorn. The earthiness of this aspect makes us feel super connected to our besties. Keep in mind that the focus is on material things, so we may desire shopping sprees, wine tastings, spa days, or decadent meals with our crew instead of hanging out at the local pub or coffee house.</p>



<p>From December 24, 2025, to January 17, 2026, Venus in Capricorn is making us believe in our visions of devotion. The presence of Neptune in Pisces adds a softer vibe, allowing us to fall head over heels. Luckily, Saturn gives us the strength not to go overboard. The caveat is that boundaries will be instrumental in how we move forward with others. If you get the opportunity to peek through your significant other’s iCal, resist the urge. If you opt to be nosy and get caught, it might cause major rifts. </p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the first of two Venus Star Points occurs on January 6, 2026 (the last one is cosmically slated for October 23, 2026. The term is coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, who considers the meeting of the Sun and Venus in the same sign and degree (also known as “cazimi”) to bring about metamorphic changes. Venus becomes an evening star, making it hard to spot in the sky, but not in our spirit. Since this celestial union is in Capricorn, we are inclined to make pragmatic decisions about whom we commit. Get ready to adjust your relationship status on social media! </p>



<p>As a result, Venus in Capricorn pushes us to put the effort into our passions to ensure they become tangible and true. Roll up your sleeves and start working to get what you deserve when it comes to cultivating relationships. It’ll be worth the time and energy in the end. </p>

<p>Welcome to a major transition week, R29 babes. On December 21st, the solstice strikes and Capricorn Season officially begins, marking one of the most powerful energetic pivots of the year. In astrology, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">solstices are threshold moments</a>: they represent extremes of light and dark, visibility and invisibility, action and rest. This one ushers us into four weeks of self-dedication, sovereignty, and intentional effort. And because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars is already in Capricorn</a> as the sun changes signs, we haven’t entered this energy cold.</p>



<p>We’ve been acclimating to discipline, devotion, and long-term thinking for weeks now. What shifts at the solstice is not effort, but <em>orientation</em>: we move from Sagittarius’s freedom-seeking, exploratory energy into Capricorn’s grounded commitment to self, legacy, and responsibility. We’re also coming off the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius New Moon</a>, making this an ideal week to set intentions if you haven’t yet, or to recommit to the ones that truly matter.</p>



<p>Before the sun even enters Capricorn, though, there’s an important emotional undercurrent. In the early hours of December 21st at 5:08 a.m. EST, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, creating a moment of tension between sensitivity and action. Jupiter in Cancer amplifies emotional truth, memory, and the need for safety, while Chiron in Aries exposes wounds around identity, courage, and self-assertion.</p>



<p>Collectively, this can feel like wanting to protect ourselves while also being asked totake bold steps forward. Old insecurities may flare up, especially around whether we’re  allowed to take up space or move decisively while still honoring our feelings. The entry into Capricorn Season acts as a grounding balm after this square, reminding us that we don’t have to choose between emotional honesty and forward momentum. We can build from both.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, the Capricorn influence deepens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to our relationships — romantic, platonic, and professional. Even during the holidays, the collective mood is less about small talk and more about substance. We’re thinking about money, security, generational wealth, and what (or who) is actually worth investing in. Standards are higher, patience is thinner, and performative connection won’t cut it. This is a powerful moment to turn that discernment inward first. How can you live according to the standards you expect from others? How can you embody the stability, integrity, and commitment you’re craving? Capricorn Season isn’t about deprivation — it’s about self-respect. And this solstice week sets the tone.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a potent internal–external tension. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your career, reputation, and long-term goals light up, asking you to take yourself seriously and step more fully into leadership. But just before that shift, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in your sign, bringing emotional material to the surface, especially around home, family, and your inner child. You may feel pulled between ambition and vulnerability, between showing up powerfully in the world and tending to old wounds that want your attention. This can be an uncomfortable but clarifying start to the week. The message is clear: true authority comes from emotional honesty. When you acknowledge where you still need care, you actually become more grounded and effective in your public life.</p>



<p>As the week continues, the focus sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and intensifying themes around professional relationships, long-term commitments, and the value you bring to the table. The second half of the week asks you to evaluate where your time, energy, and talents are going, and whether they’re being reciprocated in meaningful ways. This isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about alignment. You may feel less patient with superficial interactions and more drawn to connections that support your growth and legacy. Capricorn energy here reminds you that success isn’t just about achievement… it’s about building something you can stand behind with pride.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the solstice ushers in Capricorn season and activates your sector of higher learning, belief systems, and long-term vision, inviting you to zoom out and consider where you’re headed next. But this week doesn’t begin in purely practical territory. Just before the sun enters Capricorn, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional material in your subconscious and healing sector. Old fears, unspoken worries, or patterns you’ve kept buried may surface, especially around trusting yourself to move forward without having everything figured out. This square can feel disorienting, but it’s also liberating. You’re being asked to release limiting beliefs that have quietly shaped your decisions and to make room for a more compassionate inner narrative as you step into the next chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing clarity to what you want to commit to long-term. The second half of the week favors intentional planning, meaningful conversations about the future, and decisions that support growth beyond your comfort zone. You may feel drawn to travel plans, educational pursuits, or spiritual practices that offer both structure and inspiration. Rather than rushing, Capricorn energy encourages you to build your expansion thoughtfully. This is about choosing paths that feel both grounding and expansive — ones that honor your values while helping you grow beyond what’s familiar.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with emotional depth and psychological insight. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to intimacy, shared resources, trust, and energetic exchange. But before that grounding takes hold, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tensions between your friendships, future goals, and deeper emotional wounds around belonging. You may notice sensitivities around who truly supports you, who drains you, and where you’ve overextended yourself socially or emotionally. This square can surface discomfort, but it’s also clarifying. It asks you to get honest about reciprocity, and to release group dynamics or obligations that no longer feel aligned as you prepare for a more intentional chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and deepening your desire for emotional and financial integrity. The second half of the week favors serious conversations around shared money, long-term commitments, or emotional boundaries. You may feel less inclined toward surface-level connection and more focused on building trust that’s earned, not assumed. Capricorn energy here supports mature intimacy — the kind that feels stabilizing rather than consuming. This solstice week reminds you that when your inner world is supported, your outer brilliance flows more freely.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> places relationships at the center of your attention. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your partnership sector is activated, bringing focus to commitment, collaboration, and emotional balance with others. Just before that shift, Jupiter in your sign squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your personal growth and professional or public-facing wounds. You may feel torn between honoring your emotional needs and showing up confidently in the world. Old insecurities around visibility or leadership could resurface, but they do so in order to be healed. This square asks you to trust that caring for yourself doesn’t weaken your ambition… it strengthens it.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and adding seriousness to your relationships. The second half of the week encourages you to assess which connections feel mutual, stable, and aligned with your long-term goals. You may feel less interested in keeping the peace at all costs and more committed to partnerships that offer real support. This is a powerful moment to redefine what commitment means to you: choosing relationships that feel grounding, respectful, and capable of growing with you.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a call to recalibrate your energy and priorities. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to work, health, routines, and the systems that hold your daily life together. But before that grounding fully settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating emotional material tied to rest, burnout, faith, and old beliefs about always having to be “on.” You may feel the tension between wanting to push forward and realizing your body or spirit needs more care. This is a powerful moment to listen to subtle signals — fatigue, irritation, or restlessness are all messages asking you to work <em>with</em> yourself, not against yourself.</p>



<p>As the week progresses, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing harmony and intentionality to your daily life. The second half of the week is ideal for refining habits, improving work dynamics, and committing to routines that support your long-term vitality. This isn’t about restriction… it’s about self-respect. You may feel more motivated to clean up your schedule, set clearer boundaries at work, or invest in practices that make you feel stronger and more capable. This solstice week reminds you that sustainable success starts with taking care of the engine that powers it all: you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> activates themes of joy, creativity, and emotional honesty. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your sector of pleasure, romance, and self-expression comes into focus, inviting you to take what you love seriously. But just before that grounding energy settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, surfacing deeper feelings around vulnerability, trust, and shared emotional or financial investments. You may notice where you’ve been over-giving, overthinking, or holding back out of fear of losing control. This square can stir discomfort, but it also offers healing clarity, especially around intimacy and what you truly need to feel safe opening your heart.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing warmth, devotion, and maturity to matters of love and creativity. The second half of the week favors meaningful connection over casual interaction. Whether romantic or artistic, you’re drawn toward experiences that feel grounded, intentional, and worth investing in. This is a powerful time to commit to a passion project, deepen a relationship, or simply allow yourself to enjoy what you’ve worked so hard to build. The solstice reminds you that joy doesn’t have to be earned… it can be chosen.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “I said I was fine, but the body kept the receipts.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus turns inward to home, family, and emotional foundations. You’re craving comfort, stability, and maybe even a little nesting energy. But just before that grounding arrives, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, poking at the tension between your public image and your closest relationships. Translation: you might be killing it at work or showing up polished on the outside, while privately feeling misunderstood, under-supported, or low-key exhausted by certain dynamics. This could look like smiling through a family dinner you’d rather skip, or realizing you’ve been people-pleasing your way into burnout. The solstice asks you to be honest about where you actually need support instead of pretending you’ve got it all handled.</p>



<p>By midweek, the vibe shifts from emotional awareness to practical action. On December 24th, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and turning your attention to what stability really looks like. The second half of the week is perfect for setting boundaries at home, having the “okay but how are we <em>actually</em> doing?” conversation, or making decisions that support your long-term peace, even if they’re not immediately popular. This is Capricorn energy with receipts: choosing rest over obligation, quality over quantity, and emotional safety over aesthetics. The glow-up here is subtle but powerful. You’re learning that balance isn’t about keeping everyone happy… it’s about creating a life that doesn’t drain you.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is delivering truths with zero fluff and no emotional cushioning. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your mind shifts into strategist mode. Communication, scheduling, boundaries, and logistics suddenly matter a lot more. But before you can fully enjoy the clarity, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring tension between your big-picture beliefs and the daily grind that’s been quietly wearing you down. You may realize you’ve been philosophizing your way around a very real problem, like saying “it’ll work out” instead of actually fixing your schedule, your habits, or your burnout. The solstice doesn’t judge you for this. It just hands you the clipboard and asks you to be honest.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves divine timing, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and upgrading your communication style from “intuitive and intense” to “clear, intentional, and impossible to misinterpret.” The second half of the week favors direct conversations, firm decisions, and cutting through emotional static. You’re less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in results. Think fewer dramatic monologues, more bullet points. This is a powerful moment to say what you mean, mean what you say, and stop entertaining dynamics that require you to over-function. Capricorn energy doesn’t ask you to be nicer — it asks you to be effective.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “freedom, but make it fiscally responsible.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to money, self-worth, and what you actually have to show for all those big ideas. But before you can fully lean into the budgeting era, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional stuff around shared resources, trust, and independence. You may notice a low-grade irritation about having to rely on someone else, or realizing you’ve been way too chill about an arrangement that deserves more structure. The solstice doesn’t cancel your optimism; it just asks you to back it up with a plan.</p>



<p>By the second half of the week, the tone sharpens. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and making it clear that your time, energy, and talents are not a charity. You’re more selective about how you spend your money and who gets access to you. This could look like saying no to last-minute plans, renegotiating financial terms, or finally admitting that “exposure” is not a currency. Capricorn energy here isn’t about being boring, it’s about valuing yourself enough to build something sustainable. The real freedom comes from knowing you’re not winging it anymore.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the solstice marks your official reset, and you feel it immediately. As the sun enters your sign on December 21st, the focus shifts back to <em>you</em>: your body, your boundaries, your identity, your direction. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, bringing up emotional tension between your public role and your private foundation. You may feel pulled between responsibility and vulnerability, between being “the strong one” and needing support yourself. Old family patterns or inner-child wounds could surface, not to derail you, but to remind you that leadership doesn’t mean emotional self-denial. This solstice asks you to define success in a way that includes your well-being, not just your output.</p>



<p>As the week continues, your presence sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters your sign, joining the sun and Mars and adding magnetism, maturity, and seriousness to how you show up and what you attract. People notice you more now, but not because you’re performing. It’s because you’re embodied. The second half of the week is ideal for recommitting to yourself, refining your goals, and setting the tone for the year ahead. You may feel less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in alignment. The shadow here is over-identifying with productivity or carrying responsibility that isn’t yours. The power move? Choosing yourself without guilt. Capricorn Season doesn’t ask you to do more… it asks you to do what matters.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “main character energy, but with emotional accountability.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, you slip into a quieter, more behind-the-scenes mode. This activates your rest, reflection, and subconscious sector, which already feels ironic given how visible your thoughts usually are. But before you can fully retreat, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your daily responsibilities and how you communicate your needs. You might realize you’ve been intellectually explaining your feelings instead of actually <em>feeling</em> them. Or pushing through exhaustion because “it’s fine.” The solstice gently (but firmly) calls that bluff.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves a slow burn, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and reinforcing the message: rest is not optional, and boundaries are not rude. The second half of the week favors solitude with purpose: tying up loose ends, clearing emotional clutter, and quietly deciding what you’re no longer available for in 2026. This isn’t isolation; it’s preparation. Capricorn energy here asks you to stop leaking energy in places that don’t return it. You’re not disappearing…you’re conserving power. And honestly? That’s very on brand for the upgrade ahead.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is quietly calling you out, in a loving, no-nonsense way. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to friends, community, and long-term goals. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tension between joy, creativity, romance, and your relationship with money or self-worth. Translation: you might want to do what feels good, but there’s a voice reminding you that vibes alone don’t pay bills or sustain dreams. You could feel emotionally exposed around what you deserve versus what you’ve been settling for. The solstice doesn’t shame you for dreaming… it simply asks whether you’re willing to support those dreams with structure.</p>



<p>Then the tone firms up. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to your social life. The second half of the week is about discernment: who’s actually aligned with your future, and who’s just along for the ride? You may feel less available for emotional freeloading and more interested in connections that show up consistently. Capricorn energy here helps you mature your compassion, keeping your heart open without overextending yourself. You’re learning that boundaries don’t make you colder; they make your magic sustainable. And honestly? That’s the ultimate end-of-year glow up.</p>
