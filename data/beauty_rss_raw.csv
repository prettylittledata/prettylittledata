<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior director <br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Non-profit<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 37<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Vancouver, BC<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $170,000<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is approx. $250,000. My salary is steady and predictable, but my husband works in film/TV, which is very unpredictable. Work was very slow during the pandemic and SAG-AFTRA/WGA strikes in the US, but he’s worked a lot more over the past year and will bring in about $80,000 this year. This also includes some very part-time graphic design work that he does on the side, and employment insurance when he’s not working. We also receive $542.50 from the government each year of Canada Child Benefit ($45.20 a month). My husband and I combine our finances. We have a joint credit card, bank accounts, and savings, which I manage, plus individual credit cards (for gifts etc.) and separate investments.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> <br />Registered Retirement Savings Plan [RRSP]: $127,000 <br />Tax-Free Savings Account [TFSA]: $39,200 <br />Locked-In Retirement Account [LIRA]: $29,300<br />First Home Savings Account [FHSA]: $3,000<br />Husband’s RRSP: $74,491<br />Husband’s TFSA: $32,950<br />Joint Emergency Savings: $10,000<br />Joint Savings: $50,300<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $0<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $4,395<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $3,998 for a two-bed, one-bath apartment, parking space, and storage locker. <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> n/a<br /><strong>Electricity:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Internet:</strong> $78<br /><strong>Daycare:</strong> $1060 (the full price would be $1605, but the government provides a $545 subsidy).<br /><strong>Gym:</strong> $90<br /><strong>House Cleaner:</strong> $90<br /><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> $31.64<br /><strong>Phone:</strong> $218 ($68 for me, $150 for my husband)<br /><strong>Tenants Insurance:</strong> $26.39<br /><strong>Car Insurance:</strong> $157.92<br /><strong>Pet Insurance:</strong> $302<br /><strong>NYT:</strong> $2.10<br /><strong>Spotify Premium:</strong> $20.04<br /><strong>iCloud storage:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Crave:</strong> $24.64<br /><strong>Disney+:</strong> $15.99<br /><strong>Netflix:</strong> Included in internet<br /><strong>Apple TV:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Shudder:</strong> $8.99<br /><strong>Patreon:</strong> $14.97 (<em>The Birth Hour</em> podcast and Aja Barber)<br /><strong>BCAA:</strong> $20.56<br /><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> (for my husband’s work): $29.11<br /><strong>Dropbox</strong> (for my husband’s work): $31.35<br /><strong>Bank account fees:</strong> $16.95<br /><strong>Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP):</strong> $200<br /><strong>RRSP Contribution</strong> (comes from my paycheck and is matched by my employer): $708<br /><strong>Extended healthcare:</strong> $0 (paid for by my work)<br /><strong>Charitable Donations:</strong> $106 (Black Lives Matter, Binners Project, Canadian Mental Health Association, Indian Residential School Survivors Society)<br /><br /><strong>Annual expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Credit card fees:</strong> $135<br /><strong>Amazon Prime:</strong> $110.88<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes. I grew up in the UK, and neither of my parents went to university (although my dad later completed a degree part-time at night school), but I was expected to go to a good one. I didn’t get an offer from any of my top three schools because my predicted grades weren’t as high as I needed (even though my actual grades were top marks — the UK system is weird), but I still landed at a top-20 university. I paid for my tuition and living expenses with student loans and part-time jobs, but my parents paid for my rent until I graduated, aged 20 (it was a three-year program).<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I was brought up not to ask about or share specifics on salaries or spending, as it was deemed rude (very British). I knew neither of my parents grew up with much money, but my dad eventually worked in software engineering, and we were comfortably middle-class. My dad started a few companies, and my mom was always terrified about the lack of financial stability. They’re both quite cautious, and I remember being told that saving for retirement was key and not to place my pension in any remotely risky investments. They’re now retired and living in Canada close to me, and are very worried that I don’t own a home, and likely won’t any time soon.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I got a job working in the village shop on Saturday mornings aged 13. My parents encouraged me to learn the value of work and commitment, and I loved the extra spending money ($18 USD a week). I quit when I got a better paying job at age 16, and my younger brother took over at the shop.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Not in the day-to-day sense. Occasionally, I’d pick up some tension or uncertainty from my parents, and there were tighter times than others, but I had everything I needed for school, and we went on vacation every couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. I have a great salary and solid savings, but rent and daycare come to 60% of my income, and my husband’s work is very unstable. Any money we do save when he’s working subsidizes our living expenses when he’s not. Saying that, we could definitely cut down on our expenses (coffees, meals out) if we really had to. Buying a place to live in Vancouver feels out of the question, so I worry about our long-term plans, especially as we need more space for my son as he gets older. I’m on the wait list for a co-op and really hope we get in within the next couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />Aged 20 when I graduated from university, and my parents stopped paying my rent. They’re now retired and are on a budget, but they would definitely give me a loan if I needed it (as long as I paid them back).<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />My parents gave me $15,000 towards my wedding in 2017, and $25,000 in 2022 as part of my grandmother’s inheritance when she passed away. We used some of it to buy a car when our old one died, and most of it went to keeping us debt-free when I was on maternity leave and my husband had a 10-month stretch of not working.</p>



<h3>Day One: Wednesday</h3>



<p>7:20 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and lie in bed thinking about morning logistics. My son D., is now a three-nager, and recently started a new daycare which has longer opening hours and is close-ish to my office. My husband K., is working on a movie at the moment, so I’m usually on daycare duty on the bus, but he has a rare late start today, so I can take the car. I drag myself out of bed, do my morning routine of Origins Ginzing Moisturizer, and get D. out of the door — though not without some protests.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — I start my workday from home, with an instant coffee to help me navigate my inbox. I’ve moved house since my last Money Diary, into a two-bed apartment in a new rental building about a five-minute walk from the Co-Op I was subletting. This place is a third of the size of the last place and triple the rent which is painful, but the views are amazing, and the location is perfect. Luckily, K. has been working a lot this year, and I also started my current job three months ago. It was a really hard decision to leave my last role, which I loved, but it’s a step up to VP level with a small salary bump (though the healthcare benefits and PTO aren’t as good), and I knew I’d get out of my comfort zone and learn so much. I’m now responsible for operations and HR, so I have a couple of calls about a salesforce transformation project I’m leading, and work on some job descriptions. K. takes the dog for a walk, stopping off for a coffee and a pastry. <strong>$11.24</strong></p>



<p>9:01 a.m. — …and a bag of prescription food from the vet. It’s a new diet and our pet insurance will reimburse about $35 per bag for the first two months — but soon we’ll be covering the full amount. When K. gets back, he heads to work. I heat up and eat a frozen mini burrito for a late breakfast, then have a baked potato with tuna mayonnaise for lunch. <strong>$87.62</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I walk the dog around the block, then change into “business casual” (jeans and a nice top) and head into the office. I have a weekly 1:1 with my boss on Wednesday afternoon, and I always prefer to have it in person. Our talk today is particularly important, as it’s been a frustrating couple of days and I have some feedback to share about how we’re working together (or not). I make an iced coffee for the road, and take the bus as it’s too hot outside to walk without turning into a sweaty mess. <strong>$2.70</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — The conversation goes well! I suggested we get out of the office for a walking meeting, which was definitely the right call, but I’ve racked up 7,000 steps in flats that squeeze my toes, and am a sweaty mess after all. No Evo’s (local car share company) today, so I take an Uber to daycare and arrive right before they close at 5:30 p.m. It takes a while to get him all packed up, and we miss the bus by a minute! I melt at the bus stop for 15 minutes while we wait for the next one, which we jump off early to pick up a photo book of D.’s photos from his mini kid camera (paid for when I ordered it last week). He loves it, and we look through it together on the final bus home. <strong>$14.10</strong></p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back home and I am exhausted. D. and I look through the photo book together, then FaceTime my parents who are living their best retirement life and sailing around the Gulf Islands this week. I make D. a peanut butter sandwich and some strawberries, while I finish off a leftover portion of tortellini with cheese sauce. D. is mad at me because there isn’t more pasta, and goes to play alone in his room (that’s the three-nager part). I use the time to tidy the kitchen.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — K. gets home. We try to tidy D.’s room since the cleaner comes tomorrow and we can barely see the floor for Hot Wheels, but D. throws his pajamas out of our 14th floor window and things devolve. Luckily for me, K. is on bedtime tonight, so I take a much-needed shower, clean the kitchen, and pack tomorrow’s lunches for D. and myself (K. is very well-fed on set). When I’m done, I book tickets to the outdoor pool for Saturday as it looks like good weather. It’s Labor Day weekend and we were going to go to Whistler, but my parents aren’t around to dog sit and I decided taking a three-year-old and a dog wouldn’t be so relaxing, so I cancelled our hotel last night. <strong>$17.92</strong></p>



<p>10:20 p.m. — K. emerges from D.’s room. We quickly talk through the next day’s schedule, then I do my nighttime routine (Sunday Riley Good Genes serum and Olay moisturizer) and get into bed. I am absolutely hooked on <em>The Americans</em> right now, so I watch part of an episode, then switch to a podcast and fall asleep around 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $133.58</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I wake up from a very deep sleep with D. next to me. He wakes up in the middle of the night and comes into bed with us most nights, which I don’t mind as long as he stays still. I get up, get dressed, give the dog his morning pill (he just turned 12 and he’s on five pills a day for various ailments), and get D. an Eggo waffle and a banana for breakfast. D. is upset I gave the dog his pill first and throws his food on the floor.</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — K. is taking D. to preschool today, which is great as Thursday is one of my two office days. I enjoy the office and go every day when K. isn’t working, but need to be home for the dog more when he is. I planned to be on the bus by 8:20, but the food-throwing and some potty assistance delay me. I end up taking an Uber to the office. <strong>$9.52</strong></p>



<p>10 a.m. — K. does the daycare drop-off then picks up a dark roast with mocha syrup from Starbucks across the street. I do an in-person interview at the office, which I really enjoy, but the candidate isn’t a fit. <strong>$1.97</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — The dog walker and cleaner (in monthly expenses) both arrive at lunchtime, and I buzz them in from my cellphone. <strong>$20</strong></p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — The afternoon flies by in a blur of meetings, including some interview debriefs and a “Party Planning Committee” meeting to plan our Summer BBQ next week. I take a short walk to get some fresh air, and find myself at a coffee shop buying a vanilla latte and a chocolate walnut cookie. The cookie is delicious, but I regret spending the money almost immediately. <strong>$13.47</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — Leave work later than planned as I had to wait for our weekly payables to be ready for approval, so I grab an Uber to daycare. <strong>$10.15</strong></p>



<p>5:30 — I pick up D. and take him to the grocery store to pick up watermelon and pineapple for a daycare potluck picnic tomorrow, plus some fruit freezies that D. spies. The bus is still 15 minutes away and D. is hungry, so I get him a banana bread at the coffee shop next door before it arrives for the bus). <strong>$32.92</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I throw some laundry on as soon as I walk in the door, and see that B. has found my mini Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk lipstick (a gift from a friend) and drawn all over his face. Dinner is a mix of baked potato, baked beans, cheese, broccoli, and some pineapple and watermelon that I’ve chopped for the potluck. K. gets home around 8:45 p.m., and I start D.’s bedtime. The routine involves some playing, some books, and lying uncomfortably on the floor next to his crib while he falls asleep. We’re hoping his new daycare will cut his naps as he’s getting older, so he’ll go to sleep earlier.</p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is finally asleep, so I shower and head straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $88.03</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Friday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — I had set my alarm to help K. with the morning routine, but he tells me his call time was pushed back overnight, so I don’t need to be up just yet. I’m exhausted but can’t fall back asleep, so I shower, take the dog on a longer walk than usual, and catch up on my voice notes. I stop at my favourite coffee shop for a large caramel latte. K. also picks up a coffee and a pastry after daycare drop-off. <strong>$18.80</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — My calendar is usually empty on a Friday, so I hold the time to catch up on work. However, today everyone wants a “quick chat” and I’m on back-to-back calls all morning. One of them is to finalize a colleague’s promotion, which we celebrate by text. I make a quick sandwich for lunch, pack for the daycare potluck, and take an Uber to the office with my homemade iced coffee in hand. <strong>$9.99</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I get to the office and join a technology demo in our boardroom. I’m multi-tasking and end up not listening, I know my team will share the main updates with me next week.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get a taxi to daycare with another parent friend who works two blocks from me (she covers the fare). The potluck is chaotic but really nice. I know a few of the parents there just coincidentally (there aren’t many daycare spots in Vancouver), so it’s nice to catch up and see how the new kids are settling in. The watermelon and pineapple are a hit, but I end up losing my Tupperware in the chaos. K. misses most of the fun, but comes to pick us up when he’s finished work.</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — I supervise D.’s bath time, then hand over to K. for bedtime and walk the dog to the liquor store to buy some weekend beverages for K. and I (three beers, three coolers, one cider). Bedtime takes a while, but I wait up for K. I’m exhausted and know I should go to bed, but he puts on the new Amanda Knox TV show and I end up watching the first episode even though neither of us loves it (though I find her story fascinating). I watch another episode of <em>The Americans</em> and fall asleep after midnight. <strong>$40.48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $69.27</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Saturday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — It’s the weekend! D. slept all night in his own bed and is up early. We all sleep better this way, but the trade-off is that mornings start sooner. We snuggle and chat in bed for half an hour, then I get up, make his breakfast (Eggo waffle and strawberries), and tidy up. It’s an independent play kind of morning, so I watch <em>The Americans</em> while he plays with monster trucks. I suddenly realize I’m starving, so I heat a frozen burrito for breakfast, then head to the gym. I recently joined a women-only gym at the end of my block and while I wish I had the energy to go during the week, I really try on weekends. I do 20-minutes on the treadmill and a full-body weight machine circuit.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I shower and we head to our favorite coffee shop with the dog in tow. I get a large caramel latte and a pastry, K. gets a flat white, and D. has a mini pastry called a kouign-amann. We sit outside and eat, drink, and play with Hot Wheels, and D. gets a second pastry. <strong>$33.13</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — On the way home, we stop in at a florist and K. buys a small pearl vine for our plant wall, and I get a free pink rose for following the florist on Instagram. When we get home we go up to the rooftop patio, where we hang out watering the plants in our garden bed and playing with more Hot Wheels. <strong>$4.47</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I convince K. we should go to the Pacific National Exhibition (very busy outdoor fair) for its final day on Monday, and I buy tickets on my phone with a 30% discount as a BCAA member. <strong>$67.80</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — I’m so tired and just want to nap, but have a pedicure booked as my toenails are a state and I’m not done wearing sandals yet. I watch <em>The Americans</em> on my phone during the appointment. <strong>$62.33</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — The weather isn’t as hot as hoped, but we go to the outdoor pool anyway, as we have tickets. We have fun splashing around and playing in the shallow end and manage to get dried and dressed without any drama.</p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — We leave the pool and stop off at our local brewery for dinner. K. gets a pint of raspberry sour, I get a 12oz of the same and we attempt a family game of snakes and ladders. The brewery recently partnered with a burger vendor who we love, so I order three cheeseburgers and fries. We share a table with a nice and patient couple who put up with the preschooler screams and give K. a beer that the bartender made them by accident. The portions of fries are absolutely huge and we end up taking a whole box home, along with most of D.’s burger. <strong>$85.80</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — Bedtime is chaotic, but D. is tired. He falls asleep soon after 10 p.m. and I go straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $253.53</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Sunday</h3>



<p>9:15 a.m. — I wake up and am shocked when I see how late it is! D. woke me up coming into our bed in the night and it took me a while to get back to sleep, but the sleep in is worth it. I get up and head to the gym, where I do a short incline walk on the treadmill and a Juice &amp; Toya arms and abs workout on YouTube.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Home, shower, and out for a walk for coffee and pastries from our usual place. Same order as yesterday — a caramel latte, flat white, pastry, and kouign-amann. K. and D. walk to the grocery store across the street to get started on the weekly shop, while I walk the dog home and drive back down and meet them with the shopping bags. We get all of our usual lunch staples, including bread, bagels, croissants, salad kits, cucumber, berries, shredded cheese, yogurt, broccoli, filled pasta, canned tuna, and kids snacks, plus some Drano. <strong>$222.27</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — We have a chill couple of hours at home doing scrap paper crafts and watering the rooftop garden plot. We’re meeting friends at the beach this afternoon, so I pack up our beach bag and throw in some turkey croissants to share, and a piña colada cider I got from Friday’s liquor store run.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — We pick up a friend who lives a few blocks away from us, and make it two minutes before I get a Facebook message from someone on her way to pick some of D.’s old clothes that I’m selling on Marketplace, and have forgotten to leave out — shoot! We go back home and I leave them in my lobby to buzz her in when she arrives. She only takes 1/3 of the clothes but transfers me the full $25. Great! We arrive at the beach and I pay for parking. We meet our other friend, and have the best afternoon together. The four of us met the day we all arrived in Vancouver from the UK almost 15 years ago, and while we don’t get to hang out together as often as we like, we have the best time when we do. We play about on my SUP, take turns chasing D. around, and the non-drivers drink beers. <strong>$14.49</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — We’re having so much fun and don’t want the day to end, so we all jump in the car and return to the same brewery from last night for more burgers. The burger place said they were open until 9 p.m. on Instagram, but when we arrive they’ve closed an hour early. I shoot them a note letting them know and a crying emoji. We decide we still want burgers, so order takeout on Uber Eats instead and eat on a picnic bench outside. I get two Angus burgers on a BOGOF deal and fries to share, plus a cheeseburger combo meal for D. They’re still pretty good! K. drinks two pints and I stick with water. <strong>$80.23</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — It’s late and dark, so we pile in the car and I drive our friends home. D. hasn’t napped today, so we play <em>The Lion King</em> in the car to keep him awake. Once we get home, I realize we left the diaper bag at the brewery and make the three-min drive back to get it. K. handles bedtime while I walk the dog and do the briefest of nighttime routines (Sunday Riley Luna Oil and Olay moisturizer). I’m in bed by 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $316.99</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Monday</h3>



<p>9 a.m. — Wake up squished against D., and scroll for half an hour in peace. The burger place from last night sent me a DM apologizing for the error on hours and offering me a free meal next time I’m there, so nice! D. wakes up and we look through baby photos of him on my phone together until it’s time to get up. There’s sand everywhere from yesterday’s beach adventure and I offer to help K. clean, but he says I won’t do a good enough job and he’d rather do it himself (he’s right). He really struggles when things are out of place, which makes parenting pretty tough. I get out of his way and take the dog for a walk to the coffee shop, where I get our usual order to go, plus a pistachio-pineapple pastry for K. <strong>$30.18</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — We’re finally ready to leave for the fair. A new work friend lives right across the street from the grounds and offered for us to park at her place, so we drive straight there. D. has an accident in the car, so we change his underwear in her driveway when we arrive. He spots the big trampoline in her yard, so we spend ten minutes catching up while he bounces before bribing him with a new Hot Wheels car to leave.</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — We have a fun afternoon at the fair! D. tries out hockey, basketball, and soccer at the kids’ sport zone, we watch the super dogs and the high divers shows, and D. goes on a few kids’ rides. We manage to limit him to one “prize-guaranteed” fairground game and he chooses a tiny bottle of bubbles as his prize. <strong>$10</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — It’s a hot day, so I get a Coke Zero and soft serve ice cream for D. and I. K. skips the ice cream and gets a tuna poke bowl. We stay for a few hours, then manage to make a tantrum-free exit. <strong>$44.87</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — We’re home. K. and D. go up to the roof to water the plants while I call TELUS. My internet/TV plan expired a couple of months ago and our bill jumped from $98 a month to $200! I speak to a rep and end up negotiating the same package but with better internet for $78/month, plus a $100 credit to cover the increase in the last two months. D. watches YouTube videos of families playing with monster trucks and starts crying because he doesn’t have a backyard. Sigh. I think he’s incredibly lucky to be growing up in this city and apartment life won’t kill him, while K. really hates that he likely won’t experience living in a house. We redirect him with cartoons and order Indian takeout. <strong>$95.60</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — My turn to do bedtime. After some negotiation, D. is asleep by 10. I realize I needed to wash my hair tonight but I’m too tired, so I’ll have to get up early and do it in the morning instead. I head to bed and watch <em>The Americans</em> until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $180.65</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Tuesday</h3>



<p>7 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm. D. is in our bed again, although I don’t remember him getting in. K. has a rare day off today, so I have a nice long shower, wash and dry my hair, and walk to work with an instant coffee. K. takes D. to pre-school and gets a coffee from Starbucks afterwards. <strong>$4.44</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Tuesday is our mandatory “in office” day and it’s a busy one. I work on my quarterly work plan, answer some emails about insurance, and attend our weekly Executive Team meeting. I eat last night’s Indian leftovers at my desk for lunch, which I realize have been in my backpack instead of the refrigerator all morning. It tastes even better the day after. </p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I have a confidential call with my HR Manager and there are no meeting rooms available, so I head to a coffee shop across the street where no one from work can overhear us. I order a hedgehog mocha and a chocolate walnut cookie. Another colleague wants to meet before the end of the day to discuss some meeting structures, so I make it a “walk-and-talk” around the park so I can make a speedy exit. <strong>$13.49</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I’m making the most of K. being on daycare pick-up duty and meet friends for happy hour! We try a new spot that’s only a 10-minute walk from my office. It’s bar service, and I know that once we sit down and start chatting, I won’t want to get up again, so I order two happy our tequila and Sprites up front. After catching up, we Uber to a liquor store (my friend pays). I don’t buy anything as I brought my last two coolers from home, then we walk to meet two more friends at the beach. <strong>$12.56</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I have the best evening! We order delicious pizza ($30 each), drink delicious drinks, and don’t stop talking for hours. We’re all British, and all parents of under-fives who met on the Peanut app a few years ago while we were on maternity leave. We talk about the highs and lows of parenting, vent about our partners, and discuss the best spicy romantasy books. It’s a beautiful sunset and I wade into the ocean just to get my feet wet. <strong>$30.00</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — I share an Uber home with the friend who paid earlier, so I get this one. <strong>$8.00</strong></p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is already in bed when I get home; he and K. went to a brewery after daycare and got a pint and an apple juice plus parking. I take the dog out and get ready for bed. D. wakes up and hears me and asks to sleep in my bed. I’ve missed him after all the parenting talk tonight, so after some half-hearted efforts to re-settle him, I say yes, and we fall asleep together around 11. <strong>$18.69</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $87.18</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p><br />This was a pretty average week, and even though it was a long weekend, which meant some extra spending, we spent a lot less than we would have if we’d gone to Whistler for the weekend, so that was a good choice. I’ve known for a while that I could save a lot more money if we cut down on coffees and happy hours/takeout, and recording my expenses did make me very aware of that — and skip a couple of cookies! However, I don’t really have any sort of goal to motivate my savings right now, so it’s easier to just choose enjoying life in the moment. I’m sure that will change in the future, and I know there are areas I can cut back on if I need to.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11888777.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Time stands still for no one, or so the planet Saturn teaches us. Saturn is leading us into Aries on February 13th. As we move onward in life, the austere and reverent cosmic force urges us to be responsible and ambitious as we grow. Along the way, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/may-2025-monthly-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn will present obstacles</a> and it’s up to us to find the best path forward. </p>



<p>Saturn is a dominant planet that likes to take charge and Aries is the zodiac sign that is self-reliant. When the two collide, we may focus on how we can solely advance ourselves rather than on helping others. Saturn is exalted in Libra, which is the opposite sign of Aries, and commits to being a team player. This means that when Saturn is in Aries, the planet is in detriment and urges us to be selfish. As a result, struggles can occur along the way. Saturn in Aries can be a complex combination because the fire sign is impulsive, and the planet itself is known to be strategic. When these two come together, it can make us question how to take action.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries can be a tad immature. Rather than learning and moving on with the knowledge and insight the universe gives us, we may still chase the same challenges and opportunities (until we decide to move on). Even though we know instinctively that the “white whale” is unobtainable, it’ll still be lingering in our minds until we reach that goal. This could hinder us from growing and evolving into the next stage of life. Aries is a zodiac sign that won’t and can’t stop until it wins; Saturn gives it the extra determination to do so. We can still achieve greatness, it’ll just require extra effort. As long as we’re up for the task, then we should be able to thrive.</p>



<p>Saturn’s stint in Aries is unique because Neptune is transiting the same sign and moving closely with Saturn. The two planets will form a conjunction on February 20th, 2026. This magical time encourages us to reach for the stars and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifest our dreams</a>. Saturn cements Neptune’s aspirations, making it a decisive moment in time. These two planets haven’t aligned in Aries in centuries. </p>



<p>Although the centaur Chiron will be far away by a degree, we’ll still feel the lingering energy in the same sign as Saturn. Chiron helps us heal, and Saturn helps us acknowledge the lesson. We can transcend internally by mending our trauma at this time. The growing pains might be challenging; however, we’ll face our shadow selves and embrace our fears, squashing them as we move toward enlightenment.</p>



<p>Those born on the dates below will be experiencing their Saturn returns, making it a transformative time. For those not in the know, the Saturn return is when the planet returns to the sign and degree it was when you were born, every 27 to 30 years. The first one teaches us how to adult, the second journey urges us to embrace our success, and the third Saturn return is a moment of reflection. Reference the dates below to see if you qualify: </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958724.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew I had to do something about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10865365/masseter-reduction-botox-cost-effects"">jaw pain</a>. It was my birthday, and a friend cracked a joke so good that half the drinks on the table toppled as everyone doubled over laughing. I, meanwhile, could barely move my mouth; smiling, talking, even laughing felt like lifting weights with my face.  </p>



<p>That’s why I owe a lot to a beauty editor friend of mine, who told me she’d been in the same boat — and that masseter Botox, injected into the masseter muscle along the lower jaw, had completely changed her life.  </p>



<p>Within hours of talking to her, I’d booked an appointment with the injector she swore by, and a week later, I could eat, speak, and laugh again without my jaw snapping shut. The pain and tension — probably from stress-induced teeth clenching — had vanished, and I finally felt human again. But as I enjoyed my newfound freedom, I noticed a subtle change in my face. It had a slightly more oval shape, and I’m convinced the skin along my jaw felt a little looser than before. My experience isn’t unique — but it does raise some important questions. </p>



<h2>What is masseter Botox, and what are the benefits and downsides? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">While Botox</a> — a purified neurotoxin — is widely used for smoothing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-gf-solution-serum-review"">fine lines and wrinkles</a> by relaxing the muscles underneath the skin, more experts are recommending it as a solution for jaw pain, clenching, teeth grinding, tension, and clicking. Conversation around it is booming. On TikTok, the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/masseterbotox?lang=en"">hashtag #masseterbotox</a> has amassed 158 million views and counting, with both experts and patients sharing their experiences. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As searches for masseter Botox increase, many people are also googling whether it can cause jowls.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""https://nycfacedoc.com/"">Dr. Moustafa Mourad, MD, FACS</a>, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and masseter Botox expert, who did not perform my treatment, describes it first and foremost as a treatment with real functional benefits: “An aesthetic effect is a secondary bonus,” says Dr. Mourad. “Masseter Botox can be incredibly helpful for patients who clench or grind their teeth, deal with chronic jaw tension, or feel jaw pain and fatigue by the end of the day,” he adds. “By relaxing an overactive masseter, we’re reducing the force transmitted through the jaw and teeth, which often translates into less pain, less tightness, and fewer tension headaches.” </p>



<p>But it would be remiss not to acknowledge the aesthetics of it all. Dr. Mourad confirms that masseter Botox can reduce muscle volume. “When it’s done thoughtfully, this can create a more tapered lower face, which is why it’s popular in patients with true masseter hypertrophy,” he says — essentially an enlarged jaw muscle that affects the natural shape of your face. In my case, I had been grinding my teeth for so long that my masseter had become large and strong, giving my jawline a sharper, more rigid appearance.  </p>



<h2>Can masseter Botox give you jowls?  </h2>



<p>A more oval face isn’t the only change I noticed. I’m almost certain that masseter Botox contributed to a very slight shift in skin texture, making it look and feel a little looser — something I picked up on myself, rather than anything anyone else noticed. To the naked eye, the change was very minimal, but I’m not alone in this observation. As searches for masseter Botox increase, more people are also googling whether it can cause “jowls” or sagging skin along the jawline.</p>



<p>Dr. Mourad tells me that “jowling” after masseter Botox is not caused by Botox damaging the skin: “Rather, it is related to changes in facial support over time,” he explains. Loose skin isn’t something Dr. Mourad typically sees after one, two, or even three treatments. “It is more commonly seen in patients who have been receiving masseter Botox chronically over many years,” he tells me, adding that it’s only with sustained relaxation that true muscle shrinkage can potentially change the shape of the lower face. “[In this case], instead of a more defined, angular jaw contour, the lower face may appear softer and rounder,” he says. </p>



<p>In fact, Dr. Mourad notes that he usually only sees looser skin after masseter Botox in patients who already have existing skin laxity or are experiencing age-related collagen loss — a completely normal part of aging. In other words, the Botox itself is rarely, if ever, the cause.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958793.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of jowls can be minimized with careful planning and restraint.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>If jowls develop after masseter Botox, can they be reversed? </h2>



<p>Unlike filler, which you can dissolve if you don’t like it, Botox can’t be undone. It does wear off eventually, and the muscle goes back to normal, but that can take up to six months. Dr. Mourad says that as the muscle returns, some support can come back, too, which has been the case in my experience. With chronic atrophy, though, it could leave the lower face looking rounder and loose skin more noticeable.  </p>



<p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of loose skin can be minimized with careful planning and restraint. “I am very deliberate about dosing and treatment frequency,” he says, stressing the importance of not over-weakening the muscle, spacing treatments properly, and reassessing the face over time. </p>



<p>He also evaluates each patient’s facial structure and the quality of their skin on their lower face before recommending long-term masseter Botox treatment. “In some patients, especially those who are aging or already showing early jowling, I will limit the use of masseter Botox or recommend alternative approaches to managing jaw pain that do not contribute to progressive muscle atrophy,” he adds. </p>



<p>If you’re committed to masseter Botox but have noticed some skin sagging and want to address it, Dr. Mourad suggests considering other treatments, like jawline filler or skin-tightening options <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">such as lasers</a>. </p>



<h2>Besides jowls, are there other long-term side effects of masseter Botox?  </h2>



<p>Dr. Mourad says that most other side effects of masseter Botox are mild and temporary, but it must be performed by a qualified injector. “Patients may experience localized soreness, swelling, or bruising, and some notice temporary difficulty chewing very hard foods as the muscle weakens,” he explains. Less common, but still possible — especially in underqualified hands — is the toxin spreading into nearby muscles, which can lead to temporary asymmetry, like a slightly altered smile, he adds. </p>



<p>While Dr. Mourad is a big fan of masseter Botox treatment — especially for relieving pain and tension — he emphasizes the importance of using it thoughtfully. “It should be revisited regularly, and not approached as an indefinite routine maintenance treatment,” he concludes. </p>



<p>I’ll definitely try masseter Botox again. We’re living in a stressful world, and for me, teeth grinding has become part of the deal. Next time, though, I’ll ask for a lighter touch — and work harder at managing my stress. Any subtle changes to my face shape are a trade-off I’ll take over the pain of constant clenching; like most treatments, it’s about weighing up the pros and cons. And yes, I’d still recommend it. It can be truly life-changing.</p>

I knew instantly that I had to have it, and it’s all down to the “solar” notes — scents that create a warm, fuzzy feeling, as though you’re basking in sunlight. The first spritz is fizzy, with a squeeze of citrusy bergamot and yuzu, before drying down into a creamy, nuzzly, skin-like scent thanks to jasmine, comforting vanilla, nutty tonka bean, and neroli — the fragrant oil extracted from the flowers of the bitter orange tree. Like all of Parfums de Marly’s predecessors, the staying power is unrivalled; I can still smell it on my jacket days after spritzing. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Parfums de Marly</strong> Athénaïs Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fathnas-eau-de-parfum%2F8799945"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1931"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958623.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1931&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1400:1931"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fskylar.com%2Fproducts%2Fscent-club-february-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Skylar Forbidden Fruit, $33</a> <br /></h2><br />Skylar’s latest addition is limited, so if it sounds up your alley, you’ll want to add it to your cart, stat. The brand describes this as “unapologetically sweet,” and it’s all in the gourmand notes. There’s sticky lychee, cane sugar, liquid vanilla, and sakura mochi for those with an insatiable sweet tooth, but it’s balanced by crunchy raspberry leaves, resin-like woods, and warm amber. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Skylar</strong> Forbidden Fruit, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fskylar.com%2Fproducts%2Fscent-club-february-2026"">Skylar</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1268"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958627.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=952&amp;height=1268&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=238:317"" width=""952"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fviolette-30-eau-de-parfum%2F8802119%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Le Labo Violette 30 Eau de Parfum, $110</a> <br /></h2><br />As a history buff, I find the story behind Le Labo’s Violette 30 fascinating. It’s inspired by floriography, the Victorian-era art of using flowers to send secret messages. The violet is particularly layered, signaling both passion and strength. It makes sense, then, that Violette 30 packs a punch. Powdery violet, lush rose, all-encompassing incense, and heady patchouli make it a scent that demands attention, while delicate white tea and creamy cedarwood linger softly on the skin as the day goes on. <br /><br /><strong>Le Labo</strong> Violette 30 Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fviolette-30-eau-de-parfum%2F8802119%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1104"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1328&amp;height=1104&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=83:69"" width=""1328"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsublime-eau-de-toilette%2F8754105"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tory Burch Sublime Eau de Toilette, $138 <br /></a></h2><br />If you think you don’t like floral fragrances, this will make you think twice. It’s light and airy rather than cloying or powdery, thanks to zingy clementine, juicy peach, grassy vetiver, and warm amber woods — like diving headfirst into freshly washed laundry. And the bottle? Absolutely something to marvel at. <br /><br /><strong>Tory Burch</strong> Sublime Eau de Toilette, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsublime-eau-de-toilette%2F8754105"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1900"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958635.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1900&amp;height=1900&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1900"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatilda-eau-de-parfum-P520167"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">By Rosie Jane Matilda Eau de Parfum, $86 <br /></a></h2><br />By Rosie Jane is a longtime Refinery29 favorite, and Matilda proves exactly why. The first spray sparks as much joy as the first sip of a passionfruit martini, but while the opening is tart and zingy, the dry down is where it truly shines. Sweet meringue is lifted by finger lime, yet both are anchored by golden musk — a honeyed, skin-like warmth that makes the perfume feel cozy, enveloping, and soothing. Obsessed. <br /><br /><strong>By Rosie Jane</strong> MATILDA Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatilda-eau-de-parfum-P520167"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1777"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958638.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1500&amp;height=1777&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1500:1777"" width=""1500"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gourmandbeauty.com%2Fcollections%2Feau-de-parfum%2Fproducts%2Fviolet-sucre-eau-de-parfum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Le Monde Gourmand Violet Sucre Eau de Parfum, $28 <br /></a></h2><br />I know what you’re thinking: another dessert-inspired fragrance? But hear me out. While the candied violets and actual sugar crystals are as sweet as you’d expect, the addition of raspberry purée takes it from saccharine to tangy and bright. It’s like shampoo in the best way, so if you’re after a “clean” fragrance that isn’t soapy, you’ll love this. <br /><br /><strong>Le Monde Gourmand</strong> Violet Sucré Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gourmandbeauty.com%2Fcollections%2Feau-de-parfum%2Fproducts%2Fviolet-sucre-eau-de-parfum"">Le Monde Gourmand</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2000"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958641.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1500&amp;height=2000&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=3:4"" width=""1500"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fatelier-des-fleurs-plage-du-figuier-eau-de-parfum%2F8794037%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chloé Atelier des Fleurs Plage du Figuier Eau de Parfum, $166 <br /></a></h2><br />The fig perfume trend shows no sign of slowing, and why would you want it to when it smells this good? Instead of the syrupy inside, it’s like snapping a fig leaf off a branch — green and milky — while sun-baked orange blossom flowers lend a sweetness that’ll have you sniffing your wrists all day long. If you’ve ever walked the streets of a Mediterranean island at sunset, with the warmth of the day still lingering on your shoulders, you’ll recognise the feeling instantly. <br /><br /><strong>Chloé</strong> Plage du Figuier Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fatelier-des-fleurs-plage-du-figuier-eau-de-parfum%2F8794037%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958770.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fberry-cream-hair-body-mist-P520646"">Phlur Berry Cream Hair and Body Mist, $26 <br /></a></h2><br />Berries are big in fragrance right now, with YSL, Mugler, and Glossier all picking them for their latest offerings. But no one nails a fruit-forward scent quite like Phlur. Berry Cream combines raspberries and strawberries with fresh, slightly woody apple leaves, warming vanilla bean, and nutty ambrette for a fragrance that occupies a cozy space between sweet and spicy. Think crème brûlée topped with compote. <br /><br /><strong>Phlur</strong> Berry Cream Hair and Body Mist, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520646"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958767.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatcha-milk-hair-body-mist-P520665"">Phlur Matcha Hair and Body Mist, $26 <br /></a></h2><br />Trust me when I say that even matcha naysayers will find this addictive. It’s not earthy like the drink; instead, it’s smooth and ever so slightly sweet thanks to vanilla and amber, while salty macadamia milk, steeped black tea, and woody patchouli give it a spicier edge. Spritz it through your hair for impressive sillage. <br /><br /><strong>Phlur</strong> Matcha Milk Hair and Body Mist, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmatcha-milk-hair-body-mist-P520665"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""640"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958645.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=640&amp;height=640&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""640"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fmediterranean-honeysuckle-soleil-eau-de-parfum-spray%2F8742046"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aerin Mediterranean Honeysuckle Soleil Eau de Parfum, $150 <br /></a></h2><br />Consider this your sign to start dreaming of a Mediterranean summer.

From open windows, you catch the scent of people showering for dinner — a mix of shampoo and aftersun.

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">Bad Bunny</a> leaped off the Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, California, ending his 13-minute <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10868981/super-bowl-2022-halftime-show-racism"">Super Bowl halftime show</a> chanting the lyrics of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9T_MGfzq7I&amp;list=RDv9T_MGfzq7I&amp;start_radio=1"">DtMF</a>,” the stadium erupted in fireworks. More than 2,800 miles away in Orlando, Florida, I saw the sky outside my window light up, too, flashing in brief bursts of color. In a city with one of the largest Puerto Rican populations in the contiguous U.S., some shop-owners shut their doors early so they could catch the show together with their families, others kept the lights on well into the night to host sold-out Benito Bowl watch parties, and others took to neighborhood roads, dancing with friends under street lights or illuminating entire neighborhoods with light shows. From the rolling hills of northwest California to the low wetlands of the Southeast U.S., we, distant neighbors, celebrated like patriots commemorating our beginning — because, for the millions of us who trace our histories across the American continent, we were.</p>



<p>For the estimated <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/life/2026/02/09/how-many-people-watch-the-halftime-show-2026-bad-bunny/88589346007/"">135.4 to 142 million viewers</a> who tuned in globally — figures that would make Bad Bunny’s halftime show the most-watched in history — it was an invitation to reclaim what it means to be an American, an identity and inheritance that for too long has been hegemonized by the U.S., even though it belongs to an entire continent.</p>



<p>After an energetic performance of a medley of hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr8K88UcO0s&amp;list=RDCr8K88UcO0s&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IFRpdMOtIE1lIFByZWd1bnRvoAcB"">Tití Me Pregunto</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtSRKwDCaZM&amp;list=RDGtSRKwDCaZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUYYmFkIGJ1bm55IFlvIFBlcnJlbyBTb2xhoAcB"">Yo Perreo Sola</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQ_6XbATPc&amp;list=RDjCQ_6XbATPc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygURYmFkIGJ1bm55IFNhZmFlcmGgBwE%3D"">Safaera</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9XrXnfJPsk&amp;list=RDG9XrXnfJPsk&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUPYmFkIGJ1bm55IFBhcnR5oAcB"">Party</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;list=RDX2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUeYmFkIGJ1bm55IFZveSBhIExsZXZhcnRlIFBhIFBSoAcB"">Voy a Llevarte Pa PR</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myDIeOjqQos&amp;list=RDmyDIeOjqQos&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUNYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVvT6AHAQ%3D%3D"">EoO</a>,” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;list=RD_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUQYmFkIGJ1bm55IE1vbmFjb6AHAQ%3D%3D"">Monaco</a>,” to name a few, Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, ended his performance invoking “God Bless America.” It was the first English words he uttered during a halftime show that was historic, in part, because it was the first in the NFL’s 60-year run to ever be performed predominantly in Spanish. With the flags of Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., among others, waving behind him, the Puerto Rican rapper then went on to name countries across the Caribbean and South, Central, and North Americas. When he ended with “my motherland, mi patria, Puerto Rico,” he cemented his performance, like a victorious touchdown, with a football stamped with the words, “Together, We Are America.” It was a message for all of us, those who have always traced their roots to the region, those who arrived centuries ago, violently and forcefully, on ships, and those who, generation after generation, have migrated to this corner of the world carrying a dream.</p>

<p>The words, the flags, and the faces of racially and ethnically diverse people encircling the Grammy award-winning artist sent a message to President Donald Trump and the ultra-conservative, who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">boycotted Bad Bunny’s halftime show</a> because of the rapper’s cultural identity and pro-immigrant politics: America is a continent, and his rendering of “God bless America” is a prayer for the people of every nation that stretches across it, not just the white U.S. citizens who have long positioned themselves as the primary beneficiaries of the label and land.</p>



<p>Transitioning to his native tongue to complete the blessing, like any other Latine church kid who speaks in English but prays in Spanish, Martínez Ocasio intoned an even more important invocation for migrants and their descendants: “seguimos aquí” — “we are still here” — a popular Puerto Rican refrain that marks our survival, presence, and refusal amid generations of political and natural disasters. </p>



<p>Some who boycotted the performance tuned into an alternative halftime entertainment event, the “All-American Halftime Show,” organized by the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. It aired live online at the same time as the NFL’s official halftime show, explicitly positioned as a protest of Bad Bunny’s performance. Roughly five million viewers (a fraction of the audience that watched Benito Bowl) tuned in to watch little-known country and rock artists like Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. To them, Martínez Ocasio’s identity as a Puerto Rican artist, his use of his native Spanish, and his belief that “the only thing more powerful than hate is love” were framed as a threat to white American notions of “faith, family, and freedom.” </p>



<p>Ironically, it is the people of Puerto Rico, a U.S. colonial territory, who have been calling for freedom since the U.S. seized the archipelago in 1898. Their cries reverberated throughout Bad Bunny’s performance. </p>



<p>Bad Bunny commenced his historic performance with a stage set evoking Puerto Rican history, beginning with the brutal legacy of Spanish imperialism on the island. A man wearing a pava hat — the traditional hat of Puerto Rican agricultural workers, lovingly called jíbaros — strums the opening notes of “Tití Me Preguntó” and declares, “Qué rico es ser Latino.” Behind him stand sugarcane fields, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous Taínos as well as poor criollos once labored, enriching the pockets of the island’s first colonizers and giving rise to a shared Puerto Rican identity rooted in communal power and resistance to colonial systems.</p>



<p>Seconds later, Bad Bunny’s baritone resonates across the fields. Dressed in a cream collared shirt and tie, a sport-inspired jersey bearing his family name, Ocasio, and the number 64 (representing the birth year of his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio), and his signature BadBo 1.0 Adidas sneakers, he is flanked by actors: some, wearing pava hats, embody those Puerto Rican farmworkers of the past, while others dress in modern farmwear, portraying the contemporary Latine laborers who continue to toil across the harsh agricultural landscapes of the U.S. All of them hold machetes, a tool once wielded by formerly enslaved people to revolt against colonizers across the Caribbean.</p>

<p>As he dances through the sugarcane fields, Bad Bunny brings us with him to modern-day Puerto Rico. Vendors sell coco frio, welitos play dominos, Black and brown women adorn themselves at a nail salon, and workers continue to rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane María. Benito then cools off from the blazing Caribbean sun with a piragua and tacos from the beloved L.A. taco shop, Villas Tacos, a nod to the street vendors across California and the U.S. who have been targeted and harassed amid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns. </p>



<p>Some of the scenes he portrays are painful, but there’s joy in his resistance and power in our cultural art forms and entertainment. Watching Bad Bunny evade punches from Puerto Rican boxer Xander Zayas and Mexican boxer Emiliano Vargas evokes the pride our families feel in our living rooms, watching our people represent us in sport. Seeing Latine artists like Cardi B, Karol G, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, and Jessica Alba dancing en la casita — a life-size replica of a traditional pink Puerto Rican house that Bad Bunny has used as a stage during his historic 31-day <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency”</a> in Puerto Rico and on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour to symbolize a pari de marquesina, those Caribbean garage parties nostalgic to so many of us — summons us to move through the structural violence we continue to endure with dance, too, just as our ancestors did. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958682.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Musician Bad Bunny performs during the Apple Music halftime show at the NFL Super Bowl LX football game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots at Levi Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But instead of bomba and plena, traditional Afro-Puerto Rican musical genres born from protest and community, women in khaki miniskorts shake their asses as Bad Bunny raps the lyrics to his reggaeton hit “Yo Perreo Sola,” a song about bodily autonomy, independence, and the right to dance without harassment. “Las mujeres en el mundo entero, perreando sin miedo,” he says, assuring women everywhere they have the space to move freely and safely in the show he’s created. Bad Bunny then transitions smoothly into “Safaera,” where we, global fans, sing the words to a sexually explicit, and empowered, song he can’t rap on the largest stage in the world: “Si tu novio no te mama,” he sings, as countless viewers yell back, “el culo, pa eso que no mame. Baja pa casa que yo te lambo toa. Mami, yo te lambo toa.”</p>



<p>Welcoming millions of watchers to “la fiesta más grande en el mundo entero,” Bad Bunny knows his halftime performance will break streaming records. He has shattered records throughout his career, becoming <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-bad-bunny-top-artist-album/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spotify’s most-streamed artist worldwide</a> in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2025 and <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">surpassing Amazon Music’s live-streamed concerts</a> during his “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más” finale. That’s because, as the world now knows, no one parties quite like folks from the Caribbean. There is protest, resilience, and freedom in the dips, sways, and wines that <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-calls-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show/story?id=129980124"">Trump labeled “disgusting.”</a> And through his performance of “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” the Grammy award-winning “EoO,” and a medley tribute to reggaeton pioneers like Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny invites the world to perrear como una puertorriqueña, to learn history and dance through Puerto Rican rhythms. </p>



<p>Ahead of his halftime show, Bad Bunny emphasized that language wouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying his performance. Speaking with Apple Music Radio hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden at the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/06/nx-s1-5563906/bad-bunny-super-bowl-performance-predictions"">Super Bowl LX Halftime Show Press Conference</a>, Martínez Ocasio urged those who’d be watching to dance from the heart, to relish a “heartbeat dance” — and heart was at the center of the entire show. </p>



<p>There was the moment Bad Bunny stared into a camera, pointed at the viewers watching from television sets, laptop screens, and portable projectors, and encouraged them to always believe in themselves because they are worth more than they know. There was the couple, kissing after “I do” in a white wedding gown and tuxedo, who <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47872442/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lx-half-wedding"">legally married during the halftime show</a>. There was Lady Gaga, one of Bad Bunny’s favorite artists, and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican band who played on his most recent album, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/deb%C3%AD-tirar-m%C3%A1s-fotos/1787022393"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</a></em>, performing a salsa rendition of “Die With a Smile” as the newlyweds shared their wedding cake. And when Bad Bunny returned to the mic, there were moments of cross-generational care. First, while singing his hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Femq4NPxs&amp;list=RDa1Femq4NPxs&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IEJBSUxFIElOb0xWSURBQkxFoAcB"">BAILE INoLVIDABLE</a>,” he gently woke a child sleeping on two seats, an experience every Latine who grew up going to family parties that stretch well into the night knows. Then, during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5V5WZVcVE&amp;list=RDKU5V5WZVcVE&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUTYmFkIGJ1bm55IE51ZXZhIFlvbKAHAQ%3D%3D"">Nueva Yol</a>,” he gifted a child his Album of the Year Grammy trophy, kneeling to the ground, and whispering to him, “Cree siempre en ti.” The boy symbolizes Bad Bunny’s own inner child, Latine youth across the diaspora, and, perhaps, even <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/administration-seeking-expedited-removal-5-year-family-rep/story?id=129918648"">Liam Conejo Ramos</a>, the five-year-old Ecuadorian boy who was detained by ICE in Minnesota while coming home from school.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958684.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=769&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A769"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: A couple marries during the Bad Bunny performance onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But Martínez Ocasio’s heart danced most passionately for his homeland — and for Puerto Ricans, whose population in the contiguous U.S. outnumbers that in the archipelago, home is often experienced differently, though no less authentically, throughout the diaspora. In “Nueva Yol,” Benito takes us to a Puerto Rican neighborhood in the Big Apple, with Puerto Rican flags hanging from store windows, women braiding each other’s hair outside of a barber shop, Brooklyn’s own Toñita, the beloved owner of the community anchor Caribbean Social Club, handing him a shot of rum, and Boricuas of every shade dancing in the street to a genre their Nuyorican ancestors co-created. </p>



<p>Ricky Martin then takes us back to Puerto Rico, now to the rural mountains, where he reinterprets Ocasio Martínez’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUgYmFkIGJ1bm55IExvIFF1ZSBQYXPDsyBlbiBIYXdhaWmgBwE%3D"">Lo Que Pasó en Hawaii</a>,” a protest song against U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico and a call to its people to fight to preserve land, heritage, and culture at a time when tourism-driven colonial pressures aim to reshape the island. When Bad Bunny returns to the mic, it’s to perform “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUUYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVsIEFwYWfDs26gBwE%3D"">El Apagón</a>,” a sharply political song that uses the debilitating power outages in Puerto Rico to critique government corruption and displacement. Carrying a Puerto Rican flag and, at one point, scaling a sparking utility pole, Bad Bunny, through the song, urges Puerto Ricans to fight for the future and sovereignty of their land and people.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958688.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Bad Bunny performs onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But as the music shifts from electro-reggaeton to plena, traditional Puerto Rican folk music, Bad Bunny extends his call. Walking off a set design of Puerto Rico that, in itself, should garner awards, and symbolically into the homes of those watching across the Americas, he names each country that makes up the Caribbean, South America, Central America, and North America — urging us all to reimagine American-ness, no longer restricted to the U.S.’s linguistic hegemony or make-believe colonial borders. Bound by shared histories, cultures, and resilience, he invites us to claim belonging and community that transcends nation-states and challenges centuries of imposed divisions.</p>



<p>This, of course, is the greatest threat to the ultra-right. It’s why Turning Point produced the All-American Halftime Show. It fears not just Bad Bunny but what his artistry is capable of: reimagination. </p>



<p>Through history, education, joy, dance, pleasure, and love, Bad Bunny’s music allows us to envision another reality — one where we, as marginalized people, understand our power and our worth, and where we fight lovingly for our undocumented neighbor in the house next door and for those enduring state repression in neighboring countries. </p>



<p>This is the cross-continental America we can create, the one where solidarity, justice, and dignity prevail for all of us, the one worth putting our hearts into and illuminating our skies for. After all, as Martínez Ocasio noted in a jumbotron during his final performance: “the only thing more powerful than hate is love.” <br /></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958068.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>From the very beginning, <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaelba/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina Elba</a></strong> has been clear about who she is creating for. In this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em> sponsored by <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and its Black History Month collection, which spotlights Black founders building with community in mind, the <strong><a href=""https://sablelabs.co/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22847971116&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoySwxa6rLOwHWVWAJcsScPLRC9lL&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1czLBhDhARIsAIEc7uj5Kp50Tl2ZVUdqaZx83ZYTNqfBs6Q8LybIEocgYKH2ipcnetAgRzsaAsi-EALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">S’ABLE Labs</a></strong> co-founder breaks down what it means to build beauty intentionally, ethically, and with communities of color at the center rather than the margins.</p>



<p>At the heart of Elba’s approach is what she calls “A beauty,” a term rooted in African beauty knowledge passed down across generations. “It’s the passing down of knowledge, traditions, ingredients, customs, throughout the whole continent of Africa,” she explains. That history is not just inspiration. It is a framework for how she builds. African botanicals like shea, Black soap, and rooibos come from some of the world’s harshest climates, which Elba says makes them especially powerful for skincare. For Elba, purpose lives in how those ingredients are used, not just where they come from. </p>



<p>Purpose also shows up in how those ingredients are formulated. Elba is intentional about pairing traditional African botanicals with modern skincare science, creating products designed to support melanin-rich skin without irritation. “Everything is fragrance free,” she says. “I don’t want to irritate skin that has gone through it.” Her philosophy reflects a belief that starting with more sensitive, inflammation-prone skin leads to better products overall.</p>



<p>That mindset was shaped by personal experience. As a teenager, Elba struggled with products that damaged her skin barrier and failed to meet her needs. “It’s part of the reason I’m so frustrated with the beauty industry, frustrated enough to start a brand,” she says. Rather than adapting to what existed, she chose to build something new with intention.</p>



<p>Elba’s purpose extends beyond formulation into how her brand operates. As a UN Goodwill Ambassador, she brings the same care to sourcing, working directly with farming communities across Africa and prioritizing transparency, fair wages, and safe working conditions. “If a product doesn’t tell you where those ingredients are coming from, we need to question that,” she says. It is an approach that aligns closely with Target’s <em>Made With Purpose</em> initiative, where ethical practices are treated as essential, not optional.</p>



<p>The beauty founder also pushes back on the narrow way Black-founded brands are often framed. “You haven’t created a Black product,” she says. “You’ve created a better product period.” Starting with communities of color, she argues, raises the bar for the entire industry.</p>



<p>Listen to the full <em>Go Off, Sis</em> episode to hear Elba chat with Senior Content Director of Entertainment at Refinery29/Unbothered, Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Brand Partnerships Lead at Unbothered, Sandy Pierre, and Social Strategist at Unbothered, Jessika Hardy, about African beauty knowledge, clean formulation, and why the industry still has catching up to do.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958198.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In the midst of all the chaos going on in the world, it’s nice to know that Venus in Pisces is bringing us a fairytale vibe. Venus in Pisces, which lasts from February 10th to March 6th 2026, is pulling out all the lovely stops, allowing us to feel confident in ourselves as well as relationships (both platonic and romantic). This is a moment of gentleness. We are finding solace and comfort through intimacy in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-lookbook-editor-letter-2025"">the depths of winter</a>. Whether we’re involved with others or not, it’ll be easy to feel the warmth and kindness regardless.</p>



<p>Venus in Pisces is in its “exaltation,” meaning the position of the planet in the water sign is favorable. The reason Venus thrives in Pisces is that the planet yearns to be unconditional, adaptable, tender, and creative. Venus in Pisces is all that and more — encouraging people to be forgiving and sacrificing for others. This transit encourages us to lead with the heart, ask questions later, and to understand those we care about through compassion. At times, Venus in Pisces can make us idealistic, but it’s only that we want to believe in the fantasy we set in our minds about what partnerships should be and look like. Anything less than that won’t suffice.  </p>



<p>On occasion, Venus in Pisces can be a tad mischievous, since the water sign is a mutable sign and absorbs the energy around it. People could take advantage of our goodwill, demanding more without reciprocating, and in turn, pushing us to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">call for boundaries.</a> Therefore, we have to be careful about what we allow in our lives and the quality of people we associate with. Be mindful of those who aren’t serving us anymore. </p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Pisces encourages us to be dreamy and artistic. Eclipse season and Mercury retrograde cross paths with Venus in Pisces, pushing us to focus on camaraderie and self-care more than anything else. Aligning with partners that are on the same page won’t be hard, although our desires are currently evolving and in flux. Three major aspects are essential to defining how Venus in Pisces will affect us. Fortunately, the North Node of Destiny, Jupiter, and Uranus are cultivating greatness for everyone. </p>



<p>Embrace switching up your style, if you want to. If you do, then use the weeks before February 26th, when Mercury turns retrograde, to ensure no regrets.</p>



<p>On February 17th, the same day as the Lunar New Year and annular solar eclipse in Aquarius, Venus aligns with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces. The karmic moment makes us more passionate and optimistic about relationships. Our confidence is high, pushing us to shoot our shot when it comes to asking out our crush, evolving commitments, and trying a new approach to dating. Since we’re feeling ourselves, we will not shy away from being bold and experimenting with different styles of expression, even acting through a leap of faith and believing the best in those we care about, regardless <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-red-flags"">of the red flags</a>.</p>



<p>Venus and Jupiter in Cancer bring luck on February 22nd. Both planets are two of the “greater benefics,” bringing positive energy and favorable news. Together, they can refine our ethics, promise abundance, offer security, and intensify our rizz. It encourages us to strive for the good life. We must listen to our gut. Intuition can be a lifesaver — now, more than ever. </p>



<p>Uranus in Taurus adds a streak of wildness and excitement to Venus’s cosmic mix on March 4th. If a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">situationship isn’t working</a>, we aren’t going to allow it to bring us down. We’ll break out and be free, helping us soar on the wings of love with someone who is worthy of our time. This could also mean that we are dating against our type to insert freshness into dating. And we lived happily ever after? Fingers crossed!</p>

<p>We know where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> stood on political and social issues because she told us, vehemently, loudly, and often. She told us in her music with songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWM"">Mississippi Goddamn</a>” and her cover of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vBga68Xdc"">Strange Fruit</a>,” two songs about lynching and the brutalization of Black folks during the civil rights era. Simone made art like her purpose was pulsing through her, coursing through her veins and embedded in her bloodstream. It spilled out because it had to, she <em>had</em> to tell the world how she saw it and how it ought to be. <a href=""https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-radical-politics-of-nina-simone"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">She told us explicitly</a> through quotes like the one that’s been making its rounds on social media lately: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo"">an interview from the ‘60s</a><em>. </em>“How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</p>



<p>The quote has been used so much it’s been flattened into a meme and lost some of its impact. But it’s never been more true that there are few artists in 2026 who are as committed to reflecting the times. Sixty years after Simone, then one of  the most notable singers in the world, used her voice to denounce systemic racism, critique capitalism, and unequivocally support the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190444/black-panther-movies"">Black Panthers</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-panther-style"">Black Power movement</a>, it’s hard to imagine more than a couple famous singers of her stature being as specific, bold, and unflinching in their activism and political outspokenness — within their music and outside of it. Silence is the standard. Sure, there are a few exceptions and after the Grammys, when multiple artists did speak out against <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205854/abolish-ice-origins-twitter-undocumented-immigrants"">ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-2026-bad-bunny-political-references-halftime-show-11487269"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny’s blistering Super Bowl performance,</a> the energy seems to have shifted slightly. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-grammy-boy/story?id=129980775"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCn2cmfEgA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/best-new-artist-grammys-lost-brits-1236174909/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Dean,</a> <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2026-02-04/shaboozey-responds-grammys-speech-backlash"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shaboozey</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/sza-ice-grammys-1236170851/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Eilish</a> all used their platforms at the Grammys to talk about how <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/presidential-debate-trump-harris-immigration"">ICE is dehumanizing immigrants</a> and terrorizing American communities. </p>



<p>To varying degrees of eloquence and effectiveness, these artists attempted to meet the moment at the Grammys, which came just a week after anti-ICE demonstrations erupted across the U.S. to protest the killings of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-transformed-federal-immigration-alex-pretti-renee-good-rcna256032"">Renee Good and Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis by ICE agents. People are being ripped from their homes, killed in the streets, and rights are being stipped away in real time. It didn’t start with these two murders, but like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11402306/george-floyd-anniversary-jordan-neely-death"">George Floyd’s murder </a>in 2020, we’re at an inflection point where people are finally, collectively saying ENOUGH. The celebrity statements at the Grammys were met with overwhelming support online and applause from the audience, like everyone was waiting for celebrities to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">stop treating awards shows like it’s business as usual</a> and capitalize on the attention that comes with the stages they are afforded. For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p>



<p>On the red carpet for the Golden Globes last month, I asked<em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Poker Face</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> star Natasha Lyonne</a> about the “ICE OUT” pin she was wearing. She mentioned Renee Good by name. That interview garnered over eight million views. And when I spoke to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUB5W6jDwM/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">actress Jameela Jamil</a> on another red carpet about how she gets called “brave” when she speaks up about social issues while other celebs stay silent, she responded, “Am I brave or are they cowards?” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Call it cowardice or bravery or anything in between, but what celebrities choose to say — or don’t — about the state of the world is always a hot topic. So, what do we <em>really</em> want to hear from artists in times of crisis? As <a href=""https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/11/15/toni-morrison-art-despair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Toni Morrison famously said</a>, “This is precisely the time when artists go to work.” It may be too simple to say that every single celebrity should be performing their activism on social media or during awards speeches. A social post is the bare minimum. And many of these artists do not have the range to engage in a productive political debate. There are many different ways to support causes you care about, and if you have money, funding movements, giving to organizers on the ground, or to victims’ families can be more powerful than simply posting an Instagram story. I don’t think it’s a useful pastime to litigate what each celeb has or hasn’t said on their personal social media accounts. But two things can be true. And we live in a time when celebrities wield more power and access than ever, with legions of stans ready to act on command. We know that when famous artists do speak up, it works. </p>



<p>Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration"">increased voter registration by 23 per cent</a> (the number of 18-year-olds registered more than doubled) in 2023 with a non-partisan plea for her followers to vote. Swift is an example of someone who, despite making a documentary that was heavily about her decision to start <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump"">speaking out against Donald Trump</a>, has chosen to remain neutral in a time that demands partiality. Telling fans to vote without making it clear that their basic rights and freedoms are on the line is like inviting people to dinner without telling them the menu is a choice between hot dogs and razor blades. One option ain’t great; the other will kill you. But most artists try to toe the line. On one hand, Beyoncé will deliver an album (and a <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-black-panther-halftime-the-revolutionary-politics-behind-beyonces-super-bowl-performance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl halftime performance</a>) that can be interpreted as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/04/11698236/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-country-music-history-reaction"">searing critique of America</a> while highlighting oft-forgotten Black history and on the other, she’ll be spotted <a href=""https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/jadegomez510/beyonce-ivanka-jared-charity-dinner"">partying with members of an administration</a> hell bent on erasing that very history. In 2026, there are only a handful of celebrities who seem to be truly channeling the spirit of Simone. The rest opt into conversations about social justice when it’s comfortable, convenient, and popular. </p>



<p>The Grammys were proof of this. From the vague (Shaboozey) to the sincere (Olivia Dean and SZA) to the specific (Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, and Kehlani), the show ended up being an unintentional showcase of the typical range of celebrity responses to social injustice. To be clear, I think it’s important and necessary that each of these artists chose to use their speeches to stand up for immigrants and stand against ICE. But if you are going to speak up, as <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/2026-grammys-review-politics.html"">Craig Jenkins put it for Vulture</a>, we’re going to need more “naming and shaming.” Jenkins wrote, “The ingredients for a broadcast that could brashly outline the regime connections in the building were in play, but any elephant in the room that was tacitly acknowledged was also rarely explicitly named and shamed.”</p>

<p>Take Shaboozey for example. “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them,” the singer said as he accepted the Grammy for Best Country Group/Duo Performance. “For all children of immigrants, this is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunities, to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it.” It’s a nice sentiment, but Shaboozey didn’t say “ICE” once in his speech and his “immigrants built this country” line not only erases the labor of enslaved Black Americans, it also plays into the harmful idea that immigrants deserve to be treated fairly solely because of their labor, instead of the fact that they are human beings. <a href=""https://people.com/shaboozey-addresses-backlash-immigrants-built-this-country-remark-grammys-speech-11899304"">Shaboozey has since apologized</a> and clarified his statements. I’m sure that the risk of receiving backlash for clumsy comments is why many stars refuse to say anything at all, but the stakes are too high to be scared of some silly social media fallout. Plus, the potential repercussions — like losing followers or brand deals — are trivial concerns compared to the violence people are facing at the hands of ICE, and in the wake of the Trump administration’s tyranny.</p>



<p>Someone who seems to understand this is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-reclaims-reimagines-america"">Bad Bunny</a>, and his career hasn’t suffered. Bad Bunny is also one of the few artists topping the charts in 2026 who actually incorporates his beliefs into his music — and he has for years. Bad Bunny speaks to the colonial violence America has enacted globally, and refuses to conform to the white supremacist ideals it continues to perpetuate. In a recent piece for NPR called “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/05/nx-s1-5701460/where-are-the-protest-songs"">Where Are All The Protest Songs?</a>, Ann Powers writes, “Bad Bunny stands out in 2026 not only for his historic success as the first artist win album of the year for a Spanish-language album, but because DtMF does <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-political-lines-explained"">explicitly enact resistance</a> in songs like “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” calling out American imperialism, gentrification and the displacement of his fellow Puerto Ricans.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s [Bad Bunny’s] clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In fact, Bad Bunny’s success hasn’t been hindered by his outspokenness, I think it’s added to it. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is unapologetically himself, a proud Puerto Rican, and someone who believes in the power of art to be political <em>and</em> personal. “Before I say thanks to God,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech for Best Música Urbana Album, “I’m gonna say ICE out… We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” And when he won Album of the Year, Bad Bunny accepted in Spanish and dedicated his award to Puerto Rico. At the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-super-bowl-meaning-1235513218/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl, Bad Bunny</a> displayed a sign that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCX_Aqzoo4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">El Apagón</a>,” a song which mentions the <a href=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/19/bad-bunny-el-apagon-music-video-puerto-rico-hurricane-gentrification/10426694002/"">power grid issues Puerto Rico</a> has struggled with since Hurricane Maria (due in large part to the inaction of the U.S. government), the set featured Bad Bunny and dancers hanging from utility poles. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Bad Bunny also listed countries</a> across Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America in his Super Bowl set, speaking to our diasporic connection and bookended his performance with holding up a football with the words, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Together, We Are America</a>” scrawled on it, pushing the message that borders are imaginary and cultures are global. It was a moment that, as a Jamaican Canadian currently living in the U.S., brought me to tears. That’s only scratching the surface of the symbolism and spirit of revolt that Bad Bunny brought to the Super Bowl. When it was time to step up and say something, he did it with authenticity, integrity, history, conviction, and clarity. It’s this clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ask is for celebrities to show us their values, some of them will also show us their asses. Despite being dubbed “MAGA Barbie,” Sydney Sweeney has yet to specifically denounce the actions of the party she’s associated with (Sweeney is reportedly a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/sydney-sweeney-jeans-ad-republican-voter-registration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">registered Republican</a>). In a <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">recent interview with Cosmopolitan</a>, Sweeney said, “I’ve never been here to talk about politics. I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of. And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” Later <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">in the Q&amp;A</a>, Sweeny vaguely defines her beliefs as being rooted in love by saying, “I’m not a hateful person” and doubles down on the idea that art is not political. </p>



<p>“I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am,” Sweeney told Cosmo. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form.” These statements are genuinely so stupid, I almost don’t want to give them the dignity of a rebuttal. The last time <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">I wrote about Sweeney</a>, I swore it was the last time. But this notion that entertainment and politics should be segregated, that one has no bearing on the other, isn’t just a false belief held by Sweeney to justify her inability to emphatically condemn an image of herself she helped create. Since the Grammys, the sentiment has been echoed by <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/why-don-t-stfu-mark-130425855.html"">Kevin O’Leary</a> and <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/ricky-gervais-celebrities-leave-politics-out-speeches-grammys-1236494483/"">Ricky Gervais</a>, two old white men no one should be paying attention to and yet, here we are. </p>



<p><a href=""https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kevin-oleary-slams-billie-eilish-173347556.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">O’Leary posted that Eilish</a> should “STFU [shut the f-ck up]” after she said “No one is illegal on stolen land” in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">speech accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year</a>. “I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE,” Eilish continued. Based on their recent statements, Sweeney, O’Leary, and Gervais seem to agree that the artists who spoke up at the Grammys should just “shut up and sing.” But art <em>is</em> political and it always has been. Every piece of art – a song, a movie, a TV show, an album — is created within the social context of its time. Sweeney ran an unsuccessful Oscar campaign for playing an abused lesbian boxer in <em>Christy</em>. Victims of domestic violence and members of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3lT_r0MYA"">LGBTQ community</a> are two vulnerable groups whose <a href=""https://time.com/7332225/domestic-violence-victims-shelter-trump-immigration/"">legal protections have been under attack</a> since Trump was elected again. </p>



<p>And while art has been used by governments to weaponize, propagandize, and manipulate populations, it has also been suppressed and censored to shut down resistance. Art can be a joyful act of defiance and a powerful instrument of protest. When Sweeney calls herself a storyteller without acknowledging how stories can push narratives, preserve history, propel representation forward or stereotype entire demographics, she’s either being wilfully ignorant or just illiterate (literacy is another example about how art is political). And when artists use art to lure in victims or cover up their crimes (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10634487/r-kelly-trial-allegations-charges"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/210844/bill-cosby-sentence-sexually-violent-predator-guilty"">Bill Cosby</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9539191/harvey-weinstein-sentence-23-years-prison-women-justice"">Harvey Weinstein</a>, the Hollywood elite in <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-list-of-powerful-men-named-in-the-epstein-files-from-elon-musk-to-former-prince-andrew"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the Epstein files</a>, I could go on), it’s impossible to say that the two are unconnected. </p>



<p>At the Grammys, country singer<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jelly-roll-allegedly-confronted-reporter-185644570.html""> Jelly Roll came under fire</a> for proclaiming that “people shouldn’t care to hear my opinion” because he’s “a dumb redneck.” This is also a common refrain from celebrities (and influencers). They claim not to be informed enough to speak on current events. If they are going to be given microphones, you’d think they’d put some thought and care into what they are going to say into it. There is a responsibility that comes with fame and feigning cluelessness isn’t a good excuse, it’s a copout. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVP_fXt51Y"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jelly Roll can speak about Jesus</a> and preach about his religion, but he refuses to interrogate the teachings in the very Bible he totes around in order to stand up for the basic human rights of his neighbors. Jelly Roll’s comments probably didn’t come as a surprise. He’s a white country star and the genre tends to lean heavily conservative. The music industry is a business, and when the majority of your fan base is Republican, artists aren’t staying silent out of ignorance, they are choosing money over morals. </p>



<p>Money is the only explanation for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/06/nicki-minaj-maga-era-barbz-defend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj’s recent behavior</a> — even though her fanbase is overwhelmingly queer and Black. In the past, the Trinidad-born, New York-raised rapper hailed herself as a proud immigrant standing in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Now, she’s full MAGA. “I am probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change,” Minaj said last week at the<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/trump-accounts-nicki-minaj.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> U.S. Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit</a>. “And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> My wish is for these artists to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Along with holding hands with Trump (shudder), Minaj “thanked the president for getting her a Trump Gold Card, a kind of visa for wealthy foreigners to help them secure expedited U.S. residency,” <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/nicki-minaj-trump-gold-card-husband-citizen-grammys-trevor-noah-don-lemon.html"">according to Slate</a>. “The visa normally requires a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go?accountMarketingPreferences=off"">$1 million contribution, plus fees</a>; Minaj… nabbed the Trump Gold Card for free.” There’s conflicting reports as to whether Minaj’s visa is legit, but it’s clear that cozying up to Trump is for her own personal gain. As digital creator and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUZnISvjqZl/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Raven Schwam-Curtis says in a video</a> posted to her @ravenreveals account, Minaj “has chosen to side with a president that uses the optics of Black women as ‘proof’ that his regime is doing good things for our communities while actively harming us,” she says. “Representation doesn’t equal liberation or solidarity. If anything it shows how easily representation can be weaponized by the right when your class position pulls you out of solidarity with regular Black folk.” Through her art, Minaj gained wealth, status, and standom that she has now leveraged to push her far-right agenda. And <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-fans-barbz-vote-republican-trump-11482667"">according to Newsweek</a>, legions of Minaj’s fans, dubbed “Barbz” are following her pivot to the Republican Party. </p>



<p>It’s already problematic that we live in a time when celeb worship is at an all-time high. We shouldn’t be looking to these people to tell us what to believe, but they are influential, whether we want them to be or not. If Minaj and Bad Bunny stand at two opposite ends of the celebs speaking up politically spectrum, they each represent the <em>dos</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of celebrity political activism. One is emphasizing how culture and community can combat oppressive regimes (Benito) and the other is proof that conformity and greed can make you complicit in upholding them (Minaj).</p>



<p>The Grammys, and the Super Bowl halftime show, served as hopeful examples of celebrities meeting the moment, even though they both still exist within institutions that sustain the status quo. My wish is for these artists — and anyone with a platform — to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. Like Bad Bunny and Kehlani (who has been a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7508887896628219178"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro-Palestinian advocate</a> in her music as well as on social media), my hope for all public figures to use every avenue of their influence to try to shake the table and push back against powerful people who aim to snuff out dissension and stifle diversity.</p>



<p>“We’re too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of a statement in our country,” Kehlani <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suQNZoLVrdE"">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> on the red carpet at the Grammys. “I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists and speak out against what’s going on, and I’mma leave this and say “‘Fuck ICE,’” she echoed during her speech. </p>



<p>I started this piece by quoting Nina Simone and as cliche as it may be, I’m going to end it the same way. Because Simone was decades before her time. And every artist (including actresses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DURBiKkEoQZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kerry Washington</a>, <a href=""https://iop.harvard.edu/events/artist-public-life-sophia-bush-activism-artistry-and-courage-speak"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Bush</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacks-star-hannah-einbinder-criticized-ice-shouted-free-palestine-emmy-rcna231320"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Einbinder</a>) who dedicate their platforms to advocacy for those whose voices need to be heard, are doing so because of the path Simone, and others like her, paved. I think their legacy should be more than just memes. So, I’ll leave you with Nina Simone’s full quote: </p>



<p><em>“An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</em></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, a liminal checkpoint between what has already climaxed and what is about to be reborn. Last quarter moons are not about manifesting or initiating, they’re about editing. This one asks us to release what the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-full-snow-moon-in-leo-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo Full Moon</a> revealed is no longer sustainable, especially around power, control, emotional attachments, and unspoken resentments. You may encounter small speed bumps, emotional flare-ups, or moments of resistance. Instead of pushing through, pause and ask yourself: <em>What am I being asked to let go of so I don’t carry it into the eclipse?</em> Scorpio energy reminds us that release is rarely neat, but it is necessary.</p>



<p>Midweek, the emotional tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, a placement where Venus feels especially at home. Under this transit, compassion rises and defensiveness melts. With Mercury already in Pisces, conversations become more heart-centered, intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. This is a powerful week for forgiveness, creative expression, spiritual connection, and choosing love over fear, not in a bypassing way, but in a grounded, human one. As Pluto continues its work in Aquarius, reshaping collective systems and futures, Venus in Pisces reminds us that revolution without tenderness is unsustainable.</p>



<p>The emotional and spiritual weight of the week peaks on February 13th, when Saturn leaves Pisces and enters Aries, closing a chapter that began in March 2023. Cosmic beings, give yourselves credit. Saturn in Pisces asked for surrender, boundary repair, grief work, and deep spiritual accountability. Its exit may bring relief, but also unexpected emotion. This is the final full week of the Year of the Snake, and grief can surface alongside excitement.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries begins a brand-new 29-year cycle at the very start of the zodiac, but this is <em>not </em>a race. With Mercury approaching its retrograde shadow and eclipse season arriving next week, this remains an in-between time. The momentum is real, but so is the need for gentleness. Trust that the tides are turning. You’re allowed to move forward slowly, intentionally, and with love for both yourself and the collective you’re helping to shape.</p>
