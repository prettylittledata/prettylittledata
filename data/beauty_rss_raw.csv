<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960290.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960287.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Yet as I saw runway after runway composed exclusively of the thinnest models, the scattered tips I was getting about curve models on the runway started to feel like rare sightings of an endangered species.</strong> </p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>

<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>



<p>Will it replace my trusty Shark Glossi? I think so — once I’ve grown my layers out. I prefer a blunt cut with straight hair on me. That said, my friends with curly hair are already eyeing it up, so who knows how long I’ll be able to hold onto it… </p>

<p>I’ve been to a lot of fashion shows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Fashion Week</a> is basically a sport at this point and I’m basically an Olympian. You prep, you glam, you Uber in heels because you can’t actually walk in them, and you pray the show starts late. I’ve mastered the rhythm. I know how to move. But this time, it felt different. Because for the first time ever, I wasn’t just attending a show, I was being dressed for one. And not just by anyone. By <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sergiohudson/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>. For his <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/sergio-hudson"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fall/Winter 2026</a> runway. On his 10th anniversary. I’m still pinching myself.  </p>



<p><strong>My Favorite Room During Fashion Week</strong> </p>



<p>Sergio Hudson’s show is hands down my favorite show to attend during New York Fashion Week. The collections are always versatile. Whether you’re a corporate baddie running a boardroom, the belle of the ball at a gala, or just a fashion girly who loves to throw that fit on, Sergio has a piece for you. And his casting is inclusive. Always. In a fashion world that still struggles with representation, his runway actually looks like us.   </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960041.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The room itself feels like the hottest and chicest invite of the year but never exclusive in a weird way. Everyone from <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.dk/detail/news-photo/yolanda-adams-sergio-hudson-and-monica-attend-sergio-hudson-news-photo/2261636426"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monica</a> to <a href=""https://hellobeautiful.com/4581318/jackie-aina-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jackie Aina</a> was there. And somehow, no one feels more important than the other. You feel like you belong. </p>



<p><strong>The Showroom Moment</strong> </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960042.jpg?width=583&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=583%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A few days before the show, I went to the Sergio Hudson showroom to find my look. My first option was a red blazer moment. It was giving “I own the company,” but I wasn’t fully sold. I wanted a <em>moment</em>. Then one of the stylists pulled out a silver sequin dress and I knew. I paired it with a gray wool coat draped over my shoulders and yeah, this was the bold statement I needed to make. It felt regal, dramatic, and intentional. All I needed were silver heels to finish it off. If you’re going to be dressed by Sergio Hudson for his 10th anniversary show, you don’t play small. </p>



<p><strong>Fashion Week Tried Me</strong> </p>



<p>Now here’s where the plot thickens. Show day was a mess. On the day of the show, I still hadn’t found the perfect shoes. I had two hair appointments. I had to shower, do my makeup, get dressed, and be there by 6:45 PM. </p>



<p>Appointments got pushed. My hair didn’t finish until 5 PM. I rushed home, threw on my dress, did my makeup with one eye on the clock, and ran out the door. I got in the Uber at 6:20 PM. and because it’s New York… traffic!  </p>



<p>What should have been a quick ride turned into over an hour. I was panicking the entire time. All that prep. All that anticipation. Just to possibly miss the show? I felt defeated sitting in that back seat. But by the grace of God, I made it. The show started ten minutes after I arrived. And I’m choosing to be a delusional queen and believe they stalled it for me.  </p>



<p><strong>10 Years of Excellence</strong> </p>



<p>The collection was out of this world. Bold colors. Chic tailoring. Fierce models. Looks that quite literally took your breath away. It felt celebratory but forward. A reminder that ten years in this industry, especially as a Black designer, is no small thing.  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.essence.com/fashion/sergio-hudson-10th-anniversary-show-fashion-fw26-nyfw/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ten years </a>of vision. Ten years of staying true. Ten years of dressing powerful women and men in pieces that command attention.  </p>

<p>It’s safe to say my outfit was a hit. As I walked into the show and later as walked out, people were taking photos of me. Complimenting the dress. Stopping me mid-step. For a moment, I felt like a queen.  </p>



<p>Being dressed by a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">Black designer</a>, celebrating his milestone, and sitting in a room filled with culture, excellence, and intention will always be one of the highlights of my career.  </p>



<p>Supporting Black-owned designers like Sergio Hudson isn’t just about fashion, it’s about community. It’s about showing up for the people who reflect us, design for us, and see us. I already can’t wait for the next show. </p>

<p>Over the last week, New York City proved its status as a fashion capital of the world, with talented designers showcasing creative collections on the runways, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">in the streets</a>, and on our feeds. From “let them eat cake” aesthetics and double-duty bags to fringed frocks and leather opera gloves, New York Fashion Week brought <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">statement fashion trends</a> and serious 2026 outfit inspo to the forefront.<br /><br />In order to get the front-row scoop on what will be huge for the fall and winter of 2026, I attended so many fashion shows and presentations that my heels hurt and phone was always on the brink of losing power. The endeavor was more than worth it because I found the standout trends (that I think you can start implementing into your wardrobe while it’s still cold!). The wonderfully disheveled <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saltburn-indie-sleaze-2000s-fashion"">indie sleaze look</a> and head-to-toe <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">animal prints</a> that dominated New York’s runways are especially great for party looks, while <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11305994/brooch-fashion-accessory-trend"">brooches</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">headwear</a> can add flair to any winter outfit.<br /><br />Ahead, see which brands — from New York staples like Tory Burch to NYFW debuts like that of designer-denim staple 7 For All Mankind — took on similar trends in their own unique points of view.  Then shop styles to get the looks.</p>

<h2>Vintage-Inspired Brooches for Today</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959927.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Wondering what the stand-out accessory of the A/W 2026 shows were? It <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">wasn’t just one shoe trend</a> or a particular purse or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">statement necklace</a>. It was the brooch. Ranging from metal sculptures from the likes of Caroline Herrera, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a>, and Tory Burch; crystal cascades courtesy of Collina Strada; 3D glass florals by Caroline Zimbalist; and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUvv79tCbKo/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sergio Hudson</a>’s fabric-covered designs, many brands put their seal of approval on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/designer-fashion-secondhand-the-realreal-ebay-poshmark"">vintage staple</a>.<br /><br />These modern designs might look out of place in your grandmother’s jewelry box (but that doesn’t mean she won’t want to borrow your baubles from time to time!). Pin them to your sweater, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a>, or to secure your scarf for fashion <em>and</em> function. </p>

<h2>Animals Gone Wild</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959932.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>I can confidently say that animal prints will never go out of style. In fact, they’ve essentially become neutrals that can seamlessly integrate into everyone’s wardrobes today. This season, brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-anna-sui-collaboration-2025"">Anna Sui</a>, Norma Kamali, Ralph Lauren, and Ulla Johnson tapped the fan-favorite cheetah and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard prints</a>. Looking to find inspiration from other corners of the animal kingdom? Kim Shui and Markarian introduced tiger prints, while Kate Hundley and Sergio Hudson offered snakeskin sets, and Bronx and Banco sent out a zebra purse.<br /><br />Animal illustrations were also big sources of inspiration, as Alix of Bohemia featured a whole zoo worth of animal prints and embellishments (think: giraffes and monkeys!). Swans also popped up across Tanner Fletcher outerwear and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU4lDRfiI_F/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aknvas</a> button-downs if avian-inspired looks are more your style.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>The Grunge &amp; Indie Sleaze Scene</strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959934.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>For those of us who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">crave nostalgia</a>, it’s exciting to note that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2025"">the ‘90s</a> and early 2000s have never been more back! Specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/joaquina-90s-grunge-era-jcpenney-collection"">moody grunge</a> and indie sleaze party-girl aesthetics are having a moment, with dark palettes, messy styling, and even disheveled, slept-in hair (look no further than Collina Strada’s models for proof). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">Plaid prints</a> featured heavily in the anchor pieces of several collections, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/coach-handbag-trends"">Coach</a>’s youthful blazers as well as Collina Strada’s and Private Policy’s dresses.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuHzuajEmc/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">7 For All Mankind runway show</a> was also a master class in early-aughts styling, down to the energy and even the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUuXgANjkvZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">models’ viral walks</a>. Think, lots of layering, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">all-denim-everything</a>, skinny scarves, platform pumps, jumbo shoulder bags, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-chunky-jewelry"">chunky jewelry</a> all together — because in this case, more is more. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Hat Attack</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959935.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>Bundling up in the cold has never looked so chic. Hats and headpieces served as the cherry on top of this season’s runway looks, serving inspiration for right now and next winter. Designers especially made the case for having headwear for every outfit and event, no matter how casual or fancy. Designs included chic pillbox hats and caps that tie around the neck (Christian Cowan), fur trapper hats and headbands (Aknvas and Bronc and Banco), oversized knit silhouettes (Advisry), extra-long beanies (Private Policy), lace skull caps (Prabal Gurung and LaQuan Smith), and beaded head coverings (Jane Wade) across womenswear <em>and</em> menswear alike.<br /><br />The impossibly stylish <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11856777/asap-rocky-verdict-court-case-timeline"">A$AP Rocky</a> even wore a fur trapper to close out the NYFW debut of his brand AWGE, giving hats a celebrity stamp of approval! </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>All Laced Up</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959936.png?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>While the collections that New York City’s designers showed this season weren’t as stiff or structured as some in the past, lacing still showed up as a major throughline. For proof, look no further than Adeam’s, Elena Velez’s, and Meruert Tolegen’s not-so-basic corsets and dresses.<br /><br />Those seeking more casual interpretations of the trend can turn to Kate Hundley’s lace-up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jacket</a>, which is proof that your winter puffer can not only not ruin your outfit; it can make your entire look. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUxFffpjp26/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gabe Gordon</a>’s lace-up knit skirt also feels as right for après ski as it does for a Saturday <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-fall-winter-2024-trends"">athleisure look</a>. Laces even made their way into the models’ hair at Caroline Zimbalist as an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">unexpected hairstyle trend</a>.</p>

Having a pair felt like everything. I remember dreaming about them, imagining how it would feel to finally wear them and show them off,” she told the publication. <br /><br />The sneakers were so popular among Latine youth that Reebok even collaborated with the biggest star of reggaeton at the time, Daddy Yankee, for a “DY” signature sneaker and apparel line in 2005.<br /><br />Now, with reggaeton one of the most popular genres in the world and Karol G as one of its front-runners, it’s her turn. And the Grammy award-winning singer isn’t just wearing Reebok Classics like she dreamed — campaign photos of her in the 131-year-old footwear brand can be seen all over, from Medellín to the rest of the world. <br /><br />As part of “Born Classic. Worn For Life,” the sports culture brand launched its most popular lifestyle sneakers crafted in 100% real, full-grain premium garment leather, including Club C 85 Vintage, Freestyle Lo, Workout Plus. <br /><br />And while the sneakers were just made available on February 18, <a href=""https://wwd.com/footwear-news/shoe-trends/karol-g-reebok-ambassador-media-impact-value-1238514597/"">WWD reported</a> in late January that just the announcement of Karol G as Reebok’s latest ambassador generated $1.1 million in Media Impact Value (MIV) in 48 hours for the footwear brand. <br /><br />Swipe to see what all the hype is about.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959871.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2400&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""2400"" /><figcaption><strong>Club C 85 Vintage</strong> <br /><br />When Reebok introduced the Club C 85 in 1985, it was a clean, performance-driven sneaker built for tennis champions. But the simplicity of its low-cut design quickly made it a staple off the court, too. Now, the Club C 85 Vintage, available in unisex and women’s, channels the same minimalist spirit of the ’80s classic, reimagined with a premium garment leather upper.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959853.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Over the last few days, the social media firing squad has been aimed at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tyrabanks/"">Tyra Banks</a> and the producers behind <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363307/""><em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, the cultural phenomenon of a reality show that aired from 2003 to 2018 and spawned dozens of international spinoffs. <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81928842?trackId=259776131&amp;trkId=259776131&amp;src=tudum""><em>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model</em></a> is proof that the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>



<p>The Netflix docuseries, which premiered on February 11, featured firsthand accounts from models, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ebonyehaith/?hl=en"">Ebony Haith</a> (Cycle 1), <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shandithecatlady/?hl=en"">Shandi Sullivan</a> (Cycle 2) and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/danievans1/?hl=en"">Danielle Evans</a> (Cycle 6) as well as judges <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mrjaymanuel/?hl=en"">Jay Manuel</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miss_jalexander/?hl=en"">J. Alexander</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nigelbarker/?hl=en"">Nigel Barker</a>. Through three episodes, viewers get a firsthand look at the exploitative conditions contestants were subjected to each cycle. That included extreme makeovers using plastic surgery and dental work, blackface and racist stereotypes as photoshoot themes and a sexual assault that was intentionally caught on film. Banks and former <em>ANTM</em> executive producer <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596298/"">Ken Mok</a>, who both served as executive producers for <em>Reality Check</em>, were also interviewed.</p>



<p>For 24 cycles, Banks was able to bully women into becoming the American ideal standard of what the “ideal woman” was at that time. And for millennials who were coming of age at the height of the show, it was not only appointment television; it was a rubric for how to become worthy of adoration.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959823.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model.

<p><em>ANTM</em> was one of the first times millennials witnessed hyperfemininity politics on display in the media through a reality show competition. As a little Black girl from the Midwest, watching the women who looked like me on the show further ingrained a conditioning that was already at play: that, to the world, I could only be beautiful with conditions. With <em>Reality Check</em>, flashbacks of Ebony’s gorgeous skin being called dull and ashy came rushing to the forefront. Danielle Evans being pressured to close her gap influenced me to want braces (thank you for not acquiescing, mom). Watching judges dismiss the concerns of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamtoccarajones/?hl=en"">Tocarra Jones</a> (Cycle 3), a full-figured woman from my hometown who I grew up looking up to, injured my confidence as I grew into my own curves.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And as a child, I was convinced Black girls couldn’t show their hurt like <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1909197/"">Tiffany Richardson</a> (Cycle 4) did, lest be seen as aggressive, ungrateful and undeserving.</p>



<p>“It was very, very intense but you guys were demanding it, and so we kept pushing more and more and more,” Banks said in <em>Reality Check</em>.</p>



<p>Banks skirts accountability in an astonishingly delusional manner throughout the docuseries. The trauma this show left with these women — especially the sexual assault of Shandi, which the documentary doesn’t name as such — was real, and Banks is to blame. At the same time, there’s some validity in her statement that we can’t ignore. No, viewers didn’t force Banks to exploit these women,  and much of the trauma they were subjected to has come into perspective only recently, but the buck doesn’t stop with Banks or this show.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959833.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model. Dani Evans in Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts. The message was resounding: thin and white was right. And if you were a woman of color, you better adapt quickly if you want to get anywhere.</p>



<p>As we sit firmly in 2026, it’s clear how wrong Banks and the producers were in their abuse of power. But what’s being overlooked is that history is repeating itself right before our eyes.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><em>ANTM</em> wasn’t just a look into the exploitative extremes models experienced behind the scenes. It held a mirror up to the homogenous beauty standards that Americans celebrated in the early to mid aughts.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>With social media, there’s an insurmountable pressure that comes with showing up as your best. And unlike in 2003, the feedback is in real time. With a growing amount of content creators and influencers relying on social media platforms for their livelihoods, it takes more time, energy and money than ever before to keep up with appearances. For many, that’s the difference between economic stability or missing out on opportunities.</p>



<p>Body positivity feels like a thing of the past as the idea of thinness reemerges as a status symbol and the <a href=""https://www.today.com/video/cosmetic-surgery-is-drawing-younger-patients-and-more-men-250889285677"">demand for cosmetic procedures</a> for younger groups increases. Doctors and marketers <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/glp-1-brands-enter-their-super-bowl-era/"">push GLP-1s</a> on any and everyone regardless of clinical need. And <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sydney_sweeney/"">Sydney Sweeney’s</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">“great jeans” American Eagle ad</a> feels in conversation with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miketyson/"">Mike Tyson’s</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/article/mike-tyson-super-bowl-ad-maha-fatphobia"">fat shaming Super Bowl ad</a> funded by Make America Healthy Again.</p>



<p>In addition, the needle hasn’t moved much on Black women being labeled “aggressive” and facing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">microaggressions and outright racism</a> on and off screen. Even in the show “The Traitors,” Black contestants are given <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/jan/09/black-contestants-the-traitors-reality-tv"">far less grace</a> to prove themselves as “faithfuls” due to stereotypes being used as evidence of their integrity.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959856.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=799&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A799"" /></figure>



<p>So many of us who watched <em>ANTM</em> growing up have done work to divorce ourselves from the limiting beliefs that the show and others instilled in us growing up. (For me, that looked like embracing my curves and natural hair.) But witnessing progressive ideas of beauty disappear in media while it simultaneously shames Banks feels a bit hypocritical.</p>



<p>It’s frustrating to see Banks refuse to take accountability for her wrongdoings and have the nerve to tease a Cycle 25 that may go to less extremes but will be likely to fall into old patterns. But what’s also true is that she is the perfect scapegoat for this moment to keep us comfortable in repeating the same mistakes. There’s a regressiveness happening that we can’t ignore. Today, it’s a reality check that our favorite show perpetuated the same system it said it wanted to change. Tomorrow it’s something far more sinister. </p>

<p>When it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/phantom-french-cat-eye-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">my manicure</a>, I’m pretty unadventurous. As soon as I sit down at my local salon, my nail tech knows exactly what to ask: “Your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">usual French</a>?” And the answer is always yes. To me, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> — whether the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">classic white tip</a> or something a bit cooler, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye</a> — strikes the perfect balance between timeless and elevated, and it takes a lot to sway me from it. But the trending “reverse” French manicure might just change that. </p>



<h2>What is the reverse French manicure?  </h2>



<p>The reverse French manicure isn’t exactly new, but we have <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamcardib/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cardi B</a>’s Super Bowl look to thank for its recent comeback. Her nail artist, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cocamichelle/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Coca Michelle</a>, turned the classic <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhRw5XEaBA/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure on its head</a> — literally — by flipping the gold tip so it curved around the base of the nail, right at the cuticle. Since then, Google searches for “reverse French manicure” have increased by 110%, as it seems we’re ready to channel Cardi B and try something different. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, is well-versed in the art of the reverse French manicure. “The reverse French is essentially a flipped take on the classic,” she explains. “Instead of highlighting the tip of the nail, the design hugs the curve of the cuticle with either a thin, delicate line or a thicker, more graphic arc,” — exactly like this beautiful set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DT7XXe4jOtM/?hl=en"">nail artist Fern Barron</a>. </p>

<p>Mercedes adds that it draws the eye downward. “It frames the nail at its base rather than the edge, which gives it a more unexpected, editorial feel compared to the traditional French.” </p>



<p>She has an idea why it’s becoming so popular again: “It’s a twist on a timeless look, and right now clients are craving fresh ways to stay minimal without feeling boring,” she says. To Mercedes, the reverse French feels modern and intentional — subtle, yet still a statement, like this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-UWS_asnyw/?hl=en"">Fliss Alton</a>. “It’s perfect for someone who loves ‘clean’ nails but wants something more directional than a standard tip,” adds Mercedes. </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the reverse French manicure? </h2>



<p>Achieving a reverse French manicure is similar to painting a traditional French tip. It calls for the precision of a thin nail brush and a steady, skilled hand as not to flood the cuticle with polish or get any uncured gel on the skin, which could <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gel-nail-allergy"">potentially cause an allergic reaction</a>.  </p>



<p>There’s a clever benefit to reverse French nails, too, but it depends on your color choices: “If you incorporate negative space or a sheer nude at the cuticle area, the grow-out can look incredibly subtle,” says Mercedes. Because the design is already anchored at the base, she adds that it can blend more seamlessly as the nail grows. “This is especially true when softer tones are used,” she says, like nude shades. </p>

<p>Unlike the traditional French tip, the reverse French is much easier to master on shorter nails, like this set by manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPvgxcACOpp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte May</a>. We especially love the sky blue base and how the reverse French wraps around the tip slightly.</p>

<p><em>This week: a marketing manager on $167,000 and who spends some of her money on some knitting yarn.</em></p>



<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025.</em> <em>This is a follow-up diary. You can read the original diary </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary""><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Marketing manager<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Life sciences<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 31<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago, IL<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $167,295 ($143,295 base + $24,000 bonus)<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is around ~$240,000 (+/- $10k). My husband, F., is a freelance director of photography and has recently gone back to school to facilitate a career change to healthcare.  Shortly after my first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary"">Money Diary</a> we made the decision to combine our finances. It was a little challenging at first, but at the end of the day, we are a team, and we make financial decisions together. Combining finances has given us a clear picture of where we stand as a family and has allowed us to meet big financial goals like completely paying off our student loans last year. The way we manage our finances is that we plan our monthly budget off of my net income, and all money F. brings in goes into our liquid savings account. At the end of every month, we review our spending and sort everything into a spreadsheet with categories to track our spending habits and make sure we’re staying on top of our financial goals.<br /><strong>Assets</strong> <br /><strong>Home value:</strong> $275,000 <br /><strong>Car value:</strong> $20,000<br /><strong>Combined retirement accounts &amp; investments:</strong> $250,848.52<br /><strong>Checking account:</strong> $1,785<br /><strong>Savings account:</strong> $66,612.60<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $172,600 (home loan)<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $3,252 (my husband’s varies)<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $1,742.64 ($1,368 mortgage + $374 HOA). <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $0 (we paid off student loans last year)</p>



<p><strong>All Other Monthly Expenses</strong><br />Paycheck deductions (per paycheck):<br /><strong>Health/Life Insurance:</strong> $273<br /><strong>Investments:</strong> $1460<br /><br /><strong>Recurring expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Utilities:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $70<br /><strong>Gym membership for two:</strong> $154<br /><strong>Car insurance:</strong> $111<br /><strong>Mint mobile (2x lines):</strong> $53<br /><strong>Dog medication:</strong> $55<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There was an expectation to attend college and get my bachelor’s degree. However, I strayed away from getting a degree in anything that would require higher education because I was afraid of having to take on additional debt. I paid for undergrad with a combination of student loans, settlement money from a childhood injury, and some support from my parents. My husband F. is currently pursuing a career change with plans to go to med school. Seeing him in school definitely has me toying with going back and getting an MBA. My company has tuition reimbursement programs I’m looking into.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I did not receive a lot of education around money growing up. My parents made a handful of bad financial decisions and got into a lot of business debt owning their own small business. Tax-advantage accounts and employer 401(k)s were totally foreign to me when I first started working, but I think we’ve done a good job building an investment portfolio given our financial backgrounds. My husband and I have done a lot to improve our financial literacy as adults and discuss our finances often.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job out of college was working as a marketing coordinator at a PR agency. I got the job because I studied communications during college and snagged a paid internship between my junior and senior years. I worked as an intern until I graduated and was offered a full-time position. I was incredibly grateful to have a job lined up on day one of post-grad. My starting salary was $38k, which is wild to think about now! At the time, I was extremely careful with how I spent my money and even managed to save some on this salary.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes — looking back it is very clear to me that my parents were striving for a life that their careers could not afford. I grew up with a lot of insecurity around money, and feared that my peers would find out about my parents’ financial struggles and think less of me. Growing up this way definitely pushed me to strive for financial security and success as an adult.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />No — I am very aware that we live a life that exceeded either of our expectations and feel confident in our current financial position and trajectory. Additionally, combining our accounts pushed me to take my emotions out of finances. I also know that I’m incredibly privileged to be able to think of money as a tool that allows us to live a comfortable life.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible for myself the day I graduated college. My husband and I have built a financial safety net for ourselves through paying off loans, liquid savings, purchasing property, and investing in retirement accounts. We’ve been able to do all of this by living within our means through our 20s, and by prioritizing spending on long-term investments. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />Yes. This past year we received a $10k gift from my grandfather. His health has declined and he is living with my parents, and sold all of his properties. The grandchildren all received a financial gift from the property sales. </p>



<h3>Day One: Monday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — The temps have dropped so we are finally sleeping with the windows open but it means we had a noisier-than-usual night and didn’t get great sleep. My husband, F., makes coffee while I browse white-noise machines. I notice that they are HSA/FSA eligible so make a note to come back for my purchase. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I boot up my computer for the week and check in with co-workers before I get ready to take the dog, P., around the block. I listen to my audiobook, <em>Darling Girls</em>, while I walk P. around the block. I love listening to audiobooks and love that you get 10 hours of listening included in your monthly Spotify Premium subscription! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I join my weekly round robin all-hands call as F. heads out for a job. My co-worker has the updates for my team this week so I just listen in while all teams give their updates and priorities for the week. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Next meeting of the morning! I hop on a call with all the product marketers on my team and we discuss what we’re working on this week. For me, it’s a few housekeeping tasks and a little bit of planning for future projects. I just wrapped up managing a big project and my manager is on paternity leave for the next two weeks, so it’ll probably be a pretty slow week for me work-wise. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — It’s time for breakfast! I take a break and listen to my audio book while I make myself eggs, toast, and a fruit bowl.</p>



<p>10:15 a.m. — My co-worker calls me asking for help with something. We also catch up and chat about what’s been going on in our lives since we last connected, and I eat my breakfast. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I spend the rest of the morning working on the task my co-worker and I chatted about. </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I break for lunch and whip up a quick bowl of tuna salad. While I’m on my lunch break I scroll through Ravelry looking for a pattern to use up some extra yarn I have from a baby sweater project. A year ago, I really got into knitting and haven’t stopped since I picked up knitting needles for the first time. I purchase a small neck scarf pattern called the <a href=""https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-jose-scarf"">My Jose Scarf</a>. I cast on the project and knit a few stitches before logging back in for work. <strong>$8.20</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m — Work is slowing down for the day so I decide to get a head start on dinner. F. and I have evening commitments so I’m hoping this will get dinner on the table faster. Dinner tonight is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020419-pasta-alla-norma-sorta"">Pasta Alla Norma Sorta</a> from NYT Cooking. F. comes home from his job and we catch up for a few minutes in the kitchen.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I check my emails and Teams messages before riding my bike to group tennis lessons from 5-6 (I prepaid for the session a few weeks ago but it’s typically $259 for 8x 60-minute lessons). I started taking tennis lessons last March and have fallen completely in love with the sport! I’m still very much a beginner tennis player, but I’ve signed up for my first ladies’ tennis league this fall. Expectations of winning are low, but I’m still planning on having fun!</p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back from tennis and F. is already settled into his online chemistry class. I check emails and Teams once more before logging off for the day and taking a shower. I’m grateful my past self did all the dinner prep. All that’s left to do is heat and assemble. I finish listening to my audiobook while I get dinner together. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — F. has a break from his online class so we eat dinner together for a few minutes. F. recently decided on a career change and is finishing up some pre-reqs on online community college. The plan is to take the MCAT after this and then apply for med school (big life change)! After dinner, I clean up the kitchen, and walk P. once more before relaxing with my knitting project and watching reality TV for the rest of the evening. </p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — We get ready for bed and read for a little while before falling asleep. F. is reading his chemistry textbook and I’m reading<em> Fates and Furies</em> by Lauren Groff.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $8.20</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Tuesday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — We wake up early today since F. has a job, so he needs to head out the door early this morning. F. makes coffee as I work through the NYT Games for the day. The Wordle really stumps me!</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I check in on my emails and check off a task for the day. F. heads out the door and I follow behind with P. I call my mom and catch up while I walk the dog. My mom lets me know that they are coming up to Chicago for Thanksgiving and this puts me in a good mood. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love to host!</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I’m back online for work for the rest of the morning. I get a CC alert that $20 has been reloaded on the city street parking account. F. must have arrived at his job (this is a work expense and we will get reimbursed from the client). I take a quick break to make breakfast and eat in front of my computer while responding to emails.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — During my lunch break I go to the public tennis courts near our condo and practice my serve for a while. As a beginner tennis player, serves are 100% the hardest skill to learn!</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — On the way home from the courts I stop at my neighborhood market and grab a bell pepper, turkey, iceberg lettuce, olives, mozzarella, and black olives to make a chopped salad for lunch. <strong>$22.05</strong></p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — When I get home I throw together my lunch salad and settle in for work for the rest of the afternoon. F. gets home from his job around 3 p.m. and makes salad with the ingredients I bought. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get an email that my tennis league didn’t have enough people sign up for the bracket and is being cancelled and refunded. I end up signing up for Gladiator Tennis, which I’ve heard of players using for league play. After my serve practice, I’m feeling hopeful I won’t totally embarrass myself and sign up for the beginner/intermediate league. <strong>$35</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon was spent working from the couch. I got my period and was majorly knocked down by cramps and PMS. F is already in class so I peel myself off the couch to walk P. around the block. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftovers from yesterday. F. eats while he’s in online class and I eat while watching TV. I feel a little guilty about being so lazy this evening while F. is being productive in school. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — F. wraps up class early so we walk P. around the neighborhood one more time, and then come home and wind down watching PBS before getting ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.05</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Wednesday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — We wake up and F. makes coffee while I play the NYT Games for the day and work on a few rows of knitting. F. talks about going to the gym this morning and I tell him I might come, too.</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I log onto my computer to get started on work for the day. The last week of August is usually my slowest week of the year, so there isn’t a whole lot I need to be doing for the rest of the week. As a “high earner” with a WFH job, I feel a lot of guilt/shame around slow periods. November through July is generally very busy and then it slows down for a few months. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We take P. around the block and then head to the gym. I put on a spooky podcast when I get to the gym and do a leg workout. </p>



<p>11:15 a.m. — F. makes eggs, toast, and fruit for us for breakfast when we get home and I do a little bit of work on my laptop. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I hop on a call to discuss landing pages that are being built for an upcoming campaign I’m managing. I often work with and project manage the digital and content teams and feel grateful that they’re a nice bunch of people to work with. We all give feedback and talk through some options for the Q4 campaign I’m leading.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After my meeting, I take a quick little snack break and have some honey roasted almonds and remind myself to drink a glass of water. F. sees I’m up from my desk and also takes a study/snack break. We talk about going to Key West for his spring break in March. We’ve never been to Key West and we’ve never taken a spring break before. I send F. a few links to the Key West Historic Inns once I’m back at my desk.</p>



<p>3:15 p.m. — Work is wrapping for the day and I get a jump start on dinner since F. and I will be out for the evening. Tonight’s dinner is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025436-one-pot-chicken-and-rice-with-caramelized-lemon"">chicken and rice from NYTimes Cooking</a>. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — While the chicken and rice is in the oven, I take P. out for a walk and clean up the kitchen a bit. F. and I sit down for an early dinner before getting ready to head out. After dinner, F. drops me off at tennis on his way to night class. One night a week he’s in person for a lab.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After tennis, my friend and I grab a drink at a wine bar in our neighborhood and cheers to playing well during class! <strong>$28.25</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I enjoy a nice late summer walk home through the neighborhood. August is the sweetest month of all and I always feel such a warm, fuzzy feeling walking around this time of year. I’m sure the wine was helping perpetuate this feeling!</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — Home from tennis and I take an ‘everything shower’ before making a yogurt bowl and chilling with my knitting project while watching <em>Southern Charm</em>. I was turned on to <em>Southern Charm</em> after watching the latest season of <em>The White Lotus</em>. F. gets home around 9:30 p.m. and he fills me in on his first day of in-person class, and we hang out for a bit before getting ready for bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $28.25</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready quickly for my first meeting of the day. </p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I meet with a colleague in Europe and we discuss projects we’re collaborating on. F. makes coffee in the kitchen and we drink our coffee together after I wrap up my meeting. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — F. asks if I ordered the sound machine yet (I haven’t). We decide on an old school fan-based sound machine. I get started on a little bit of work and message with one of my coworkers about a final report for a project we’re wrapping up. <strong>$60.63</strong></p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. gets ready for the gym and I get ready to take the dog on a walk. I walk F. to the gym and then stop at a local cafe for a breakfast sandwich before heading home and getting back to work. <strong>$14.79</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — F. has been working on his chemistry homework all morning. Weirdly, the chem textbook does not come with an answer guide to check your work, so he purchases a used solutions manual to help him with studying. <strong>$27.44</strong></p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I have my weekly check-ins with two of my co-workers. We all agree it’s been such a slow week but also nice to come up for air after our busy season this summer. </p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — I have a psychiatrist appointment to check in on the anxiety medication I’m taking. I had a really scary panic attack where I ended up in the emergency room earlier this year so I have 100% been prioritizing my mental health. Anxiety is something I’ve struggled with since I was a kid and this year I feel like I’m finally taking the steps for treatment. Because I’ve hit my out of pocket max for the year, my co-pay is $0. </p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — I stop for gas and at Whole Foods on my way home to pick up magnesium glycate (recommended by my psych for sleep) and a very balanced snack of cheese balls and a protein drink. I also grab some sugar that’ll I need for the baking project I’m working on this weekend. <strong>$73.25</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I wrap up work for the week and throw together a quick dinner of rice leftovers, broccoli, and shrimp from the freezer for F. and I to have before he has class, and I head out for my evening activity. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Every Thursday, my local knitting shop has a ‘knit circle’. This is the shop where I learned to knit a year ago and I really enjoy the community space they’ve built. I haven’t been to knit night all summer so I make sure to bring a few of my finished objects to share. Vibes are great and I promise to myself I’ll be back again next week. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Home and snacking on the rest of the cheese balls while I watch TV and knit and F. finishes with his online class. Once he’s done, we catch up and get ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $176.11</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Friday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I have the day off so F. and I wake up a little later. I don’t know if it’s a placebo, but I did sleep a lot better last night after taking the magnesium! F. and I have sex before getting out of bed and making coffee. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. and I meet up with one of my friends to play some two-on-one. We play for about an hour and a half and it’s so much fun. I love the endorphins I get from playing tennis. </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Home from tennis and we have some breakfast. After knit night, I’m feeling inspired to order the boucle yarn I need to start a pattern I bought months ago. I also buy an extra skein of yarn for the scarf project I’m working on since it looks like I’m going to lose a game of yarn chicken. <strong>$165.15</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready to go to therapy. I go every other week, and to be honest, I find talk therapy a little bit tedious and exhausting but I go on the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have to take the train because F. is about to head out of town for the weekend for a film festival. F. will be staying at his parents’ place and any expenses incurred, i.e. meals, etc., this weekend are business write-offs. </p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — Once I get to the office I realize I messed up the dates and I actually don’t have therapy until next week — whoops! Instead of therapy, I take a long walk through the neighborhood and stop at a few shops. I pick up three birthday cards and a baby card at Hazel — they have the best selection of cards. <strong>$25.91</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I make a few more shopping stops on my way home. Next stop is a local apothecary to pick up Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara. I also stop at the running store to pick up energy snacks for some of the tennis meetups and matches I have. Last stop is the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients for lunch, and baking ingredients to do a practice run of my friend’s wedding cake I’m making in September. <strong>$77.62</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — After the impromptu shopping afternoon, I come home and made a Costco frozen pizza. While the oven pre-heats and the pizza cooks I eat the broccoli leftovers from last night. I relax on the couch for a while before taking P. on a long walk. F. ended up taking the toll roads to Michigan since the holiday weekend traffic was looking bad. <strong>$17.10</strong> <strong>(tolls). </strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I spend a majority of the evening working on a practice cake for my friend’s wedding next month. The recipe I’m using is Claire Saffitz’s confetti cake — it’s such a good recipe and is my go-to for the foster care birthday cakes I make volunteering. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Cake baking goes well but at this point I’ve made two failed attempts at marshmallow buttercream. I clean up the kitchen and decide that frosting the cake is a tomorrow task. I relax and watch TV while knitting the rest of the evening. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $285.78</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Saturday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up with a wet nose in the face and we snuggle in bed while I do the NYTimes Games. After this I get up and make a latte —still using the Breville Espresso Maker! While I drink my coffee, I crack open the holy grail cake cookbook, <em>The Cake Bible</em> by Rose Levy Beranbaum and scour the buttercream recipes until I find one that sounds like it will go well with the confetti cake. </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I have a 10 a.m. tennis meet-up so I take P. around the block and make a quick breaky of scrambled eggs and fruit. Then I get ready and put a backpack together with my racket, waterbottle, knitting, and a book. I’m not going to go home right away after tennis. </p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — I hop on my bike and arrive a few minutes early, hoping to snag a court, which I do! My tennis partner and I warm up and play a set. I lose 2-6, but still have fun and felt good about my serves. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — First stop of the day after tennis is Loba. I get a housemade melon soda and a strawberry sourdough muffin. I settle in at a table to work on my knitting and start listening to a new audiobook, <em>Don’t Let Him In</em>. Coincidentally, the two gals next to me were also knitting and we share a moment talking about what we’re working on. The knitting community is alive and well in Chicago! <strong>$14.15</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Next stop is Paulina Meat Market to grab an Italian sub. I’m back on my bike headed towards the lake to enjoy my sandwich, and a little more knitting while I listen to the audiobook. <strong>$13.78</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — I don’t have enough butter in the fridge to do the meringue buttercream recipe so I stop at the local market on the way home and buy more butter. It kills me to buy butter at this price so I make a mental note to stock up at Costco next time. <strong>$6.64</strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — P. greets me at the door and I get straight to work prepping all the ingredients for the butter cream. All goes well with the new buttercream recipe and I finish up with the cake project for the weekend. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I take P. for a long walk to the river before the sun goes down. When I get home, I take a shower, clean up the kitchen and make tacos for dinner. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I try a slice of the cake I made and it’s heavenly — can’t wait to bring some to my friend tomorrow morning! The rest of the night is spent working on my knitting project and watching <em>Southern Charm</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $34.57</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Sunday</h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up again and we snuggle in bed while I play the daily NYTimes Games. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I make a latte and watch <em>Sunday Morning</em> while working on some knitting. After this, I walk P., have some breakfast, and get ready to meet up with a friend for tennis. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We don’t have to wait long for an open court, thankfully! My friend and I have a nice long warm-up and then play a match. I get my a** handed to me and lose 6-0, 6-0. I still have fun and score a few points and remind myself the only way to get better is to keep playing!</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — After tennis, I go home, take a shower, and get the laundry for the week started. Our condo building doesn’t have in-unit hook-ups, so we’re still using coin-operated in the basement. It’s not glamorous but it gets the job done. <strong>$4.50</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — F. is home from his weekend away and I’m starving for lunch! We go on a long walk through the neighborhood and get sandwiches and Diet Cokes at L&amp;M, which we eat in the park and catch each other up on our weekends. <strong>$37.42</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — When we get home from lunch we have some of the cake I made yesterday. F. gives his best Paul Hollywood critique. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on knitting projects and watching TV. I’m pretty tired from the two hours of tennis. F. takes a nap and works on his chemistry homework for a bit. </p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — F. and I walk P. around the block. When we get home we open a bottle of wine and have the tacos from yesterday for dinner. We chat for a bit before F. resumes his chem homework and I get back to knitting. </p>

For virtually all of my teen years, I blasted my face with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide — anything that claimed to target acne, I slathered with reckless abandon. It wasn't until my 20s that I finally put down the harsh products and picked up gentler ones that targeted breakouts without the slash-and-burn-farming approach — this is how I discovered <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">niacinamide</a>. <br /> <br />If you ask me, niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) is well-deserving of its hype, and it’s not unusual to see it laced into not only skincare products, by makeup primers, skin tints, and foundations nowadays. The ingredient is often name-checked by dermatologists for its multifaceted benefits: curbing excess oil, minimizing the appearance of large pores and fine lines, and soothing flare-ups due to inflammation or acne.  <br /> <br />“Niacinamide works by modulating inflammation and supporting the skin barrier, which is especially important for acne-prone and reactive skin,” explains dermatologist Jenna Queller, MD. She adds, “It also helps regulate sebum production [natural oils produced by the skin], reduce the transfer of pigment within the skin, and improve skin elasticity, contributing to brighter, more even-toned skin over time.” In other words, it's an all-in-one skincare ingredient with near-universal appeal. <br /> <br />Ahead, I've rounded up some of my favorite products that include the star ingredient — from niacinamide cleansers to serums to moisturizers. <br /> <br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

/>I've been using this stuff on repeat for a few reasons. For starters, the price is right, and for an acne cleanser, it's not over-stripping, thanks to CeraVe’s signature ceramide complex and hyaluronic acid. Plus, it works wonders to ward off new breakouts, thanks to antibacterial salicylic acid, which also exfoliates deeply but gently, preventing clogged pores, not to mention niacinamide to mop up oil and boost the skin barrier.  <br /><br /><strong>CeraVe</strong> Renewing SA Cleanser, $, available at <a

/><figcaption><h2>Naturium Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%</h2><br />If a hydrating essence and a gel cleanser had a baby, this would be it. You can apply it as the first step in a double cleanse to remove makeup, or on wet skin to whisk away dirt and oil, leaving behind a bright, balanced complexion. In addition to niacinamide, this formula contains sodium hyaluronate (a form of hyaluronic acid), plus sodium ascorbyl phosphate, a water-soluble, stable form of vitamin C. <br /><br /><strong>Naturium</strong> Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3%, $, available at <a

Essence<br /></h2><br />Then I Met You (founded by Charlotte Cho, the brains behind K-beauty retailer Soko Glam) has been something of a best-kept secret — until now. This hydrating, brightening essence contains yeast-derived galactomyces ferment filtrate and saccharomyces ferment filtrate to reduce the appearance of large pores and curb sebum. (TL;DR fermented skin care ingredients tend to be more effective and are easily absorbed by the skin thanks to the molecules being much smaller.) Besides these smart ingredients, it contains a 5% concentration of niacinamide to brighten and soothe skin. <br /><br /><strong>Then I Met You</strong> The Giving Essence, $, available at <a

Serum<br /></h2><br />Eadem’s Milk Marvel Serum is uniquely formulated by and for people with melanin-rich skin, meaning that it targets excess pigment without lightening or bleaching your overall skin tone. Niacinamide is a key ingredient in the formula, along with papaya and pineapple enzymes, to target concerns like dullness and hyperpigmentation at the source.  <br /><br

Cin Niacinamide Face Serum<br /></h2><br />Dr. Queller recommends this gentle yet effective formula for its pairing of niacinamide with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, zinc PCA, and aloe vera. ""I love this for daily use on sensitive, acne-prone, or dull complexions,” she says. “Patients respond really well to it and appreciate how lightweight and non-irritating it feels on the
