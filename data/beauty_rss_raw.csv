<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead. </em></strong><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton"">Bridgerton</a></em> viewers have been eagerly awaiting the conclusion of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Season 4</a>, with book fans getting prepared for <em>that bathtub scene</em> (IYKYK). And boy, was it worth the wait. After Benedict Bridgerton (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-4-details"">Luke Thompson</a>) and his mother, Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell), rescued maid Sophie Baek (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-chinese-korean-yerin-ha-katie-leung-interview"">Yerin Ha</a>) from being wrongfully imprisoned, Benedict and Sophie had a steamy moment to themselves. It was everything we could have asked for, and for those who loved the carriage scene in Season 3, it’s like that… just wetter. </p>



<p>The dynamic between Sophie and Benedict has been fraught, with Ha’s character terrified of becoming like her mother and harbouring an illegitimate child with a nobleman. In this particular scene, they don’t want to accidentally conceive, so there’s some mutual pleasuring going on. Set to an orchestral cover of <em>Never Be The Same</em> by Camila Cabello, it’s both emotional and horny. And of course, like all <em>Bridgerton</em> stories, the season wraps up with a happily-ever-after.</p>



<p>When I speak to Ha and Thompson over Zoom, their chemistry is immediate. They are engaged, energetic and are able to poke fun at each other as if they’ve been friends forever. Below, the <em>Bridgerton </em>actors talk about the bathtub scene, Korean and Chinese representation in Season 4, and hype each other up in the sweetest way. Oh, and <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@benophiebridgerton/video/7601241313660374288"">Thompson still doesn’t know what ISTG means</a>. </p>







<p><strong>Refinery29 Australia: <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 had me giggling and kicking my feet at times. I was wondering if you two could break down the bathtub scene? What was it like to film, and were you nervous?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Luke Thompson: </strong>We’d done a bit of intimacy by then. Were you really nervous for that one?</p>



<p><strong>Yerin Ha:</strong> In a different way. Different angles.</p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Different body parts, and we were in water. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>The bathtub is so long. I’m 5’2! </p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> She kept floating down the river. We had to sort of brace a little bit. And being in water for six hours is…</p>



<p><strong>YH:</strong> Gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>LT: </strong>I’d recommend it to everyone. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>Lukewarm water, hot water to wash my hair with. </p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Disintegrating petals. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>Yeah, milky, oily water. </p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Well, that’s the other thing, it was so slippery. We were like two seals, because they kept pouring in this thing to make it milky, but I think it had oil in it. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>So it made us look really shiny.</p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Yeah, so they basted us… </p>



<p><strong>YT: </strong>Like chickens!</p>



<p><strong>LT: </strong>Like two turkeys, exactly.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think fans are going to go wild over the scene?</strong></p>



<p><strong>YH:</strong> I hope so. We put a lot of work and effort into that. I hope they do!</p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> They better! No, I mean, I hope they do. It’s an iconic scene in the book.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960832.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=684&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A171"" /></figure>



<p><strong>And your chemistry is so great. What’s your favorite thing about working with each other?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong>  I always say this, but I think it’s true. I think Yerin takes the work seriously, but she doesn’t take herself seriously. It’s the combination of being like an amazing scene partner, in terms of actually being in the scene, but also outside, we just had a laugh. And you’re just a good person, as well as being wildly talented, and I do think that’s rare. I think that combo is not often felt.</p>



<p><strong>YH:</strong> Luke’s the same. He’s a fantastic listener. And in a day and age where I feel like people don’t listen, he’s a fantastic listener. And I mean that on screen and off screen, I’m able to vent to you about so many things and also come to you when I’m feeling a certain way, but also have a laugh. And you have a great heart. </p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Thank you. </p>



<p><strong>Yerin, you’re also our Australian Diamond Of The Season. How exciting has it been to represent both Korea and Australia worldwide in such a massive way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>YH:</strong> It’s the best feeling, and it’s everything I dreamed of, to be able to represent both countries in that way. I don’t want to think about it too much, because then it feels like this sense of pressure, but just me being in that position and that naturally being the domino effect, it’s the best. To make people feel seen all over the world, it’s the thing I always hoped for. It’s why I came back to Australia to try and pursue acting in Hollywood, or whatever you want to call it. So yeah, it’s a dream.</p>

<p><strong>Your costumes also had some Korean influences, for example, your necklace was amethyst, and South Korea is known for producing that gemstone. At the same time, Araminta Gun’s family had Chinese influences, and I think it’s cool to differentiate, because East Asians are often lumped together.</strong></p>



<p><strong>YH:</strong> Yeah, there is a difference! It’s so nice. The fact that the costume department even thought about that and nailed the details, it just goes to show how much thought goes into everything, from the set to the costumes. It is just a recognition that we are different, and yet we can coexist. I didn’t have to teach them that. They educated themselves, and then they came back with the ideas. Educating people can be tiring, so the fact that I didn’t have to do that and they put all the work in just goes to show how professional and amazing they are.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much, that’s all I have time for. Thank you, and Luke, I hope you know <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@benophiebridgerton/video/7601241313660374288"">what ISTG means now</a>.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> ISTG, yeah, thank you so much. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>What does ISTG mean? </p>



<p><strong>LT: </strong>Instagram. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>No!!!!!</p>



<p><strong>LT: </strong>It doesn’t mean Instagram? </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>I swear to god!</p>



<p><strong>LT:</strong> Oh, I swear to god. I’m so confused. Okay, I’m still confused. I don’t know what it means. </p>



<p><strong>YH: </strong>I will brief him on this afterwards. </p>



<p><strong>LT: </strong>I thought it meant Instagram! But that makes no sense. I swear to god.</p>

<p>Chances are that if you know comedy, you know <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/canadian-female-comedians"">Catherine O’Hara</a>. The Canadian actress and comedian built a decades-long career on bringing love, joy, — and a bevy of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/moira-rose-schitts-creek-best-hair-makeup-looks"">perfectly coiffed if unusual wigs</a> to the world on-screen. She’s a woman who made <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/moira-rose-schitts-creek-best-hair-makeup-looks"">black and red en vogue</a>, gave a whole new levity and meaning to the name “Kevin!” (not to mention <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/catherine-ohara-kevin-cry-home-alone-1235508224/"">made her a pop-culture legend</a>) and made many of us question what exactly it means to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCVKCUB5w50"">“fold in” cheese</a> when we’re cooking. </p>



<p>And she’s continuing to give us the best moments even now that she’s not here to see them— most recently at The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/actor-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">32nd Annual Actor Awards</a> (<a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"">formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards</a>). </p>



<p>On March 1, O’Hara posthumously received the award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series for her work as studio executive Patty Leigh in Apple TV+’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIQuE7JGXU8""><em>The Studio</em></a>. It was an incredibly well-deserved moment, but one that felt bittersweet in its timing. The Canadian actress, known for her iconic roles in <em>Beetlejuice</em>, <em>Home Alone</em>, <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and, — most recently, — <em>The Studio</em>, died in January of this year at the age of 71.</p>



<p>Accepting the award on her behalf, <em>The Studio </em>creator Seth Rogen took to the stage to pay tribute to his co-star, reflecting on his experience knowing O’Hara and marveling at the actresses’ ability to be kind, generous, and gracious throughout her career without minimizing her immeasurable talent. Talking about working with her on the hit series, Rogen said: “She knew she could destroy, and she wanted to destroy everyday on-set,” before going on to urge those watching in the audience and at home to share O’Hara’s work with others, advising: “Show them <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQXVHITd1N4"">O’Hara dancing to Harry Belafonte</a> in <em>Beetlejuice</em>, show them O’Hara hurting her knee in <a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/best_in_show""><em>Best In Show</em></a> and doing that amazing thing where she hobbles around. And tell the people, as they are laughing, that that’s Catherine O’Hara and we were lucky that we got to live in a world where she so genuinely shared her talents with us.” </p>



<p>Excuse us while we — and every A-list actor in that auditorium — sobbed. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>[O’hara’s win was] a much-needed reminder that art can be impactful, and bring people together in a very special way. The way that O’Hara, and now her legacy, does. </p><cite>katherine singh</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It was a touching and incredibly fitting tribute for an actress who has had such an impact on film and TV, and a stand out in the typical awards show circuit that can often feel monotonous and unnecessary. </p>



<p>And to be clear, in many ways this awards season <em>has</em> felt that way. Among increasing political chaos across the United States; including the unlawful and inhumane <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ice-detaining-deaf-immigrants-no-sign-language-access"">detainment and deportation of immigrants and citizens by ICE</a>, the <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/renee-good-was-shot-head-autopsy-commissioned-family-finds-rcna255335"">murder of citizens</a> at the hands of the very same agents, and the country <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/3/2/us-israel-attack-iran-live"">engaged in numerous attacks globally</a>, it can feel like hell to be a person existing right now. And this chaos, not to mention the literal life and death stakes people are facing day-to-day, makes concerns over whether or not Timothee Chalamet is going to take home an  his much-anticipated Oscar award for <em>Marty Supreme</em> feel pretty trivial. Because when citizens are literally being murdered in the streets by government officials, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">a singular “ICE OUT” </a>pin and bids for “prayers for peace” from some of the most wealthy and privileged people in society, feels pretty lame and inconsequential. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11962192.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – MARCH 01: (L-R) Kathryn Hahn, Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz, and Chase Sui Wonders, winners of the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series Award (and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series on behalf of Catherine O’Hara) for “The Studio,” pose in the press room at the 32nd Annual Actor Awards at Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on March 01, 2026 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Which is one of the reasons why O’Hara’s win, and touching tribute from Rogen and those in the auditorium, felt so special. As a much-needed reminder that art — and the people who share it with audiences — can be impactful, and bring people together in a very special way. The way that O’Hara, and now her legacy, does. </p>



<p>“Catherine was an honor to be around,” <em>The Studio</em> co-star <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF-dhZSFyYo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chase Sui Wonders</a> told Refinery29 on the red carpet at the Actor Awards. “We’re so luck that we had that experience with her, to be in Vegas drinking martinis at The Sphere. It’s honestly nice to be together and to be able to trade stories  and laugh about the crazy things she did and how amazing she was. She was one of one.” </p>



<p>Another reason O’Hara’s win felt monumental? The fact that, after an already illustrious career, she was really just getting started. At the time of her death, O’Hara was having a much-deserved renaissance of sorts; still actively working and opening herself up to a whole new younger generation of fans with her work in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11776486/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-jenna-ortega-catherine-ohara-interview""><em>Beetlejuice</em> franchise</a>, her epic turn as Moira Rose in <em>Schitt’s Creek</em> and her most recent satirical role in T<em>he Studio</em>. </p>



<p>Like actor Harrison Ford <a href=""https://x.com/netflix/status/2028305176508170602"">spoke of his own career </a>while accepting the Actor Award’s Lifetime Achievement Award, O’Hara too was at what only felt like the halfway point of her career. She was at a point that all greats inevitably come to, often much too late in their careers, where they’re finally celebrated and given their flowers; their footprint only fully understood in hindsight. Which serves as a reminder, in a year that has brought the loss of so many of our legacy Hollywood greats, including Diane Keaton, Robert Redford, Graham Greene and Rob Reiner, that it’s important and meaningful to celebrate these artists, their work, and their impact while they’re still here to receive it.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961430.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Hands with a galaxy projection are held up against a blurred red planet on a dark background. This artistic concept explores the connection between humanity, the cosmos, and inner space.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">Are you ready to dive head first into the enigmatic sea of Mars in Pisces? From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/march-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">March 2nd to April 9th</a>, we’ll be trying to keep our heads above water when the planet of passion and ambition, Mars, swims in Pisces, bringing a whirlwind of desire and excitement. For the next several weeks, self-care and preservation will be essential. </p>



<p>Mars in Pisces <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/confrontation-friendships-relationships-trust"">doesn’t like to be confrontational</a>. This astrological placement would rather avoid having arguments with others by swimming away from a situation and avoiding dealing with the person. Mars in Pisces urges us to leave the drama on read and send calls to voicemail. The vibe can be frustrating if you’re on the other end of it, because resolving matters is impossible during this transit. </p>



<p>This is why when we want to fight, instead of directly discussing the matter with the person who is frustrating us, we will choose to go behind their back and do shady things, like provoke their enemy (after all, our enemy’s enemy is our best friend) or talk behind their back. The reason is that Mars in Pisces likes to play games and pretend they didn’t have a hand in stirring the pot, rolling the dice, or shuffling the cards. Mars in Pisces is too slippery to get caught in the act, but if it does, prepare for gaslighting or bear the burden of the blame, since Mars in Pisces rarely takes responsibility for having a role in a situation.</p>



<p>The answer is simple: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">We must use our intuition</a> and empathy to understand that, while we may wish to do devious things for vengeance, it’s not worth it. Using compassion to understand what others are going through will help us comprehend the motives. Giving people grace proves that we are evolving into evolved beings, which is what Mars in Pisces urges us to become. Picking up on a sentiment can lead us down the right path, allowing us to handle matters with TLC. Kindness and sympathy for what our friends and loved ones are going through are more necessary than ever, especially given the world’s current divisions.</p>



<p>The celestial currents of Mars in Pisces have many great attributes, such as creativity and altruism that pushes us forward. We will infuse our imagination and talents into projects, helping us achieve harmony and peace — not only with others but within ourselves. Also, we’ll believe in fate and karma, letting go of anything or anyone that doesn’t flow with the cosmic waves. Finding serenity in our lives leads us to a state of calmness because no one can activate us. Shielding our aura from negativity is key to having the life we dream of. </p>



<p>And yet, this year, Mars in Pisces brings a reversal of fortune. Ten days after March 3rd’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a>, on March 13th, and in the middle <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Mercury retrograde</a>, Mars links up with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces, challenging the events that are unfolding from the lunar eclipse. We will be able to take action on the story that unfolds, leading to disagreements and conflicts within our inner circle. Once we see who people are beyond the veil, it’ll be hard to make an about-face and forget. Mars in Pisces is a sponge; therefore, it remembers and retains information and memories — the good, the bad, and the ugly. </p>

<p>R29 babes, welcome to the first week of March. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Eclipse season is reaching</a> its peak, and the emotional volume is turning up. Before the main event, though, the sky is fully drenched <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces energy</a>. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, joining <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mercury (currently retrograde)</a>, Venus, and the North Node in this dreamy, intuitive sign. This creates a powerful Pisces stellium right in the middle of eclipse season.</p>



<p>Mars here doesn’t push forward aggressively, it moves through feeling, intuition, and emotional truth. During this six-week transit, motivation may come in waves rather than steady bursts. You might feel more sensitive, spiritually tuned in, or pulled toward rest, creativity, or emotional processing. The lesson is to move with your energy, not against it. In a season this watery, forcing productivity will only lead to burnout. Listening to your intuition is the real power move.</p>



<p>Then comes the main event. On March 3rd (3/3) — a numerological powerhouse and so-called ascension portal — we experience a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in Virgo. Lunar eclipses are emotionally intense, and this one shines a spotlight on control, perfectionism, and the pressure to hold everything together. While the recent Aquarius solar eclipse asked you to break free and think bigger, this Virgo eclipse asks the harder question: what are you still gripping tightly out of fear? Wherever you’re trying to micromanage outcomes, expect life to loosen your grip. This isn’t punishment, it’s recalibration. If anxiety rises, take it as information about where you’re overextended or running on empty. This is a powerful moment to ask for help, delegate, rest, and release the belief that you have to do everything alone.</p>



<p>Just a few days later, the emotional waters get a spark of fire. On March 6th, Venus enters Aries, shifting the relational tone from reflective to bold. After weeks of deep feeling and nostalgia, this transit brings a fresh wave of confidence, desire, and initiative in love, creativity, and self-worth. You may feel more willing to go after what you want instead of waiting for signs. The shadow? Aries energy can lean impulsive, impatient, or a little me-first. The medicine is balance: honor your needs without bulldozing someone else’s. In a sky full of Pisces softness, this fiery shift is energizing, reminding you that after the emotional release of eclipse week, it’s safe to move forward again… this time with your heart and your courage aligned.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your ruling planet Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, shifting your energy inward for the next six weeks. Instead of your usual go-go-go momentum, you may feel slower, more sensitive, or less motivated to push forward aggressively. That’s not a problem, it’s the point. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and the North Node also in Pisces, this is a powerful period for spiritual healing, rest, therapy, meditation, and honest emotional processing. If your body asks for more sleep or your intuition tells you to pause, listen. The more you work with<em> </em>this quieter energy instead of fighting it, the more clarity and strength you’ll build for the next chapter.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo activates your health, wellness, and daily routine sector, bringing a serious reality check. This eclipse can spotlight burnout, anxiety, or habits that are quietly draining you. If you’ve been ignoring your body’s signals, they may get louder now. Think practical care: schedule that physical, dental visit, or mental health check-in you’ve been postponing. Small changes to your routine, hydration, sleep, movement, boundaries at work, will go further than dramatic overhauls. Virgo energy isn’t about perfection. It’s about sustainable care, one manageable step at a time.</p>



<p>The mood lifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, putting you back in the spotlight. After weeks of emotional processing, your confidence and magnetism return, and people notice. This is a powerful time for attraction, style upgrades, dating, and going after what (or who) you want. You’re glowing. Just be mindful of the shadow of Venus in Aries: moving too fast or sending mixed signals because you’re excited by the attention. Be clear about your intentions and lead with honesty. When you combine this new confidence with emotional clarity, you become a powerful magnet for the kind of love and opportunities you actually want.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the energy this week turns your attention toward your social world as Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, activating your friendship, community, and technology zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and Venus (your ruling planet) already in Pisces, this part of your life is under deep review. You may feel motivated to reconnect with certain friends, step back from draining group dynamics, or rethink how much time you spend online. Old connections could resurface, while others may fade naturally. Let this be a period of intentional alignment. Your circle is shifting to match the person you’re becoming, and your energy belongs where it feels emotionally safe and mutually supportive.</p>



<p>On March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lands in your fellow earth element, activating your realm of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing. This eclipse can bring a turning point in dating, a creative project, or a situation involving children or personal passions. Something may reach a culmination, transformation, or emotional truth point. The challenge here is control. Virgo energy wants to fix or manage the outcome, but eclipses ask for surrender. If something shifts or ends, trust that it’s clearing space for a more authentic expression of love and happiness.</p>



<p>The tone turns inward on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, moving your ruling planet into your spirituality and healing zone for the next four weeks. After the social intensity of Pisces season, you may crave more solitude, rest, and emotional privacy. This is a powerful period for therapy, creative reflection, spiritual practices, or simply stepping back from constant stimulation. Think of it as a quiet reset for your heart. The more you honor your need for peace now, the more magnetic and grounded you’ll feel when Venus returns to your sign next.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, your public life and long-term direction take center stage as Mars enters Pisces on March 2nd, activating your career and reputation zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this area of your life is under deep reflection rather than fast expansion. You may feel motivated to pursue a goal, but progress could come through revising, reconnecting, or rethinking rather than launching something brand new. Old professional opportunities or unfinished projects may resurface. Move intuitively and stay flexible. Right now, alignment matters more than speed.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major emotional moment around home, family, or your living situation. This fellow Mercury-ruled energy can feel intense, especially if you’ve been juggling career demands with personal needs. Something around your emotional foundation may need to shift, whether that’s a boundary with family, a living arrangement, or simply acknowledging burnout. The key is to release the pressure to hold everything together perfectly. Ask for support where you need it and give yourself permission to rest.</p>



<p>The energy lightens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your friendship and community zone for the next four weeks. After a heavy focus on responsibilities, this brings a refreshing social boost. You may feel more outgoing, inspired by your network, or ready to collaborate on shared goals. It’s a great time to reconnect with friends, expand your circle, or show up more confidently online. Just be mindful of overcommitting. Choose connections that energize you, not ones that drain your already busy mind.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, the emotional waters deepen in a way that actually feels supportive this week. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your expansion, travel, learning, and big-picture vision zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, you may feel pulled toward spiritual growth, journaling, therapy, study, or revisiting a dream you once put on hold. Instead of rushing into a brand-new direction, let this be a period of intuitive recalibration. The path forward is becoming clearer, but it’s unfolding through reflection, not force.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your communication and mental health zone. This can feel like emotional overload if your schedule, inbox, or daily obligations have been piling up. A conversation may reach a turning point, or you may realize you’ve been carrying too much mental responsibility alone. Virgo energy here is asking you to simplify. Prioritize fewer things, say no where needed, and give your nervous system space to reset. Not every message needs an immediate reply, and not every problem is yours to solve.</p>



<p>The mood shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your career and visibility zone for the next four weeks. After a reflective start to the month, this brings a welcome boost of confidence and recognition. You may feel more motivated to go after a professional opportunity, advocate for yourself, or step into a leadership role. Just watch the shadow of this transit: moving too fast or taking on more than your energy can sustain. Lead boldly, but stay emotionally grounded. When your ambition and intuition work together, your presence becomes magnetic.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week pulls your energy inward in a way that may feel unfamiliar but ultimately empowering. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this is less about external momentum and more about emotional and financial recalibration. You may be revisiting conversations around boundaries, debts, investments, or the give-and-take in close relationships. Old feelings or trust issues could resurface, not to derail you, but to be processed and released. Move slowly here. This is deep emotional housekeeping, not a race.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major reality check around money, self-worth, and sustainability. This eclipse may highlight where you’ve been overworking, overspending, or tying your value to productivity or external validation. Virgo energy asks for practical care: budgeting, simplifying expenses, and creating systems that actually support your long-term stability. If anxiety shows up, treat it as information about where your foundation needs strengthening, not as a sign that something is wrong.</p>



<p>The energy lifts on March 6th, when Venus enters fellow Fire sign of Aries, activating your expansion, travel, and adventure zone for the next four weeks. After the emotional depth of early March, this transit brings fresh confidence, optimism, and a desire to say yes to new experiences. You may feel inspired to travel, learn something new, or take a bold step toward a bigger vision for your life. Just watch the impulsive side of this energy. Excitement is great, but thoughtful action will take you much further than rushing ahead.</p>

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, the spotlight is intense this week, and it’s asking you to balance sensitivity with self-protection. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your partnership zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, relationships are under deep review. You may feel heightened emotions with a partner, collaborator, or close friend, or find yourself revisiting old conversations and expectations. This isn’t the time to force clarity or make ultimatums. Move slowly, listen to your intuition, and allow dynamics to reveal what’s sustainable and what isn’t.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in your sign brings a powerful personal turning point. Lunar eclipses in your sign can feel emotional and physically draining, as if the universe is asking you to release the pressure to hold everything together perfectly. You may suddenly recognize where you’re burned out, overextended, or trying to control outcomes that are no longer yours to manage. Prioritize rest, hydration, and nervous system care. This eclipse is less about doing more and more about letting go of what your body and spirit can’t carry anymore.</p>



<p>The energy shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your intimacy and shared resources zone for the next four weeks. After such a personal release, this transit brings opportunities for deeper emotional connection, financial collaboration, or healing within close bonds. You may feel more open to vulnerability, but be mindful of rushing emotional or financial commitments too quickly. Let trust build gradually. When you move at a steady pace, this period can strengthen both your relationships and your sense of security.</p>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, the emotional tone of the week asks you to slow your pace and listen to what your body and spirit have been trying to tell you. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your wellness, work, and daily routine zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your schedule, energy levels, and work-life balance are under review. You may feel more sensitive to stress, workplace dynamics, or the way your daily habits affect your mental health. Instead of pushing through, this is a time to simplify, rest where possible, and rebuild routines that actually support your well-being.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your rest, closure, and subconscious zone, bringing emotional material to the surface. This eclipse can feel heavy if you’ve been carrying anxiety, unresolved feelings, or burnout beneath the surface. Think of it as a release valve. Prioritize sleep, quiet time, and space away from overstimulation. If something feels overwhelming, it’s likely a sign you’ve been holding too much on your own. Let this be a moment of emotional clearing rather than trying to stay productive at all costs.</p>



<p>The energy shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your partnership zone for the next four weeks. After the inward focus of early March, this transit brings renewed momentum in relationships. You may attract attention, feel more direct about your needs, or experience fresh energy with a partner or collaborator. Just be mindful of the shadow of Venus in Aries: impatience or reacting quickly instead of responding thoughtfully. When you balance honesty with consideration, this period can bring exciting new movement in your connections.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week brings a shift from emotional intensity into something lighter and more life-giving. On March 2nd, Mars enters fellow Water sign of Pisces, activating your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, you may feel inspired to reconnect with what actually makes you happy, not what you think you should be doing. Old passions, creative ideas, or even people from the past could resurface. Let yourself play, flirt with new possibilities, and follow what feels emotionally energizing rather than forcing productivity.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo activates your friendship and community zone, bringing a turning point within your social circle or long-term goals. You may realize you’ve outgrown certain dynamics, taken on too much responsibility for others, or been stretching your energy too thin trying to keep everyone happy. Virgo energy asks you to be honest about where your time and emotional labor are going. If a group situation shifts or a connection fades, trust that it’s creating space for more aligned support.</p>



<p>The mood turns more focused on daily life when Venus enters Aries on March 6th, activating your work, health, and routine sector for the next four weeks. This transit brings motivation to get your life organized, improve your habits, or take a more proactive approach to your physical well-being. Just watch the shadow of this fiery energy: doing too much too fast and burning yourself out. Small, consistent actions will take you further than an all-or-nothing approach. Balance discipline with the playfulness Pisces season is encouraging.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week pulls your energy inward, asking you to focus less on the outside world and more on your emotional foundation. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your home, family, and inner stability zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, this area of life is under deep reflection. You may feel more sensitive to your environment, revisiting family dynamics, living situations, or the emotional patterns that shape your sense of security. Instead of pushing outward for new adventures, this is a time to strengthen your roots and create a space, physically and emotionally, that actually supports you.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a major turning point in your career and public life. Something around your responsibilities, reputation, or long-term direction may reach a culmination or reality check. If you’ve been overworking, carrying too much pressure, or trying to meet everyone’s expectations, this eclipse may reveal where adjustments are needed. Virgo energy here is about sustainable success, not burnout. Focus on what’s essential and release the pressure to do everything perfectly.</p>



<p>The mood shifts on March 6th, when Venus enters fellow fire sign Aries, activating your romance, creativity, and joy sector for the next four weeks. After the emotional heaviness of early March, this transit brings a welcome spark of fun, confidence, and playfulness. You may feel more flirtatious, inspired, or ready to say yes to experiences that light you up. Just be mindful of impulsiveness or chasing excitement without considering the follow-through. When you balance spontaneity with intention, this energy can reignite your passion for life.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the pace of life picks up mentally and emotionally this week, but the key is not trying to manage everything at once. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your communication, learning, and daily logistics zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your mind may feel busy but not always linear. Conversations, plans, or short-term projects may need revisiting rather than pushing forward. Old emails, unfinished ideas, or past contacts could resurface. Move slowly, double-check details, and give yourself extra time to process before committing.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a turning point around your long-term vision, travel plans, education, or belief systems. You may realize that a path you’ve been pursuing isn’t sustainable, or that your goals need refinement to match your current reality. Virgo energy here asks for practical alignment rather than blind ambition. If something shifts or gets delayed, treat it as a course correction, not a failure.</p>



<p>The emotional tone softens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your home and emotional foundation zone for the next four weeks. This transit encourages you to focus on comfort, personal space, and the relationships that make you feel safe. You may feel motivated to refresh your living environment or spend more time with family. Just watch the shadow of this energy: reacting quickly to emotional triggers. Creating stability now comes from slowing down, not trying to control every outcome.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week brings your focus back to the basics, but in a way that asks for emotional honesty, not just practical strategy. On March 2nd, Mars enters Pisces, activating your money, self-worth, and values zone for the next six weeks. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a>, Venus, and the North Node already in Pisces, your finances and your relationship to security are under review. Motivation around earning or stabilizing your resources may come in waves, but progress now comes from reassessing, not rushing. Old income ideas, pricing structures, or financial conversations could resurface. Move slowly and make decisions based on what feels sustainable, not just urgent.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo brings a deeper emotional turning point around shared resources, debts, or energetic entanglements. This eclipse may reveal where you’ve been overextending yourself financially or emotionally, or where a dependency dynamic needs to shift. Virgo energy asks for clarity, boundaries, and practical solutions rather than avoidance. If something feels intense, focus on what you can organize, repay, renegotiate, or release.</p>



<p>The energy lightens on March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, activating your communication and social zone for the next four weeks. After the heavier financial and emotional themes, this transit brings confidence in your voice and a desire to reconnect, share ideas, and move more freely in your day-to-day interactions. Just be mindful of speaking impulsively or reacting too quickly. When you combine honesty with a little patience, this period can open doors through conversations you’re brave enough to initiate.</p>

With Mercury retrograde, this is a time to recalibrate your identity, your direction, and even how you present yourself. If your energy feels inconsistent, that’s your cue to rest, reset, and move only when something truly feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on March 3rd, the Full Moon Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo lights up your partnership zone, bringing relationship truths to the surface. Lunar eclipses reveal what’s out of balance, and this one may highlight where you’ve been overgiving, overfixing, or holding yourself to impossible standards in your connections.

<p>After more than 10 years in beauty, I’m usually the go-to for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare recommendations</a> in my friendship circle. But if the past few months are anything to go by, they’ve been the ones schooling me, because lately, there’s only one brand on their lips — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fbrand%2Fmedicube"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">and it’s Medicube</a>. </p>



<p>Skincare enthusiasts — or anyone whose thumbs are never far from their TikTok feed — probably already know (and love) the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare brand</a>, which launched in South Korea in 2017. But it’s managed to cut through the noise (read: the tens of other brilliant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aestura-atobarrier-365-cream-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean brands</a> that have also made their way into <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ulta Beauty</a> and <a href=""https://amzn.to/4rFMdiR"">on Amazon</a>) to become one of the most talked-about and exciting names in the space. No, really. At a recent Medicube event, I’ve never seen my fellow editors more intrigued by a brand — specifically the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED Booster</a>. (They didn’t care that they were wearing makeup; the handy red-light tool went straight on their faces.) </p>



<p>With spring right around the corner, my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> was in need of a complete overhaul, so I swapped everything out for a full collection from Medicube. Here are all the products I’d recommend. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore Pad, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961481.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is one of Medicube’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top-reviewed products at Ulta</a> and the one I was most excited to try. First off, I love that it comes with a handy pair of tweezers, which makes light work of picking up each pad — a very helpful addition if you have long nails like I do. The pads themselves — 70 of them, by the way — are soaked in two exfoliating acids. </p>



<p>First up, 4.5% lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that exfoliates the top layer of skin. This gentle acid makes skin smoother and brighter over time by chipping away at dead skin cells and fading hyperpigmentation. Besides exfoliating, it also boosts hydration. Then there’s 0.45% salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). While also gentle, it seeps deeper into pores, breaking up the paste-like mix of oil and dead skin that contributes to pimples. One side of the pad is smooth, while the other is slightly rougher for manual exfoliation.</p>



<p>Happily, because the acids are relatively low in concentration, the pads don’t sting, even on my reactive skin, and they can be used daily. I’ve been using them for over three weeks at night, and I realized they really worked magic on my skin when I caught myself in my apartment mirror one evening and saw my skin literally glinting under the warm light. It’s a lot clearer and smoother, too. One thing I’m not sold on is the name. Pores are completely normal — you can’t shrink them or get rid of them. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-collagen-gel-mask-pimprod2053540"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Collagen Gel Mask, $19.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961478.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>These masks spotlight one of K-beauty’s most promising ingredients: PDRN. Without turning this into a biology lesson, it stands for polydeoxyribonucleotide — essentially DNA derived from salmon. Research suggests PDRN can <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11994882/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">help regenerate skin tissue</a>, promoting healing, reducing inflammation, and increasing collagen, the protein that keeps skin strong and supple. </p>



<p>I’ve been using one mask a week for a month, and the main difference I’ve noticed is how much more hydrated and juicy my skin looks afterwards — so much so that I don’t feel the need to follow with any other skincare. If you’re after that “glass” effect, this will definitely help you get there. I also love watching the mask shift from pink to transparent, a sign that your skin has drunk up all the goodness. Beyond the hydration boost, it’s simply a nice, relaxing ritual. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcollagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream, $22</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961507.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is my new favorite AM and PM moisturizer. As for the texture, the clue is in the name — it’s a transparent jelly rather than a gel-cream. I underestimated it, convinced it wouldn’t be enough to quench my thirsty cheeks and occasionally flaky forehead, plus keep pimples at bay, but my skin always feels smooth, hydrated, and comfortable. </p>



<p>It takes a second to stop feeling tacky, but the finish is matte, and it makes the perfect makeup primer. While I don’t necessarily believe topical collagen can boost your own supply, I do know it’s a fantastic hydrator — especially alongside moisturizing squalane and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oil-reducing niacinamide</a>. </p>



<p>I use this everywhere: under my eyes like eye cream, down my neck, and on the backs of my hands. I’m also really impressed by how much you get for the price. The tub houses an impressive 110ml of product. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-sa-clear-capsule-facial-deep-cleanser-pimprod2054911%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore SA Clear Capsule Facial Deep Cleanser, $16.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961480.jpg?width=996&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=249%3A256"" /></figure>



<p>I’ve gone through two of these cleansers in recent months, and I’m almost certain my skin is clearer because of it. Like the Zero Pore Pads, it contains exfoliating acids — salicylic and mandelic — both of which help unclog pores and gradually fade post-acne marks. While it also contains tiny exfoliating particles, they’re very soft, and I barely notice them.</p>



<p>Happily, the second ingredient on the list is glycerin, a deeply moisturizing humectant, so it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. Since it’s a foaming face wash, I only use it in the evening after removing makeup with micellar water. In the morning, I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prefer something creamy and gentle</a> to avoid stripping my skin. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-peptide-serum-pimprod2053536"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961508.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>If you really want to maximize the benefits of PDRN, this gentle daily serum is your best bet over a one-and-done face mask (though the mask is undeniably fun). Alongside PDRN, it contains no fewer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">five peptides</a> — short chains of amino acids that form the building blocks of proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep skin bouncy. </p>



<p>The inclusion of palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is what makes it stand out. Together, they’re often dubbed “Botox in a bottle” and can help smooth skin texture over time. Since slotting it into my routine, I’m convinced my forehead lines look less obvious — at least to my eye. The matte finish helps, too, and means makeup glides on like a dream. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbooster-pro-pimprod2053433%3Fsku%3D2645355"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Booster Pro, $220</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961503.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This tool has all my beauty editor peers talking. There are four modes in total. First up, Booster Mode, which gently vibrates to help your skin better absorb your chosen moisturizer or serum. Second, MC Mode, which uses low-level microcurrent technology to stimulate facial muscles, giving skin a temporary “lift.” Third, Derma Shot Mode, which uses red <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED light</a> to encourage healing and support elasticity. Lastly, Air Shot Mode is designed to refine texture and pores. Personally, I don’t think it’s strong enough to actually exfoliate, but it does feel like a refreshing cool shot — especially nice if your skin gets inflamed or red after cleansing. </p>



<p>The catch? Consistency is key. You’ll only see results if you stick with it. I like to use the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red and blue light modes</a> for five to 10 minutes at a time when I have large hormonal pimples. I’m convinced it helps reduce their size and ease the soreness. </p>

<p>We’re diving into the biggest handbag trends that we’re seeing translate from the runways to our favorite stores and the streets.<br /><br />Looking to both the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">Spring/Summer 2026</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Fall/Winter 2026 collections</a> that debuted across global fashion weeks, we’ve narrowed down the most prominent handbag styles on showcase. For the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hilary-duff-nostalgia-concert-tour"">nostalgia lovers</a>, 2016-esque chain bags are having a major moment. For the those with traditional-with-a-twist aesthetics, undone-yet-ladylike bags are in. And for those who could never understand how people carry mini bags, spacious bowling bags are a popular choice.<br /><br />All of these trends build on our up-to-the-minute dispatch on the runway trends that we saw at Winter 2026 New York Fashion Week, as well as our forecasting of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">top 2026 color trends</a>, best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">denim silhouettes</a>, and emerging <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">shoe styles</a> to step into throughout the year.<br /><br />Ahead, see the purse shapes, fabrics, hardware, and colorways that some of our favorite designers have sent down their runways — cementing them as the handbag trends we’ll be seeing (and wearing) all year long.  </p>

<h2>2016 Is Back &amp; So Are Chain-Strap Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960941.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The mass nostalgia for 2016 is also infiltrating today’s fashion scene, and quickly. “Crossbody bags defined this era,” creative director and celebrity stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/scotlouie/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scot Louie</a> tells Refinery29. “Think: The Gucci Marmont and Dionysus, the Chanel Boy Bag, Valentino Rockstud… Bags from this era are tied to a moment when fashion felt expressive, visible, and communal, which is why they resonate again now.”<br /><br />Also of note? These bags all feature chain straps. And while chain-strap handbags have never really left Chanel’s runway (yes, they were prominent at the <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/chanel-spring-2026-couture-1238526043/chanel-spring-2026-couture-56/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2026 Spring Couture show</a> just weeks ago), more brands are embracing the old-school style, too. From Valentino’s chunky shoulder bags and Chloe’s frilly leather pouches to Stella McCartney’s XL totes and Ferragamo’s oblong clutches, chain straps are popping up across your favorite brands and on all types of bags.<br /><br />Why the nostalgia push? Self-declared Chief Bag Officer and creator of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/y2kbags/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@y2kbags Instagram account</a>, Alejandro V has a simple explanation: “All of us who once aspired to wear those designer pieces now actually have the means to purchase them — hence why the 2016 aesthetic has come roaring back in rapid-fire fashion!” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Under-Arm Candy: Oversized Clutches</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960945.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Keep your shoulders free from the weight of your belongings and instead opt for an oversized clutch that can comfortably nestle under your arm. Many models carried these bags during the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, though the details varied. Designers are leveraging luxe leather, feathers and fringe, and belted and buckled silhouettes to update your typical <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">wedding guest</a> clutch. In other words, they aren’t exclusively meant for eveningwear attire.<br /><br />“Holding onto something so precious just feels fabulous and chic,” says Alejandro V. “I truly believe clutches are forever and should never go out of style — but I’m very happy they’re having a major comeback moment.” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Woven Leather Bags (All Year Long) </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960948.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/woven-bag-baskets"">Woven leather bags</a> seem to peek out of people’s wardrobes in the spring and summer, so there’s no doubt that they’ll be everywhere again when the weather gets warmer. The most recent Fashion Month, however, has made a case for the versatility and timelessness of this high-quality style.<br /><br />“The Bottega Veneta influence here is undeniable,” notes Alejandro V. “From Daniel Lee to Matthieu Blazy, they did an incredible job reintroducing this silhouette and reminding people how timeless it really is. We’re at a point where consumers understand that great design can live forever.” <br /><br />Louie agrees — though he notes that the target market is shifting slightly, too. “There will also be more emphasis on men wearing bags, which continues to shift how these silhouettes are styled and perceived,” he said, giving a particular shoutout to a certain movie star and noted Bottega Veneta lover. “Thank you Jacob Elordi.”<br /><br />A woven bag — whether finished in leather or suede, and shaped as an oversized shoulder bag, utilitarian tote, or a trend-forward bucket bags — can tag along for nearly any activity. (I personally wear a woven suede tote as my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-bags-for-women"">work bag</a> throughout the year!) “You can dress it up or down, and there’s even the idea of passing it on someday as a family heirloom,” Alejandro V suggests. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Unzipped “Ladylike” Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960943.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">“ladylike” trend</a> as a whole re-emerged in 2025, the ladylike bag specifically will shine in 2026, top handles and all. There’s a crucially modern update at play, however: The traditionally dainty style (typically featuring a single strap or handle) is now being reimagined with unzipped, unclasped, and undone details.<br /><br />“I think this ties back to the [Hermès] Kelly being such an eternal icon — the ultimate single-strap, ladylike bag,” explains Alejandro V. More signature styles like the Dior Lady Bag have new interpretations too, like the <a href=""https://www.dior.com/en_us/fashion/news-fashion-shows/folder-news-and-events/dior-cigale-bag"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cigale bag</a>. You’ll also find the unfastened, single-strap style across Loewe, Fendi, and Toteme’s collections.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>(Non-Leopard) Animal Print Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960940.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Animal prints</a> will likely never go out of style, but there are points when they’re especially in vogue. Such patterns have been all over the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, most frequently presented through handbags. Even more interestingly, leopard print isn’t the most popular choice Instead, zebra and tiger prints, snakeskin, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cowhide</a> dotted several designers’ collections — and they’re far more versatile than you may think.<br /><br />“Most animal prints are basically neutrals,” Alejandro V notes. “You can wear tiger and zebra print with almost anything! Cheetah, obviously. Or giraffe print à la early Dooney &amp; Bourke.” Typically available in neutral color palettes, these prints can be paired with your favorite wardrobe stapes to add a pop to any outfit.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>From The Office To The Alley: Doctor &amp; Bowling Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960942.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Spacious and structured handbags have solidified themselves as the trend of all trends to carry around. On the runways, they’ve predominately popped up in leather, suede, and even snakeskin variations, and silhouettes ranging from the professional-looking house <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-summer-2025"">doctor style</a> to the sportier <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-spring-2025"">bowling bag</a>.<br /><br />These boxy and/or bulbous bags are perfect for all-day wear, though they’re particularly useful as your work bag. “These bags fit everything—and then some,” says Alejandro V. “A book, an iPad, a Hydro Flask… it’s truly the perfect chic little schlep bag without feeling overwhelmingly massive.” In other words, gone are the days of mini bags (though we’re sure that won’t last very long). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Playful Pastel Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960946.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>There isn’t just one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">trending color</a> that will cement itself as a 2026 handbag must-have. Instead, a rainbow of pretty pastels will be taking over. Expect to find <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellows</a>, baby pinks, mint greens, lilac purples, and frosted blues across every handbag category (including in some of the trending styles seen above ). See: The pale yellow cylindrical shoulder bags at Coach; the pink, purple, and blue pouches at Prada; as well as the pink lady bags and yellow quilted chain bags at Dior.<br /><br />Pastel purses will no doubt make their biggest presence during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-roller-rabbit-collaboration-lookbook-shop"">the spring months</a>, but they can also add unexpected brightness to fall and winter outfits that need a bit of cheering up. </p>

(L to R) Devonta Anderson, Brittany Wicker in episode 1008 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of the most popular topics of discussion on the internet is the “<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-kaleidescope/202507/is-male-loneliness-a-new-epidemic-or-an-age-old-struggle"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Male Loneliness Epidemic.</a>”  Many refer to it as the reason we have  <a href=""https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/alpha-male-podcast-bros-and-their-grip-on-young-minds/163897/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Alpha male” podcasts</a> and an increasing number of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red pill-type content targeted towards Gen Z</a> and Gen Alpha young boys. Women are noticing that the men they date are participating in and exhibiting behaviors that make them very unlikeable and undatable. Loneliness is a serious subject, but when paired with misogyny and contempt towards women, it has become a punchline. When a woman posts about a bad dating experience or a <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/i-love-my-husband-who-hates-me.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wife posts about</a> her careless and clueless husband, the jokes ensue. After each of these instances, I think the same thing:<em> straight men are simply not lonely enough. </em>The bar is on the floor, and these men can’t even meet that low standard. Maybe loneliness is what they deserve. </p>



<p>Watching this season of<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11854927/love-is-blind-season-8-diversity"">Love is Blind</a>,</em> I am beginning to understand the male loneliness epidemic more and more. In the last batch of episodes of the dating reality series, I watched these men unravel and say things to their fiancées that were deeply concerning. The humiliation ritual masquerading as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-is-blind-couples"">reality show</a> that we all binge-watch with glee is back with <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/love-is-blind-season-10-cast-instagrams"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Season 10, set in Ohio.</a> As <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2023/04/11340331/love-is-blind-4-couples-therapy"">Love Is Blind</a> </em>grows, there is always the question: “Are these people here for the right reasons?” I think there are better questions like, “are these men ready for commitment at all?”, “are they truly ready to let another person into their lives?”, and “are they willing to actually do the work it takes in a relationship?” For all of the aforementioned questions, the answer is giving a glaring no. Don’t they know this show is supposed to end in marriage?  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-season-10-keya-kevan-tyler-love-triangle-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kevan is a great example</a> of someone who is not ready for the commitment that this experiment requires. His indecisiveness puts him in a love triangle with Tyler and Keya. In Episode 4 during the pods (the part of the series where couples are not allowed to see each others’ faces yet), Kevan says that he needs to “do the mature decision,” because he wants the “best for everybody” and “doesn’t want to let anybody down,” which made me roll my eyes and wish he would make up his mind. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Overall, the men on this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">podcast </a><em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">What’s the Reality</a></em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">? </a>with<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ad-love-is-blind-red-flags""> LIB Season 6 contestant AD</a>, Tyler revealed that what we didn’t see was Kevan’s admission that he was not ready to be married, and saying that if he were her, he would run. So, she did. All of Kevan’s flakiness led both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vDBrw6KIgE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tyler and Keya to leave him</a> in the pods. Throughout those episodes, Kevan seemed like he just didn’t want to lose the game he was playing. </p>



<p>In the pods, Emma was very vocal about <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/love-is-blinds-emma-addresses-awkward-kid-talk-with-mikes-parents-excl/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">not wanting kids</a>, but her fiancé, Mike, kept trying to convince her she would be a great mom. He even explained this to her family by using the nonsensical analogy that if she can take care of a puppy, she can take care of a baby. This man should be alone until he can listen to a woman’s choices and respect them.  It was baffling when, in the same scene, Mike said he was open to what Emma wants, then backtracked and said having kids was non-negotiable. If it was so important to him, he should not have proposed to Emma. Mike said he was really banking on Emma her changing her mind and that he thought he could be the one to change it, if she could just see his “passion for wanting kids.” This is disrespectful to her wishes and a waste of both of their time.  <strong>  </strong></p>



<p>In true <em>Love Is Blind </em>fashion, many couples are having issues revolving around their physical appearances and the men feeling disappointed that the women they chose are not their “type.” We’ve seen this before on <em>Love is Blind</em>. We saw it in Season 2 with Shake &amp; Deepti and in Season 3 with Bartise &amp; Nancy. Of course, we know that people are human and physical attractiveness does matter in a relationship, but the show is called LOVE IS <em>BLIND</em>. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961368.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. Alex Henderson in episode 1008 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>This season, this dilemma plagues three couples: Brittany and Devonta, Ashley and Alex, and Jessica and Chris. Brittany consistently told Devonta she didn’t feel secure in their relationship because he was not physically and verbally affectionate. He excused the distance by saying he was dealing with the death of his grandfather (who <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427931/love-is-blind-season-10-why-devonta-broke-no-phones-rule-in-pods"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">passed while the show was being filmed</a>). But Devonta also revealed that Brittany is not his physical “type” and that he has never dated a woman of color. Brittany is Black and Latina. When I interviewed Brittany, I asked how she felt watching the episodes back and hearing how Devonta felt about her and she said that in the back of her mind she felt Devonte’s distaste towards her.  Don’t worry girl, we could all feel it too. Devonta seems to be a self-hating mess and should be in therapy, not on reality TV. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The worst man of all is Chris. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Ohio, Ashley told <a href=""https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/02/25/love-is-blind-alex-henderson-donald-trump-vote/88707804007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">self-proclaimed Trump supporter</a> and alleged<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindNetflix/comments/1r8bj6t/i_think_alex_is_a_con_man/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> scammer Alex</a> that their intimacy was lacking. She brought up that they had not been intimate since arriving home from Mexico. He told her he was the one who initiated physical intimacy in Cabo and that now it was her turn. He then went on to say he was unaware that he could initiate sex with her while she is on her period. AGAIN, MEN AREN’T LONELY ENOUGH. Alex spends a majority of Episode 10 gaslighting Ashley because he can’t keep his story about his past exes straight. While Alex reassured Ashley that he is attracted to her, he told her to her face that she is not his typical “type” which is a horrible thing to repeatedly tell your partner. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961381.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. (L to R) Chris Fusco, Jessica Barrett in episode 1009 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>The worst man of all is Chris. By now, you’ve probably seen <a href=""https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/love-is-blind-chris-fusco-crossfit/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the scene that has gone viral</a>. It shows Chris sitting across from his partner Jessica, a doctor, and telling her that he is not attracted to her because <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/chris-tells-jessica-hes-used-to-dating-women-who-work-out-all-the-time/1393006055935790/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she doesn’t work out enough</a>. The audacity of this man. In the scene, Chris says to Jessica that he is not enjoying their sex life because he’s, “used to girls who do Pilates every day.” Mind you, in my opinion, Chris is a short five (and that’s being generous) with tiny hands, and Jessica is a hot doctor. </p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Chris also tells Jessica that he might be happier with Bri because he is more attracted to her. The more he explains himself as the episode goes on, the more openly disrespectful he becomes toward Jessica. He even loudly confesses to Bri and the other girls that Jessica was the worst sex he has ever had. Later in the evening, Chris even makes a sad attempt at reconciling with Jessica. He continously tries to get her to know he wasn’t trying to be mean all the while not understanding why what he said was so hurtful. Chris deserves worse than loneliness.  </p>



<p>Overall, the men in this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. The <em>Love Is Blind </em>casting directors need to find men who actually <em>like</em> women. We live in a time when <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/07/trump-spurs-global-rollback-rights-women-and-girls"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">women’s rights are being stripped </a>away, when <a href=""https://counciloncj.org/new-analysis-shows-8-increase-in-u-s-domestic-violence-incidents-following-pandemic-stay-at-home-orders/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">domestic violence is on the rise</a>, and when even in our highest moments, we <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/25/distasteful-joke-us-hockey-star-hilary-knight-responds-to-trump-comments-on-womens-team"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">become the butt of the joke</a>. At the very least, we want to be able to enjoy our silly dating reality show without having to watch men degrade and disrespect the women they supposedly love.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Watching this season, it feels as though the men would rather treat the women more like experiments than human beings. They expect the women to bend, break, and mold themselves into who they want them to be, instead of seeing them for who they are and accepting the women they spent time getting to know in the pods. These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. I would rather all of them just tell the truth and say, “This is not for me. I have some work to do.”   </p>



<p>At the end of these episodes, it is clear these men are not ready for marriage, for falling in love at all, or for considering their partners’ needs and wants. We have one more week before the wedding episodes and I hope Emma, Ashley, and Brittany follow Jessica, Keya, and Tyler’s lead and run for the hills!  There may be a male loneliness epidemic, but Season 10 of <em>Love Is Blind</em> is proving that maybe men are not nearly lonely enough. </p>
