<p>Rejoice! As we enter Pisces season, we’re also getting closer to spring. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">From February 18th to March 20th</a>, the sun will be splashing around in the enigmatic water sign of Pisces, heightening our intuition, and creativity. This year, Pisces season brings wisdom, reflection, and a lot of wildness in between. Things are going to get messy, so prepare for the drama-of-it-all. Before we get sea sick from the rapid changes, it’s important to learn how to flow with ease through the turbulent waters ahead. Luckily, the stars and planets will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">help us predict the journey</a>.</p>



<p>In previous years, Saturn and Neptune have added restriction and paranoia to the mix when the sun was in Pisces. Now, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn and Neptune are in Aries</a>, still stirring up problems, but not making us insecure and unsure about the road ahead. February 20th brings the conjunction of the two, urging us to pursue our dreams at any cost — even if it means hurting others in the process. We aren’t going to stand idly by and watch situations unfold; we’re going to take an active approach to drive change. We are more confident, aggressive, tenacious, and tougher than before.</p>



<p>For the first part of the solar return, there will be a stellium in mystical Pisces (the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). We’ll be stubborn in our delusions, only accepting our reality as the correct one, which is problematic. As a result, arguments can ensue, especially if we do not back down. Finding the middle ground is useful; however, it’ll be difficult to understand others when we put our desires first and throw logic out the window. Taking a beat to center our energy requires patience and consideration — sentiments we may be lacking in the heat of the moment. </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde in Pisces begins on February 26th and lasts until March 20th, when the sun ingresses into Aries, and the spring equinox melts the ice away. The Mercurial moonwalk is going to raise our anxieties from the immense miscommunications and frenetic vibes. The universe wants us to go inwards, allowing us to focus on internal healing. Former partners will resurface, promising the world, when they have no intention of staying. Things are feeling intangible, and the wishy-washiness makes us lose our way. Choosing compassion connects us to people and gives us the strength to rise above the tides.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a> on March 3rd keeps our head above water by offering a chance to have a pragmatic approach to resolving matters. The blood moon is letting us see through the darkness, like a lighthouse illuminates the ocean, keeping us afloat. The caveat is that lunar eclipses are fast and furious, so the information being brought to our attention might shake us up, forcing us to make decisions. The retrograde pauses us from being direct or able to cut off the negativity, leaving us riddled with confusion, disillusionment, and frustration. I told you it was going to be chaotic! </p>

<h3>Key Astrological Dates For Pisces Season: </h3>



<p><strong>February 18th:</strong> The sun enters Pisces, making us tender, imaginative, romantic, and sentimental. Our hearts and emotions guide the way forward.</p>



<p><strong>February 20th:</strong> Saturn conjuncts Neptune in Aries, allowing this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon to bring evolution and a metamorphosis on a global level. Outdated systems fall and new ones emerge.</p>



<p><strong>February 26th:</strong> Mercury Retrograde in Pisces commences, bringing travel issues, missed texts or emails, and the revival of old foes or exes for another hurrah (if we let them). </p>



<p><strong>March 2nd:</strong> Mars enters Pisces, pushing us to rebel and assert our views — although, we’ll have a few doubts about what we want to fight for or pursue.</p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> The lunar eclipse in Virgo is a moment of clarity and truth. How we react and deal with the energy will augment and shift our lives. </p>



<p><strong>March 6th: </strong>Venus enters Aries, motivating us to take the lead in relationships and to pursue our dreams.</p>



<p><strong>March 10th:</strong> Jupiter in Cancer ends the retrograde cycle that began on November 11th, 2025. Abundance and luck are coming!</p>



<p><strong>March 18th:</strong> The New Moon in Pisces is an opportunity to manifest our hopes and goals for the new season that comes two days later.</p>

<p>Black hair has a way of carrying everything. Memory. Care. Pressure. Pride. Each ritual rooted in purpose. On this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, the conversation feels less like an interview and more like a collective exhale, as the hosts dig into the rituals, rules, and quiet truths that shape Black women’s hair journeys.</p>



<p>The episode is presented in partnership with <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fbN-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and their Black History Month Collection, which highlights the power, purpose, and intention behind Black founders and the communities that inspire them. The connection is clear in this conversation, which highlights women whose careers are rooted in care, access, and showing up for Black communities in tangible ways.</p>



<p>Beauty founder <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/darealbbjudy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jesseca Dupart</a></strong> brings the perspective of someone who understands hair as both personal and collective. Her approach to building has always extended beyond products. It is about creating tools that help Black women feel confident, supported, and seen, especially in spaces where their needs have historically been overlooked. Her work and products show community impact matters just as much as innovation.</p>



<p>That sense of care and purpose becomes deeply tangible with celebrity hairstylist<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lacy Redway</a></strong>, whose stories blur the line between ritual and profession. Growing up Jamaican, she remembers sitting between her sister’s legs every Sunday as her hair was washed, twisted, and prepped for the week. When the hosts chime in with memories of familiar wash-day routines, the moment feels instantly shared, grounding the conversation in experiences many Black women recognize.</p>



<p>As an adult working across red carpets, magazine covers, and film sets, Redway says that intimacy never disappears. “We’re not just doing hair. We’re creating safety,” she explains, describing the trust required when working with clients in industries where Black hair is still misunderstood or minimized. From editorial shoots to major premieres, she continues to push back against narrow ideas of what is considered professional or feminine, reminding us that textured hair does not need to be tamed to be worthy.</p>



<p>Throughout the episode, the conversation returns to a simple truth. Choice matters. Whether worn natural, braided, relaxed, covered, or completely undone, Black women deserve the freedom to decide how they show up without explanation.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, this week begins in the dark of the moon, and we can all feel it. In the days leading up to the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, emotions run high beneath the surface, even as many people pretend they’re unfazed. This is a charged combination. The Dark Moon is always a liminal space, a threshold where fears, insecurities, and unspoken truths rise up, both personally and collectively. You may notice avoidance, dissociation, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">or emotional numbness</a> as coping mechanisms. The invitation here is honesty, at least with yourself. What are you afraid of losing? Where have you been trying to stay neutral when neutrality no longer feels possible? This is not the week to bypass discomfort. It’s the week to witness it.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse strikes and the Year of the Fire Horse officially begins. This eclipse is electric, disruptive, and unapologetically revolutionary, especially because it squares Uranus, one of Aquarius’ ruling forces. On a collective level, this is volatile energy. Expect an uptick in unrest, protests, system shocks, and visible attempts by entrenched power structures to hold on tighter as their foundations crack. Aquarius eclipses do not negotiate with empires. They expose them. This square makes it clear that staying on the sidelines is no longer an option. Over the next six months, people will be forced to choose where they stand. Comfort, compliance, and silence become increasingly uncomfortable positions to maintain.</p>



<p>And yet, just as the revolution peaks, the cosmos reminds us to keep our hearts open. On February 18th, Pisces Season begins, and the sky fills with a powerful Pisces stellium. The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node all gather in Pisces, creating a countercurrent of compassion, empathy, and spiritual remembrance. This is not weakness. This is medicine. While Aquarius agitates and Aries ignites, Pisces insists that healing, love, and imagination remain central. This stellium asks us to believe in the best-case scenario even when the world feels like it’s cracking. It urges us to grieve what’s ending, tend to collective trauma, and remember that liberation without heart becomes hollow.</p>



<p>The week culminates on February 20th with a rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, a once-in-a-generation alignment that fuses vision with responsibility. On a personal level, this can feel like a calling, a moment where dreams stop being abstract and demand action. Many people will feel compelled to step into leadership, creativity, or courage in new ways. Collectively, this alignment can catalyze the birth of movements, bold initiatives, and new identities rooted in purpose. The shadow is ego inflation, savior complexes, or mistaking impulse for destiny. The higher path is conscious courage: act from integrity, not adrenaline. This week reminds us that revolution isn’t just about tearing down what no longer works. It’s about building what comes next, with intention, imagination, and care.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week opens in the dark of the moon, and for you, this stirs the part of life tied to friendships, communities, and social dynamics. If the vibes have felt oﬀ lately, trust that you’re not imagining it. With Saturn and Neptune now in your sign, you’re more visible than usual, and visibility attracts everything… admiration, curiosity, and yes, sometimes jealousy. As we move through the final days of the Year of the Snake, this is a powerful time to release old alliances, unspoken tensions, or the need to prove yourself within certain circles. You don’t need to confront everything. Quietly choosing distance is just as effective.</p>



<p>Everything resets on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">activates your friendship</a> and community realm. This is a fresh start. Over the next six months, you’ll either deepen bonds with true ride-or-dies or meet people who align with the version of you that’s emerging now. This eclipse can also accelerate your digital visibility. You may feel called to join a new collective, show up more online, or even create your own community or platform. If your circle feels small right now, don’t panic. This eclipse is planting seeds. Trust that the right people will find you as you step forward more authentically.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, inviting you inward for reflection, spiritual integration, and rest. This gentler tone pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in your sign on February 20th, a once-in-a-generation moment of identity transformation. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, while Neptune reminds you to stay connected to hope, imagination, and faith. Together, they mark the beginning of a long chapter where your dreams are no longer abstract. They’re asking to be lived. This week is not about having all the answers. It’s about trusting who you’re becoming and allowing your identity to evolve with intention, courage, and compassion.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this is the kind of week you end up writing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">fifteen-page journal entry</a> about and still feel like you’ve only scratched the surface. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns inward toward your career, reputation, and long-term direction. You may find yourself spiraling a bit, questioning whether the path you’re on is still worth the energy it demands. With the final days of the Year of the Snake wrapping up, this is a release moment. Titles, expectations, or goals that once felt motivating may suddenly feel heavy or outdated. Letting go now isn’t failure, it’s discernment.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which brings an undeniable aha moment around your public life and sense of purpose. This eclipse pushes you toward innovation and authenticity. You may feel inspired to pivot professionally, redefine success, or take a bold step that aligns more closely with your values. Over the next six months, this eclipse can radically change how you show up in the world, especially if you’ve been playing it safe to maintain stability. Growth now requires courage, not comfort.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy softens and shifts toward friendships, networks, and shared visions for the future. You may feel drawn to people who feel emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, or creatively inspiring. This gentler tone pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating a more introspective zone of solitude, healing, and spiritual depth. This is about learning to trust your inner world rather than fear it. Your intuition is strengthening, not to overwhelm you, but to guide you. The more you honor quiet reflection this week, the clearer your next direction becomes.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this is one of those weeks where your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-a-good-sleep-reclaiming-rest"">brain is doing backflips</a> at 2 a.m. and suddenly everything feels <em>philosophical</em>. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, the spotlight turns to your beliefs, future plans, and the big “where am I actually going?” questions. You may feel restless, disillusioned, or torn between multiple paths. That’s not a sign you’re lost — it’s a sign something old is ready to go. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, release outdated narratives about who you’re supposed to be or what success is supposed to look like. You don’t need all the answers yet, just honesty with yourself.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which hits this same realm of growth, travel, education, and long-term vision. This is a genuine reset. Over the next six months, you may say yes to a new direction, commit to learning something transformative, relocate, publish, teach, or radically change your worldview. The square to Uranus means the pivot may come suddenly or feel slightly chaotic at first, but it’s freeing. This eclipse doesn’t want you stuck in analysis paralysis. It wants movement, even if the map isn’t fully drawn yet.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward career, visibility, and your public voice. Your intuition starts guiding professional decisions more than logic alone. This blends powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your community, networks, and long-term goals. You’re learning which dreams are worth committing to and which circles actually support your growth. Spiritually and socially, this is a maturation moment. You’re not here to float between possibilities forever. You’re here to choose a direction that feels meaningful and build toward it with intention.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this is one of those weeks where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your intuition is louder</a> than everyone else’s opinions combined, even if you’re trying to ignore it. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, deep emotional material rises around trust, intimacy, and shared resources. You may feel more sensitive than usual, or suddenly aware of where you’ve been over-giving, over-functioning, or holding emotional weight that isn’t yours to carry. With the Year of the Snake coming to a close, this is a powerful release window. Let go of attachments that drain you, even if part of you feels guilty doing so. Emotional boundaries are the medicine right now.</p>



<p>The breakthrough comes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates a major reset around healing, vulnerability, and energetic exchange. Over the next six months, you may redefine how you share space, money, emotions, or power with others. This eclipse can bring sudden clarity around debts, dependencies, or emotional entanglements that need to be transformed. It’s uncomfortable at first, but ultimately liberating. You’re learning that closeness doesn’t have to mean self-sacrifice, and independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy shifts in your favor, opening a gentler chapter focused on faith, learning, travel, and spiritual expansion. This flows beautifully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which activates your career and life-direction realm. You’re being asked to blend intuition with responsibility and dream with structure. Leadership may feel intimidating, but it’s calling you anyway. This week helps you trust that you can step into visibility without losing your emotional integrity. You’re not meant to hide right now. You’re meant to lead with care.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like the plot twist you didn’t ask for but secretly needed. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your relationships take center stage and not in a casual way. You may feel tension, distance, or emotional uncertainty around partners, close friends, or collaborators. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed relationship dynamics that drain your vitality or keep you performing instead of being real. If something feels off, trust that instinct. You’re not meant to carry connections that dim your light anymore.</p>



<p>The reset arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, landing directly in your relationship realm. This is a big one. Over the next six months, your approach to partnership will radically evolve. New people may enter your life suddenly, or existing relationships may need to renegotiate terms around freedom, equality, and authenticity. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, expect surprises. Not all of them are comfortable, but they are necessary. This eclipse asks you to stop clinging to what looks good on paper and start choosing what actually supports your growth.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward healing, intimacy, and emotional honesty. This pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn– Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your beliefs, values, and long-term vision. You’re learning to balance hope with discernment and passion with wisdom. This week reminds you that true confidence doesn’t come from controlling outcomes. It comes from trusting yourself enough to adapt, grow, and let relationships evolve alongside you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this is one of those weeks where your nervous system knows what your mind is still trying to rationalize. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns to routines, health, work dynamics, and the way you spend your energy day to day. You may notice fatigue, irritation, or a strong urge to clean up systems that feel inefficient or draining. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed habits that keep you busy but not fulfilled. You don’t need to fix everything at once. You just need to be honest about what’s no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets your relationship with work, wellness, and service. Over the next six months, you may change jobs, shift schedules, adopt new health practices, or redefine what productivity actually means for you. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, the changes may feel sudden or disruptive at first, but they’re designed to free you from rigid expectations. This eclipse reminds you that efficiency without alignment <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. You’re allowed to design a life that works for your body and your spirit.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention shifts to your relationships and one-on-one connections. This softer energy blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating deep themes around trust, vulnerability, and shared commitments. You’re learning how to balance discernment with openness. This week encourages you to let others meet you halfway rather than carrying everything yourself. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time. Growth now comes from collaboration, not perfection.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week opens with a subtle but emotionally charged dark of the moon, stirring your creative life, romantic longings, and desire for joy. You may feel strangely restless, uninspired, or unsure about where your passion has gone. That’s not a block, it’s a clearing. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release old narratives around love, attention, and validation. If something no longer feels fun, playful, or heart-expanding, it’s okay to admit that. This is a moment to let go of performative pleasure and reconnect with what genuinely lights you up.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets this same realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the next six months, you’re entering a new chapter around how you love, create, and take up space. This eclipse can spark a sudden romantic development, creative breakthrough, or renewed relationship with your inner child. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, expect surprises. You may feel pushed to take risks emotionally or creatively, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. The lesson here is freedom. You’re learning that joy doesn’t need permission.</p>



<p>The tone changes on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, redirecting attention toward your daily rhythms, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/salary-story-illness-work-life-balance"">work-life balance</a>, and emotional well-being. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating long-term shifts in your partnership and commitment zone. Big relationship themes are unfolding, starting with how you show up for yourself. This week reminds you that sustainable love and creativity come from alignment, not overcompromise. Let pleasure be honest. Let love be real.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week begins with a quiet confrontation between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming. As we move through the dark of the moon, old insecurities tied to home, family, and your emotional roots may resurface. You might notice familiar patterns trying to replay themselves, especially in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This isn’t a setback — it’s a moment of recognition. You’re being shown what no longer deserves repetition. The work here is awareness, not self-judgment. You can’t break a cycle you refuse to name.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates deep shifts around home, belonging, and emotional safety, while squaring Uranus in your partnership zone. This is liberating energy, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over the next six months, you may break free from relationship dynamics that mirror old wounds or finally speak truths you’ve been holding back. Some connections will strengthen because of honesty, while others may fall away because they can’t evolve with you. Either outcome is aligned. This eclipse asks you to choose emotional freedom over familiarity.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward love, creativity, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a welcome shift after the intensity of the eclipse. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your daily life, work habits, and long-term sustainability. You’re gaining momentum, but the lesson now is pacing. You don’t need to prove anything by overextending yourself. Structure and inspiration can coexist without burnout. This week teaches you that transformation is most powerful when it’s steady, intentional, and kind to your nervous system.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week feels like a mental and emotional reset that you didn’t know you needed until it arrived. As we move through the dark of the moon, your attention turns to communication, thought patterns, and the stories you tell yourself about where you’re headed. Old narratives, especially ones rooted in fear, comparison, or self-doubt, may resurface in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This is your cue to release them. You’re outgrowing a version of yourself that needed constant reassurance. Trust that clarity will follow honesty.</p>



<p>The breakthrough arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your realm of learning, writing, speaking, and daily exchanges. Over the next six months, your voice evolves. You may launch a project, commit to sharing your ideas more publicly, or shift the way you communicate in close relationships. The square to Uranus brings sudden insights and unexpected conversations that push you out of your comfort zone. Say the thing. Ask the question. This eclipse reminds you that growth happens when curiosity outweighs fear.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention turns inward toward home, emotional safety, and the spaces that ground you. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating creativity, romance, and passion projects. You’re learning how to bring structure to joy and commitment to what you love. Just be mindful not to overdo it… inspiration doesn’t require exhaustion. This week teaches you that sustainable happiness comes from choosing depth over excess and meaning over momentum.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week begins with a reckoning around worth, security, and what you’re truly building toward. As we move through the dark of the moon, financial concerns, self-esteem patterns, or lingering fears around stability may rise to the surface. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release scarcity thinking and outdated definitions of success. If something has required too much effort for too little return, this is your signal. Letting go now creates space for a more aligned foundation to form.</p>



<p>The shift arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your money and values realm. Over the next six months, you may experience a reset around income, priorities, or how you measure your own worth. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, changes may come unexpectedly. A new opportunity, a sudden expense, or a wake-up call around what truly matters could alter your path. This eclipse pushes you to innovate rather than cling to what’s familiar. Security now comes from adaptability, not control.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward communication, learning, and emotional expression. This pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, activating deep shifts around home, family, and inner emotional structures. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’re especially sensitive to this moment. You’re learning to build strength without rigidity and responsibility without emotional shutdown. This week reminds you that true resilience comes from honoring both your ambition and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11275205/how-to-sleep-when-stressed-tips"">your need for rest</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week is personal in a way you can’t intellectualize your way out of. As the week opens in the dark of the moon in your sign, and the emotional focus lands directly on you… your identity, your body, your sense of self. You may feel unusually sensitive, exposed, or unsure of how you’re being perceived. That’s because something fundamental is shedding. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re releasing an old version of yourself that learned how to survive, not necessarily how to thrive. Let the discomfort speak. It’s showing you where growth is overdue.</p>



<p>Everything changes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse in your sign, a major reset that will echo for the next six months. This eclipse marks a turning point in how you show up in the world. With the eclipse squaring Uranus, one of your ruling planets, expect disruption, breakthroughs, and moments that force honesty. You may feel pulled between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming, especially in relation to home, family, or emotional security. This is not a quiet evolution. It’s visible. You can’t go back to playing small or staying neutral. The world is responding to the version of you that’s ready to lead differently.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the focus shifts toward self-worth, money, and values, grounding the intensity of the eclipse into practical reality. This blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your communication and mindset. You’re being asked to take your ideas seriously while still honoring imagination and intuition. The lesson this week is integration. You don’t have to choose between logic and vision. When you trust both, you become a powerful architect of the future you’re here to build.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like the deep exhale before a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">brand-new chapter begins</a>. As the week opens with the dark of the moon, you may feel more introspective than usual, pulled toward solitude, memory, and emotional processing. Old fears, habits, or subconscious patterns may surface in these final days of the Year of the Snake, asking for closure. This isn’t about fixing yourself. It’s about forgiveness… of others, of circumstances, and of past versions of you who did the best they could with what they knew.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your spiritual, subconscious, and healing realm. This is a powerful internal reset that will unfold quietly but profoundly over the next six months. You may feel called to rest more, create in private, or release attachments that no longer align with your emotional truth. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, sudden realizations or intuitive downloads can arrive unexpectedly. Trust what your inner voice reveals, even if it doesn’t make sense yet.</p>



<p>The tone softens and expands on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, placing the spotlight back on you and your personal journey. This is your time to emerge gently, not rush. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which marks a once-in-a-generation moment of integrating dreams with responsibility. You’re learning that spirituality and structure don’t cancel each other out. They strengthen each other. This week reminds you that your sensitivity is not a liability. It’s the compass guiding you into the next era of your life.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Eclipse season is here!</a> The onset of the annual solar and total lunar eclipse is bringing a fateful chance for us to transform. We are shifting our ideas and purpose to find our place in the world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">Eclipses help to show us</a> what we need to augment to live a fulfilling existence, and these are no different. The caveat is that we are expected to move forward gracefully, which is hard for anyone, especially since the energy packs a powerful punch that shakes things up unpredictably. Comprehending that some people’s situations and experiences must be shelved or that they must begin a new phase is easier said than done. Compassion for ourselves and others can help us. The only way out is through! See you on the other side!</p>

<h4><strong>The Annular Solar Eclipse In Aquarius</strong></h4>



<p>Take note: February 17th is set to be a momentous day. According to lunar astrology, not only does it usher in the Year of the Fire Horse, but the solar eclipse in Aquarius also occurs at 7:01 a.m. EST. This is the first eclipse that falls on the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis, which makes its formal move into these signs on July 26th. The eclipse activates the coming North Node of Destiny in Aquarius, urging us to usher in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">a new mindset</a>, and for us all to work cohesively to make global advances. We are a powerful force of nature when we come together.</p>



<p>A “ring of fire” annual solar eclipse is a rare lunar phenomenon that is the result of the moon moving between the sun and earth, while being far from the earth, making the moon look smaller than the sun. The result of the eclipse leaves a fiery look to the circular edges of the moon (in this particular case, the moon will appear that way for two minutes and 20 seconds at the peak of the eclipse). The eclipse is primarily visible from Antarctica. Other regions, such as South America, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean, will have partial views.</p>



<p>The solar eclipse in Aquarius aspects a sensitive point of the sign, known as an anaretic degree (the 29th degree). The urgency to grow and evolve is immediate. It is giving us a chance to embrace our unique sentiments and let them be known. The collective is changing, and we are evolving our minds with it. Because the planet Uranus, which is in Taurus, is active in the eclipse, it’s fair to say that this is the time of revolution. We are going to stand up for what we believe in and won’t back down. The results may be unpredictable at the moment, but the battle is worth fighting for. </p>

<h4>The Total Lunar Eclipse In Virgo</h4>



<p>On March 3rd at 6:38 a.m. EST, the total lunar eclipse in Virgo intensifies the sky, giving stargazers and astrology lovers an amazing sight to see and capture. The lunar eclipse is a time of release, since it connects to the South Node of Destiny in Virgo (on the current Pisces and Virgo lunar axis). We are departing from old views and emotions, making space for us to explore different philosophies. This is a moment of transcendence and reflection, so take a look back at what recently happened that is sparking a reaction that pushes us to run away from it. </p>



<p>During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears to take on a reddish hue as it passes over the earth’s shadow. Known as the “Blood Moon,” total lunar eclipses are a moment of illumination and revelation. The lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Americas, Australia, East Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, lasting around 59 minutes at its totality.</p>



<p>The lunar eclipse in Virgo receives a gentle push from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, making a difference. Jupiter is known to be the planet of luck, but it can also expand matters that are in a delicate position in either good or bad ways. Problems can become bigger; however, Jupiter always ensures that the results are fortunate. The sting may feel intense at the moment, especially since Mercury retrograde in Pisces is causing ambiguity and confusion. Looking back on the eclipse, we’ll realize that letting go of the past was necessary. The moon in Virgo is a creature of comfort, which is why relinquishing control and healing will be challenging. In the end, it’ll be worth the sacrifice and ride.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959267.jpeg?width=756&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=189%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<p>So, I’m <strong><em>that</em></strong> friend. The one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bucket-list-hotels-r29-editor-picks"">booking her hotel</a> on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11949132/christmas-travel-where-to-stay-hotel-new-york-city"">flight to the destination.</a> The one who buys her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capsule-wardrobe-guide-tips"">full wardrobe</a> after getting there. The one with a non-existent itinerary and a deeply held belief that, “If we just walk outside, something will appear.” Some may call it impulsive, but I like to call it spontaneity with a little bit of chaos. </p>



<p>I’ll admit it, I’m a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/life-coach-lessons-type-a-personality"">Type A person’s</a> worst nightmare… and I had every intention of staying that way. That is, until Hilton invited me on a press trip with a handful of seasoned travel reporters, people who don’t just travel, but optimize it. Over dinner, two of them walked me through how they use points to unlock upgrades, experiences, and thousands of dollars in savings I didn’t even realize I was leaving behind.</p>



<p>And for my fellow Type B travelers who’ve been raw-dogging their way through travel, here’s how one Hilton-hosted weekend in West LA reformed me<strong>,</strong> without stripping away my go-with-the-flow energy. </p>



<p>I had just moved from New York to Los Angeles when Hilton reached out to host my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">Grammy Awards</a> weekend experience.I jumped at the opportunity to attend music’s biggest night and enjoy a little staycation. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959258.jpg?width=784&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=49%3A64"" /></figure>



<p>What I didn’t expect was horseback riding in Malibu, multi-course dinners on property, and a suite bigger than my NYC <em>and</em> LA apartments combined, all tied to <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/"">Hilton Honors,</a> the brand’s loyalty program that gives members access to curated Grammys weekend packages, upgrades, and experiences I genuinely did not know you could redeem with Points.</p>



<p>And before you roll your eyes at the word “points,” I see you. Because if you’re anything like me, “points” sounds like something that requires 47 international flights and a corporate job with unlimited PTO. I am here to tell you: it’s not as unattainable as it sounds. Let’s break it down. </p>



<p>When you book direct or stay at Hilton properties, you earn points you can actually use, either toward free nights or by combining them with cash. You don’t need some impossible balance, you just use what you have.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959270.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>But what surprised me most is that it’s not just about rooms. Through <a href=""https://experiences.hiltonhonors.com/"">Hilton Honors Experiences</a>, Points can unlock actual moments, concert access, VIP sporting events, spa treatments, even Grammy weekend stays at <a href=""https://www.guestreservations.com/waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/booking?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=969500850&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=969500850&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADiMQMYLTTERfRqL_lLG1CPWgLJh2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PqKbdLKIq-SYBhQbXWPtEgKHvICNxJYZYDbYnfDvDQqr7PLjdqchMBoCXKAQAvD_BwE"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills.</a></p>



<p>And then there are the small things that quietly upgrade your life: skipping the front desk with a digital key, choosing your room in advance, late checkout when you need it. And truuuust me, a girl like me will <em>always</em> need a late checkout. </p>



<p>But what if you’re not headed to the Grammys? What if you just want a moment away from the noise?</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959261.png?width=760&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=95%3A128"" /></figure>



<p>That’s exactly how I ended up on the back of a horse overlooking the Malibu coastline. Hilton partnered with a local outfitter and handled the logistics, transportation, timing, the whole setup, so all I had to do was show up. It’s an experience I would never, ever plan for myself, but it pulled me completely out of my comfort zone in the best way.</p>



<p>We split our stay between <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smoolol-oceana-santa-monica/?WT.mc_id=zLADA0AA1OL2PSH3GGL4AMPHTBRD_Oct5GNPLTPMWBRNLAB6SMOOLOL7EN8i142435__z22150182377z__&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_keyword=oceana%20santa%20monica&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22150182377&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-Q0XEachnVMaiJRrASK4anHY1hat&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PsQYcgtXE2HDbyA6H3kXeVE9CLM74zjCDXK21WfEO_2Os5I2H-vsfxoCnpoQAvD_BwE"">Oceana Santa Monica</a> and <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/laxwawa-waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills</a>, and they could not have felt more different. The Oceana was rooted in serenity and calm, the type of energy Santa Monica is known for. And if you stay there, head downstairs to the La Monique and grab the Escargot Poppers with garlic herb crème fraîche. Yes, they’re fried snails. And yes, they kind of remind me of mozzarella sticks. Soooo good. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959273.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>On the day of the Grammys, we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills. It felt like a slightly elevated experience and definitely had me feeling like a superstar for the day. The bathroom overlooked the city, the suite was polished and luxurious, and everything about it felt Grammys-coded. When my mom came to visit, we definitely had a pinch me moment. We’re just two girls from the deep-south after all! </p>



<p>All of this to say: points are  for everyone — including you, Type B traveler who still loves chaos but doesn’t mind leveling up. We can still, stubbornly, embrace the chaos while making our money stretch. </p>

<p>There’s a lot to talk about when it comes to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fLCdIYShEQ""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em>. </em>I’m sure we’ll be dissecting and debating it for weeks. From the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">whitewashing controversy</a> to the <a href=""https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2026/02/09/noc-review-toxic-love-entices-and-torments-in-wuthering-heights/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">toxic love</a> to the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/an-exclusive-first-look-at-the-wild-and-wonderful-costumes-of-wuthering-heights"">daring costumes</a>, the discourse is going to be <em>discoursing</em>. This film, like most everything Emerald Fennell touches, is going to be divisive. And I think that’s part of its charm and its weakness. As The Ringer put it, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> may be “<a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/11/movies/wuthering-heights-movie-preview-hate-watch"">the hate-watch event of the year.</a>” Except, I didn’t hate it. </p>



<p>I may be one of the few people that don’t think this Heathcliff should have been anything but the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-movie-review-heathcliff-controversy"">white fantasy Fennell envisioned</a> (let her make the revitionist movie she wants; we should be championing artists of color to create <em>their</em> wildest desires onscreen and pushing Hollywood execs to greenlight them instead), and this may be strange to admit, considering the movie is based on one of the most toxic relationships in literature, but as soon as Cathy and Heathcliff grew into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights"">Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi</a>, and they gave us some of the most blistering and intoxicating chemistry I’ve seen onscreen in awhile, I started to enjoy myself. I couldn’t look away. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqqhcoQdeQ"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a><em> </em>is a gothic, depressing tragedy of love, lust, loss, and self destruction and yet, it’s also kind of <em>fun</em> (until it’s not, no spoilers). Aside from the absurdity and campiness of the costumes, one of the things I enjoyed most was how unhinged, horny, and mean Cathy could be. And how weird and complicated <a href=""https://www.countryandtownhouse.com/culture/who-is-alison-oliver/"">Alison Oliver’s Isabella Linton</a> was. As Robbie put it, Cathy is “such a bitch.” You can say a lot about Fennell, but she can write female rage (see: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10238043/promising-young-woman-ending-explainer-cassie-death""><em>Promising Young Woman</em></a>) and here, she sets her sights on female desire. </p>



<p>Late last month, the day after I’d seen <em>Wuthering Heights </em>for the first time, I talked to Robbie and Oliver at the film’s fantastical press junket (it was held at The Doheny Estate at <a href=""https://greystonemansion.org/"">the Greystone Mansion and Gardens</a> and there were<em> Wuthering Heights</em>-themed installations throughout the historic grounds) about their characters’ surprisingly refreshinging agency, that much-discussed <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/margot-robbie-jacob-elordi-wuthering-heights-press-tour-weird.html"">Robbie-Elordi chemistry</a>, and which costumes shocked them the most.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959156.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Both of these characters are messy. They’re destructive. They’re unapologetic. They put female desire first, which I think is going to piss some people off, but I loved that about them. It would be easy to say that their entire identities are wrapped up in romantic obsession. But talk about how important it was to show that female desire, that all consuming desire, and the choices that these women make for themselves? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Margot Robbie: </strong>Do you know what felt radical? We have a scene — Alison and I — on the swing in the garden, and it’s a scene essentially, where we’re just fight over Heathcliff, and it felt so radical to do a scene like that. The ironic thing is that we’ve fought so hard to not have to do that in movies anymore, but now it’s been so long since — I don’t know if I’ve done a scene like this since I was on the soap opera I was on back in Australia when I was a teenager. It felt so radical to just be two women fighting over a man. It was crazy. “You have him. He’s so handsome. Who you talking about? You could never take him!” It was weirdly exciting to do.</p>

<p><strong>Alison Oliver: </strong>Yeah, it was strange. All of these characters do have — I feel like Emerald really gave them agency in their own ways as well, which within the sort of confines or the period, you do feel like they have agency in some sense. And I think that was important to show. </p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. They have depth and agency.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yeah, they all make the choices. And then everything you see in the movie happens because of the choices they make. Whereas usually, even now, when we’re not doing scenes fighting about men, most of the time, you’re usually playing a character that something happens to, and then you watch a movie about the effects of that thing happening to that female character. </p>



<p><strong>AO:</strong> They are the decider.</p>

<p><strong>MR: </strong>For both of our characters, I feel like we make a choice, we do a thing, and it’s not the right thing in most instances, and then we have to deal with the consequences.</p>



<p><strong>OK, Margot, this does not work unless you and Jacob have the most insane chemistry we’ve ever seen on screen. And you did. I’m always fighting to bring back chemistry, and you guys did it. </strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>Yes! Chemistry and charisma are two things that I’m like, why can’t we have that? That’s what I want in the movies. Charismatic characters or I want insane chemistry,</p>



<p><strong>Was there a moment where you and Jacob were like, <em>Oh, we got it</em></strong>?</p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>There were a couple of moments. Even on day one. [We shot] the first scene in the movie where Cathy flings open the bed hangings, and [Heathcliff is] lying in bed. And then we ended up cutting this bit but I walked up over him, and then crouch down and got like <em>this</em> close to his face and told him to, “get up, we’ve got neighbors,” or whatever it was. And we cut that bit because the proximity is something we wanted to save. But, I mean, that was day one, and even then, everyone was kind of like, “Whoa.” And we were like, “Okay, I think this movie’s gonna work.” Also just because she’s throwing something at him, and he’s throwing it back, and he’s like, “What?” There was already an intensity between them that I think we could build on from that point. </p>



<p><strong>Alison, what was it like watching Margot and Jacob build that chemistry? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>Incredible. I kept feeling like I was watching, like an old Hollywood film, like watching Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. It really was so incredible to see the two of them just inhabit those characters. It was really special.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959160.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=561&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A561"" /></figure>



<p><strong>We have to talk about the costumes. There were so many moments in my theater that the whole audience gasped at certain costumes. Were there any moments for both of you that you saw a costume you put on and it shocked you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>We had so many costume changes. Every time, in me and Margot’s rooms — we were next to each other and they put us both in our rooms — it would probably take like, half an hour to get into the outfit, and then we’d both come out of the room at the same time and do a reveal. I never felt like more of a girl in my life. I’d come out and be like, <em>Ah!!</em> [mimics screaming]!! </p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>You couldn’t control that reaction if you wanted to. And I didn’t want to, but I couldn’t even if I had wanted to. It was so fun.</p>



<p><strong>AO: </strong>[to Margot] Did you have a favorite? </p>



<p><strong>MR:</strong> I think my favorite was on the swing. That costume during the swing scene [was my favorite]. It’s got this black velvet bodice, and this like and this like neck thing, and then this bit’s showing, but then it’s like, got this chainwork in pink rose. We replicated these old couple of paintings of women in that outfit. One woman wore it, got painted in it, and then someone else was like, <em>Well, I want that.</em> And then did it as well. I think there’s three different decades apart where they’ve done this. I was like, <em>wow, that lady was the original Kardashian</em>. Like, did she wear something and everyone was like, “I want to wear what she wore!” </p>

<p><strong>AO: </strong>There’s this shot where Margot is on the swing, and then I think Isabella says something, and [Cathy] twists around. And every time [she] did that, I literally was like, “that’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” And I would break  character and be like [<em>gasps</em>].</p>



<p><strong>I remember that scene. It’s also a bitchy moment.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MR: </strong>She’s such a bitch, and then swings back around<em> [laughs].</em></p>

<p>When <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11939743/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt’s</a></em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shabanaazeez_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shabana Azeez</a> talks about her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/changing-surname-career-ethnic-discrimination"">career,</a> she traces it back to a single, almost accidental moment of kindness that allowed her to follow a dream that had always been inside her. “I got into acting because a lady was really nice to me one time,” she says, laughing. It sounds flippant, but it’s the truth. She grew up in a family where the arts were not encouraged, academics were the priority, and despite wanting to act her whole life, she never studied drama at school. It wasn’t until she was working at Mercury CX, an emerging filmmakers’ hub in Adelaide, Australia, that someone finally asked her the right question.</p>



<p>Her boss pulled her aside. “She said, ‘You’re great, but this isn’t your passion. What is it?’ And I was like, ‘Well, I’d like to act, but I’ve literally never acted before.'” Within an hour, her boss had secured her an audition for a short film, and she booked it, with no prior acting experience. That led her to secure roles in the animated <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gemma-chua-tran-lesbian-space-princess-queer"">Lesbian Space Princess</a></em> and the coercive-control thriller <em>Bird Eater</em>. She expresses the same mix of gratitude as she talks about her leap from Australian indie television to <a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HBO’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> The contrast, she says, is both extreme and strangely familiar. “It’s chalk and cheese in some ways, and exactly the same in others,” she explains. The budgets are bigger, the access is better, on <em>The Pitt</em>, she can consult real doctors and benefit from an army of specialists, but the core remains unchanged. “Everyone cares about the story.”</p>



<p>When Shabana first read the script for<em> The Pitt </em>she described it as information overload. “It’s like ten series regulars and then a bunch of recurring characters, and then all the patients, and all the names for the doctors are surnames. So you can’t be like, ‘Who’s a woman? Who’s a man? What are their age?’ There’s no clues. I had to go out and buy more highlighters and color-code the entire script,” she says. The audition process for <em>The Pitt </em>was surprisingly lowkey: a single self-tape, followed by a Zoom scheduled for twenty minutes that wrapped after just nine minutes. When the call ended early, she assumed it was a bad sign. “I cried for half an hour afterwards,” she says. “The Zoom was nine minutes. The emotional recovery was three times that.” So when she landed the role, and learned the production would sponsor her visa and fly her halfway across the world it came as a genuine shock.</p>



<p>Moving to LA was, in her words, “horrible in so many ways” and yet also strangely exhilarating. There was a joy in not knowing what came next, in stepping into something undefined. “To not know what you’re stepping into, and to have that curiosity, that scared feeling, that’s what life is about,” she says. Once in Los Angeles, the emotional weight of the move fully settled in. “Oh my god, I knew no one,” she says. “I truly knew not a single person in LA.” That isolation became especially clear during her first days at work. Sitting at lunch during boot camp, she watched as coworkers casually texted friends and loved ones. “Everybody was texting their friends, and I was like, I have no friends to text. They’re all asleep,” she says. “That was really lonely and really scary,” she adds.</p>



<p>Everything shifted when she formed a close friendship with co-star Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr Samira Mohan. Their bond deepened quickly. “I adore her. I think the world of her,” she says simply. “She’s my best friend.” That sense of shared experience extended into their professional lives as well. Shabana notes that her character wasn’t originally written to be South Asian, but the production pivoted after her audition. “I remember thinking that would never happen because they already had a ‘brown girl’,” she says, pointing to the unspoken limits that still shape representation on screen. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“All of our experiences in the world are embodied experiences, and mine is that of a young brown woman, and that’s not going to change. It was so healing to have somebody there with me.”</p><cite>Shabana azeez</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Season one was filmed in near-total anonymity. By season two, the shift was impossible to ignore. Filming now overlapped with awards season; days were spent on set, nights at the Golden Globes or Critics’ Choice Awards. The pace was punishing. “I got flu-level sick three times,” she admits. Still, amid the noise and spectacle, the work itself never changed. “The show is the same to make,” she says. “And that’s really grounding.” In <em>The Pitt</em>, Shabana plays Victoria, a medical student, a role that could easily collapse into the familiar model minority archetype: hyper-competent, genius-level, and primarily functional. But Shabana was intent on resisting that flattening, shaping Victoria into a character defined as much by her flaws as her intelligence. “When we talk about excellence or prodigies, we tend to think, ‘Let’s play that,’” she says. “But that’s not really how people work. When you’re very good at something, you usually have a deficit that’s just as powerful. For Victoria, it’s social. She’s deeply socially inept.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958220.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>What she loves most about acting is the research. “It’s an exercise in empathy,” she says. Through projects like <em>Bird Eater</em>, where she researched stories of emotional abuse, she found it changed her not only as an actor, but as a person. “Every woman I spoke to had a story. It genuinely changed my life.” Rather than focusing solely on the medical aspects of her role, she immersed herself in romance novels, glossy American teen dramas, and studies of loneliness. Victoria, she explains, is “building a life she doesn’t really want,” and fantasy becomes a form of escape. By Season Two, the show allows that internal tension to surface. “We really dig into the icky parts, her jealousy, her exhaustion, her sharpness. She fails a lot. And I think that’s what actually dismantles the model minority myth.”</p>



<p>When I asked Shabana how she stays grounded amid the whirlwind success of <em>The Pitt</em>, she laughs. “My little brother keeps me really grounded. Honestly, they kind of bully me about it, which is actually kind of helpful. When I went home for Christmas, every time I tried to speak and someone interrupted me, my brother would be like, ‘Everybody, excuse me — Hollywood is trying to speak.’ Before I said anything, my uncle would be like, ‘Action.’ It’s that kind of teasing that reminds me it’s just a job.”</p>



<p>“It brings me back to earth. It’s meaningful work, but it’s art, it’s play, and it’s fun, it’s not brain surgery. I think there’s a real danger of people taking themselves too seriously, and my family bullying me actually really helps with that.”<br /><br /><strong><em>Season 2 of The Pitt is now streaming on HBO MAX . </em></strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2026-02-11/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights-jacob-elordi-margot-robbie"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> opens with a scene I hated so much, I almost walked out of the theater. Don’t worry, it goes up from there! The scene in question is a hanging. Two feet dangle from the gallows as an onlooker jokes about the lifeless body’s final unconscious act: a hard on. It’s mentioned later that the perpetrator was a rapist. So the glee in which the spectators (including <a href=""https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Earnshaw"">Catherine “Cathy” Earnshaw</a>) gawk at his erect penis while he is strangled to death is justified. I understand the point — that the story about to unfold is equal parts morbid, horny, irreverent, and uncomfortable — but it just felt like a cheap ploy for shock and awe. The good news is that the rest of the film deals with these conflicting emotions slightly more effectively. And Catherine’s (played in her early years by Charlotte Mellington) curiosity for sex and macabre runs throughout the story, creating a fascinating duality of romance and toxicity, the things <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wuthering-heights-emily-bronte-life?srsltid=AfmBOopEfPLX2S82YU3O5iTObCpeBNCYdMcrYMhooysjNkTh80SZTpkD"">Emily Brontë’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> are known for. But this opening scene is very different from the book’s, and it was just one reason (of many) why I’m glad the Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is white. </p>



<p>Depending on who you ask, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/was-emily-bront-s-heathcliff-black-85341"">Brontë’s Heathcliff is supposed to be Black or Brown</a>, since he’s described in the novel as a “dark-skinned gypsy in aspect” and a “dirty, ragged, black-haired child.” Another description: “as dark almost as if it came from the devil.” In a <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/heathcliff-wuthering-heights-white-jacob-elordi-casting.html?regwall-newsletter-signup=true"">piece for Vulture called <em>Is Heathcliff White?</em>,</a> Jasmine Vojdani writes that, “The idea that Heathcliff might be of African descent first entered academic discussion in the 1950s and gained momentum as postcolonial studies became more popular in the ’80s and ’90s. Scholars have argued that the proximity of Liverpool — one of the biggest slave ports at the time in which Wuthering Heights is set — to the Brontës’ home in Haworth cannot be overlooked.” Vojdani interviews scholars and tries to get to the bottom of this mystery surrounding one of literature’s most famous leading men. One scholar says, “He is both based on the boy of an Indian ruler who’d been orphaned because of the East India Company battles. But he’s also based on an Ashanti warrior’s son.” Another: “The feeling that he should be of African heritage, I think that is interference coming in from [Brontë] sister’s book. Because we do know that in Jane Eyre, Bertha Rochester is born in Jamaica.” Ultimately, Vojdani decides, “By Victorian standards, he’s definitely not white — and likely by ours as well. Is Heathcliff Black? Maybe! It is both historically and textually viable, but he isn’t necessarily Black.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959122.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=569&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A569"" /></figure>



<p>We can debate Brontë’s intentions for decades (and clearly, scholars have), but what’s true in this adaptation is that a white Australian man (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/feb/11/is-jacob-elordi-really-the-hottest-man-on-the-planet-six-things-you-need-to-know"">Jacob Elordi</a>) and a white British boy (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/adolescence-netflix-race-debate-incel-red-pill-culture"">Owen Cooper</a>) play Heathcliff. After watching the film, honestly, it’s for the best. I am not encouraging whitewashing, which let’s be clear is exactly what this adaptation and many before it have done. Canonically, Heathcliff was not white so casting him as such is, in fact, whitewashing. But this is Fennell’s version of the story (I could write a whole other disseration on why she wasn’t the filmmaker to take on this adaptation) and aside from what implications could be drawn from a movie starring a Black man opening with a lynching, I just don’t think this <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2026/02/12/wuthering-heights-movie-heathcliff/"">love story</a> is one I would want to see, or engage in the discourse, if it was a man of color seducing and obsessing over a white woman in this way.</p>



<p>When they are grownups, Heathcliff and Cathy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/margotrobbieofficial/?hl=en"">Margot Robbie</a>) have a tumultuous and toxic relationship. Heathcliff is surly, cruel, and vindictive. He emotionally terrorizes Isabella Linton (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alisonjoliver/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alison Oliver</a>) because he can’t have Cathy. So much so that at a certain point, Isabella crawls on the floor like a dog as he holds onto her collar and makes her bark. While Isabella seems to enjoy this roleplay, it’s uncomfortable to watch. It would take skill, care and precision to pull off this kind of sexual deviance and kink between a consenting couple, let alone between one with a problematic age gap, and power imbalance. I like how female desire is depicted through Isabella, but throw race into the mix and to be frank, I just don’t think Fennell has the range. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959124.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure></div>



<p>Based on what scholars have deduced and what Brontë wrote, Heathcliff was probably Brown, which is interesting considering Fennell cast Pakistani-British actor Shazad Latif as Edgar Linton, Cathy’s husband, who was definitely white in the books. His race is barely acknowledged in the movie. And same goes for <a href=""https://people.com/wuthering-heights-alison-oliver-hong-chau-interview-exclusive-11895056"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hong Chau’s Nelly</a> (played in youth by Vy Nguyen), Cathy’s live-in maid and best friend, also a white character who is now reimagined as Asian. There’s a brief mention of Nelly’s race, when Cathy’s father says something that implies she should be grateful he took her in. Otherwise, the way race would factor into their volatile friendship is never explored. In another writer-director’s hands, this story would be rife for mining the racial and class tensions of the era. With the right storyteller, I’m all for showing flawed characters of color in toxic relationships. They don’t have to be perfect representations of their race. But, again, I don’t think Fennell has any intention, or the competency, to tackle all of that in her work.  </p>



<p>You realize early on what Fennell is doing. And that this <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is not a straightforward adaptation; it’s her own personal fantasy. She said as much on the <a href=""https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/lifestyle/a70174020/wuthering-heights-film-changes/"">red carpet for the LA premiere</a>: “Everyone who loves this book has such a personal connection to it, and so you can only kind of ever make the movie that you sort of imagined yourself when you read it.” In Fennell’s fantasy, Heathcliff couldn’t possibly be anything but a tall, white man that looks like Elordi. Heathcliff is an object of desire and Fennell’s desires cannot extend beyond her worldview, and clearly, that world is very white. Which is fine, actually. She can make the movie she wants to. And I’d rather not watch a story told by a rich, white woman about the twisted proclivities of a Black or Brown man. I wouldn’t want to see it, and I wasn’t holding my breath waiting for it. And it’s telling that in Fennell’s fantasy, the only people of color, Nelly and Edgar,  are characters who Cathy uses and discards at her pleasure. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For the people enraged over this adaptation, I want to ask: what were you expecting? I’m not trying to be condescending, I just genuinely didn’t expect a nuanced rumination on class, race, desire, and abuse from this movie. I watched the trailers, heard Robbie and Fennell talk about the movie, and I’ve seen Fennell’s previous films. I knew what they were trying to do with <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. It’s the spiritual equivalent to the genre of toxic white mess that unfolds in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10785227/succession-black-characters-season-3-review"">TV hits like <em>Succession</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>The White Lotus</em></a><em>.</em> It’s a continuation of the recent trend of modern, magically race-bent, colorblind retellings of beloved literary works, like Netflix’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/08/11082731/color-blind-casting-cons-bridgerton-persuasion""><em>Bridgerton </em>and<em> Persuasion</em></a><em>, </em>and Apple TV’s <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-buccaneers/umc.cmc.g28hcpusm23xbs9zwvnwn9re""><em>The Buccaneers</em></a><em>. </em>It was never going to be that deep. But all <a href=""https://preview.refinery29.com/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl?type_id=11958540&amp;site=us&amp;edition_id=1&amp;app=rosetta&amp;type=blog_entry"">art is political</a>, so yes, while white filmmakers should know better and <em>do</em> better, I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish<strong> </strong>for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. There is inevitably going to be an onslaught of thinkpieces and TikTok rants dedicated to chastising this casting. Sure, let’s call out whitewashing, but instead of expending all our energy on begging for scraps from white Hollywood, let’s support our own. </p>



<p>I’d rather focus on making sure <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7574286690517404958""><em>The Gilded Age</em></a><em> </em>gets 17 seasons (its co-showrunner is <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/10/the-gilded-age-sonja-warfield-anonymous-content-1236590863/"">Sonja Warfield</a>, a Black woman) and the upcoming adaptation of <a href=""https://deadline.com/2024/03/the-davenports-ya-novel-prime-video-alloy-entertainment-1235846686/""><em>The Davenports</em></a><em> </em>(also brought to you by Warfield), gets all the hype it deserves than try to make this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>into something it was never going to be. I’d rather watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belle-bridgerton-black-period-drama"">Amma Asante’s <em>Belle</em></a> again and support whatever work she’s got in the pipeline. I’d rather push for execs to greenlight anything and everything <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11939097/hedda-movie-review-tessa-thompson-interview"">Nia DaCosta is going to do next</a>. I’d rather uplift <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/alyssa-cole-when-no-one-is-watching-interview"">Alyssa Cole</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ladriana_herrera/?hl=en"">Adrianna Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://vanessariley.com/"">Vanessa Riley</a>, and the countless other Black and Brown woman historical romance writers than force Fennell to change her warped fantastical version of Heathcliff and Cathy’s ill-fated love story into anything other than what it is. </p>

<p>So let’s get into what <em>is</em> onscreen and whether that is worth your time. This may surprise you, but I actually think it might be. When I settled into Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> world, and got over the unnecessary shock tactic of that opening scene, I started to enjoy myself. For better and for worse, I was entertained. Elordi and Robbie (who the internet also swore was miscast because of her age) are electric together. I think their chemistry makes the whole thing worth it. </p>



<p>In the story that Fennell is telling, their chemistry is the one thing that needs to work, and it does. I believe that these two people would tear the world — and themselves — apart to be together. I also believe that they want to tear each other’s clothes off. They are so down bad for each other, inanimate objects that are slightly sexual set them ablaze. Chemistry often feels like a lost art and it was refreshing to see good, old-fashioned, horny-ass onscreen attraction. And for the first time, I understood the global thirst for Jacob Elordi. While Robbie’s Cathy is spunky, stubborn, and independent, Elordi’s Heathcliff is brooding, desperate, and clingy. He’s a real yearner and this may mean that I need some serious therapy, but I was <em>into it. </em></p>

<p>A friend of mine went to an early screening of the movie as well and his review was simply, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzPpZwSDcRo"">gowns, beautiful gowns</a>” and he’s not wrong, but I think it’s more than that. The costumes are absurd, but in this cinematic world, that’s a compliment! This movie thrives in absurdity and extravagance. There were moments when Robbie as Cathy walked into the frame and I had an audible reaction to her costume. Sure, at times, that took me out of the story, but if they were going to gasp-inducing costume design moments, they succeeded. Visually, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is stunning. It nails the gloomy, overcast foreboding rolling hills that the source material describes while also injecting shots of color, humor, and exuberance into the film’s aesthetic. In spite of the depressing subject matter, this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>is more camp than melancholy. </p>



<p>The film will probably never beat the style over substance accusations, understandably, but for me, the performances are the best part. Chau is perfectly exasperated and defiant. Latif is doting and oblivious yet likeable. Oliver is intoxicating and exhilarating to watch. And Elordi and Robbie lean so hard into the <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/review-finally-a-smooth-brained-wuthering-heights.html"">“smooth-brained sensuality”</a> of Fennell’s adaptation that it’s not hard to believe they were <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427555/jacob-elordi-margot-robbie-bond-on-wuthering-heights-set"">obsessed with each other on set</a>. </p>



<p>The audiences who show up to the theater on Valentine’s Day hoping for a feel-good romance may leave a bit traumatized (just like I was when I first read <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in high school), but they’ll also buy into the splendor and pageantry of this movie. And they’ll understand why Elordi and Robbie are two of the most in-demand talents of their generation. I do wish that a Black-led, Black-directed film — or one made by and for people of color — was getting the same over-the-top treatment, star-making potential, and <em>budget</em>, but until we start yelling more about why we aren’t seeing those stories greenlit, funded, and released, we’ll be stuck in our own fantasy. Fennell’s warped, whimsical, white-as-hell fever dream may be a compelling watch, but it’s <em>her </em>imagination come to life. I want to imagine a world in which the weird whims of Black and Brown filmmakers are able to be awakened too. </p>
