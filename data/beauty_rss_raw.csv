<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956402.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=681&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A681"" /><figcaption>Full moon at midnight and dark blue sky with clouds. Spooky dark night sky view. The moon was covered with clouds and its reflection was on the water.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Get ready to roar! The Full Snow Moon in Leo on February 1st demands that we take charge. How? By fighting for fairness and equality, while simultaneously asking us to care for others with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/you-are-not-an-empath"">compassion and empathy</a> (sharing this with our frenemies and nemeses will be hard, but valuable in teaching them to be kind). The remedy for upsets is to be sympathetic and fierce, making tough love the best approach. If we are going from a pure position, we can make the world and our lives a more magical and tender place to be. First, we have to be aggressive and loud to be effective in getting the word out about the causes we believe in to ensure people are listening. </p>



<p>The Snow Moon marks a time of renewal in the depths of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to the weather, the world slows down, allowing us to be more introspective and mindful of the world around us — particularly how we feel on the inside about partnerships and life. By tapping into our internal resources, we can find the strength to make the necessary changes and the stamina to carry them through the season. Centering our energy on what’s important helps us realize that a lot of what we focus on isn’t. Clearing our minds gives us the clarity we need to grow and evolve. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo is a divine time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifesting-magical-thinking-control-reality-goals"">set intentions and manifest</a>. If we are illuminating and honoring the repressed parts of ourselves that want to come out, we are on track. We can move forward and soldier on after we release the hidden aspects of our personality and creativity by putting them into play. We’re deciding not to back down and to strive for happiness — no matter how messy the journey is to get there. The destination is going to be bumpy, but worth it in the end.  </p>



<p>With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> opposing the Full Moon in Leo, it will be easy to get caught up in drama. Mars is known to instigate affairs, particularly by bringing up past situations. As a result, a line will be drawn in the sand, asking us to fight or take flight. We will be able to choose who is a friend or foe, and how we wish to participate in the matter. We might be pulled into a dynamic that pushes us to exert our frustrations or take the higher ground. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-aquarius-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Mars in Aquarius</a> quarrels for what it’s most passionate about — particularly social injustice. If we feel that there is something that isn’t right for the community at large or even for ourselves in personal relationships, then we will get on our soapbox and take a stand.  </p>



<p>The truth is coming out, allowing us to hear the good, the bad, and the ugly. Our perception of others may change — not necessarily for the better. Knowing that we have been misled or need to step up protective measures might feel like a dagger to the heart, since we’ve been open and genuine with those who aren’t. Rather than dwell, use it as a learning curve. The lesson is to put a boundary on the relationship to ensure it never transpires again. Fool us once, shame on them; fool us twice, it’s not ever happening. Words of advice: Do not feel bad about your part; understand that you can and will overcome anything in time. Never dwell on matters that are in the rearview mirror. </p>



<p>Reflect on the matter at hand and conclude what or who deserves our attention and affection. Even though the Snow Moon is slightly chaotic, Leo energy focuses on our heartfelt sensations. Yes, there are letdowns, but the reason we’re feeling them so intensely is that we are hot-blooded creatures, full of emotions and passions. Our desires guide our actions, and our sentiments dictate our reactions. Do not hold back. Say what’s on your mind. Vocalizing the voice within is a great way to be heard and seen. If you’re using it, that is what counts most.  </p>

<p>Fashion is starting to undergo a major shift. In 2026, as with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2026-innovator-awards"">beauty</a> moving away from the pared-down “clean girl” makeup trend, fashion is moving away from the mainstream minimalism of recent years. In its place is a moodier and maximal sensibility. What does this mean for jeans? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2025"">Denim trends</a> are going to inspire you to have way <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">more fun as you get dressed</a> in the months ahead.<br /><br />One theme in particular is ruling over all popular 2026 denim: exaggeration. Prepare to take up space in baggy, inflated silhouettes with playful proportions. “Comfort is a huge factor, but there’s also something about the relaxed look that just feels more modern right now,” <a href=""https://www.pistoladenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pistola Denim</a> founder Grace Na tells Refinery29.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10820638/are-skinny-jeans-in-style-2022"">Skinny jeans</a> aren’t completely out of the picture — don’t let us stop you if they’re your favorites — but tight, figure-hugging styles certainly won’t be dominating the conversation this year. Ultimately: “Jeans should flex with how you feel, where you’re going, and who you want to be that day or even that moment of your day,” <a href=""https://lagence.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Agence</a> fashion director Tara Rudes Dann says. <br /><br />Ahead, meet the top 2026 denim trends to welcome into your wardrobe, as well as some useful shopping picks. But this isn’t an experiment you have to test alone: We spoke to the forces behind some of our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">favorite brands</a> to break down the looks, why they’re popular, and how to style them.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Barrel Jeans, With A Twist</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957183.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-barrel-leg-jeans"">Barrel-leg jeans</a> came into the zeitgeist just a few years ago as a funky denim trend with questionable longevity. Yet naysayers should take heed that this silhouette is very much here to stay. This fashion-forward style features a very noticeable curve from the hip to the ankle, and that distinct shape is only going to keep getting more visible in the months ahead.<br /><br />It’s worth noting that barrel jeans are also sometimes called a horseshoe or balloon jean, though the latter is a more exaggerated version of the look. “It plays with volume in a really fresh way and adds a bit of fashion energy without feeling too intimidating,” Pistola’s Na says of the barrel-adjacent balloon.<br /><br />Rather than intimidate you, you might find that barrel jeans are incredibly versatile when it comes to styling. Pair them with a blazer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-polo-shirts"">polo shirt,</a> and heels for an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">office-ready look</a>, or try them with a cool-girl leather jacket and sneakers for brunch with friends.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Wide-Leg Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957184.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>We’ve been seeing lots of volume in pants and jeans from plenty of brands, so it’s no surprise that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wide-leg-jeans-women"">wide-leg denim</a> will be all over your social feeds and in your favorite stores in 2026. This comfortable cut was, after all, the viral opening look in <a href=""https://www.chanel.com/us/fashion/collection/metiers-art-2026/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel’s Métiers d’art 2026 show</a> — you know, the one held in a New York City subway station. Rather than hugging the body anywhere, this year’s class of wide-leg jeans shoot out from the waistband. These baggier silhouettes look great on everyone, and especially for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-jeans-for-petite-women"">petite wearers</a>, a higher-sitting waist can help elongate the legs.<br /><br />“The baggy jean can be styled with a heel for a tailored look or worn with a sneaker for a weekend-ready look,” <a href=""https://paige.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paige</a> co-founder and creative director Paige Adams-Geller says. The degree of baggy? Well, that’s buyer’s choice, and there’s a range of what’s available.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Straight-Leg &amp; Cigarette Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957185.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Skinny jeans may not be as ubiquitous as they were during the hipster heyday of the 2010s, but skinny-ish silhouettes are still in vogue. Straight-leg and cigarette jeans (darlings of the ‘80s and ‘90s) are the top nominees here. Though these two silhouettes are very similar, thanks to their slim fit that goes straight down the leg, they differ in one key spot: cigarette jeans taper at the ankle.<br /><br />The range of trends in the denim space are also a net positive for both your closet and a denim brand’s creativity. “It is exciting for us as designers but also for women because they can wear whatever suits them,” Tim Kaeding, co-founder of <a href=""https://www.motherdenim.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mother Denim</a>, tells Refinery29. “It isn’t like previous decades where one fit is dominating everything. It really is a cross-section between skinny and baggy.”<br /><br />Straight-leg and cigarette jeans work best in outfits that are all about clean lines — for one such example, look to <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/valentino-spring-2026-ready-to-wear-collection-1238281150/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valentino’s Spring/Summer 2026 collection</a>. Try adding a structured blazer or, for balance, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">soft cardigan</a>. If you’re on the shorter side, it can be extra helpful to have these jeans tailored at the hem to ensure there’s no pooling at your feet. In a pinch, wearing heels or using some iron-on hemming tape can also help.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Maxing Out</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957186.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mirroring the longer and looser denim styles ruling the year, skirts are going midi and maxi. (If you love your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-denim-skirts"">denim mini skirt</a>, simply stash it in storage — we’re sure it’ll come back in a few years.) The coolest denim skirts feature unique details like cool-enhancing asymmetric hems. Gravitating toward a more classic shape? Try a new-to-your-closet denim wash to mix things up.<br /><br />There are endless ways to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-skirts-over-jeans"">style these skirts</a>, whether girly, sporty, or something else. We like pairing ours with a moto jacket and combat boots for some edge. A button-up, on the other hand, projects a more polished vibe.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Contemporary Bootcut Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957187.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Raise your hand if you got  rid of any <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bootcut-jeans-women"">bootcut jeans</a> you had left over from the early aughts. (We did too.) Yet, while the style is one of the major denim trends to watch in 2026, the new class of bootcut styles is far more modern than the jeans of yore. Instead of a distinct slim-to-flare cut, the refreshed bootcut is more subtle. Best of all, comfortable high-waisted styles are as easy to source as low-rise inseams that all but scream “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/addison-rae-style-summer-outfits"">Y2K</a>.” <br /><br />“She’s confident, sexy and incredibly flattering,” L’Agence’s Rudes Dann says of the style. After all: “women want jeans that celebrate curves and command attention.”<br /><br />Making bootcut jeans feel current is also about how you style them — and no, you aren’t expected to only wear them with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">boots</a>. Rock these jeans with loafers or pointed-toe heels for an elevated silhouette. For a more casual outfit, pair them with a white T-shirt, cool jacket, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">skinny-soled sneakers</a>.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Think Beyond Jeans</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957188.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Your legs aren’t the only place where denim can make a maximum impact. Expect to see designers use the material for shirts, dresses, and accessories in 2026. <br /><br />Want to rock a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-festival-outfit-ideas"">Canadian tuxedo</a> or channel Britney Spears’ iconic <a href=""https://people.com/style/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-matching-denim-moment-20th-anniversary/"">denim-princess ballgown</a>? That’ll be easier than ever as brands continue to crank out shoes, bags, and outerwear all made with denim. Denim cowboy boots? Yes, (and thank you, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/beyonce-cowboy-carter-tour-outfits"">Beyoncé</a>). A crossbody bag made from the same material? Never no.<br /><br />“Denim jackets are showing up in sharper shapes in addition to the classic jean jacket,” Rudes Dann says of the all-denim everything trend of 2026. “Think bomber silhouettes and tailored blazers that feel structured but still easy and chic.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Jorts</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957191.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Think of today’s most popular <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anthropologie-pilcro-denim-jorts-review"">jorts</a> — a portmanteau for jean shorts — as wide-leg denim… for warmer weather. This style, which usually fits loose and hits below the knee if not right above it, is a seasonal interpretation of this year’s theme of comfort and ease. Style these with a snug shirt for proportional balance, or wear them with an oversized graphic tee to go full Adam Sandler. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Decorations &amp; Details</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957189.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Understated and unembellished jeans won’t ever lose their luster, but denim with an extra bit of flair is quickly becoming a favorite for the style-obsessed. Utility-inspired styles, like carpenter jeans, are staying mainstream, as are spunky styles that are decked out in embellishments. Pair these with a basic tee, jacket, and kicks to really let the jeans shine.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennettemccurdy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jennette McCurdy</a>’s memoir <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/relieved-dad-died-grief-after-emotional-abuse"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> left me in tears. So, when I heard that the actress turned author was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_dgS5rHts0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">releasing a new book</a>, her first novel, I was excited. <em><a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366244-i-m-glad-my-mom-died"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">I’m Glad My Mom Died</a></em> is brutally honest and refreshingly straightforward and I knew McCurdy’s first foray into fiction would bring the same energy. </p>



<p>The book, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">called </a><em><a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2026/01/24/half-his-age-jennette-mccurdy-review/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half His Age</a></em>, follows Waldo, a 17-year-old who has a relationship with a teacher 23 years her senior. The book deals with the nuances and power imbalance of an age-gap affair and was partly inspired by a relationship McCurdy had herself.

<p><strong>Refinery29: Jennette, after writing your amazing memoir, <em>I’m Glad My Mom Died,</em></strong><strong> how did you decide that this was the next step in your journey as a writer?  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jennette McCurdy:</strong> Oh boy. I have a very writerly answer to this. I used to not understand when authors talked this way, but now I completely understand. It was a thing that demanded to be written. You know, I was actually writing another thing, and <em>Half His Age</em> was kind of like pushing itself up on me, and I couldn’t stop thinking about Waldo. I said, “You know, I’ll give it a week.” I’ll let it run its course. I’ll probably grow tired of it, and then I’ll just go back to this other thing. And then, 30 days later, I had a first draft, and I immediately went into a second draft, then a third, and fourth, until it was just finished. There was no choice. And I think that’s always a good sign, right? For me, that’s always an experience with creativity. The one that’s pushing itself up on me, it’s the one that gets done. That’s just how it goes. </p>



<p><strong>How much does Waldo believe that she has this relationship with her teacher under </strong><strong><em>her</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>control? And why is it important for you to show that nuance even tho</strong><strong>ugh </strong><strong>s</strong><strong>he’s</strong><strong> clearly not in </strong><strong>control because she’s a minor?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I really tried to avoid being moralistic in the writing itself and to be more subtle than that. Okay, this isn’t very subtle, but I’ll say it. Waldo is very aggressive and is very forward and is, at times, you know, throwing herself at this man. He is still a 40-year-old man who should know better. I never stated in the book, but I’ll state it here now. I really wanted to show this young woman who really believes she is in control and is really fighting to be in control and clawing for some form of power. She’s still so vulnerable. She’s still at an age that is so vulnerable. And yet at that age, you’re not necessarily aware of your limitations, of the places where you’re particularly naive or susceptible to outside influences. You don’t know those things. I really think it was so important to me to show it through her eyes completely because. Most of us reading it are going to be a bit older, and we know what it’s like to be 17. We know what it’s like not to be in that naive position, and to be that susceptible to influence. We have all been there. It was so important to me to do it completely through her eyes.   </p>



<p><strong>Yes. We also know what it’s like to think we know everything when we really know nothing. You’ve said that one of the main themes of this book is female rage. What do you mean when you say female rage? And why do you feel it’s important to explore that theme?</strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Thank you for this question. I would love to hear what female rage is to you. Female rage to me is having your boundaries violated over and over and over and over and over again, and not having access to the language, the tools to advocate for yourself. Being afraid to advocate for yourself. Told not to advocate for yourself, to be polite, to be nice, to make things easy, to not be difficult. So, you continue doing that and playing that role over and over again. Then your boundaries are still violated over and over and over again, and it compounds for years until, inevitably, the rage starts to crop up and come out in unexpected ways. There’s no choice but to start confronting it and understanding not only its roots, but also how to ideally channel it properly moving forward. This was such an important theme for me to explore. I think we all have a lot of female rage. You tell me if you disagree. Do you have it? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957143.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>I </strong><strong>do not disagree</strong><strong>.</strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM: </strong>It’s something we all know so well, and yet I haven’t really felt the social conversation go there the way I wish it would. I think there’s so much value in our rage if we can access it, if we’re not hiding it and doing the thing where we’re suppressing and being polite and pretty and nice and whatever. If we’re able to go, I’<em>m fucking angry, and here’s what  I’m angry about.</em> Oh my God, that’s when it moves through you. That’s when it leads to decisions you can make that are actually helpful for your life. And Waldo is not there yet. She’s not at the place where she can make those helpful decisions. She is 17. She’s in the throes of it, and she doesn’t even realize the extent of it. And it is fueling her decisions so much without her even realizing it. Her drive for sex. Her need for Korgy. Her need for things. For clothing. All of it is so charged by rage and shame. I really hope it will open up a broader conversation about what we can do with our rage and how we can find empowering ways of utilizing it.  </p>



<p><strong>Yes, I think that is something we should talk more about. We should be allowed to feel pure anger. There are so many things set up to make us angry, and I should be allowed to curse somebody out.  </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> There are some lovely men. All gays are great. There are some straights who are lovely. <em>[laughs]</em> I’m with an amazing one.  But I think a lot of times, their fear of our emotions can really cause us to sort of suppress and wanna be polite and keep going in that inauthentic way. Who can hold our rage? A) Ourselves and B) Other women. I have never felt more at ease and safe in my rage than when I explore it with other women and talk about it. Having those deep, thoughtful conversations about what it is we’re so angry about, what the root of it is, what it might be actively that’s in our life that’s causing it to resurface, and how we can move forward in a way that is productive and healthy. </p>

<p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat is the best way for us to express our female rage? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I think it can be different for everybody. Something that might be somewhat universal, I’d say, is having a creative outlet. For me, it’s writing. I think I write really effectively from a place of anger. It’s when I do the most charged writing that I think connects the most. It can be a variety of things, but I think creativity is one place. A genuine conversation is another place for it. Surprise!<em> [laughs]</em> That shouldn’t be shocking. Just talking it out and not pretending to be <em>happy, happy, happy</em> and <em>grateful, grateful, grateful</em> all the time. That is crazy making. </p>



<p><strong>It is, as they call it, toxic positivity</strong><strong>.  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Yes.   </p>



<p><strong>If you could explain</strong><em><strong> Half His Age</strong></em><strong> using the five senses, what would they be? For example, it sounds like this, it feels like this.   </strong></p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> Ooh, okay. It feels like skin. Sweaty skin, particularly sweaty, hairy skin. It sounds like a train, like the force of a train. Potentially about to crash. We see a train coming the opposite way. The two trains are coming at the same time. That’s what it sounds like.  </p>



<p><strong>If train A sta</strong><strong>rts </strong><strong>here and train B starts there, when will they collide</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>JM:</strong> Exactly. What does it smell like? My mind went to sweat again, but I’ll say it smells like… I can’t say where my mind was <em>[laughs].</em> I’ll say it: it smells like a certain bodily fluid. It tastes like sour patch kids. And it looks like desolate landscapes of Alaska, and then I’m thinking extreme close-ups of sex. It’s not like we’re seeing a romanticized shot where it’s hot and steamy. It’s like we’re seeing a close-up of an arm. We’re seeing that gut. We’re just seeing the body hanging by itself. We’re seeing cellulite, we’re seeing makeup-less faces, we’re seeing lips, and we’re seeing drool. Just kind of the visceral, disgusting elements of sex.   </p>

<p><strong>What is it like to be so vulnerable publicly and share so much of yourself? Does it make it easier or harder that you’ve been in the spotlight for so long?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I’m really glad that I had years where I was not in the spotlight. No social media app was on my phone. I was in a cave writing for quite a few years. Not even considering the public eye in any way, shape, or form. And then being back into it as an adult has been really interesting, fun, and at times complicated, but I do lead with vulnerability. Honesty is an important value of mine. Authenticity. It’s just who I am. It would feel so bad to show up here, sit opposite you, to be somebody who I’m not. Be some performative thing that I’m not. And then after the fact, you know, closing the Zoom and shutting the laptop and then being a completely different person. It wouldn’t work for me, to be honest. I certainly have things for myself and things I keep to myself, but I do believe vulnerability is useful to others and an important value of mine.   </p>



<p><strong>Since this book is inspired by a real-life experience </strong><strong>you’ve</strong><strong> had, where does Jennette start, and where does Waldo stop? </strong><strong>How are you similar to each other</strong><strong> and h</strong><strong>ow are you different from each other</strong><strong>?  </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I was in a significant age-gap relationship. When I was 18, I had my first foray into the world of relationships. On a personal level, that influenced some aspects of Waldo’s relationship with Korgy and a lot of my unprocessed anger from that relationship. Waldo is entirely her own character. This story is entirely its own. And there’s something really  freeing and really fun about it that I loved. I certainly want to write more fiction. I’m sure people will project me onto it in certain ways, and that’s fine if people do, but I really hope that if they can, they read it entirely as its own piece of work in its own world. It’s own set of characters. I think it would be a misread to put too much of me on it, to be honest.   </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I hope [<em>Half His Age]</em> makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable… I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p><cite>jennette mccurdy</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I think </strong><strong>it’s</strong><strong> great that you </strong><strong>can</strong><strong> tell people, “No,</strong><strong> Waldo is a character. This is fiction.” Who would you say this book is not for, and who is it for?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM: </strong>I wanna say it’s not for somebody who’s suppressing a lot and has sort of muted emotions. I don’t think it would work for them. I think it’s certainly for people with big emotions. For anybody who’s ever embarrassed themselves or humiliated themselves in a relationship to try to have their needs met, to try to win the affection of somebody who didn’t love them back the way that they needed or so craved. It’s for anybody who’s ever felt deeply lonely. I think there’s so much loneliness that comes through in this. You know, we mentioned rage. Anybody with unprocessed or processed rage. All rage is welcome here. </p>



<p><strong>What do you want people to take away from this book after they put it down? </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> closing it. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> done. </strong><strong>I’m</strong><strong> crying. What am I taking away? </strong><strong></strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> A theme of this conversation has been rage, and I don’t want to harp on it too much. But I do hope it helps people process some of that, and that it leads to conversations about rage. It’s a hope of mine that anything I write will help people find closure, maybe in places where there wasn’t any, and in their own experiences. I hope it’s a source of connection, and I hope it’s a place to process uncomfortable feelings. I hope it makes people uncomfortable. I think there’s so much useful juice in being uncomfortable and so much to glean from that. So, I do hope it makes readers uncomfortable. I think it will.   </p>



<p><strong>You have to sit in the uncomfortable to find the comfortable. Can’t just have one without the other. I think that’s what people forget. </strong> </p>



<p><strong>Your TV adaptation of <em>I’m</em></strong><strong><em> Gl</em></strong><strong><em>ad </em></strong><strong><em>My Mom Died</em></strong><strong> is in the works. Congratulations! How is that process going? Are there any secrets you can tell me?  </strong> </p>



<p><strong>JM:</strong> I don’t think I can share any secrets. Top-level, locked-in-a-box stuff <em>[laughs]. </em>It’s been really interesting. I can say I have a really clear vision for what the show is. I have had this vision for years. It’s not only my life story; it’s inspired by the memoir, and knowing that the memoir has touched so many people in such a significant and profound way is so important to me to get the adaptation right. To me, that means making sure every member of that team fully understands that vision and that we’re all on the same page. And I’m not in any rush. It doesn’t matter to me how long it takes. It’s gotta be done right.   </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957041.jpg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m not <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-marriage-proposal-celebration-anxiety"">engaged</a>. And yet, somehow, I took my boyfriend to what might be our future wedding destination. I had started wedding planning without meaning to.</p>



<p>When the invitation to visit <a href=""https://ranchosantana.com/""><strong>Rancho Santana</strong></a> landed in my inbox, the subject line stopped me in my tracks: <em>Nicaragua</em>. It wasn’t a place I had ever imagined myself visiting let alone falling in love with, but I’m always down for the ride. So I said yes, packed my bags, and invited my boyfriend along to help photograph the trip.</p>



<p>From the moment we landed, the experience felt elevated. A private car service picked us up and drove us two hours through the countryside of Nicaragua, eventually arriving at a secluded paradise I didn’t even know existed. At Rancho Santana, we were greeted with welcome drinks, cool towels, and the kind of hospitality that instantly makes you exhale. The entrance alone felt cinematic: a hacienda-style courtyard opening up to sweeping ocean views. That was my first thought: <em>This place feels heaven-sent.</em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957061.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>What I didn’t realize and what my boyfriend found out shortly after we arrived was that the rest of our group consisted entirely of wedding planners and wedding photographers. The side-eye was immediate. I promised him it wasn’t a setup, but once you experience Rancho Santana, the confusion makes sense. This is the wedding venue of your dreams. Whether you’re envisioning a beach ceremony, an intimate chapel moment, or vows exchanged at golden hour, the resort offers every version of romance that is thoughtfully designed and effortlessly executed. Our group included some of California’s most talented wedding and event planners, including <a href=""https://www.rheefined.com/"">Jason Rhee</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charleybluebell/?hl=en"">Charley King</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artandsoulevents/"">Jessica Carrillo</a>, <a href=""https://thomasbuilifestyle.com/"">Thomas Bui,</a> and <a href=""https://nahidglobal.com/services-2/"">Nahid Farhoud</a>, along with photographers <a href=""https://emilywren.com/"">Emily Wren</a> and <a href=""https://clanegessel.com/"">The Clane Gessel Studio</a>. As the only journalist on the trip, I felt incredibly honored to be with such great talent.</p>



<p>And then there was the itinerary… which did <em>not</em> help my case.</p>



<p>Our room had a private terrace (by the way, every room does), mornings started with oceanfront breakfasts while surfers rode the waves below, and evenings were filled with sunset cocktail hours followed by candlelit dinners with gorgeous table decor. Night one felt less like a welcome dinner and more like an engagement dinner, for guests we hadn’t invited.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957134.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The next day, we toured the full property, and that’s when everything clicked. In addition to resort rooms, Rancho Santana offers over 20 private residences that can accommodate anywhere from six to eighty guests. It’s an ideal option for weddings or milestone celebrations that feel both intimate and expansive. Guests still receive full access to the resort’s amenities, including butler service, three restaurants, a café, a pool bar with cabanas, and a local market.</p>



<p>One night, we attended an all-white themed dinner at one of the restaurants. Between the unreal sunset backdrop and the stunning decor by local designers, you couldn’t convince me it wasn’t a rehearsal dinner. At one point, we were on the dance floor and the entire group cheered us on as the “newlyweds for the night.” I was nervous about how my boyfriend would react,  until I looked over and saw that he was having just as much fun as I was.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957075.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The running joke throughout the trip was that he might as well just marry me right then and there. The planners were ready. The photographers were on site. The venue was flawless. Low-key, I was like, “yesss, let the inspiration marinate!” And while I was joking, I was also quietly taking notes.</p>



<p>Beyond the romance, the resort delivers unforgettable experiences like horseback riding along the beach, bird and monkey nature tours, surf lessons, sandboarding, and a hands-on ceramics class. Each day somehow outdid the last.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957077.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our final day, they staged a full wedding — complete with a bride, a chapel ceremony, a saxophone player, cocktail hour, and a reception dinner inside one of the eight-bedroom homes. There was a live band. a private chef, and a level of detail that felt impossible to top.</p>



<p>By the end of the trip, we were both joking (but lowkey serious) about living there someday. I’ve always known I wanted a destination wedding. I just didn’t know where. Without realizing it, I spent five days experiencing exactly what that dream could look like, in a country I had never considered visiting. Nicaragua <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/singapore-vacation-travel-experience-black-woman"">surprised me</a> in the best way. Between the people, the culture, and the undeniable magic of Rancho Santana, I’d recommend it for a wedding, a milestone birthday, or simply a luxurious reset. As for my boyfriend? Let’s just say manifestation is real. Now the only thing left to figure out is how I accidentally plan my way onto a private jet next.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor, it’s my job to test beauty treatments, but there are only a handful that I’m really obsessed with. Sure, there are tons of interesting options out there, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED facials</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skinvive-injectable-moisturizer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">injectable moisturizer</a>, but few are genuinely innovative and game-changing (in my opinion, the single most overused phrase in the beauty industry).  </p>



<p>Without a doubt, one of those innovations and my can’t-live-without product is builder in a bottle, which you may also know as BIAB nails. I’ll even bet money on you trying it and loving it. Here’s everything you need to know about the new nail treatment sweeping salons everywhere. </p>



<h2>What are BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>BIAB (also known as builder gel) was developed by the brand <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Gel Bottle</a>. Creative nail expert and content creator, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/SadieJNails/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sadie Jordan,</a> always uses BIAB on her clients: “It’s a [curable] gel nail enhancement designed to add strength and structure to your natural nails, helping them to grow out without breaking as easily,” says Jordan. She adds that BIAB is more viscous than gel polish. “It allows you to build an apex — the highest part of a nail enhancement, most visible from the side angle — which is what makes your nail more durable.”  </p>



<p>BIAB is layered on top of your natural nail (whatever the length) to lend strength and prevent breakage. BIAB comes in a range of different colors, but the most popular tends to be clear or neutral pink. It can be used as a base coat (with gel polish layered over the top, including nail art) or applied on its own.  </p>

<h2>What are the benefits of BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>The main benefit of BIAB is the ability to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">grow your natural nails</a> underneath. Even long-term nail-biters, or those whose nails are prone to breakage, tend to have success with growth. What’s more, countless BIAB nail looks can be achieved without glue or plastic tips, says Jordan. This means you can have long-lasting manicures with a similar removal process to regular gel by simply filing away the top layer and soaking off the product with acetone. </p>



<p>Another benefit of BIAB is that it can be used alongside <a href=""https://www.thegelbottle.com/shop/37364-pro-nail-forms.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">nail forms</a> (a paper or foil tip) to repair chipped corners. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between BIAB nails, traditional gel, Gel-X nails, and acrylics?  </h2>



<p>It can be hard to tell, but there are differences between BIAB, traditional gel, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/apres-gel-x-nail-extensions"">Gel-X</a>, and acrylics. </p>



<p>Gel nail polish was <a href=""https://www.cnd.com/"">developed by CND</a> under the brand name Shellac and is a liquid polish that is cured and hardened under a UV lamp. Curing makes gel polish chip-resistant and gives it a longer wear.  </p>



<p>BIAB is a form of gel polish that has a stronger base — this is why it assists growth. An upside of BIAB is that it can be soaked off just like gel polish. Both gel polish and BIAB give that incredible, long-lasting shine that regular nail polish can’t achieve. </p>



<p>Gel-X is a gel nail extension system developed by Aprés Nails, where full-cover tips are bonded to the natural nail with gel and cured under a UV lamp, then shaped to your preference. BIAB doesn’t require tips. Instead, it’s applied onto the natural nail.  </p>



<p>Acrylics are created using liquid monomer and powder polymer, which should be mixed carefully by your nail tech. Acrylics don’t need curing under a lamp and harden within a few minutes. If you’re someone who loves really long nails, acrylics tend to be a sturdier option. One similarity between BIAB and acrylics is that once the nail starts to grow out, you can get an infill (where product is applied to the nail growth area).  </p>



<p>So what’s the best technique? It all depends on your budget, what your nail tech offers, the outcome and length you’re looking for, as well as your activity level, or how much you use your hands. </p>

<h2>How long do BIAB nails last? </h2>



<p>Luxury nail artist and beauty professional <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charlotteemilybeauty_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Emily</a> explains that most of her clients come in every three weeks to maintain their BIAB nails. But she notes that if there’s proper nail prep, a BIAB set can last for much longer. That said, keeping BIAB nails on for longer than four weeks isn’t recommended, as lifting can allow water to get trapped beneath the gel and encourage bacterial growth. After three or four weeks, BIAB nails can either be infilled or soaked off.  </p>



<h2>Is there anyone who shouldn’t have BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>Both Emily and Jordan note that those with extremely damaged nails (for example, very thin, extremely brittle, and lifting away from the nail bed) shouldn’t get BIAB nails. In some cases, those with conditions like psoriasis may also want to avoid BIAB nails. “Applying BIAB directly to a severely damaged nail bed can cause heat spikes — a stinging sensation on the nail bed — and the product should not come into contact with skin,” says Jordan.  </p>



<p>A qualified nail tech will let you know whether you’re a suitable candidate for BIAB and can create a treatment plan that’s best suited to your nails. Happily, Emily said she’s never had to turn anyone away from BIAB nails.  </p>

<h2>Are there any downsides to BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>“BIAB does take a little longer to soak off compared to gel polish,” says Jordan, but as long as the top coat is filed and broken down, this isn’t a major issue. “It can also make your nails grow out very fast,” she adds, “so you may need to have manicures more frequently if you don’t like the look of regrowth.”  </p>



<p>At present, BIAB has no downsides for Emily. “My clients and I are happy with the results, and it has created a low-maintenance manicure which is great for a busy lifestyle,” she says.   </p>

<h2>Where can you get BIAB nails, and how much do BIAB nails cost?  </h2>



<p>Today, BIAB is just as widely available as gel polish — if you’re unsure, simply call your local nail salon and ask specifically for the treatment.  </p>



<p>The cost of nails always depends on where you live, with cities being the most expensive. In New York and LA, for example, a typical price range for basic BIAB is between $40 to $80. </p>

<p>Something’s been amiss when I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wash my hair</a>. Instead of the odd few strands escaping — totally normal, by the way — my hands have been filled with near-chunks of hair. It’s a conundrum I can’t crack, because at a glance my hair still looks <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">long and healthy</a>; it just seems that I’m losing more of it. And I’m not the only one. Countless friends have texted me in a panic, convinced their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/female-pattern-hair-loss-baldness-experience"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair is coming out</a> more than usual. Interestingly, TikTok’s hair experts appear to have diagnosed it. Apparently, we’re all experiencing the big <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@abbeyyung/video/7546699386563120414"">winter hair shed</a>. </p>



<p>If I weren’t going through it myself, I’d have assumed winter hair shedding was a myth. I mean, how many more things — besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dry hands</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cracked lips</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dull-skin-causes-dermatologist-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dull skin</a> — can we take? But reaching out to my little black book of experts has proven otherwise. On the plus side, there’s usually nothing to worry about, but here’s everything I’ve learned from the pros about managing it.  </p>



<h2>Firstly, what is hair shedding — and is it normal? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dermatologist_adel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Aamna Adel</a>, consultant dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooOoT-AkJdIvdreb1LWiY2WzlEBHvpTercvOTYFAfbdSZM0Rq0Q"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute hair</a>, says that hair shedding is a normal part of the growth cycle: “Each hair on your scalp goes through phases of growth (otherwise known as anagen), transition (catagen), and rest (telogen).” Dr. Adel adds, “At the end of the cycle, the hair sheds to make room for a new one to grow in. So yes, some shedding is completely normal and happens continuously.” </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/afopeatoyebi/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</a>, a certified trichologist and cosmetic chemist, adds that on a healthy scalp, anything between 10 to 15% of total hairs are in the telogen or exogen phase at any given point in time, which means that some hair shedding is natural all year round. “It’s normal to shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day,” says Atoyebi, but she adds that this shouldn’t be confused with hair fall from breakage. “This is where the hair shaft fractures, as opposed to falls, from the root,” she explains. You can usually tell the difference because broken hairs are shorter, while hairs that have been shed naturally tend to have a white bulb at the end. </p>



<p>While some shedding is natural, Atoyebi says how much you lose can be influenced by things like stress, illness, nutritional deficiencies — including low protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B12 — as well as hormonal changes, such as pregnancy or certain forms of hormonal contraception. Dr. Adel says that if your hair is thicker or longer, or if you skip hair washing, shedding might appear more obvious. </p>



<p>Some evidence suggests telogen — the resting phase — varies slightly across ethnicities, says Atoyebi. But there’s no data showing that shedding changes with hair type. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but the increased shedding people might notice could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors like stress and nutritional deficiencies.</p><cite>certified trichologist Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Is winter hair shedding real? How can you manage it? </h2>



<p>Dr. Adel notes that many people notice increased shedding in winter, and that there could be a handful of reasons why. First, what she calls seasonal hair cycling: “Some studies suggest more hairs enter the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320509854_Seasonality_of_hair_loss_a_time_series_analysis_of_Google_Trends_data_2004_to_2016"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">shedding phase in autumn</a> and early winter, possibly as a delayed response to summer UV exposure,” says Dr. Adel.  </p>



<p>Second, a dry scalp and hair: “Cold air outside and central heating indoors strip moisture from the scalp, which can disrupt the scalp barrier,” explains Dr. Adel. Last, lifestyle changes: “Reduced sunlight (and therefore vitamin D), higher stress levels, and nutritional changes during winter can all play a role,” says Dr. Adel. She emphasizes that winter shedding is usually temporary, not true hair loss. </p>



<p>Atoyebi says that winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but she echoes that the increased shedding lots of people might notice in winter could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors: “Think stress, illness, and hormonal and nutritional imbalances that commonly accompany the season,” says Atoyebi. Depending on where you live, a lack of sunlight might also be a factor. Reduced sunlight can impact your body’s circadian rhythm — basically, your internal body clock. This could then reduce your quality of sleep. “All of which can impair the immune resilience your body needs to ward off and recover from said triggers,” says Atoyebi.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, you can support your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. </p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>How can you prevent winter hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, Atoyebi suggests supporting your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. “This includes prioritizing a nutrient-dense diet and correcting common deficiencies associated with hair shedding, particularly iron (ferritin), vitamin D, zinc, B12 or folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and ensuring adequate protein intake,” she says. </p>



<p>While I’m not deficient in iron myself, a blood test showed that I needed to increase my vitamin D and folate intake. I also take omega-3, 6, and 9 daily — and I’m noticing a positive difference in my hair shedding.</p>



<p>Besides addressing deficiencies, Dr. Adel suggests prioritizing scalp care, since a healthy scalp supports better hair growth. She recommends using scalp-focused treatments and conditioners to lock in moisture, while avoiding over-scrubbing or harsh exfoliation. I love the ritual of applying <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/products/serum?srsltid=AfmBOopKhDFqOD3FYXENxfKnMQEtdQkxG2VScpENuPF5ZdcdWbFx-5Om"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute’s Density &amp; Repair Scalp Serum</a>, which moisturizes, exfoliates, and soothes the scalp with panthenol, salicylic acid, and niacinamide. Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopbtKLBw_Cnqztua7eIW4TNy2aF4O66SWfl-xcaHqGHwN4WyAbH"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum</a>, with baicapil, an ingredient proven to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">strengthen hair follicles</a>. </p>





<p>Dr. Adel continues, “Don’t avoid washing your hair out of fear of shedding, as this can actually make things worse. Instead, use gentle shampoos, focus on the scalp [when washing], and try not to use overly hot water.” Since I’ve started washing my hair more regularly — every two to three days, and focusing more on the scalp than the lengths — I’ve noticed far less hair shedding each time.</p>



<p>Dr. Adel adds that aggressive towel-drying, tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and even friction from tight scarves and hats can all encourage breakage, so it’s important to be mindful. I swear by a gentle <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmicrofiber-hair-towel-P507559"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">microfiber towel.</a></p>





<h2>When should you see a doctor about hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Atoyebi shares a note of encouragement to those experiencing winter shedding: “Although it can be very unsettling, diffuse shedding [where hair sheds evenly across the scalp] does not lead to baldness,” she says. “Provided that the underlying trigger is addressed, this kind of shedding is completely reversible, with regrowth starting as soon as three months after addressing the trigger.” </p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re worried about the rate at which your hair is shedding, Atoyebi recommends seeing your doctor or a certified trichologist for a blood test: “This can help identify emerging deficiencies or hormonal imbalances, allowing for appropriate, clinician-guided supplementation,” she says.  </p>

<p>A new year means a new set of trending colors for the style set to swoon over. Last year was all about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellow</a>; before that, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie pink</a> and a highlighter shade of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">Brat green</a> <em>were</em> the moment. But fashion experts predict that something a little less definitive will infiltrate the market in 2026. Enter specific hues and color combinations that are as vibrant as they are complimentary to each other. “Most of us aren’t living in just one mood or style; instead we’re balancing calm with chaos, and seriousness with play,” says Xanthe Wells, VP of Global Creative at <a href=""https://newsroom.pinterest.com/news/from-cool-blue-to-persimmon-meet-the-2026-pinterest-palette/"">Pinterest</a>. The colors of 2026, she adds: “really capture how layered life feels right now.” <br /><br />More than a handful of bright colors have already popped up on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">runways</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">red carpets</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2026-street-style"">street-style</a> looks for 2026, proving that the muted neutrals that defined “quiet luxury” are on the decline and something more effervescent is blooming in its place. From traditional primary pigments — red, blue, and yellow — to unexpected pairings like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pantone-color-of-the-year-2025-mocha-mousse"">chocolate brown</a> and frost blue, this more dynamic approach is a great opportunity to let your mood shine. “Color has become a language people use to express who they are and intentionally shape how they want to feel,” Wells says. Not yet convinced? Continue ahead for more about the colors that will reign supreme in 2026 fashion.</p>

<h2>Jade Green</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956899.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the latest collection from designers such as <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-menswear/amiri/slideshow/collection#26"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Acne Studios</a>, then you know that the color jade is already one of the hues of the season. According to Wells, this shade of green should feel more grounded than the playful mint color that might already be in your closet, allowing it to double as a neutral all year long. <br /><br />“The color blends serenity with sophisticated elegance, yet still makes a statement,” Wells says. Those looking for a bolder take on jade should consider investing in a pair of  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">sneakers</a> so punchy, they go with nearly anything and everything.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Primary Palettes</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956902.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Some of the best color combinations are the ones that may seem a little too on the nose. For proof, look to the number of designers who harnessed a primary color palette –– yellow, blue, and red –– in recent collections. At <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loewe</a>, this manifested in tulip-shaped leather jackets and strategically-layered basics, whereas <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection#7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DSquared2</a> took a more eclectic approach reminiscent of streetwear in the ‘90s. Colorblocked prints and stripes are a great way to embrace the trend, while styling individually-hued pieces together makes a Crayola-level impact.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Plum Noir</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956903.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>A stark contrast to many of the bright, playful colors on trend for 2026, dark plum noir is moody yet striking, making it a great alternative for those who tend to wear all black. Between the rich suede outerwear from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/tom-ford/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford</a> and the romantic goth aesthetic of Rabanne’s pleated babydoll dresses, the deep berry hue has the power to work as both a staple and an accent in your wardrobe. Plus, it pairs well with other standout shades of the season, including electric wasabi and soft persimmon (more on that below). <br /><br />“They feel unexpected at first glance, but when you see them together, it just clicks and creates this intriguing balance,” Wells explains. “Plum noir brings this cool, collected depth, while wasabi instantly wakes up a space.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Electric Wasabi</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956901.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>From <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/prada/slideshow/collection#7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Prada</a> to <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/azzedine-alaia/slideshow/collection#36"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alaïa</a> to the fringed clutch that creative director Jonathan Anderson presented at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-couture/christian-dior/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dior,</a> a neon yellow shade of green –– we’re dubbing it electric wasabi –– will reign supreme for 2026. Though it may seem intimidating for some, the key is to start small. A pair of statement flats can be a great place to start.<br /><br />“You can also layer a colorful piece under a neutral jacket or sweater,” Wells says. “The goal is to sprinkle in color in ways that feel authentic to you.” For a more head-turning look, layer a brightly-colored bra under a sheer top or peeking over a plunging neckline.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Shocking Pink</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956904.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The industry’s penchant for pink is set to continue well into 2026. The bright magenta of shocking pink consistently popped up across the latest runway collections. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/mm6-maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/collection#17"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">MM6 Maison Margiela</a> showcased head-to-toe pink looks, while <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#34"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry</a> offered ample style inspo by adding a neon pink scarf to an otherwise muted outfit. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">Bright tights</a> underneath mini dresses and sheer skirts are another great option if you’re looking to (literally) dip your foot into the trend instead of jumping right in. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chocolate Brown &amp; Blue Frost</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956906.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mint chocolate chip, anyone? Repurpose the icy blue pieces you likely added to your closet in 2025 by pairing them with chocolate brown. If you’re looking for some cold-weather inspiration, turn to the team at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-menswear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection#13"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Acne Studios</a>, who layered a brown <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer coat</a> with a light-blue shirt peeking out from underneath in their fall 2026 collection. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/emilia-wickstead/slideshow/collection#22"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emilia Wickstead</a>, meanwhile, offered up a host of sweaters in cheery stripes for a more nostalgic feel. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Juicy Persimmon </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956905.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’d like to look good enough to eat, try on a few pieces in the rich, reddish shade of orange aptly named persimmon. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/christopher-john-rogers/slideshow/collection#23"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christopher John Rogers</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/no-21/slideshow/collection#4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">No. 21</a> were just a few of the brands who embraced the bright hue during the Spring 2026 collections, with bold separates and monochromatic looks galore. Despite the tropical feel, the shade transitions well into the winter months, too — persimmon-colored cold-weather accessories like a beanie or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">hooded scarf</a> are bound to make a statement.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Turquoise</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956900.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Brands all around the world, including <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/shanghai-spring-2026/xu-zhi/slideshow/collection#43"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Xu Zhi</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/patou/slideshow/collection#36"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Patou</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/j-w-anderson/slideshow/collection#31"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">JW Anderson</a> are incorporating turquoise into their collections for fall 2026, making it a must-have shade for the seasons ahead. Whether you invest in turquoise outerwear à la the latest <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#21"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry</a> collection or opt for a jewel-toned pair of leather gloves, the standout hue is a lot easier to integrate into your wardrobe than you may think. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, February is not playing around. This is an eclipse month, the official start of the Year of the Fire House, and one of those rare chapters where it feels like the universe is flipping multiple switches at once. The month opens with a vibrant Full Moon in Leo on February 1<sup>st</sup>, a heart-forward, spotlight-stealing lunation that kicks off eclipse season. </p>



<p>Since this Full Moon arrives just before a solar eclipse, it acts as a culmination point, illuminating themes that began around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/new-moon-in-leo-2025-july-horoscope-meaning-effects"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Leo New Moon</a> six months ago. Think creativity, confidence, romance, leadership, and self-expression. Where were you dimming your light last summer, and where are you finally ready to celebrate yourself now? The shadow here is ego or performative confidence, but the medicine is remembering that taking up space does not require apology. </p>



<p>Just two days later, we hit another major milestone as Uranus, the Planet of Surprise, stations direct in Taurus for the final stretch of its transit, something we will not see again in our lifetimes. This is big. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been shaking up our relationship with money, food systems, land, labor, and material security. As it moves forward without another retrograde in this sign, expect acceleration. </p>



<p>Economically and socially, conversations around value, resources, sustainability, and wealth distribution may reach turning points. Politically, this can look like sudden shifts tied to land, currency, or supply chains. On a personal level, it is about finally acting on the changes you’ve been circling for years. Your comfort zone is officially obsolete. </p>



<p>The first half of February carries a distinctly Aquarian flavor. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Pluto all in Aquarius, the collective mood is future-focused, innovative, and a little rebellious. We’re thinking bigger than ourselves, questioning systems, and imagining new ways of living and organizing. Then, starting February 6th, the energy softens as Mercury enters Pisces, followed by Venus entering Pisces on February 10th. This shift brings emotion, intuition, and compassion back into the picture. Logic gives way to feeling and vision meets vulnerability. It’s a reminder that even as we dream up new futures, we still need tenderness, beauty, and emotional honesty to sustain them. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the astrology takes a sharp turn as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, joining Neptune, which recently made the same move. After years of Saturn in Pisces fog, this is a wake-up call. Saturn in Aries is about discipline, courage, and taking responsibility for your desires. No more waiting for permission. No more spiritual bypassing. When Saturn and Neptune conjoin on February 20th, the message is loud and clear: our dreams require structure and inspiration needs action. This is a rare alignment that supports launching creative projects, movements, or personal initiatives that feel both visionary and grounded. The shadow of the conjunction is ego battles or authority figures posturing for dominance, especially on a global scale. The higher path is conscious leadership that builds rather than destroys. </p>



<p>The centerpiece of the month is the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius at 28 degrees, a potent reset that squares Uranus in Taurus. This is not subtle energy. Expect breakthroughs, plot twists, and moments that force rapid change. Collectively, this can coincide with political shocks, technological shifts, or sudden awakenings that demand adaptability. Personally, you may feel restless, electrified, and oddly optimistic all at once. Life may move faster than planned. The key is practicing flexibility. </p>



<p>Pisces Season begins the very next day on February 18th, reminding us that even during revolution, rest matters. As Mercury retrograde begins on February 26th in Pisces, the month closes with an invitation to slow down, reflect, and release. Forgive where you can. Tie up loose ends, sleep more, create more, and love more. You cannot spell r<strong><em>evol</em></strong>ution without love, and this month reminds us that the most sustainable change always begins in the heart. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831458.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, February starts with fireworks, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of creativity, faith, freedom, and self-expression, reminding you that you were never meant to play small. This is a feel-good, heart-opening moment where passion projects, romantic sparks, or creative risks reach a turning point. You may feel inspired to put yourself out there, share your work, or follow joy more unapologetically. The shadow, though, is burnout or overconfidence. Leo Full Moons can make everything feel urgent and dramatic, so pace yourself. You do not need to prove your brilliance by exhausting yourself. Let confidence come from authenticity, not pressure. </p>



<p>A few days later, the energy shifts in your favor as Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for its final stretch. This is a green light moment. Financial progress that felt stalled can suddenly move forward, and new ideas around income, pricing, or independence may land quickly. Because Uranus <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">rules Aquarius season</a>, which dominates most of February in your friendship, technology, and community sector, this is also a powerful time to show up more online, collaborate, or lean into digital platforms. Friendships, group projects, and social media can become surprisingly lucrative or confidence-boosting. Say yes to connections that feel future-focused and mutually supportive, especially if they align with your long-term goals. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight turns fully toward you as Saturn enters your sign on February 13th, beginning a two-year chapter of growth, responsibility, and leadership. This is not light energy, but it is meaningful. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, to commit to who you are becoming, and to step into authority over your life. Some days may feel heavy, like the pressure is on, but here’s the magic: Neptune is also in your sign, adding vision, faith, and imagination. When Saturn and Neptune meet on February 20th, you experience a rare blend of discipline and dreaminess. This is a metamorphosis moment. You’re learning how to build your dreams in real time. The start of the Year of the Fire Horse, paired with the Aquarius solar eclipse in your community sector, reinforces this theme. You’re not just changing yourself, you’re changing how you lead, inspire, and move within the collective. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins on February 18th, shifting your focus inward. After such an activating start to the year, you’re invited to rest, reflect, and reconnect with your spiritual side. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages solitude, forgiveness, and tying up loose emotional ends. This is not a slowdown, it’s sacred preparation. The next four weeks are about integrating everything you’ve learned, releasing old identities, and clearing space for your birthday season and the astrological new year ahead. Trust that stepping back now helps you come back stronger, wiser, and more aligned than ever. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, February marks a once-in-a-lifetime turning point for you. When Uranus stations direct in your sign early this month, it officially enters the final stretch of a transit you will not experience again in this lifetime. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been reshaping your identity, your body, your confidence, and your relationship to stability. Now, there’s no more backtracking. The final months of this transit, through to April 26th, are about embodiment. This is your moment to fully <em>own </em>the version of yourself that has been quietly emerging. Radical self-acceptance, personal reinvention, and freedom from old labels are not optional anymore… they’re the assignment. The more you resist change, the louder it gets. The more you cooperate, the more empowered you feel. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st sets the tone by illuminating your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. You may feel pulled between craving comfort and needing independence. This Full Moon can bring breakthroughs around living situations, family roles, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/08/11094940/workplace-boundaries-unhealthy-environment"">or emotional boundaries</a>. The magic here is realizing that you can create safety without staying small. The shadow is stubbornness or emotional defensiveness. Let yourself feel proud of how far you have come, but stay open to growth. Security does not mean stagnation anymore. </p>



<p>Mid-month, things get real as we approach the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which lands in your career and public life sector and squares Uranus now direct in your sign. This is major. Eclipses bring sudden shifts, and this one may force a choice between authenticity and expectation. Career pivots, changes in direction, or moments of visibility may arrive unexpectedly. The tension is real, but it is productive. If something collapses or feels unstable, it is because it cannot come with you into the next chapter. This eclipse asks you to trust the version of yourself that Uranus has been sculpting for years, even if the world has not fully caught up yet. </p>



<p>As February unfolds,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects""> Aquarius Season keeps</a> your focus on ambition and long-term goals, while Saturn entering Aries on February 13th pushes you to take rest, healing, and mental health seriously. You’re learning that growth requires recovery, not just effort. By the time Pisces Season begins later in the month, the energy softens, encouraging spiritual grounding and community support. Mercury retrograde toward the end of February invites reflection rather than reaction. Taurus, this isn’t a month to rush. It’s a month to <em>claim</em>. You’re stepping into the final chapter of a long reinvention. Make it intentional, make it honest, and make it yours. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, February feels like a breath of fresh air and a spark to the mind all at once. The month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and self-expression sector. This is a moment of clarity around your voice. A conversation, announcement, creative project, or piece of writing may reach a culmination point. You may feel more confident sharing your thoughts or finally being seen for your intelligence and creativity. The shadow is overperforming or feeling like you have to say everything at once. Let your words land with intention. You don’t need to dominate the room to make an impact. </p>



<p>One of the biggest themes for you this month is movement, mentally, socially, and spiritually. With Uranus now direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, healing, and intuition sector, breakthroughs may come quietly but powerfully. Old fears, limiting beliefs, or mental habits you’ve outgrown are ready to dissolve for good during the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus through April. Pay attention to dreams, sudden insights, or moments of clarity that arrive out of nowhere. As an Air sign, you may be tempted to overthink these shifts, but this transit works best when you trust your inner knowing rather than analyzing it to death. </p>



<p>Mid-month brings a major reset with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, landing in your fellow Air sign and activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture vision. This eclipse kicks off the Year of the Fire Horse, and for you, it feels like momentum returning after a period of mental fog. Opportunities to expand your world, learn something new, or share your ideas more widely may appear suddenly. The square to Uranus means plans may change quickly, but those changes are purposeful. Stay flexible. This is not about controlling the path, but following the curiosity that pulls you forward. </p>



<p>As the month winds down, the focus shifts to your career and public life as Pisces season begins, followed by Mercury retrograde on February 26th in your professional sector. Because Mercury is your ruling planet, you will feel this deeply. Work plans may slow, feedback may feel confusing, or old goals may need revision. This is not a failure moment, it is a reroute. Instead of spiraling, use this time to reflect on what success actually means to you now. Dream up new possibilities without forcing immediate answers. February is asking you to trust that clarity arrives when you stop rushing it. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, February hits different for you because you’re ruled by the moon, and this month is basically a lunar rollercoaster in the best and most transformative way. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your money, self-worth, and security sector, bringing big feelings around value, confidence, and what you deserve. This can look like a financial win, a reality check, or a moment where you finally realize you’ve been underestimating yourself. Because eclipse season begins immediately after, emotions may feel heightened, dramatic, or extra revealing. Try not to react impulsively. Lunar energy always passes, but the insights it brings are lasting. If something feels loud, it’s because it needs your attention, not your panic. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight intensifies with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which activates your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. For a moon-ruled sign, eclipses can feel like emotional plot twists. You may experience breakthroughs around trust, vulnerability, finances tied to others, or emotional bonds that no longer feel safe or reciprocal. Things may shift quickly, especially as this eclipse squares Uranus, bringing sudden realizations or changes. Breathe through it… What’s being cleared now is making space for deeper, healthier connections. You are not losing control, you’re releasing emotional weight you were never meant to carry alone. </p>



<p>One of the most important long-term themes for you begins this month as Saturn and Neptune both move through Aries, your career and public life sector. Yes, this is very different energy from your natural watery rhythm, but it is also powerful. Aries is a fellow Cardinal sign, which means you’re being asked to lead, initiate, and take yourself seriously in new ways. Saturn may bring pressure, responsibility, or moments of self-doubt around your path, while Neptune adds vision, faith, and creativity. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel a strong pull toward a new purpose or calling. The key is not shrinking in the presence of fire. You don’t need to become someone else to succeed. Lead with emotional intelligence. Your sensitivity is not a weakness here, it is your edge. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces season begins, harmonizing with your Cancer sun and offering emotional relief. After a month of intensity, Pisces Season invites rest, spiritual reflection, creativity, and compassion. Mercury retrograde late in the month encourages you to slow down, revisit old beliefs, and give yourself grace. You’re not behind… you’re integrating. February teaches you that emotional courage is just as powerful as action. When you honor your feelings instead of fighting them, you move forward with far more strength than you realize. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, February opens with <em>your </em>moment in the spotlight, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lands in your identity, confidence, and self-expression sector, officially kicking oﬀ eclipse season and reminding everyone who the main character is. This is a powerful culmination point tied to intentions you set<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/leo-season-2025-horoscope-july-meaning-effects""> around Leo Season</a> last summer. You may feel seen, celebrated, or finally ready to own a version of yourself you’ve been growing into quietly. Creativity, romance, leadership, and self-belief are amplified. The shadow is overdoing it, overpromising, or feeling crushed if the applause doesn’t come fast enough. Let this Full Moon be about authentic confidence, not performance. You don’t need to prove anything… your presence already speaks. </p>



<p>For most of the month, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season puts your relationships</a> front and center, and things get real fast. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse later in the month activates your partnership sector and squares Uranus in Taurus, which has been shaking up your home, family, and emotional foundation for years. Translation: relationship dynamics may force conversations you’ve been avoiding. A partnership could change form, deepen, or end so that something more honest can take its place. Living situations, family roles, or emotional attachments may suddenly feel incompatible with who you’re becoming. This eclipse isn’t the most comfortable, but it is necessary. Breakthroughs arrive when you stop trying to control the narrative and allow the truth to surface, even if it disrupts the status quo. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Saturn and Neptune in Aries begin reshaping your beliefs, worldview, and sense of purpose. You’re being asked to commit to a bigger vision for your life, not just chase validation. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel called to step into a leadership role, spiritual path, or long-term goal that requires courage and consistency. The challenge is impatience. Fire wants everything now, but this chapter rewards faith paired with discipline. Trust that clarity builds through action, not just confidence. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy deepens as Pisces Season activates your intimacy, shared resources, and healing sector. After a very visible, relationally charged start to the month, you’re invited inward. Emotional honesty, vulnerability, and energetic cleanup become priorities. Mercury retrograde late in February encourages reflection around trust, finances tied to others, and emotional boundaries. This is not a step back, it’s integration. February teaches you that true main-character energy isn’t about being adored, it’s about being aligned. When you honor that, everything else follows. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, February is not just another month for you. It’s a preview episode. The eclipse storyline unfolding now is actively leading toward the total lunar eclipse in your sign on 3/3/2026, and what you feel, notice, or question around mid-February is part of a much bigger arc. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your rest, healing, and subconscious sector, stirring emotions, memories, and realizations that may not fully make sense yet. That’s okay. This is your cue to slow down and listen. The work right now isn’t fixing or optimizing. It’s observing patterns, especially around burnout, self-criticism, or where you’ve been carrying more than your share. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season and</a> the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activate your work, wellness, and daily routines sector. This is major for you. Eclipses here can bring sudden shifts in schedule, job dynamics, health habits, or how you structure your days. Something may stop working the way it used to, and that’s intentional. This eclipse is asking you to redesign your life in a way that supports your energy, not just your productivity. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes may feel abrupt or inconvenient, but they’re opening the door to a more sustainable rhythm. Think of this as the first draft. The full revelation comes in March. </p>



<p>Relationships also play a central role this month as Pisces season begins on February 18th, activating your partnership sector. Emotional sensitivity increases, and you may feel more aware of imbalances, unspoken expectations, or where you’ve been over-functioning in connection. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages reflection rather than confrontation. This is not about making final decisions yet. It’s about noticing how your body responds to certain people and commitments. Your nervous system is giving you data. Trust it. </p>



<p>The most important preparation you can do now is rest, honesty, and gentle recalibration. February is helping you shed layers before the 3/3 Virgo eclipse asks you to step into a new version of yourself. You don’t need to rush clarity. You need to protect your energy, simplify where possible, and stay curious about what’s ending naturally. This is not a breakdown… it’s a sacred edit. And you are right on time. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, February opens with a clarifying moment as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This lunation asks you to look closely at who you’re building with and where you truly belong. You may feel proud of a collective achievement, step into a more visible role within a group, or realize that certain social dynamics no longer fit the future you’re envisioning. The shadow here is staying connected out of obligation or fear of rocking the boat. Let this Full Moon remind you that alignment matters more than approval. </p>



<p>As the month moves forward, the tone deepens significantly. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your partnership and marriage sector for the next several years. This is a major chapter opener. Saturn brings reality checks, boundaries, and long-term commitments, while Neptune dissolves illusions and asks for soul-level honesty. Together, they begin reshaping how you approach relationships of all kinds. Some connections may feel heavier, more serious, or more demanding, while others reveal whether they can actually go the distance. The most important shift, though, starts internally. Your relationship with yourself is being redefined, and from that place, your standards naturally rise. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector, adding unpredictability to the mix. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, sparks can fly unexpectedly. A creative breakthrough, romantic turning point, or sudden realization about what truly brings you joy may arrive quickly. While this energy can feel destabilizing, it’s also liberating. It challenges you to choose pleasure, authenticity, and passion without apologizing or over-explaining. If something cracks open now, it’s because it was limiting your ability to feel alive. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward work, wellness, and daily balance, encouraging you to slow down and integrate everything you’ve learned. Mercury retrograde later in February asks you to revisit habits, commitments, and routines that affect your energy. Libra, February is not about rushing relationship decisions. It’s about clarity, honesty, and laying a foundation that can actually support love, partnership, and self-respect over time. The choices you make now echo far beyond this month, so trust the pacing. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, February opens with a moment that puts you <em>on the map</em>, whether you asked for it or not. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your career, reputation, and legacy sector, bringing a culmination or revelation around your professional life. This could look like recognition, a new role, a public win, or the realization that the version of success you’ve been chasing no longer fits. And yes, both can be true at the same time. The shadow of this Full Moon is over-identifying with achievement or feeling pressure to perform. The lesson is visibility without self-betrayal. Let yourself be seen, but not at the cost of your well-being. </p>



<p>Around this same time, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing a noticeable shift in your partnership and relationship sector. After years of unpredictability, surprises, and emotional curveballs in one-on-one dynamics, things begin to stabilize in a new way. Not “back to normal,” but clearer. You may feel more grounded in what you want from relationships, less reactive to sudden changes, and more confident advocating for space, honesty, or freedom. This direct motion helps rebalance your relational life, especially after a long period of adapting to the unexpected. The lesson now is integration. You don’t have to abandon intimacy to protect your independence. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, a deeper shift begins as Neptune and Saturn move through Aries, your work, routines, and energy-management sector. Neptune is already here, heightening your sensitivity to environments, tasks, and expectations that drain you. You’re no longer willing to tolerate work that feels misaligned, performative, or soul-sucking. Saturn’s entry on February 13th, followed by their conjunction on February 20th, asks you to restructure how you work, not just what you work toward. Boundaries become non-negotiable. You may need to be a little more “selfish” with your energy, and that’s not a flaw, it’s wisdom. This is the beginning of a longer chapter where sustainable success matters more than grinding for approval. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your home and emotional foundations sector, creating tension between public life and private needs. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes around living situations, family dynamics, or emotional security may arrive suddenly. You may realize that certain professional goals require a different kind of support system, or that your current setup is no longer compatible with the life you’re building. The Leo–Aquarius polarity running through this month makes one thing clear: you can’t keep sacrificing your inner world for external validation. </p>



<p>By the end of February, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces Season begins, harmonizing with your Scorpio nature. This brings more creativity, romance, play, and emotional release. You’re reminded that joy is not a reward for productivity, it’s a necessity. Mercury retrograde later in the month invites reflection rather than action, helping you integrate everything you’ve learned. Scorpio, this eclipse season isn’t just about career breakthroughs, it’s about finally letting the world see the full range of what you oﬀer. You have talents, gifts, and ideas that deserve daylight. Stop hiding them. The right people are ready to receive what you’ve been holding back. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, February opens with a spark that reignites your sense of purpose and possibility. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of travel, education, belief systems, and long-term vision, bringing clarity or culmination around a dream you’ve been nurturing since last summer. You may feel ready to take a leap, say yes to an opportunity, or finally trust a path that once felt uncertain. This Full Moon is about faith, but the shadow is overconfidence or assuming everything will work out without eﬀort. Let inspiration lead you forward, but back it up with follow-through. </p>



<p>The month continues with a strong Aquarian influence as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius season activates</a> your communication, learning, and local community sector. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse mid-month brings sudden shifts in how you share ideas, connect, or move through your daily environment. Conversations, contracts, or plans may change quickly, but these shifts are meant to open new doors. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, flexibility is essential. The more open you are to rerouting, the easier this transition becomes. Think curiosity over control. </p>



<p>A major long-term shift arrives as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your sector of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This marks the beginning of a more serious relationship with your passions. You’re being asked to commit to what lights you up, not just chase excitement. Neptune brings imagination and inspiration, while Saturn asks for structure and discipline. Together, they help you turn play into purpose. The challenge is impatience. Creative growth takes time, even when the vision feels urgent. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins, drawing your focus toward home, emotional grounding, and rest. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than action, especially around family matters or personal decisions. This is a moment to slow down, integrate the lessons of an intense month, and reconnect with what feels emotionally supportive. Sagittarius, February reminds you that expansion doesn’t always mean movement. Sometimes growth happens when you let yourself land.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, February opens with a moment that asks you to slow down and feel before you act. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth, bringing a culmination around trust, vulnerability, or financial entanglements. This can look like an important conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or a moment where you see clearly what feels reciprocal and what doesn’t. The shadow here is control or emotional withdrawal. The medicine is honesty. Let yourself be real about what you need instead of managing everything from behind the scenes. </p>



<p>The bigger shift arrives mid-month, and for you, it’s <em>major</em>. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, ending its two-and-a-half-year journey through Pisces. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’ve felt Saturn in Pisces deeply, often as emotional fatigue, blurred boundaries, or the pressure to hold space for others without clear structure. Saturn moving into Aries is a sharp pivot. This is fire, not water. Action, not ambiguity. But here’s the tension: Aries squares Capricorn. Over the next two years, you may feel challenged to act faster than you’re comfortable with, to initiate before everything feels perfectly planned. Frustration can arise if you cling too tightly to control. The growth edge is learning when to lead boldly instead of cautiously. You don’t lose authority by adapting, you expand it. </p>



<p>That lesson intensifies as Saturn conjoins Neptune on February 20th, activating your home, family, and emotional foundations sector. This is about restructuring your inner world, not just your external goals. You may feel called to redefine what stability actually means, where you live, who you build with, or how you emotionally ground yourself. Neptune adds sensitivity and imagination, while Saturn demands realism. Together, they ask you to build a life that supports your nervous system, not just your resume. This is not about abandoning ambition, it’s about rooting it somewhere sustainable. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward communication, mindset, and emotional processing. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than decisive action. Old conversations may resurface. Plans may need revising. Take that as a gift, not a setback. Capricorn, February is a turning point. You’re learning how to lead without carrying everything alone, how to adapt without losing yourself, and how to build a future that feels as solid internally as it looks externally. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, February opens with your relationships front and center as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your partnership sector. This is a culmination point around love, commitment, collaboration, or even long-standing dynamics that have needed clarity for a while. You may feel seen by someone in a new way or finally realize where a relationship has been more about performance than presence. The shadow here is ego clashes or projecting instead of listening. The growth is learning that real connection does not threaten your independence, it strengthens it. </p>



<p>Then, everything pivots toward <em>you</em>. The first three weeks of February are dominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">by Aquarius Season</a>, and this year, it’s not subtle. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign is a major identity reset, one that you will continue to feel echoes of for the next two years. Eclipses in your sign are not casual… they’re chapter-defining. This one asks you to shed an old version of yourself, whether that’s a role, label, or way of moving through the world that no longer fits. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, your modern ruler, changes may feel sudden or destabilizing at first. Plans can shift quickly. Your sense of direction may evolve overnight. Trust that whatever is cracking open now is making room for a more authentic version of you to emerge. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Uranus stations direct in Taurus early in the month, ending its final retrograde in a sign it will not revisit in your lifetime. As a Uranus-ruled sign, you feel this shift deeply. This direct motion brings momentum to changes around home, family, emotional security, and where you put down roots. Uranus’ shift direct reminds you that growth requires movement, even when it disrupts comfort. This isn’t about chaos for chaos’ sake. It’s about liberation. This February, the universe is nudging you to choose evolution over familiarity. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the plot thickens as Saturn, your traditional ruler, enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th. Saturn moving into Aries activates your communication, mindset, and learning sector, asking you to take your ideas seriously and follow through on them. This is about disciplined thinking, intentional speech, and committing to a vision rather than floating between possibilities. With Neptune involved, dreams feel vivid, but Saturn insists on structure. The tension you may feel is between wanting freedom and needing responsibility. The breakthrough comes when you realize you can have both. Aquarius, February is a spotlight moment. You’re being reshaped in real time. Let the world see you as you are becoming, not as you used to be. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, of all the signs, you <em>made it</em>. February marks the end of one of the most intense chapters of your life as Saturn finally leaves your sign, closing a cycle that began back in 2023. This transit has tested your boundaries, maturity, resilience, and sense of self in ways that few people around you could fully see. You were asked to grow up, and show up, even when you were tired, unsure, or grieving old versions of yourself. The weight begins to lift this month, and while you’re not magically “done” with the lessons, you’re done carrying them alone. Take a moment to honor yourself. Seriously. </p>



<p>Before Saturn fully changes the game, the month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, activating your work, health, and daily routines sector. This can bring clarity around habits, jobs, or responsibilities that have been draining you. You may realize how much you’ve been doing on empty, or finally see which systems no longer support your energy. The shadow is pushing through exhaustion just to prove you can. You don’t need to prove anything anymore. This Full Moon asks you to choose sustainability over self-sacrifice. </p>



<p>The real plot twist arrives mid-month when Saturn enters Aries, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for the next two years. At first glance, this could sound intense, Saturn is still Saturn, after all. But here’s the magic: Neptune is already in Aries too. This means that for the first time in years, discipline and dreaming are working <em>together </em>for you, especially around finances. Instead of feeling restricted, you’re learning how to build something real from your imagination. Around the Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, you may have a breakthrough around income, pricing your work, or realizing that you’re allowed to be both spiritual and supported. You’re not here to struggle forever. That chapter is closing. </p>



<p>As the month continues, Pisces Season begins, returning the spotlight to you and reminding you who you are beneath the pressure. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse earlier in the month may have stirred subconscious fears or old patterns, but by the end of February, clarity replaces confusion. Mercury retrograde invites reflection, forgiveness, and gentle release rather than big pushes. Pisces, February isn’t about rushing forward. It’s about exhaling. You’ve done the hard part. Now you get to build a life that actually feels like yours, with faith, structure, and self-worth finally aligned. </p>
