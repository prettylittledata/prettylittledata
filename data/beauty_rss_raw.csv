<p>Whether you’re in a relationship, single, or figuring out wth to do with that situationship, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a> invites us to reflect on how we’ve been loving ourselves lately. And while self-love is more about compassion, patience, and boundaries than it is about opening a heart-shaped present, if there’s ever a holiday to treat yourself, it’s this one. And with deadlines, bills, and devastating news headlines, is there a better gift than a moment of peace and tranquility? <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2F&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection</a> was formulated to bring that calm, restful spa-like experience to your bathtub. </p>



<p>Ahead, learn more about the collection, how to use it, and why it deserves a spot in your self-care routine.</p>



<h3><strong>What is Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection and what are the benefits?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty is a sustainable, Los Angeles-based, Latina-owned beauty and skincare brand using natural ingredients to nourish the skin and support self-care rituals. Its Milk &amp; Rose collection makes up the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fradiant-skin-trio&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"">Radiant Skin Trio.</a> It includes a luxurious <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fbody-scrub&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">body scrub </a>crafted from nourishing goat milk, hydrating coconut oil and shea butter, and calming roses that both exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and smooth. Next, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagnesium-salt-soak&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak</a>, which uses Epsom salts, pink himalayan salts, goat milk powder, flower oils, and rose petals to relax your body while also moisturizing your skin so you leave your bath feeling hydrated rather than dried out. And lastly, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fhair-and-body-mist&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hair &amp; Body Mist</a>, which uses rose extract, chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, and Pro Vitamin B5 to hydrate and revitalize your hair and body and leave you smelling as luxurious as the bath you just walked out of.</p>



<h3><strong>What makes Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection special? </strong></h3>





<p>The Milk &amp; Rose Collection blends soothing botanicals, skin-loving milks, and hydrating natural extracts. Many of the products share the same ingredients, like goat milk to hydrate the skin and rose extract, rich in antioxidants, to soothe and brighten the skin. Other ingredients work together to support the skin barrier and promote lasting moisture. For instance, gentle exfoliants like brown sugar and lactic acid smooth away dry skin so nourishing oils, shea butter, and vitamin E can absorb more deeply, while Pro-Vitamin B5 and calming botanicals help soften the skin, lock in hydration, and relax the senses.</p>



<h3><strong>How to use Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty recommends starting with a body scrub to gently exfoliate dead skin cells, rejuvenate dull areas, and support skin repair. When you’re done, draw a warm bath, sprinkle in about ¼ cup of the Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak, and immerse yourself in the milky water and delicate rose petals for about 15 minutes. I like to enhance the experience with a soft candle, light music, and maybe even a good read. When you’re out of the bath, your skin will feel hydrated (and look radiant!), but you’re not done yet. To complete the pampering ritual, spritz some of the Hair &amp; Body Mist all over to smell as softly floral and refreshed as you feel.</p>



<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>





<p>My favorite part of this collection is the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. While the floral petals can be a little annoying to clean up after a shower, I still try to use it once a week. It’s honestly the best scrub I’ve used at this price point because it doesn’t just remove dead skin, it also helps restore moisture and leaves my skin feeling velvety smooth when I step out of the shower. I save the full routine for special occasions, and by special occasions I mean whenever I feel like I need some extra pampering. It really is a treat for all of my senses. At $77, it’s a pretty powerful trio. But if you’re only going to choose one product, I’d absolutely recommend the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>The rumors are true: Fashion is transporting us back to 2016. For proof, look no further than the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">nostalgic shoe trends</a> making a comeback. After seasons and seasons of minimalism and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pierced-fashion-trend-tory-burch-shoes"">quiet luxury</a>, consumers are returning to a more expressive way of clothing themselves in 2026, and they’re starting from the feet up. <br /><br />“There’s a real appetite right now for dressing with more emotion and intention, and less interest in things that feel disposable,” says <a href=""https://www.miista.com/en-US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miista</a> CEO and founder Laura Villasenin. “It’s all about balance: Soft but strong, familiar yet a little unsettling, traditional but rebellious. That contrast feels very honest — it’s how people want to show up now. You can be refined and strange all at once.”<br /><br />There are a slew of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vibram-five-finger-ugly-shoe-trend"">shoe trends</a> making waves in the new year. From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11330463/floral-fashion-3d-flowers-trend"">3D flowers</a> at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/christian-dior/slideshow/collection#11"">Dior</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/proenza-schouler/slideshow/detail#53"">Proenza Schouler</a> that look like they were picked by hand, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">gothic details</a> fueled by brands like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/detail#3"">Alexander McQueen</a>, as well as inspiration derived from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">this year’s color trends</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11933378/margot-robbie-red-carpet-looks"">Margot Robbie</a>’s stellar <em>Wuthering Heights</em> press run, this season’s footwear is all about using your wardrobe to convey who you are to the world.<br /><br />“For a lot of people heading into 2026, that kind of dressing feels empowering — choosing pieces with character, story, and a point of view, rather than just following what’s next,” Villasenin says. However, don’t just take our word for it. Keep reading for a list of subversive shoe trends that will make your outfits feel very now indeed.</p>

<h2>Goth Glamour</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958011.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Between the promotion campaign for Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> movie and a very specific shade of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">dark plum noir</a> trending upward, 2026 is all about dark romance. This includes goth-inspired footwear with buckles, grommets, studs, and witchy lace-up vamps. Margot Robbie recently donned a pair of edgy rosary sandals from the new <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/detail#3"">Alexander McQueen</a> collection during her expectedly epic press run, while <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/studio_constance/"">Studio Constance</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/copenhagen-fall-2026/skall-studio/slideshow/collection#3"">Skall Studio</a> embraced the edge with deconstructed ballet flats and lattice detailing during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">Copenhagen Fashion Week</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miista/p/DTN7rJXjBvV/"">Miista</a> showed a lineup of striking silhouettes for spring 2026 that certainly fit the bill — and come with New York City first lady Rama Duwaji’s seal of approval. <br /><br />“Our designs often sit outside traditional ideas of ‘prettiness,’ favoring strong, sculptural shapes and an outsider energy that resonates with people who see fashion as a form of self-expression rather than a way of fitting in,” says Villasenin. And while Miista shoes may be polarizing, she adds that is precisely the point: “The ‘ugly’ or ‘weird’ label is not just about provocation for its own sake but more about doing things differently –– challenging fashion’s business-as-usual practices and creating pieces with care, intention, and longevity.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>A Cut That Fits Like a Glove<strong> </strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958015.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Glove pumps were initially popular during the 1980s, and earned an aughts-era revival thanks to the hipster set. Designers have since adapted that nostalgic V-cut silhouette to complement flats and strappy sandals, too. Brands of all sizes, including heritage fashion houses like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balenciaga/slideshow/detail#20"">Balenciaga</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/chanel/slideshow/collection#28"">Chanel</a>, are embracing a high vamp for 2026 to accentuate the shape of the wearer’s foot. Cool-girl labels like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/moschino/slideshow/detail#31"">Moschino</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/khaite/slideshow/collection#28"">Khaite</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/attico/slideshow/collection#47"">The Attico</a> took a bolder approach with playful animal prints and exaggerated features. The key to successfully pulling these shoes off IRL is wearing them with leg-baring hemlines like skirts and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">dresses</a>, allowing your footwear to really shine through. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Flat Sock Boots</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958001.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2025"">boxing boot trend</a> set the stage for a  more prim and polished throwback in 2026. Enter the sock boot. Perhaps you remember the 2016 version of this boot, and how the structureless silhouette looks great with pretty much anything. Opting for a leather or suede pair à la <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/courreges/slideshow/detail#2"">Courreges</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/christophe-lemaire/slideshow/collection#38"">Lemaire</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/ann-demeulemeester/slideshow/collection#17"">Ann Demeulemeester</a> will earn you plenty of sartorial mileage. Those looking for something playful should opt for a floppy moccasin style like the sock boots from the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/louis-vuitton/slideshow/detail?share=app#1"">Louis Vuitton</a> runway. Either way, layer these kicks under dresses or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">wide-leg pants</a> for well-balanced proportions.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Updated PVC</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958018.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you needed confirmation that 2026 is the new 2016, the resurgence of PVC footwear really seals the deal. It feels like just yesterday that see-through heels and boots were everywhere. They’re now back thanks to the likes of <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/chloe/slideshow/collection#22"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chloé</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/detail#10"">Maison Margiela</a> — the latter of whom updated their signature Tabi shoes with a nearly invisible outline. Take styling cues from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/detail#21"">Loewe</a> by layering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">colorful hosiery</a> underneath your PVC shoes for a dynamic look that you can customize again and again. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Sculptural Wedges</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958006.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Stilettos not your thing? Try sculptural <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-sneakers-trends"">wedges</a> as an equally glamorous alternative. This season, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/isabel-marant/slideshow/detail#78"">Isabel Marant</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/lanvin/slideshow/detail#86"">Lanvin</a> seamlessly blended practicality and style with discreet and manageable heel heights. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/detail#65"">Balmain</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection"">DSquared2</a>’s interpretations offer stark contrasts, with phantom heels and thigh-high shafts that are a lot more wearable than you may think. Subtle yet artful details bring a necessary update to an otherwise retro silhouette. Leverage your next pair of wedges to give <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">longline trousers</a> and floor-sweeping dresses an instant lift. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soft Sneakers</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958004.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Gone are the days of chunky, dad sneakers dominating the market. Their replacement is both <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">sleek and malleable</a> for the seasons ahead. Soft sneakers are having a huge moment, both on and off of the runway, with designers like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/dries-van-noten/slideshow/detail#76"">Dries Van Noten</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/prada/slideshow/detail#50"">Prada</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/jacquemus/slideshow/detail#75"">Jacquemus</a> leveraging stripes and satin to create a derby-like effect. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/miu-miu/slideshow/detail#155"">Miu Miu</a> has your next vacation covered with a canvas and jute style that will take you from beach to street with ease. Looking for a mid-range option? Alo’s retro-inspired Sunset sneaker has become a fan favorite among influencers and editors alike. The best part about these shoes is their versatility; wear them with everything from tailored trousers and flared leggings to an off-duty dress.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>3D Petals</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958008.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While Loewe and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-x-cult-gaia-collaboration-shop"">Cult Gaia</a> have been producing floral heels for a few seasons, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11337030/floral-rosette-appliques-fashion-trend"">three-dimensional petals</a> are popping up all over the runway in a way that feels fresh for 2026. Replacing graphic prints, this modern take gives wearers a life-like look without the maintenance or mess that a real flower would require. Brands like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/proenza-schouler/slideshow/detail#53"">Proenza Schouler</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-couture/christian-dior/slideshow/collection"">Christian Dior</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/paco-rabanne/slideshow/collection#32"">Rabanne</a> incorporated colorful appliqués into their latest collections. Whether you pick giant blooms or tiny sequined posies, your outfit will be ready for spring.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Sharp-Toe Mules</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958020.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Slip-on shoes are timeless, but when designed with a prominent toe shape that protrudes from underneath pants and long dresses, they can feel a lot more of the moment. Statement mules from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/victoria-beckham/slideshow/collection"">Victoria Beckham</a> and<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection#47""> Acne Studio</a>’s respective collections from spring 2026 are prime examples of 2010s nostalgia with a modern twist.  </p>

<p>If you’re wondering whether the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">blurred makeup trend</a> is here to stay, let Charlotte Tilbury put those doubts to rest with its latest launch, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a>. You’ve likely heard of the Airbrush Flawless cinematic universe from the beloved <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-finish-setting-powder-P433526"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pressed powder</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-setting-spray-P461147"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">setting mist</a>, but the makeup artist’s newest launch is already emerging as an early favorite among R29 editors. </p>



<p>Ahead, get up close and personal with Charlotte Tilbury’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcharlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870%3FskuId%3D2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a>, and see how it looks on us. </p>



<h2><strong>What is Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and what are the benefits?  </strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer</a> is billed as a full-coverage concealer with a soft-matte finish. (In comparison, Charlotte Tilbury’s Beautiful Skin Radiant Concealer has buildable, medium coverage.) In addition to claims of up to 24 hours of creaseless wear, it’s infused with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane. And let’s talk about the wand, because this isn’t your typical doe-foot applicator; it’s got a unique, diamond-like shape that allows it to get into precise spots (like around the eyes) but large enough to quickly dot all over in place of foundation. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957171.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>What makes Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer special?  </strong></h2>



<p>Unlike some of our other favorite concealers from the brand (take <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-beautiful-skin-concealer-review"">Beautiful Skin</a>, for example, which has a creamy texture and natural coverage), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> lends a full-coverage, “filter-like” finish to the skin to minimize texture and imperfections. I have oily, acne-prone skin, and the matte finish (a rarity these days, in a sea of dewy, radiant products) makes my complexion look as smooth as a Vermeer portrait. “The coverage is incredible, which means you really only need a pin prick to tuck away breakouts, dark circles, or hyperpigmentation — any more than that accentuates my fine lines and dry patches,” adds Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957756.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>But don’t just take our word for it. “It didn’t feel heavy at all,” agreed Refinery29’s production and editorial coordinator Dawnie Jefferson. “It blended really easily, which is usually my issue with concealer. I also loved the soft matte finish, which looked great in photos.” </p>

<h2><strong>How do you use Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Blur Concealer, and is it worth it? </strong></h2>



<p>Unlike other concealers that are lighter in coverage (and therefore more forgiving), <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/charlotte-tilbury-airbrush-flawless-blur-concealer-P520870?skuId=2941888"">Airbrush Flawless Blur</a> is dependent on correct application. Both myself and Jackie were overenthusiastic the first time, only to realize that less is more with this formula. “I made the mistake of applying big swipes under my eyes (old habits die hard) and struggled to make it look natural,” she says. “The fact that so little goes a long way is actually a bonus — concealer is expensive, and it’s my most-used product, so this one is excellent value.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957783.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Since this is a matte, full-coverage formula, I lean into skin prep in order to create a hydrated, radiant base that will provide a comfortable canvas for makeup. Instead of my everyday technique of dotting concealer in place of foundation and blending, I ended up strategically placing tiny dots only where needed and buffing it out with my <a href=""https://roseandbenbeauty.com/products/de-buffing-concealer-complexion-brush"">Rose &amp; Ben D2 complexion brush</a>. In my experience, this delivers the natural coverage I typically prefer, while still evening out hyperpigmentation and breakouts. </p>



<p>The overall effect isn’t mask-like. Instead, it tucks away dark circles, breakouts, and hyperpigmentation in a way that doesn’t erase features. My skin still looks like skin.  </p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></h2>



<p>When Charlotte says “blur,” this truly does the job. As an oily, acne-prone girl, I personally love the diffused, matte finish, which I found made additional setting powder optional. (I do like a setting mist for added insurance, though.) Jackie agrees, adding that the coverage “really is second to none.” </p>

<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025. </em></p>



<p><strong>Editor’s note: After a short hiatus, we’re back once a week! Thank you for your patience. We’ll be honoring Money Diary submissions we received during our break by publishing them in the coming weeks. There’s more to come soon — stay tuned.</strong> </p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Senior director<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Healthcare<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 37<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Oregon<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $220,000<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> I’m recently divorced. I have the ability to bonus up to 20% annually as well. I’m not banking on that this year because it hinges on the profit margin for the hospital, and hospitals aren’t doing great right now.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> $65,815 in checking/savings (the majority is in a high yield savings account), $190,615 in investments/retirement accounts, house valued at $482,000, and SUV valued at $22,589. I spent my savings considerably over the last few months on a downpayment for my house and a kitchen/bath remodel. I still have one more check to fork over for the remodel and then I will be focused on building my savings back up. I keep a balance of $5,000 in my checking, $5,000 in a savings account at the same bank, and roll everything surplus into a high yield savings at an online bank. I keep $30,000 in an emergency fund and let the rest go towards whatever pops up. I like to have a good financial cushion, and it feels even more important now that I am on my own. I saved aggressively over the last few years to be able to comfortably exit a very bad marriage. My current job was a huge pay increase for me and required me to move away from my now-ex giving me a very fortunate exit pathway (thanks universe!).<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $411,913.38 on my mortgage.<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Biweekly):</strong> $4,677.82<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/Her</p>



<p><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Monthly Housing Costs:</strong><br /><strong>Mortgage:</strong> $2,988.27. I recently purchased an ADORABLE 1940s colonial in my favorite neighborhood. It’s way too much house for me with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, but I fell in love with it. I had to upgrade the electrics and decided to sink the majority of my savings into a remodel of the kitchen (it was terrible), and the main floor bathroom, too. According to my expense tracking spreadsheet, the remodel will cost approx $85k. <strong>Monthly Loan Payments:</strong> $0. My car is paid off, and I didn’t have any student loans.<br /><strong>All Other Monthly Plan Expenses: </strong><br /><strong>Cell phone: </strong>$104<br /><strong>Streaming services:</strong> $68 <br /><strong>Utilities: </strong>$250<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $72.45 (AppleCare, Apple Music, ChatGPT, NYT and iCloud). <br /><br /><strong>Other: </strong><br /><strong>Beauty treatments:</strong> I spend around $400 every 12 weeks on botox, and $45 at a similar interval to get my hair cut. I don’t have the patience for getting my hair colored or maintaining my nails. (I did recently have someone compliment my highlights which are definitely grey hair.)<br /><strong>Savings: </strong>I receive a monthly stipend from the VA [Veterans Affairs] of $774.16 that goes directly into my savings. I pay off my credit cards every paycheck, and roll what’s left above the $5k I keep in my checking and savings at my brick and mortar bank into a high yield savings account. </p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />It was never expressly stated, but both of my parents went to college and it was assumed my brother and I would as well. I went to a state school for my undergrad, and an online state school for my Master’s degree. There were some detours in the bachelors process because I was a wild ass and partied way to much, nearly got kicked out, and then used the military to straighten myself out after my freshman year. I went back to school post deployment to finish my bachelors. I did have a college fund that my grandparents set up for me with around $20,000 in it. I spent it mostly on a car or to pay off credit cards when I overspent. It dwindled over time. I still have some of it in an investment account though. I had a scholarship in undergrad that covered books, and used a combo of tuition assistance through the national guard and my GI bill benefit to cover both my bachelors and Master’s degree.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />Money was openly discussed, partially because it was pretty tight when I was little. My dad was a cop and my mom is a medical technician and they were both early shift workers. They would pick up extra shifts when we needed to make ends meet. The core lesson was to not spend what you don’t have — my family has a very conservative view on debt which I have carried into adulthood. My grandfather also liked to educate my brother and I on finances by encouraging us to think about retirement early on in our lives, and to understand the value of investing and money growing over time. My brother is the better saver out of us, but after a few overspending situations when I was young I figured it out. I would say I’m the least fiscally conservative of my family. I pay for nice vacations and was willing to use my savings on a renovation — my brother thinks I am insane for it but it is within my means.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job was selling wild game summer sausage and hot sauce to tourists in a VERY niche retail store. I got that job the week I turned 16 and had transportation to reliably get to and from work. I was expected to earn my own spending money and babysitting gigs weren’t that lucrative. I traded up to selling rodeo tickets a few weeks later and worked in a cowboy hat shop on weekends during the school year for spending money. I have always had a job or been actively job hunting since then (I had a really miserable time finding a job after moving with my now-ex to New Mexico).<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes, I knew we were living paycheck to paycheck a lot of the time. However, that being said, my parents actively saved for retirement and we probably could have been a bit more comfortable if they were less responsible about that. We largely ate elk instead of store bought meat — it was considerably better financially to get an elk every autumn and live off of that than try and purchase meat from the grocery store. I thought beef was a total luxury. I did dance lessons and was acutely aware that extra on-call shifts paid for it. Around the time I was going into high school, my dad became the undersheriff and my mom was promoted into management, so money became less of a worry. My friends were definitely better off than I was but it was less acute.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. This year, I got a divorce and I let my ex-husband keep the house (which had about $200k in equity), a car, and gave up my rights to his pension and military retirement. So, I had to reevaluate my financial position (Life advice: don’t roll over in the divorce process like I did, but trauma can make you do dumb things). Luckily, I had saved very well to be able to walk away and my current job was a $70k pay increase. I feel a bit behind in retirement savings but I try to keep in mind that this income level is really fresh. Before I finished grad school I was making around $32k a year and have seen my income climb quite a bit over the last seven-ish years. My financial planner has assured me I’m fine, but I really want to rebuild my savings and continue to save aggressively for retirement.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible at 18, minus health insurance and my cell phone. I was on my parents’ insurance off and on until I aged out, and they paid for my phone until I met my ex-husband and got on his phone plan. I do know that I could fall back on my parents for help if I needed to, but I never want to need to ask for that. They did inherit, what is to our family a lot of money, last year when my grandmother passed away and would be able to help me out (thanks great grandparents for saving up a small nest egg!)<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />I receive a passive $774 monthly from the VA, and as of this year get an annual check for whatever the IRS gifting limit is. This year was $38,000 — basically the only reason I was able to buy the house and finance the remodel in the same year. My grandparents sat on the money while we struggled and my parents have decided to gift it away annually so my brother and I have it while we are young(ish). I’m going to put it into the house throughout 2027, and then my financial planner is going to do whatever he does with it, and eventually my brother’s kids will inherit it or I will be the ‘cool gift money aunt’ so they put me in one of the nice care homes.</p>

<h3>Day One: Saturday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I slept in until 6:30 a.m., got up and then fed my dog, C. Then I made coffee and ate half a bagel with strawberry cream cheese. Carbs are a new luxury in my life, as of last May, when I moved here and stopped having to do whatever fad diet my ex-husband was insisting on. The bagels still feel like a rebellion. I don’t eat much for breakfast, breakfast is also somewhat new, because intermittent fasting was part of the pre-freedom regimen. I also have a glass of water with creatine — another new thing I’m trying.</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I’ve been cleaning the house all morning and I’m starving, so I make a big ass Caesar salad for lunch with romaine lettuce, parm, croutons, and pine nuts with BRIANNAS dressing. I have been living through a remodel since mid-June and the kitchen is mostly done, so I’m aggressively tackling the construction dust. I’m also anxious to have the house in good condition because a man I have been talking to is driving 2.5 hours today to have a first date with me, and somehow we both think it is reasonable for that first date to be him cooking dinner with me and staying over. This is made more unhinged by the fact that I have not had a single successful first date. I started dating in January for the first time since I was 23. I’m bad at it, as are generally all men.</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — Purchased two ribeye steaks from the local butcher shop for dinner tonight. The guy, we can call him H., has promised to impress me with his grilling ability. The butcher shop is super high quality and a local legend kind of place. I have run out of things to clean and am trying to be chill while I wait for H. to get into town. Also worth noting: my ex-husband, out of nowhere, shipped me a large package that arrived today containing my military dress uniform, five old stretched out ponytail holders, a chewed up pair of sneakers, travel shampoo/conditioner and travel deodorant, moisturizer, and a broken hair clip. So he seems to be doing great. I have cut off communication and this feels like a desperate play to get attention. I will not give him the satisfaction of acknowledging it. <strong>$38.67</strong></p>



<p>9:00 p.m. — Dinner consists of cold ribeye and broccolini. H. made it into town a lot later than anticipated. He was halfway here when he got an alert that a wildfire had started near his house and his neighborhood was being evacuated so he turned around. They got it under control after about an hour, so this man turned back around and still ended up coming to see me. Wild. He got here around 7:30 p.m., we started making dinner after I showed him around the house and introduced him to C. Somewhere between pulling the steaks from the grill and now, things got spicy. We’re enjoying cold steaks and having a good laugh about it. This continues to be the most inadvisable first date I can imagine. We watched a comedy special after dinner and then went to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $38.67</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Two: Sunday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — Breakfast is another half bagel and cream cheese with coffee. C. has his standard dog food and blueberries. H. left early this morning to get home and get ready for the workweek. I’m existing and trying to understand what on earth I’m doing. The plan for the day is doing some laundry and my Fantasy Football league draft. I get a text from H. when he makes it home to let me know he got there safely. Not ghosting me right away is good, right?</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I’m suddenly starving and DoorDash a chile relleno burrito, chips and guac, and “Mexican fries” from a local taco shop. I love this burrito. I have never tried the fries but they’re really good. I don’t eat very many of them, or really any of the chips and guacamole, because the burrito is enormous. Why I decided to get anything with it no longer makes sense to me. I’m currently couch rotting and waiting for the Fantasy draft to start. I end up taking a nap to make up for staying up late last night with H. I also end up autodrafting versus actively participating in the league draft. This is a good choice since I don’t actually follow football. <strong>$25.75</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftover chips and guacamole, with the addition of salsa. Benefit of living alone: no one can judge your eating habits. Freedom has its perks. After couch rotting all afternoon and eating like garbage, I head up to bed early and read until I fall asleep. I’m currently shamelessly vacillating between fantasy smut and traditional romance. Tomorrow I’m back to work so an early bedtime and a restful day are hopefully setting me up for success. I get a goodnight text from H., so that makes me smile. It freaks me out that I like him and that this weekend went reasonably well.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $25.75</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Three: Monday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — I wake up without snoozing my alarm, feed C., make coffee and eat the traditional half bagel. (I’m wild, I know.) There’s a good morning text from H. while I’m eating breakfast. I take mornings really slow — I like to listen to the <em>NYT’s The Headlines</em>, sit on the couch, work on a crossword and spelling bee, read email, and generally relax until about 7 a.m. It’s my morning dilly-dally routine and it gives me joy. At 7 a.m., I start to get ready for work and it’s back to reality.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — We have a new physician starting today and I happen to not have a meeting over the lunch hour, so I join him and the manager of the clinic for the new employee lunch. They have my favorite soup in the cafeteria today, chicken tortilla soup, so of course I get that. My assistant puts it on my Outlook calendar when it is ‘Tortilla Soup Day’. It kills me. She is for sure one of my favorite humans. Lunch is good, small talk is successful, and I spend a little time after in my office before the afternoon meeting marathon. <strong>$4.69</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I did a very bad job of planning my grocery pick-up last Friday and decide that instead of suffering for the week I will place another order, this time for delivery. I also give in to some cravings with this purchase. I get hot honey, chicken sausages, half a loaf of sourdough, hamburger buns, green onions, heirloom tomato, sliced cheese, cauliflower, a steak, ground beef, cilantro, jalapeños, Gatorade zero powder (I’m addicted to lemon lime Gatorade zero), Beecher’s cheddar, water crackers, and some fancy jam. <strong>$118.75</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — Dinner is also meal prep this evening. I sear some chicken thighs, add a ton of zucchini and yellow squash to the pan, along with dry riesling and some chicken stock, and let it simmer. I add cherry tomatoes and orzotto once the chicken is breaking down and pull the chicken apart, so it is more bite sized. I finish by adding ricotta and crushed red pepper. It’s frigging delicious. I made the recipe up so who knows if I can ever successfully repeat it. I eat and spoon the leftovers into Tupperware servings for lunches. I love to cook and I hate following a recipe. It has been such a luxury to be able to be fully creative in the kitchen again. Also: exactly why the kitchen remodel was worth it. I opted for an induction range and reaaaalllyy love it. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I’m still figuring out how to live in my new kitchen, and decide I need something to organize the spatulas etc in the drawer by the oven. I hop on Amazon and find an OXO organizer and add it to my cart. I also add another bag of multi-colored letter beads to fuel my current Taylor Swift friendship bracelet therapy. I make them for the songs that stick out to me for any given mood and usually wear a few every day. I pick them to go with my mood or how I want the day to go. It is a whole thing and I’m not ashamed. I also toss in better belly rawhides and check out. C. really likes them and we go through them frequently. I watch an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> with a glass of wine and head to bed. I get a goodnight text from H. before I fall asleep. <strong>$24.25</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $147.69</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Four: Tuesday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — As usual, I’m up at 5:40 a.m., feed C., make coffee, and eat half a bagel. No good morning text from H. today. I cave and text him good morning at 6:21 a.m. and get an immediate reply. I’m overthinking it. Luckily, I have an insane meeting schedule today and won’t be able to dwell on it. First meeting starts at 7 a.m., so the dilly dally is cut short this morning. I have essentially back-to-back meetings until 5 p.m. so the dread is real.</p>



<p>11:00 a.m. — I have a 15-minute gap between meetings to handle being a biological being. I scramble to the bathroom, toss my lunch in the microwave, take up temporary residence in the affectionately dubbed ‘squatters office’ (there is a tiny office in the executive suite directly adjacent to the toilet with the expected acoustics) and try and clear my email before the next meeting while eating my lunch (the prepped chicken pasta) and yapping with L., the executive team’s Administrative Assistant. I’m currently reeling from the last meeting where it was announced that we need to submit three financial improvement tactics per department by next Friday. I did the math: 51 strategies. I text H. that we need to make a plan to see each other, so I have something to look forward to and he responds quickly to see what is going on and we text but don’t make an actual plan. After responding to a few emails, I head to the boardroom to talk about marketing campaigns. The glamour.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — I’m home, makeup off, in my comfies, and C. has been fed. I’m very mentally wiped out from the day, and listening to an audiobook while I cook. Dinner was supposed to be frittata as per the plan, but I currently can’t use my oven (the vent fan is insanely loud, so I have a technician coming on Thursday to look at it). I make a veggie scramble instead. I used to essentially never eat eggs unless they were in frittata form, but I have evolved into someone who can eat them relatively reliably over the last year. H. has continued reliable communication, yay! I received an email from my ex-husband confirming that I received the package he sent… cry for attention again. It had tracking, bro, you know I got it. I call my mom and debrief about the package and email. </p>



<p>8:00 p.m. — I’m still hungry so I have a little bowl of skinny popcorn in bed and yet again, hop on Amazon. The first Huskers game of the season is Thursday and I have decided this means I can buy a Huskers shirt. I find a cute cropped option and add it to the cart. I also get a coffee grinder and an oil splatter guard for cooking. I accidentally bought whole bean coffee in my pick-up order, and I was annoyed by a lot of oil splatter recently, so maybe I can also justify these purchases. I have been dwelling on my marriage this evening. My ex-husband succeeded in disturbing my peace. I’m frustrated because I want to focus on what may or may not be happening with H. and not dwell on the regret of what I let myself live through. I eventually fall asleep and actually have good dreams. <strong>$75.64</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $75.64</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Five: Wednesday</h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at 5:40 a.m, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel. Dilly dally. It’s another relatively packed day. H. texts me to tell me to have a better day than yesterday which is sweet. We have the annual board retreat today and I have them touring one of my clinics that’s in the end stages of a remodel. I’m showing off a new mobile clinic we purchased this year which should be operational by mid September! I get a call from the property manager, R., alerting me to an issue with the mobile clinic. Apparently his boss, J., decided to get involved this morning and change the plan for how I wanted the mobile clinic displayed. I head in to the office for my first meeting.</p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — I have a gap between meetings and head down to see the mobile clinic. I’m immediately not happy. It is not hooked up to the truck, not level, blocking a fire hydrant, and the stairs are set up in possibly the worst way to access the clinic. I call R., who doesn’t answer, and then J. J. tells me the set up is fine. I disagree. After a pissing match, R. comes to help me redo the set up. I had to force J’s hand and he is not happy. I don’t care. I celebrate the victory with an iced coffee and head to my next meeting. <strong>$4.00</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — I don’t have a gap to eat in private so I heat up my lunch (the pasta/chicken sitch), snag some red pepper and eat in a meeting. I hate doing that, but I’m already in a mood thanks to J., and we don’t need to add an element of hangry, too. The meeting is good — easy ask. I get a text from my boss thanking me for fixing the mobile clinic situation before the board saw it. I feel vindicated. Next, I go to a staff huddle for a team that is not happy with a process change I’m making. I try to get in front of people if they are unhappy with me or a change, so they can get their feelings out to my face and we can talk about it. Not sure this is the best change management technique, but I don’t want to be the coward who hides in my office when I’m unpopular. It goes relatively well, their perspectives are valid, and it’s good to hear them out before we implement the change.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — I’m home. I survived an end-of-day-energy-suck-of-a-meeting with one of the more aggressive physicians. It was a wild ride. My boss and I are still texting about it. What a day. I’m making pasta again — tonight is orecchiette with Italian chicken sausage, zucchini, spinach, and cherry tomatoes. It turns out great. H. texts me to see how my day went by asking “did you kick some ass today”, and I can honestly reply in the affirmative. We catch up a bit via text. My friend K. calls and we gossip about my former workplace. I seem to pick up a work bestie every time I move to a new job. She’s the best. She helped me make the decision to leave my marriage. She is probably the only person I was fully honest with about what was happening while I was still in the relationship. After the gossip session, I clean up from dinner and try to decide on something to watch.</p>



<p>7:30 — I haven’t succeeded in selecting anything to watch. I’m now listening to an audiobook and having a snack of cheese and triscuits with a glass of wine. I text H. around 8 p.m. to see if he wants to talk on the phone to no response. I have a small spiral about it before I shake it off. I have a very helpful mantra when I spiral, thanks to K.: I’m not special and it’s not about me. In essence, I’m not the star of anyone else’s movie and people’s actions are about them, not me. It was very freeing to realize that people really aren’t thinking about me. That dumb thing I said in a meeting? They already forgot. H. will be H., if he wants to try he will. Lights out by 8:45 p.m.</p>

<h3>Day Six: Thursday </h3>



<p>5:40 a.m. — Up at the usual time, feed C., make coffee, eat half a bagel with cream cheese. Dilly dally. I was able to condense all of my meetings into the morning today, and will have to come back and work from home this afternoon. I need to be here for having the range serviced. Not sad about it. Knowing I have a short day, I wear a really cute but really uncomfortable dress and heels. I wouldn’t want to wear this outfit if I had to suffer through a whole day, but I can put fashion first for five hours. H. texted first thing this morning apologizing for missing the text about a call and explaining he has his phone on Do Not Disturb after 8 p.m, was engrossed in a project etc., and I feel happy that he cared to explain.</p>



<p>12:00 — I’m home from the office now and heating up lunch — the same meal prepped chicken pasta. It’s really good, so it isn’t miserable having it on repeat. I’m glad to be home and can focus on developing the 51 strategies. The bright side: I can make a spreadsheet. That is the only upside I can think of so far. As I am working on it, I get another email adding reviewing the travel budgets for every department by the same deadline. F**k. H. texts to ask about my day. He is having a good one, so that’s great. My day improves when the range is fixed and I get an email from a clinician I interviewed and offered a job to saying that he is accepting the offer! Yay! Recruiting is going well.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m making a chicken sausage and veggie hash for dinner. Potatoes, bell peppers, onions, zucchini, and yellow squash with a spicy green chile chicken sausage. I really like spicy foods — I have a whole collection of hot sauce at home and in the office. I have my laptop in the kitchen to have Hulu on as the Huskers game is on ESPN. It turns out I do not have the ESPN add-on or the live ESPN add-on, so I spend the $14.65 to upgrade so I can watch the game. I finish making dinner and eat while the game kicks off. It ends up being a good one — competitive — and the Huskers clinch the win. Great way to start the season! H is sending me videos of the tinkering projects he’s working on. He’s very mechanically inclined and I’ve discovered is always working on some side project. I find this cute. I’m up later than normal to finish watching the game and can’t fall asleep right away after it, so I know I will be tired tomorrow, but tomorrow is Friday so I will survive. <strong>$14.65</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $14.65</strong></p>

<h3>Day Seven: Friday </h3>



<p>6:45 a.m. — Up way later than normal, feed C., make coffee, go to eat an entire bagel but half has mold, so I make the questionable choice to eat the half with no visible mold. Text H. good morning. I realize everything today has a remote option minus a lunch. I’m taking a team that is getting hit by layoffs to lunch today to thank them for their work. I’m worried about it, it seems like it could be bad/flippant in the scheme of the layoffs and surrounding drama. I text H. about it and he shares my sentiment. I text my assistant that I’m planning to be remote today and happily work from my bed throughout the morning, keeping my camera off. </p>



<p>1:45 p.m. — The lunch ended up being relatively great. The team is really funny and has made peace with the situation. The conversation is excellent and we ended up at the restaurant for an hour and 45 minutes before we wrapped up. I took a group photo of everyone. That moment felt really sad. They get their severance next week, and then hopefully I will see them around town. I get in my car, happy the lunch went well but sad about the layoffs. <strong>$142.00</strong> <strong>(Expensed so not included)</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — After lunch I go to the grocery store to complete the weekly grocery pick up. I coupon and meal plan around the deals. This week I bought more than normal to take advantage of some really good coupon offers — so I’m now really well supplied with toilet paper and Cottonelle wipes. I also bought a decent amount of wine to stock the “wine cellar” (creepy basement closet with a vent fan). Groceries are a steak, chicken sausage, zucchini, yellow squash, lettuce, cheese, two bags of birdseed, coffee, peaches, lemons, limes, ice-cream sandwiches, tomatoes, spinach, broth, onions, and the aforementioned wine. I saved $108.21 by shopping sales and couponing. This is an all-time high for me. I’m jazzed and no one else in the world will ever care about it. I head home, put away the groceries and sit back down at the laptop to wrap up work. <strong>$193.67</strong></p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — My friend L. invites me to grab a beer to wrap up the week. She is solo this weekend as her husband is going hunting. We meet at a tap house and each grab a beer. I get a rye porter that has a low ABV. A dark beer with a low ABV will always get me. We nurse our beers for about two hours while we talk about work, trees, the remodel I’m doing, and the one she is planning on. It’s nice to have someone to just yammer with. A guy from work stops by our table and says hello and we make polite small talk. L. asks if I have had any decent dates lately and I tell her about H. I text him a ‘cheers’ photo. We wrap up around 5:45 p.m. and I head home to feed C. and make dinner. <strong>$7.43</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — It’s Friday so I let myself have a glass of wine while I make dinner. I am having pasta, again. I need to use the last of the Italian chicken sausage. It’s similar to the pasta I made earlier in the week, but I add ricotta at the end so it is super creamy. H. is texting me photos of getting ready to go camping on the coast with his daughter. I didn’t realize he had her this weekend, and it is WAY too early to ask about the custody arrangement. He is a super doting dad, which I think is a good sign he is a decent human. After dinner I put on <em>The Materialists</em> and head to bed before it’s finished, I’m so tired. I hear the ring of a goodnight text from H. while I am drifting off. Decent week.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>



<p>I impulse bought from Amazon a little more than I would’ve liked to. I really don’t like to support Amazon, but it’s so convenient. I’ve been trying to be budget conscious with the remodel, and actually think I did okay — minus the DoorDash order. I realized I’m not very exciting, at least not in my current phase of life. It was fun to write and reflect on how I’m spending. Hopefully, in the future there are a few more “fun” purchases.</p>

<p>In a sea of steamers, so-called TV slop, and endless options, <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/?itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;itscg=MC_20000&amp;mttn3pid=Google+AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019801_1-774134829080-c&amp;mttnsubkw=75222244984_kwd-67743848_idXQ476O_&amp;mttnsubplmnt=_adext_"">Apple TV</a> has quietly emerged as the service that provides quality over quantity. When other streaming services are rumored to be <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/matt-damon-netflix-movies-restate-plot-viewers-on-phones-1236633939/"">churning out content that (allegedly)</a> intentionally caters to people who are playing shows in the background while they do chores or are <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/matt-damon-netflix-plots-reiterated-distracted-viewers-1236477116/"">on their phones</a>, Apple TV is respecting audiences that actually, you know, <em>pay attention </em>during the movies and TV shows they watch. </p>



<p>At a splashy press day in LA where they flew in press and influencers from around the world and trotted out their best talent to showcase first-look teaser trailers, Apple TV unveiled their packed 2026 slate, and we’re already <em>seated</em>. Multiple women-led series are front and center, and each feel engineered for the post-antihero era: shows about how it feels to live inside messy systems — capitalism, patriarchy, desire, family, fame — and still want more. More pleasure. More honesty. More money. More luck.</p>



<p>Apple TV already has a slate of great shows, and the casts of some of my personal faves (<em>Shrinking</em>, <em>The Last Thing He Told Me,</em> <em>Pluribus</em>, <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>) were in attendance to hype up their new seasons.<em> </em>As for the new shows, from chaotic motherhood and money woes to the messy realities of female friendship, Apple’ TVs latest offerings are giving us the kind of complex, flawed, deeply relatable characters we’ve been craving. Forget your typical glossy prestige dramas, these shows promise to be raw, funny, uncomfortable, and exactly what we need right now.</p>



<p>From a darkly funny meditation on female gratification to a glossy moral thriller about wealth and consequence, Apple’s latest slate signals a clear creative thesis: women don’t need to be likable, tidy, or redeemed, they just need to be <em>interesting</em>. </p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about Apple TV’s four new women-led shows that defined the day and are about to become your entire personality.</p>



<h2><strong><em>Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</em></strong></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Tatiana Maslany, Jake Johnson, Brandon Flynn<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> May 20, 2026 </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957813.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>If the title alone doesn’t have you immediately intrigued, let me paint you a picture: What happens when a woman decides to take control of her pleasure and it backfires, badly? <em><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/02/maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-apple-tv-premiere-date-photos-1236706239/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> follows newly divorced mom Paula (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/04/84634/tatiana-maslany-orphan-black-interview"">Tatiana Maslany</a>) as conversing with a cam boy leads her down a destructive path of murder, blackmail and… youth soccer. I sat through a whole panel about this show and I still don’t get where the soccer comes into play, but rest assured if Maslany is there, so will I. </p>



<p>Convinced she witnessed a crime, Maslany’s Paula begins her own investigation that unravels a bigger conspiracy as she looks to rebuild her family and regain her self identity. <em><a href=""https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2026/02/apple-tvs-darkly-comedic-thriller-maximum-pleasure-guaranteed-starring-emmy-award-winner-tatiana-maslany-and-jake-johnson-to-make-global-debut-may-20/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maximum Pleasure Guaranteed</a></em> is a full-throated (pun absolutely intended) exploration of desire, agency, and what it means to prioritize your own happiness in a society that low-key punishes women for doing exactly that.</p>



<h2><em>Imperfect Women</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elisabeth Moss, Kerry Washington, and Kate Mara<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> March 18, 2026</p>







<p>Think <em>Big Little Lies </em>meets <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> meets <em>Little Fires Everywhere </em>except there is nothing “little” about these women. After a possible murder shatters shatters the lives of three women in a decades-long friendship,<em> <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/imperfect-women/umc.cmc.1w2rmpbqzt24879bt7109zgi6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imperfect Women</a></em> kicks off into a high-octane thriller that is sure to keep us guessing until its final minute. I was holding my breath during the entire teaser trailer. </p>



<p>According to Apple TV, “The unconventional thriller explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that irrevocably alter our lives. As the investigation unfolds, so does the truth about how even the closest friendships may not be what they seem.” That does sound intriguing but they had me at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kerry-washington"">Kerry Washington,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9481023/elizabeth-moss-invisible-man-performance-scary"">Elisabeth Moss</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/08/121778/kate-mara-movies-morgan-2016"">Kate Mara.</a> </p>



<h2><em>Lucky</em></h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Anya Taylor-Joy, Annette Bening, Timothy Olyphant, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and Drew Starkey<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> July 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957807.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/anya-taylor-joy-mad-max-furiosa-interview"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> plays a fugitive con artist. You’re sold, right? Same. Written by Jonathan Tropper and Cassie Pappas and based on <a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Stapley’s bestselling novel, </a><em><a href=""https://reesesbookclub.com/book/lucky/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lucky</a></em> centers on a young woman (Taylor-Joy) who was raised in a life of crime but is trying to leave that life behind. Now, she “must now embrace her darker, criminal side one final time in a desperate attempt to escape her past,” so says the show’s official synopis. </p>



<p>Taylor-Joy also serves as an exective producer on the project and it marks her first TV series since 2020’s smash hit (and pandemic savior), <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy"">The Queen’s Gambit.</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9993184/netflix-the-queen-gambit-trailer-anya-taylor-joy""> </a></p>



<p>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Timothy Olyphant also star. </p>



<h2>Margo’s Got Money Troubles </h2>



<p><strong>Starring: </strong>Elle Fanning, Michelle Pfeiffer, Nick Offerman<br /><strong>Premieres:</strong> April 15. 2026</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957816.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p><em><a href=""https://deadline.com/feature/margos-got-money-troubles-show-news-updates-1236412988/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Margo’s Got Money Troubles</a></em> is a “bold, heartwarming and comedic family drama following recent college dropout and aspiring writer, Margo (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229557/teen-spirit-movie-review-elle-fanning-max-minghella"">Elle Fanning</a>), the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/michellepfeifferofficial/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) and ex-pro wrestler (<a href=""https://nickofferman.co/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nick Offerman</a>), as she’s forced to make her way with a new baby, a mounting pile of bills and a dwindling amount of ways to pay them.”</p>



<p>I wanted to get that synopsis right because I didn’t think you’d believe me if I said Michelle Pfeiffer is playing an ex-Hooters waitess and Nick Offerman would be tattooed-up wrestler. These aren’t the roles we’re used to from these two iconic performers, but I’ve seen some of the show, and, <em>whew</em>, they are such pros, you’re going to be blown away. I imagine that series creator David E. Kelly wanted to surround Pfeiffer with the absolute best to match her star power. And, of course, Elle Fanning did just that. Aside from the storyline that sounds like a perfect premise for a realistic, messy, and absurd look at motherhood, Fanning proves she is one of the best working young actresses in Hollywood.</p>

<p>They say you can’t beat a classic, but if my Instagram feed is anything to go by, the humble <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-tip-nail-manicure-autumn-color-trends"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> is undergoing something of a makeover. It began with the “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/french-fade-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French fade</a>”, a look that blends the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tinted-glow-french-manicure-nails-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a>’s signature white tip into the nail’s neutral base for a soft, melted ombré effect. Another recent favorite is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“deep” French</a>: a chunkier take on the traditional tip that pays homage to the early ’00s. Fast forward to February and another trend has entered our radar — what we’re coining the “phantom” French — and it’s one for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/iced-french-manicure-nail-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">French manicure</a> <em>and </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye nail</a> obsessives alike. </p>



<h2>What is the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye French tips</a> are nothing new, relying on a magnet to maneuver metal particles into formation, creating a reflective, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11185958/velvet-nails-trend-magentic-gel-manicure"">velvety effect</a> — much like a cat’s eye in the dark. In that instance, however, the cat-eye polish is usually painted as a French tip over a neutral gel base. The “phantom” French is a little different. This time, the entire nail is coated in cat-eye polish, but the magnet is used in a way that draws only some — not all — of the particles to the tip, creating a French tip effect. Depending on the light or the movement of your fingers, the French tip seems to appear and disappear, hence the “phantom” part. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadgirlnails/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Natalia Mercedes</a>, nail artist and founder of <a href=""https://www.sadgirlnails.com/"">Sad Girl Nails Studio</a> in New York City, has a theory about why we’re gravitating toward a more subtle take on the French manicure: “There’s definitely a renewed interest in softer, more understated French tips,” says Mercedes, “but at the same time, bold and graphic French designs are just as relevant.” Its recent popularity stems from its subtlety, Mercedes adds. “It’s a modern evolution of a classic that feels especially sleek right now,” she says, “but it’s less about one trend replacing another. Instead, it’s about the range of expression people are embracing.” </p>

<h2>How do you achieve the phantom French manicure? </h2>



<p>The “phantom” French manicure requires a skilled hand, and everyone seems to do it a little differently. On Instagram, digital creator and nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/C-fZFgvAF4c/?hl=en"">Melanie Graves</a> paints her nails with silver cat-eye polish, then places a magnet on either side of the nail to draw the particles inward into a reflective formation. Before curing, she positions a longer magnet at the center of the nail, pushing the magnetic pigments toward the tip to create negative space. The result? A cat-eye French tip that’s only visible at certain angles. </p>

<p>Mercedes has her own method. “The ‘phantom’ effect in cat-eye French tips comes down to both layering and magnet technique,” she says, adding, “It’s about guiding the magnetic particles with intention, then letting light do the rest.” As the nail catches different angles, Mercedes explains, the design appears to shift, fade, and re-emerge. “This creates an illusion of movement.” </p>



<p>While it might sound a little complicated, a qualified nail tech will know exactly what to do. If in doubt, arrive armed with plenty of reference images. The phantom French manicure works on all nail shapes, from almond, like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFS-YdrNbzD/?hl=en"">these by Koleva,</a> to squoval, like this set posted to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CvgVDy0oGIc/?hl=en"">Instagram by @Nai__Spa</a>.</p>

<p>We love this neutral set posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5SyQ8gLyS/"">Polish’d Nail Bar</a>. The cat-eye polish closely matches the gel base, subtly blurring the line between the tip and the rest of the nail.</p>

February is the month we mostly associate with love and our heart’s deepest desires. While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day"">Valentine’s Day</a> can be performative and capitalistic, Spirit is asking you to drop what’s surface level and get more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-practice-self-love-yourself"">intimate with yourself</a>. This month, center the relationship you have with your inner knowing. Your heart has been holding the truth this whole time. It knows what needs to shift, what you've been avoiding, and what you actually want but haven't let yourself say out loud. You've been overriding it with logic, drowning it out with productivity, and silencing it because what it's asking for feels too vulnerable, too big, and too real. <br /><br />With that, this month's Tarotscopes goes straight to the point, cuts through the noise, and gives you direct access to what your heart has been trying to tell you about 2026. This is the year you get to reconnect to your own innate wisdom and allow that to lead you.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising, let your heart respond, and then be brave enough to listen.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957504.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>AQUARIUS (January 20 - February 18) Three of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that the grief you've been intellectualizing needs to be felt. Chances are you are still energetically carrying remnants of 2025, and as we pivot onto the new Chinese year and, soon, the new astrological year, it’s time to fully release these bonds. You've processed it in therapy, journaled about it, and understood the lesson, but you haven't let yourself actually break open and weep. This year, your heart is asking you to stop analyzing your pain and start moving it through your body. You're brilliant at making sense of things, but some wounds don't heal through understanding. They heal through release. Through letting your nervous system discharge what it's been holding. Trust that falling apart won't destroy you. Instead, it will regulate you. Your heart knows that what's on the other side of that grief is the kind of clarity and creative power you've been searching for. Feel it and let it move.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957505.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>PISCES (February 19 - March 20) The Star</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your sensitivity is your spiritual technology, and not something to fix. You've been trying to build thicker skin, set firmer boundaries, and be less affected by the energy around you. Energetic boundaries are a must in your book, but this year, your heart is reminding you that your porousness is your gift. Yes, still maintain a healthy routine of spiritual hygiene, just don’t disregard the fact that you can feel everything because you’re meant to. It's how you receive information, how you read energy, and how you serve. The work isn't to become less sensitive. It's to get so clear in your energetic sovereignty that you can stay open without losing yourself. You're not too much. You're tuned to a frequency most people can't access and you’re able to travel within many realms. Your heart wants you to stop apologizing for it and start leveraging it. Your sensitivity is your superpower. Use it intentionally.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957506.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>ARIES (March 21 - April 19) Queen of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your ambition is sacred, not selfish. You've been treating your desire for more like it's something to apologize for, scared that if you expand too much or too fast, you’ll leave others behind. This year, you will put an end to that. There are those that are anticipating such rapid growth and conquest from you and others who will never understand what it’s like to have such hunger for the attainment of your own expansion. Leave them behind. Your heart is asking you to lead from your fire, so don’t dare contract your energy to make others comfortable. The Creator is waiting for you to embody your full authority and stop performing humility. Trust that your body knows the difference between ego and divine assignment. Propel forward with what burns in you. These are not random impulses; it is purposeful direction. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957507.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>TAURUS (April 20 - May 20) Four of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that safety isn't the same as sovereignty. It’s time to step out of the safety structures you’ve built, the same routines and patterns that keep you bound to the same old energies. These structures are here to protect you; however, they’re also keeping you small. This year is asking you to examine what you're gripping so tightly that you can't receive what's actually trying to reach you. Your body has been holding patterns of scarcity that your current reality doesn't even reflect anymore. You've outgrown survival programming, but your nervous system hasn't caught up yet. Your heart knows you're ready for the next level of wealth, but your hands are still clenched around what you already have: in your body, mind, and soul. This is the year you stretch your energetic container beyond its current standards. Not by thinking your way through it, but by embodying the frequency of the woman who has already arrived. Let your heart lead you into the softness of true security.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957508.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>GEMINI (May 21 - June 20) The Lovers</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you don't have to choose between your spiritual path and your human desires; both can co-exist. You've been treating pleasure like it's separate from your purpose, like wanting love or partnership or sensual fulfillment somehow makes you less committed to your work. That's a lie that you have programmed as the truth. This is not the year of compromise. This year, your heart is calling you into integration: the marriage of your spiritual gifts with your very real need for connection, intimacy, and being met. You can be devoted to your spiritual practice and still want someone to come home to. You can channel divine wisdom and still crave physical touch. Stop splitting yourself in half and having to choose breadcrumbs. Your heart knows the truth: devotion to Spirit includes devotion to your whole self. What is for you will find you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957509.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CANCER (June 21 - July 22) Six of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that healing your lineage doesn't mean carrying it alone. You've been doing the ancestral work, clearing the patterns, and walking through the timelines, but somewhere in there, you started believing that being the cycle-breaker means you can't ask for support. Practice calling in support from all areas: from your spirit allies, friends, the Creator, etc. Healing happens best in community, whether it is physical or non-physical. This year, you get to have things handled for you, which speeds up your development. At the same time, you might discover some potent medicine within you that is ready to be shared with your community. If you’ve been accustomed to supporting everyone else, flip the switch this year. Your lineage doesn't need another martyr. It needs you whole, resourced, and connected. Let your heart show you what it feels like to heal in the presence of love and be the first to receive before pouring out onto others.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957510.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LEO (July 23 - August 22) Ace of Wands</strong><br /><br />That creative fire building inside you isn't just inspiration; it's revelation. It’s your green light to shine. You've been treating your ideas like hobbies and side projects you'll get to when everything else is handled. But your heart knows that what's wanting to be born through you right now is the main event. This is your year to stop relegating your creative genius to the margins of your life and start centering it. The project, the offering, the vision you've been refining, it has been ready. You've been studying the masters, learning the craft, and absorbing the wisdom. Now it's your turn to create from that place and implement what you’ve learned. Stop preparing and start building. Your heart knows the world is waiting for what only you can deliver. A little goes a long way. Pace yourself but start now. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957511.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>VIRGO (August 23 - September 22) The Hermit</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that rest is not a reward for productivity; rather, it's the foundation of it. You've been running on excellence and determination, optimizing every area of your life while ignoring the quiet voice that keeps asking you to slow down. Slowing down is the key to wealth in all forms. Learning how to embody your desires and listen to the wisdom within you will be a game changer for you. You have nothing to prove. This year, your heart is calling you into sacred withdrawal. Not burnout. The kind of intentional solitude where your nervous system can finally regulate, where the downloads can land, and where you remember who you are without the performance of achievement. You're doing such important work in the world, but you can't pour from a depleted well. This is the year where you normalize being in overflow and you stay there. Your heart knows that the next level of your impact requires you to be full first. Give yourself permission to disappear for a while and, most importantly, to be selfish.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957512.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>LIBRA (September 23 - October 22) Two of Swords</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that indecision is just you avoiding listening to your own intuition. You've been sitting at the crossroads, weighing options, gathering more information, waiting for absolute certainty before you make the move. But how many more signs do you need before you act on what you already know? Your heart already knows the answer. The choice you're avoiding isn't actually between two equal paths. Chances are it's between the life you know and the life you're being called into. This year demands that you trust your inner knowing over everyone else's opinions. You already do the inner work. You journal, you pray, and you listen. You have access to your intuition. Stop pretending you don't know how to access what your heart is telling you. The answer is already there. Choose it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957513.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SCORPIO (October 23 - November 21) Knight of Cups</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you're allowed to want love without having to nearly sabotage yourself to deserve it. You've made intimacy a spiritual test, turned every relationship into an initiation, convinced yourself that real love only counts if it brings you to your knees first. You don’t have to abandon yourself in order to have your desire. You can ascend, be your best self, and still be blessed. This year, your heart is asking you to open to a different frequency, the kind of love that doesn't require you to prove your worth through suffering. You've done the shadow work in abundance, and 2025 has led you through the darkness and back to the light again. You've faced your depths, walked through the fire, and you survived. Now let your heart show you what it's like to be chosen softly, met consistently, and loved without the chaos. Or better yet, you decide to do the choosing. Choose yourself and then make an informed and elevated decision to choose another from a space of autonomy and clarity. Don’t burn yourself down because you think you’re lacking something.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957514.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>SAGITTARIUS (November 22 - December 21) King of Wands</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that your vision is too big for you to keep playing small in the execution.

This year calls for you to stop consuming inspiration and simply embody it. You are meant to push yourself into leadership and action. You don’t need any more encouragement, examples, or steps. What you need is to trust that you know what you’re doing and to do it. Individuals will be astonished with your bold energy and growth. It’s less talk and more walk. You have nothing to prove to anyone and ample time to execute excellence. There are people around you who need to see you at your highest level, so they have permission to operate on their own. Your heart knows you're capable of the vision you keep downloading. Now build it like you mean it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957515.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>CAPRICORN (December 22 - January 19) Nine of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Your heart wants you to know that you've already earned the right to enjoy your life — now, live it to the fullest. You have expanded your sense of self-worth, stayed committed to your goals, strengthened your foundation and stability, but yet you’re still moving from a space of scarcity, and like everything can crumble at any minute. This year, your heart is asking you to practice receiving pleasure without attaching it to productivity. Buy the thing without justifying it. Rest without earning it first. Let yourself be luxurious, not as a future reward but as a present reality. This is the standard now. As you’re expanding your capacity to do more, be more, and hold more energy, you can also attract more. So you should enjoy it! You're an energetic match for wealth in all forms, but your nervous system is still running the old program. Your heart wants you in your opulence now. Not when you hit the next milestone. Now. Let yourself live like the abundant person you already are.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p>"

<p><em>Sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, and Emmeka and Dr. Gupta were compensated by Novartis.</em></p>



<p>A tingle that turns into an itch that only becomes worse as you scratch it. A feeling that may resemble mosquito bites all over your body. Trouble sleeping, work disruptions, and skipped social events spurred by the anxiety of the hives returning. That’s what flare-ups can be like for people living with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) — an immune-mediated disease characterized by hives and/or deep swelling for more than 6 weeks without a known allergy or external triggers.</p>



<p>When Emmeka, an Iowa-based social media manager and beauty content creator, first noticed itchy, red, welt-like bumps across her back, she worried she was experiencing an allergic reaction. For months, she tried to rule out what might be causing symptoms and considered everything from laundry detergent and beauty products to the food she was eating. “I was continuously trying to figure out what was happening to me and editing my lifestyle to avoid potential triggers; it was a burden,” Emmeka recalls. After a long journey of trying to get to the root cause of her persistent hives, she finally got a diagnosis of CSU.</p>



<p>Living with CSU can feel like being in a bad relationship: compromising, downplaying your needs, and feeling stuck in a cycle of discomfort and frustration.</p>



<p>Dr. Payel Gupta, a New York City–based allergist who treats people with CSU, is working to raise awareness of this condition and empower patients to find solutions that work for them. “Living with CSU shouldn’t mean settling for discomfort,” says Dr. Gupta. “CSU is something you and your doctor can work on together. It’s a partnership, and that means good communication about what’s working, what’s not working, so we can find the right management plan.”</p>



<p>Dr. Gupta and Emmeka recently sat down together to discuss what it means to  be proactive in taking more control of your life with CSU and shared key tips for improving your “relationship” with this chronic condition.</p>







<p>Keep reading for Dr. Gupta’s advice on how to get a better sense of control in your journey with CSU. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938046.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>It took Emmeka 2 years to receive her CSU diagnosis — a delay that’s all too common, as the average time to diagnosis for CSU is over 2 years. Dr. Gupta recommends that patients presenting with symptoms of CSU connect with a specialist, such as an allergist or dermatologist, who is familiar with CSU and the standard diagnostic and treatment protocols for this condition.</p>



<p>“They’ll help you develop a concrete plan of action for when you’re having an acute episode, so that you don’t feel lost or confused and end up needing to seek urgent care,” Dr. Gupta continues. “Seeing a specialist can be a really important step toward getting the help you need to manage this condition in the long term.” </p>



<p>It’s also important that you feel like you can fully open up to your health care provider. “You want to have good communication on both sides. So, if you feel like you’re not being heard or like you’re unable to express yourself, then it’s important to get a second opinion to make sure your concerns can be addressed,” Dr. Gupta says.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938049.png?width=1024&amp;height=485&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A485"" /></figure>



<p>After coming to terms with her CSU, Emmeka decided to share her journey online and was met with support and stories from her online community, empowering her to use her platform as a content creator to raise awareness. </p>



<p>“Community is really important because it reminds you that you’re not alone,” says Dr. Gupta. “Seeing your lived experience mirrored in others helps you feel validated and understood.” </p>



<p>Social media, in particular, can be a valuable space for connection. But Dr. Gupta warns about relying too heavily on advice from non-medical sources: “Use social media for community, but when seeking information, turn to qualified medical professionals and resources based on reputable references, like <em><a href=""https://www.neverjusthives.com/?utm_source=sponsored-content&amp;utm_mlr=fa-11460132&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=sponsored-content_unbranded_r29-sponsored-content_nov-2025&amp;utm_content=rha_csu_patient-story_link-in-article"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Never Just Hives</a>.”</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938048.png?width=1024&amp;height=384&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>“The biggest misconception is that there’s an allergic trigger,” Dr. Gupta explains. “Some patients blame themselves, thinking their actions caused the symptoms. But the truth is, you’ve done nothing wrong.”</p>



<p>CSU isn’t triggered by external factors like allergies, foods, or environmental irritants. Instead, it’s caused by an overactive immune system. For many patients like Emmeka, the spontaneous nature of this condition can be hard to come to terms with. But listening to your body is a powerful first step. </p>



<p>If you can’t identify a specific trigger, it could be a sign that something else deeper is going on, like CSU. </p>



<p>Dr. Gupta encourages patients to stay connected to their bodies by tracking symptoms and taking photos during flare-ups. This can help facilitate productive conversations with your doctor, and enable you both to work together to find a path forward.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">2026 Grammy Awards red carpet</a> was a treasure trove of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend"">manicure trends</a>. From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026#slide-7"">FKA twigs</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/glossier-katseye-collaboration-lip-oil-glaze"">KATSEYE</a>, the stars delivered enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"">nail inspiration</a> to last the entire year — but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">Hailey Bieber</a> stood out, especially since her look was made <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-opi-nail-polish-colors"">entirely with OPI</a>. This time, though, it had nothing to do with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-opi-nail-polish-colors#slide-2"">Funny Bunny,</a> the shade behind her iconic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vanilla-chrome-manicure-nail-art"">“glazed donut” nails</a>. </p>



<p>Bieber swapped her signature blush for a hazelnut-americano-inspired hue, carefully mixed by her longtime friend and LA-based nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nailsbyzola/?hl=en"">Zola Ganzorigt</a>. While appointments with Ganzorigt are rare, she took to Instagram to reveal the exact color combination for those who don’t mind performing a little nail alchemy.  </p>

<p>While Ganzorigt used OPI’s professional GelColor shades for Bieber’s Grammy Awards manicure — a system found in most nail salons — all three shades are also available for at-home use in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">OPI’s Nail Lacquer</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2F"">Infinite Shine</a> ranges online. </p>

<p>The likes of Big Apple Red and You Don’t Know Jacques! are considered classics among manicurists, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opi.com%2Fproducts%2Finfinite-shine-barefoot-in-barcelona"">Barefoot In Barcelona</a> is one of those shades that has slipped under the radar until now. It occupies a cozy space between blush pink and hazelnut, and its neutral finish suits all skin tones equally.  </p>
