<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951379.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We begin this week under the energy of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">first New Moon of 2026</a>, which arrives on January 18th at 2:52 p.m. EST at 28 degrees Capricorn. New Moons mark beginnings, and starting the year with a Capricorn New Moon at the very <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">end of Capricorn season</a> sets a powerful, intentional tone for what we are building next. This lunation forms a close trine to Uranus in Taurus at 27 degrees, blending Capricorn’s slow, steady commitment with Uranus’ capacity for meaningful change. </p>



<p>While Capricorn New Moons typically emphasize patience and long-term planning, Uranus adds a spark of momentum, suggesting that some intentions may manifest faster than expected. Especially between now and late April, as Uranus prepares to shift signs, what you commit to now can move from vision to reality more quickly if you are willing to do the work. </p>



<p>This is a New Moon week that rewards specificity and embodiment. Rather than vague resolutions, the universe responds best to grounded detail. If you’re setting intentions around career, finances, relocation, or lifestyle changes, write them as if they’re already in motion. Imagine how your days feel, where you live, who surrounds you, and how stability shows up in your body. Capricorn energy asks for structure, while Uranus rewards courage. Together, they remind us that practical planning and bold reinvention do not have to be opposites. This is an ideal moment to make realistic plans for change that still leave room for surprise and evolution. </p>



<p>On January 19th, the sun enters Aquarius, ushering in the first full week of Aquarius Season and shifting the collective mood. While both Capricorn and Aquarius are ruled by Saturn, their expressions are very diﬀerent. Capricorn is focused on responsibility, tradition, and mastery through discipline, while Aquarius brings an airier, more innovative approach to growth. As we move from Earth to Air, the focus widens from personal ambition to collective impact. </p>



<p>On January 20th, Saturn in Pisces forms a supportive sextile to Uranus in Taurus, helping us integrate long-term dreams with tangible change. This alignment supports progress that is both compassionate and sustainable, reminding us that real innovation works best when it considers emotional, spiritual, and communal needs. </p>



<p>The week continues to build momentum as Mercury enters Aquarius on January 20th, followed by Mars entering Aquarius on January 23rd after six weeks in Capricorn. This marks a collective shift from personal responsibility to shared vision, from solo effort to collaborative action. </p>



<p>Adding to the significance, this is the final full week of Neptune in Pisces, with Neptune lingering at 29 degrees all week long. Neptune’s harmonious connection to the Capricorn New Moon encourages us to move beyond dreaming and into doing. After nearly fifteen years of reflection, spiritual exploration, and emotional sensitivity, this moment asks us to apply what we have learned. Think back to where you were in 2011 when Neptune first entered Pisces and consider how your understanding of compassion and boundaries has evolved. </p>



<p>This week invites gratitude for those lessons, paired with the resolve to choose what truly supports your growth moving forward. It’s less about imagining a better future and more about committing to building it. </p>

Your next level is not a solo mission. </p>

<p>If you’ve ever loved a beauty product, then you’ve likely also experienced what it felt like to lose it. Whether it was a beloved moisturizer that was discontinued or a reformulated lipstick shade that was never quite the same, we’ve all been there. And if you’re one of the thousands (I can only assume) of people who adore Armani’s Luminous Silk Foundation, what comes next might be hard to hear, but you’ve been warned. </p>



<p>After launching in 2000 (turn of the century!), Armani Luminous Silk Foundation skyrocketed to popularity, becoming one of the most frequently name-dropped products among celebrities like Gemma Chan and Kim Kardashian, and makeup artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tobimakeup/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tobi Henney</a>. (One 2020 statistic even reported the brand <a href=""https://www.thezoereport.com/beauty/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-foundation-sells-1000-bottles-every-day-heres-why-44969437"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sold 1,000 bottles of Luminous Silk</a> per day.) So you may be wondering why Armani would replace an existing bestseller, even after 25 years — and you’d be right to do so. But before you run to your nearest Sephora to stock up on your old shade, here’s everything you need to know about the new version of the cult classic, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html?dwvar_ww-01019-arm_color=6%20-%20Medium%2C%20Neutral%20Olive&amp;dwvar_ww-01019-arm_size=30ml"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>. </p>

<h2>Why did Armani reformulate its iconic Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>As the name suggests, the OG Armani Luminous Silk Foundation was touted as a medium-to-full coverage product that enhanced skin’s natural radiance. The upgraded formula, <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation</a>, captures the same soft-glow finish with a thinner, more blendable texture. Then, there is the addition of skincare-first ingredients like niacinamide to brighten and curb oil production — an especially welcome addition for those prone to oily skin like myself, who notice that foundation can sometimes enhance shine and greasiness. Another notable addition to the foundation is glycerin, an emollient and humectant that helps draw in moisture and lock it in place. </p>



<h2>What’s different about Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation? </h2>



<p>Whether you’re hitting a red carpet (relatable!) or simply looking for a workhorse complexion perfector for every day, Armani Luminous Silk had mass appeal in spades due to its silky texture, moderate coverage, and luxe cachet. (Put simply, having this in your makeup bag made you That Girl.)  </p>



<p>But as is often the case, not everyone was convinced. Some reviewers wanted a better finish for drier skin types, while others said it oxidized quickly. Since its launch, countless brands have introduced foundations powered by increasingly high-tech formulas. With this in mind, Rena Hayashi, Armani Beauty’s head of research and development, reveals that the reformulation was inevitable. “Even for an icon like Luminous Silk, consumer expectations evolve,” Hayashi says of the four-year reformulation process. She adds, “The driving inspiration was to meet today’s demand for foundations that offer an even more seamless, true-to-skin match and act as an extension of one’s skincare routine, not just makeup.” </p>



<p>I’m notoriously picky when it comes to foundation, but even I was blown away by how Armani’s Luminous Silk looked, and most importantly, felt on my skin. I was a true fan of the original Luminous Silk, but typically reserved it for special occasions that warranted a more glam look. As such, a natural, skincare-inspired version of Luminous Silk sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What to know about Armani Luminous Silk Foundation:  </h2>



<p>– Available in 44 shades (including 18 brand-new ones to better suit a variety of undertones) <br />– Provides medium coverage with a glowy finish <br />– Includes skincare ingredients, including glycerin and niacinamide in a non-comedogenic formulation </p>



<h2>Is Armani’s new Luminous Silk Natural Glow Blurring Foundation good?  </h2>



<p>Like any liquid foundation, how you choose to apply it depends on the amount of coverage desired, as well as the finish you’re looking to achieve. However, one thing that immediately stood out to me during the testing process was how the new Luminous Silk truly disappeared into my skin, leaving behind a veil of coverage that looked like my skin, but better. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cgonzalezbeauty/?hl=en"">Carolina Gonzalez</a> (who’s glammed celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter and Gigi Hadid) echoes this as one of Luminous Silk’s most notable upgrades. <s> </s>“The biggest standout for me is that it feels even more skin-like — it minimizes any texture on the skin, which I love, and gives a gorgeous soft-focus effect,” she says.  </p>



<p>My favorite way to apply foundation is to dot tiny amounts directly onto my face where I need the most coverage, and buff it out with a fluffy brush for an airbrushed effect that I can dial up if needed. And according to Gonzalez, the new Luminous Silk is more versatile than ever: “If I want a natural, soft-glam finish, I’ll use a foam wedge or my hands to really melt it into the skin,” she explains. “When I want more coverage, I typically use a brush and work it into the skin.”  </p>



<p>But no matter how you apply it, the consensus remains the same: “What I love most about this formula is that no matter how it’s applied or how many layers you build, you always get the same beautiful, skin-like result.” Beauty content creator Alexis Androulakis of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thelipsticklesbians/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lipstick Lesbians</a> did a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTYLyD0EalN/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">side-by-side</a> comparison, touting the comfortable wear and less drying texture of the reformulation. However, she also noted that the two are more alike than different, especially in terms of the signature satin finish. </p>



<h2>Where can you get Armani Luminous Silk Foundation? </h2>



<p>The new-and-improved Armani Luminous Silk is currently available on <a href=""https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation/ww-01019-arm.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Armani Beauty’s website</a> and at select retailers including <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-liquid-foundation-with-24-hour-wear-P519887"">Sephora</a> and <a href=""https://www.nordstrom.com/s/armani-beauty-luminous-silk-natural-glow-blurring-foundation-with-24-hour-wear/8688069"">Nordstrom</a> for $69 (a small increase from the previous price of $64).  </p>



<h2>Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>For the price, I was expecting to be blown away by the new Luminous Silk, and I have to admit that I vastly prefer it to the original. Luminous Silk Natural Glow has replaced my everyday foundation since I can sheer it out so easily, depending on how and how much I apply. (I also wore it recently to an event and my skin looked flawless for over seven hours, even with plenty of talking, eating, and drinking.)  </p>



<p>Is it a pricey product? Definitely — easily one of the most expensive in my collection. That said, it had impossibly large shoes to fill — not to mention a viciously loyal customer base willing to go to war — and I think it’s exceeded expectations. (The only piece of criticism I have is that I don’t get much of a blurring effect, which I love for minimizing the appearance of pores, texture, and acne scars. That said, I still like it overall as a foundation.) I can only wonder what we’ll be saying 25 years from now, when the 3.0 version hits our counters… </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">This January</a>, the sun’s entrance into Aquarius on the 19th brings a sense of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">camaraderie and friendship</a> for you. The water bearer wants us to partake in collective joy and join forces with neighbors to manifest a communal bond. Better yet, it’ll give us the opportunity to think, love, and speak freely, without any judgment. Oh, and did I mention it’s time to cheer? We are cheering the unknown, praising the divine forces that lead us on an unknown path which enriches our lives with knowledge and intelligence. </p>



<p>If you have been trying to create your vision, then Aquarius season is a month in which we can bring novel ideas to the forefront of our minds; now is the best time to do so. The reason is that Aquarius is a sign of innovation, making it an extraordinary moment to jumpstart projects and ventures. Even if the naysayers want to dampen our spirit, we will not let them because we’re on the path to strike gold. Believing in ourselves and all we do is pivotal to ensure we are able to construct our visions in the best way possible. </p>



<p>The Aquarius stellium [when three or more planets come together] of 2026 includes the sun, Venus, Mercury, and Mars’s ingress into the Air sign. Add in Pluto, which has been in Aquarius for some time, and we have a spicy and desirable energy. At times, we may be more stubborn and inflexible in our ideology. We’ll be prone to preach about our values and want others to follow our lead. Pluto is bringing in the heat — especially when it forms a conjunction with the sun in Aquarius. The cazimi effect of the sun and Pluto’s connection urges us to evolve and transform, after arguments, jealousies, control issues, triangular situations, and power struggles arise.  </p>



<p>The upcoming weeks will bring life-changing events. The solar eclipse on February 17th marks the beginning of the lunar new year and ushers us into a new state of being. The year of the Fire Horse is giving us the passion to attain our aspirations without looking back. The eclipse ushers us to think outside the box and to embrace our individuality, due to its proximity to Uranus in Taurus. The applying square offers us autonomy and excitement to reach for the stars and make our aspirations happen on our own terms. The effects of the eclipse will be felt the most when the North Node of Destiny enters Aquarius on July 26th. </p>



<p>Pay attention to how we can <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/befriend-neighbours-social-life"">support the local community</a> and the charities we wish to invest our time in by giving back. We can understand that it’s essential to help others on their journey, as it gives them a sense of hope and offers kindness. We are all connected in one way or another. Aquarius season wants us to do our best and be the most genuine versions of ourselves. By doing so, we are making the universe better. </p>

<p>The New Moon on January 18th is coming in hotter than a steamy matcha latte! The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">first New Moon of 2026</a> is going to have a significant impact on how we kick off the year and the standard we implement for ourselves. The astrology for this lunar event is going to be intense — the only way out is through. By that, I mean the best way to handle the New Moon is to put ourselves first. For many, this will be challenging because 2025 was a year in which we selflessly gave to others. Since <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">2026 is a numerically number one year</a> (2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 10, and 1 + 0 = 1), it’s time to switch up that vibe. No more playing nice, it’s time to start doing more for us than we do for others. Here we go!  </p>



<p>New Moons occur at the beginning of the lunar cycle. They initiate a time of beginnings and fresh starts, allowing us to set intentions for the month ahead. We can manifest and bring our desires to light, igniting our dreams and putting them into fruition. At this moment, the sun and moon come together in the same sign and degree, forming a conjunction. The connection of these celestial entities brightens our drive, but curtails our intuition. The technical term for the alignment of the sun, earth, and moon is syzygy. Every New Moon has a different flavor, promise, and message — this lunation is no exception. </p>



<p>The New Moon links up with Mercury and Mars in Capricorn, Saturn in Pisces, Uranus retrograde in Taurus, and Neptune in Pisces. Although Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is farther away, it’ll lend an extremist energy, escalating the planetary energy. The same day, Mercury faces off with Mars and Saturn. The healing centaur, Chiron in Aries, and the liberating asteroid Lilith, which is in Scorpio, add a cosmic punch. All these elements are urging us to act toward starting fresh, which will not be easy. Why? We aren’t ready to let go of our old ways of thinking and feeling. Rather than relinquish us from habits, situations, or relationships that aren’t serving our highest good, we’ll drag our feet.  </p>



<p>It may seem that each step forward is accompanied by a setback. The challenge is comprehending that rather than trying to push forward, we must take a moment to meditate on our current position to assess the path we want to take. Although Mars is hyperactive in the New Moon activity, the correspondence it shares with Neptune is going to have a standing still, so instead of trying to make waves, we should really meditate on how we feel or what we are willing to incorporate and dismiss from our lives.  </p>



<p>Saturn serves as a stabilizing force. The karmic and responsible planet is in watery Pisces, a place known for dismantling boundaries; we are learning to set limits, not just with others, but with ourselves as well. This entails adopting a new mindset for all of us, allowing us to understand that we don’t have to put pressure on a specific timeline to evolve. With the New Moon occurring on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capricorn-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">last day of Capricorn season</a>, we might want to jump forward. Remember, growth takes time and happens progressively. The less we stress and compare ourselves with those who appear to be doing better than us, the easier it’ll be to move at our own pace. </p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean power struggles won’t ensue. In some circumstances, the stew has been brewing and simmering for a while, and now it’s ready to boil over. Jealousies are heightened due to insecurities, making us feel as though we aren’t good enough. We are! We must focus on the positive attributes within ourselves, not give others too much leverage, and refrain from arguing over feelings. If they aren’t going to acknowledge how they’ve repressed us, then it’s time to consider disconnecting. The only opinion that matters is our own when it comes to our heartfelt sentiments. Gaslighting and emotional manipulation can be used to gain sympathy, which is why we must draw a line in the sand. Protecting our energy and aura is vital.  </p>

<p>For years, romance fans have been patiently waiting for our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/09/10034159/erotic-romance-books-with-sex-scenes"">fave romance novels</a> to be adapted into movies. During the onscreen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-romantic-comedies"">rom-com drought</a> of the past couple decades (with a few notable exceptions), romance novels were there, carrying the weight of depicting all the different ways we fall in love. For some reason, for a while Hollywood decided romantic intimacy wasn’t something people wanted to watch onscreen, but the <a href=""https://www.writersdigest.com/the-billion-dollar-genre-why-romance-writing-matters"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">billion-dollar book industry </a>proves people want horny, smart, romantic stories. And <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/emily-henry-books.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emily Henry</a> is one of the genre’s most prolific and adored authors. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954048/people-we-meet-on-vacation-book-movie-differences"">Netflix’s</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954048/people-we-meet-on-vacation-book-movie-differences""> People We Meet On Vacation</a></em>, adapted from Henry’s novel and starring Tom Blyth and Emily Bader, is already a smash hit — and it’s only been streaming for a week. Blyth and Bader are Alex and Poppy, best friends who take vacations together, strictly as friends, until their carefully defined arrangement starts to feel less… defined. Their platonic trips take a turn and, well, romantic hijinks ensue. </p>



<p>All anyone really wants from a good rom-com is great chemistry between its leads. When we met up with Henry and <em><a href=""https://people.com/where-was-people-we-meet-on-vacation-filmed-all-about-the-netflix-show-s-real-life-locations-11886201"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People We Meet On Vacation’s</a></em><a href=""https://people.com/where-was-people-we-meet-on-vacation-filmed-all-about-the-netflix-show-s-real-life-locations-11886201"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a>director Brett Haley at the film’s press junket in New Orleans, they told us that it was Blyth and Bader’s connection that made them know the movie would be something special. “I saw the chemistry read they did together and that was all it really took for me,” Henry said to Refinery29’s Dawnie Jefferson. Haley agreed: “The most important thing was the chemistry. And once we saw them work together, we knew that this was gonna work. I needed to see that oil and water thing happen, but I call it oil and vinegar — salad dressing when you shake it up. Delicious. That was them.” </p>

(L-R) Emily Bader as Poppy and Tom Blyth as Alex in People We Meet on Vacation. Cr. Daniel Escale/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Blyth and Bader are great in the movie that actually improves on its source material (Henry teased that <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/emily-henry-adaptations-announcement-funny-story-happy-place"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">her next adaptation</a> will be of her lauded novel, <em>Beach Read</em>) and embody their characters — Alex is a rule-following stickler and Poppy is a free-spirited nonconformist — with humor and heart. “Tom is nothing like Alex. He’s a charismatic loose guy,” Haley said. “The only thing he has in common with Alex is that he’s handsome.” Henry echoes that Blyth is “silly” in real life and we witness that vibe in person. During our interview, Blyth is funny and irreverent, getting distracted repeatedly by the chaotic noises flowing in from the New Orleans streets. And Bader, who both Henry and Haley said is similar to  her character Poppy, is playful and bubbly. Both actors were on the verge of starring in Netflix’s #1 movie (<a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/news/people-we-meet-on-vacation-ratings-netflix-movie-1236630279/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">17.2 million views</a> in its first weekend!) and unlocking a new level of success in both of their careers. It felt a bit like talking to a young Hanks and Ryan, and the duo cited <em>When Harry Met Sally </em>and <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> as their biggest inspirations for the movie. </p>



<p>Here, Blyth and Bader talk about why men need to yearn more, Poppy and Alex’s attachment issues and how the movie’s already iconic dance scene came together.  </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congratulations. Loved the movie! Thank you for making such a great film for me to watch over and over.  </strong></p>



<p><strong>Emily Bader:</strong> Thank you! </p>



<p><strong>Poppy and Alex are an example of the “friends to lovers” trope that is very popular in rom-coms. Why </strong><strong>do you think “friends to lovers” works? Is it the best trope? </strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>The best trope? I think everyone’s gonna have a different opinion about that but I do like enemies to lovers as well. I don’t know if I could pick one, but I think people love it because it’s about yearning. It’s a lot of yearning.</p>



<p><strong>Tom Blyth:</strong> Yearning is very in style at the moment,</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>Has yearning ever gone out of style?</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>No, but it’s a whole thing right now. Everyone’s loving yearning, apparently.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>I’ve loved yearning since I saw <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>Fair enough! </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Men like to pretend that we’re all tough and don’t have a soft inside, but we have a big soft inside, and I think the yearning allows that to come out. Men should yearn. </p><cite>tom blyth on yearning in ‘people we meet on vacation’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>That’s a great segue because there is quite a lot of yearning in the book and in the movie, mainly by Alex. Tom, why do you think that it’s important to see men yearning on screen?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>That’s an amazing question. </p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> Why is it important to see men yearning on screen? You know why? Because men like to pretend that we’re all tough and don’t have a soft inside, but we have a big soft inside, and I think the yearning allows that to come out. Men should yearn. It puts you in a vulnerable place. And it’s good to be vulnerable.</p>



<p><strong>It really is! </strong></p>



<p>TB: Bada bing, bada boom!</p>



<p>EB: Bada bing. bada boom<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>Tom, would you consider yourself a yearner? </strong></p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>Yeah, at times. Yeah. I can be quite romantic. Yes, definitely when I was a lot younger. I definitely yearned. Painfully yearned. And that’s all I’m gonna say on that.</p>



<p><strong>We won’t push it, but I would love to know more.</strong></p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I can see you wanting to push the line of questioning. I was like. No!<em> [laughs].</em> No names.</p>



<p><strong>We’ll keep it safe. For both of you, would you consider yourselves an Alex or a Poppy in real life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> I’m a Poppy for sure.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I think we are both more Poppy than Alex. Well, it depends. There are moments.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>You have Alex tendencies. Today, when you were doing the thing, it kind of made me open my mind. </p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>We figured out I’m a grouchy traveler. I get quite stoic when I’m traveling. I just wanna get it done. It’s a bit Alex.</p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> Just a little bit Alex.</p>

<p><strong>There are so many moments in the movie when you just want these two characters to just get over themselves and make out. You’re watching it like, </strong><strong><em>please just kiss</em></strong><strong>! </strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> Kiss! </p>



<p><strong>Ultimately, what do you think is the biggest reason they’re too scared to be together?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>I think it’s because, in their minds, if it goes wrong, the greatest friendship they’ve ever had goes away. And I think there’s a very real possibility of that with them. If it really blew up in their faces at the end of the day, and they weren’t compatible in that way, it would be hard to go back because they would’ve taken such a leap. They’re best friends. </p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> I also think they’ve built up this expectation in their own mind of what their life is supposed to be like. Poppy’s like, “I’m supposed to be free. I’m supposed to not have any things that hold me back or tie me down.” And Alex is the opposite. He thinks he’s got to have stability. And he wants to live in Linfield where he grew up and he wants to be near his family. And I think sometimes putting expectations on yourself and other people is the death of change. And it holds you back and it stops you from being changeable and malleable. And that’s what you need to be able to fall in love with someone and be vulnerable with someone. At the end, when they let go of their expectation of themselves and each other, they’re able to realize how close they were all along.</p>

<p><strong>EB: </strong>That’s very good.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>I’m philosophizing a lot today.</p>



<p><strong>The dance scene was very cute. What prep went into it and how did it come together?</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> We had an awesome choreographer. We went to this church building when we landed in New Orleans — </p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>We prayed for help <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>We said “Help us please learn how to dance. Give me rhythm.”<em> [laughs] </em>But we basically came up with ideas, things we’d seen in movies before, moves we wanted to incorporate, and strung them together with her help. She was really amazing.</p>



<p><strong>TB: </strong>And the choreographer filmed us rehearsing it and doing it. And then she would show us how bad it was and say, “this could be better.” She was really supportive. We worked hard on that.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>And you can’t improvise it because you need to shoot it from so many different angles. And it has to be the same.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> But it had to have an improvised feel because they’re not dancers. They’re two people just letting loose. And kind of falling in love while they’re letting loose. And so it had to have that loose quality to it.</p>



<p><strong>I didn’t know you couldn’t dance. It was giving dancers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>EB:</strong> Thank you so much. That was my big fear of mine.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> You didn’t know you could dance either?</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>Oh no, I didn’t. I’m still not sure.</p>



<p><strong>TB:</strong> Oh, you’re so good.</p>



<p><strong>EB: </strong>Put it on my resume!</p>

<p>Tarnish-free <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fine-gold-jewelry-under-300"">gold jewelry</a> sounds like the ultimate cheat code — pieces that won’t fade, dull, or turn your skin green, no matter how much you wear them. But do they exist on a budget? The short answer: kind of. Unless you’re investing in solid gold (which is costly), no jewelry is completely resistant to wear over time. But thanks to smarter materials and better plating techniques, you can get long-lasting shine without the hefty price tag. <br /><br />“‘Tarnish-free’ means the jewelry is resistant to discoloration from air, moisture, or skin oils,” explains <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennieyyoon/"">Jennie Yoon</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=""https://kinnstudio.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kinn Studio</a>. “While no jewelry material is completely immune to wear over time, tarnish-free pieces are designed to maintain their original appearance for much longer.” The key? High-quality base metals, thicker gold layers, and protective coatings that help plated pieces hold up to daily wear. <br /><br />One of the biggest game-changers in affordable jewelry is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a high-tech plating method that makes gold layers tougher, thicker, and more resistant to fading. “Recent advancements like PVD coating, thicker micron plating, and anti-tarnish treatments allow us to create beautiful, long-lasting pieces at a price point that is accessible to more people,” Yoon explains. <br /><br />But longevity isn’t just about the plating method — it also comes down to how you wear and care for your jewelry. “Avoid exposure to water, sweat, and chemicals like perfumes or cleaning products,” Yoon advises. “Storing your pieces in a cool, dry place and cleaning them with a soft cloth can make a huge difference in keeping them looking new… A well-made piece of plated jewelry can last for years with proper care.” <br /><br />So what’s the difference between gold plating, vermeil, and solid gold? Gold plating is the most affordable, but it’s also the least durable — just a thin layer of gold over brass or stainless steel. Vermeil is a step up, with a thicker layer of gold over sterling silver, making it more resistant to tarnishing. And solid gold? That’s literally the gold standard for jewelry that stays pristine forever — but at a cost. Ahead, we’re breaking down the best tarnish-free gold jewelry brands for everyday wear — whether you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-ring-trends-2025"">an investment piece</a>, fun Valentine’s Day-coded <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/heart-shaped-jewelry-ring-necklace-earrings-bracelet"">heart-shaped design</a>, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gold-hoop-earrings"">everyday go-to hoops</a> that won’t quit.</p>

<p>Session manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amistreets/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ami Streets</a> says iced coffee glass nails are so popular right now because they tap into what she calls the soft luxury aesthetic. “Amplified by social media and satisfying magnetic effects, iced coffee nails feel modern, elevated, and luxurious,” says Streets. She explains that it blends multiple major trends: “Think glazed and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glass finishes</a>, as well as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/11/11185958/velvet-nails-trend-magentic-gel-manicure"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">magnetic manicures</a>,” she says, essentially cat-eye polish, which contains magnetic particles that are maneuvered into place with a magnet before it cures. </p>



<p>While ribbed glass nails come in a variety of shades, one color palette seems to be reigning supreme: “Brown tones have been a dominant trending color and are set to continue as a key color movement in 2026,” says Streets. “The warm neutrals paired with a glossy, translucent sheen create depth and movement that mimics coffee in a glass.” We’re just a little bit in love with these espresso nails courtesy of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGyzDCFUqQ/?hl=en"">@Nails_ByLes on Instagram</a>. </p>

<h2>How do you achieve iced coffee glass nails? </h2>



<p>Though this manicure might look complicated, an experienced nail artist will know exactly what to do. Streets explains, “To create iced coffee glass nails with a ribbed-glass effect, start with a sheer brown gel base in latte, caramel, or iced-coffee tones.” She adds that your nail tech will layer the polish according to your opacity preference. “One to two thin coats will be more translucent rather than opaque, or for added depth, you can layer a subtle magnetic brown or taupe gel and softly activate the magnet to create gentle movement that mimics liquid in a glass.” </p>



<p>The next step is sealing in the cat-eye color with a high-shine top coat, curing it under a UV lamp, and then applying a <em>matte </em>top coat over the entire nail. “This will help achieve that frosted, iced glass finish,” says Streets. </p>



<p>Now for the finishing touch: once both top coats are cured, a clear builder gel or thick clear top coat is used to draw raised vertical lines, Streets explains. “These extend from the cuticle to the free edge and should be evenly spaced to resemble ribbed drinking glasses,” she says. The nails are then fully cured. “The glossy lines will appear raised while the rest of the nail remains matte,” says Streets, “and it’s the contrast between soft-focus glass and high-shine ribs that gives this manicure an elevated, dimensional finish.” </p>



<p>Because there are quite a few steps, don’t expect this to be a quick salon visit. Iced glass nails can take a couple of hours in the salon chair, as moving the magnetic particles into place to make the finish look like liquid takes time and precision. Your nails might take even longer if you’re opting for a builder gel or hard gel base, which requires extra layering and curing. </p>

<p>Take a closer look at some of today’s hottest beauty products, and you’ll likely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">find peptides</a> front and center in the ingredients list. These buzzy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-squalane-amino-acids-lip-balm-review"">amino acids</a> — which promote hydration and collagen production — have been making their way into everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paulas-choice-pro-collagen-peptide-moisturizer-review"">lightweight moisturizers</a> to viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-pocket-blush-review"">cream blushes</a>, but their most exciting role might be in lip treatments.</p>



<p>“The skin on your lips is very thin and delicate and can be prone to dehydration,” says consultant dermatologist <a href=""http://milenaaesthetic.com"">Dr. Milena Al Mansuri</a>. She adds, “Peptides are therefore great for lips because they help to strengthen the barrier, which in turn helps to lock moisture in; they can also help protect your lips from damaging environmental factors such as the sun and wind.”  (Adding a top layer of sun protection is still essential for your lips, as UV rays can break down collagen.)</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: Peptide lip products can be quite pricy due to the advanced research and technologies behind their formulations. Most cost between $15 and $30, which is a little steep considering you can buy a drugstore lip balm for around $5. </p>



<p>Intrigued — and in the name of providing fair and honest reviews — I decided to put eight of the most popular peptide lip treatments to the test to see which ones truly deliver on their promises. Spoiler alert: one contender totally blew me away — and it’s only $9.</p>

<p>Described as a “nourishing lip layer” by founder <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-peptide-lip-shape-review"">Hailey Bieber</a>, this TikTok-viral bestseller arguably kicked off the peptide lip product craze when it launched in 2022. I’m a late bloomer when it comes to embracing the Rhode hype, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rhodeskin.com%2Fproducts%2Fpeptide-lip-treatment"">this treatment</a> made a great first impression. It adds a shiny, non-sticky glaze that sits atop my lips for hours. The consistency is my second-favorite among all the products I’ve tried. Besides the titular ingredient, the formula also features cupuaçu (a type of cacao fruit that maintains skin elasticity) and babassu (an antioxidant that also hydrates the skin).</p>



<p>Some of my initial enthusiasm faded with repeated use. The vanilla scent was very yummy at first, but I got tired of it after using it for a couple of weeks, as it reminded me of artificial sweeteners. (There is an unscented version of the treatment, and all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-tinted-lip-review"">Rhode Lip Tints</a> are unscented.) While the texture feels soft and conditioning when I apply it, I don’t find that it moisturizes my lips that much in the long term; I can still feel my lips craving moisture a few hours later, and it does little to heal gritty, flaky skin. I think it’s a bit overhyped, but it’d be a good fit for someone already blessed with well-hydrated lips who wants a coat of long-lasting shine and a side of dessert-inspired fragrance.</p>

<p>Paula’s Choice is aiming for a piece of that peptide hype with its two new launches: The <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpro-collagen-peptide-plumping-gel-cream-moisturizer-P514671%3FskuId%3D2828424"">Pro-Collagen Peptide Moisturizer</a> (which I enjoyed) and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpro-collagen-peptide-plumping-gloss-balm-lip-treatment-P514674%3FskuId%3D2828416"">this gloss balm</a>. Out of all the squeezy tube lip products I tested for this story, I liked the applicator on this one the most. It has a slightly curved tip that hugs the contours of the lips, making it easier to disperse just the right amount of product I need. It has a faint, sweet aroma that reminds me of cakes.</p>



<p>A lot of science has gone into the formula, namely three types of peptides — tridecapeptide-1, palmitoyl tripeptide-1, and palmitoyl tripeptide-38. I asked <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dremmaclinics/"">Dr. Emma Cunningham</a>, medical director at <a href=""https://dr-emma.co.uk/"">Dr. Emma Clinics</a>, to explain their benefits: “Tripeptide has three amino acids [the building blocks of proteins] and is great for general skin repair, improving hydration and strengthening the skin barrier,” she says. “It’s smaller, so it absorbs quickly and works quickly.” I can confirm that it works well, as I wake up with softer and more hydrated lips when I’ve slathered this treatment on before bed. My only gripe? It is quite expensive, and I fear I might go through the whole rube rather quickly.</p>

<p>I have Suni Lee to thank for discovering this gem. The Olympic gold medalist <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@sunisalee_/video/7409473555802410282?lang=en"">shouted out the product</a> as part of her go-to lip combo, and it has since sold out many times over. I tried the citrus flavor and loved the subtle shimmer it imparts. In addition to peptides, it’s enriched with kokum butter and mango seed butter, which add moisture to the lips. This is the most instantly hydrating treatment out of the bunch, but the texture is a bit too sticky for my liking. The brand says this can be applied over lip color to add extra shine, but it already feels like wearing a heavy coat on its own. I will likely save this one for when it’s brutally cold, and my lips are very dry.</p>

It’s formulated with a 6% tripeptide complex, which promises to smooth out fine lines on the lips, along with plumping and softening benefits. The product has a similar texture to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lip-oils-review"">lip oil</a> and doesn’t irritate when I glide it across the cracked parts of my lips. I do notice my lips looking a bit fuller and more defined after a week, but I likely won’t finish the whole tube for one reason alone: it left a bitter, medicinal aftertaste. The product transferred easily, and I can always taste it as it seeps into the corners of my mouth.</p>

I’ll say that the moisturizing benefits aren’t all that noticeable on their own, but it does dial up the efficacy of a lip serum or lip mask when you layer it on top (my favorite pairing has been <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chanel.com%2Fus%2Fskincare%2Fp%2F133330%2Fhydra-beauty-micro-serum-levres-intense-replenishing-hydration%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel’s Hydra Beauty Lip Serum</a>). It seals in all the goodness, and I love the apple scent and barely-there texture. However, at this price point, it hasn’t impressed me enough, and I have to layer it with another product to get the best results. Its airy, whipped texture is a better fit for summer, especially since it contains vitamin C, an antioxidant that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/antioxidant-serum-sunscreen-skincare"">enhances sun protection</a>.</p>

<p>This one is a sleeper hit that should be TikTok-viral, especially given the affordable price. I tried Ice, a clear color that adds a subtle pearly luster to my lips. It’s like wearing a Y2K-inspired shiny lip gloss without any of the stickiness. My lips feel instantly softer, with a moisturizing top layer that lingers long after I wipe the product off. I attribute this to squalane, an emollient that draws moisture to the skin, alongside nourishing peptides, vitamin E, and avocado oil. It has been my go-to product for prepping my lips before makeup, as it does a remarkable job at smoothing over the cracks, and I’m so drawn to the light grapefruit scent. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fjuicy-peptide-lip-balm-pimprod2046091%3Fsku%3D2625647"">This one</a> gets an A+ from me: I simply don’t get sick of this product and can’t wait to try the tinted versions.</p>

<p>This is the perfect SOS treatment for when your lips are raw and irritated. Packed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">with ceramides,</a> an ingredient I always look for in my moisturizer, it creates a protective barrier on the lips while working overtime to repair the cracks underneath. The bright yellow color comes from sea buckthorn oil, an antioxidant that helps reduce hyperpigmentation and inflammation. I have this next to me when I work from home, and I love the feeling of the cushiony balm over my lips. It proved its worth when my partner recently came home from a ski trip with severely chapped and scaly lips. He popped on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fallies-of-skin-peptide-and-ceramide-repair-lip-balm%2F14759495%2F"">this lip balm,</a> and the flakiness disappeared overnight. </p>

<p>Given how often I use peptides, squalane, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"">hyaluronic acid</a> in my skincare, I had high hopes for this one, which contains all three ingredients. The texture appears semi-coagulated, making it a bit too chunky to squeeze out of the tube, but it melts into a nourishing oil once on my lips. I did some research on the product’s Sephora page, and the hard texture seems to be a common complaint after a recent reformulation; some even find the product gritty once applied on the lips, but I didn’t feel any clumps. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbiossance-pro-peptide-tm-hydrating-lip-perfector-balm-with-hyaluronic-acid-P513592%3FskuId%3D2797942"">The product</a> does a good job at making my lips bouncier and softer, but the ointment-like texture means that you really feel it weighing on your lips for hours on end. </p>
