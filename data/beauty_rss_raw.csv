<p>Whether you’re dressing for the office, a cozy dinner, a log cabin getaway, or a window-shopping stroll, it’s time to embrace <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uruguayan-brand-pastiche-us-launch-fall-finds"">sweater weather</a>. From plush cashmere and merino wool to ribbed jersey knits, these sweater dresses are equal parts warm and comfortable. We found styles in a range of lengths with turtlenecks, belts, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">cardigan-esque designs</a> that aren’t so basic, yet still versatile.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Velvet Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://i2.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11954757.png?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p>When it comes to winter fabrics, velvet is the undisputed favorite. It’s soft, tactile, and undeniably luxe — perfect for winter cocktail parties, especially when in drapey silhouettes. For other seasonal occasions, like date nights, we’ve also spotted darling mini dresses with playful details like sequins and lace for extra texture and interest. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954832.png?width=803&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=803%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Just as classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">plaid coats are trending</a>, so are plaid dresses. While gingham shines in the warmer months, slightly festive and edgy plaids and tartans in deep color combos are perfect throughout the winter. So, whether you’re looking to re-style your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday dresses</a> or are shopping for a new dress, plaid is your friend. Find the print across mini, midi, and maxi lengths for every vibe and occasion. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Blazer Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954778.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Continuing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-creators-trend-forecast-2025"">2025 fashion trend</a> train, bold shoulders and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">soft suiting</a> are still popular, so it’s no wonder blazer dresses are having a moment. This suit alternative lets you bring the business vibes while showing a bit of leg. Plus, thicker velvet and faux leather fabrics, as well as details like neck scarves, mean you don’t have to sacrifice warmth. Just add fleece-lined tights and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-over-the-knee-boots"">over-the-knee boots</a> to fully winter-proof your look. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Cape Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954837.png?width=734&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=367%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>We’ve been seeing cape dresses more frequently, especially across <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=red+carpet"">awards season red carpets</a>, so we’re embracing the celebrity-backed trend. Ethereal sheer capes, attached scarves, and removable sleeves are especially popping up across our favorite retailers. Cape dresses make for the ideal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest style</a>, especially if you’re looking for a little extra coverage and warmth, sans stiff or sweaty long sleeves. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>High-Neck Dresses</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954838.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This awards season has also highlighted high-neck gowns, which is perhaps surprising, but certainly seasonally appropriate. From turtlenecks and mock necks to cowl necks and boatnecks, these dresses are reserved, but still chic and flirty. And luckily, there’s a range of fabrics and lengths that are perfect for professional work settings, casual family gatherings, romantic date nights, <em>and</em> black-tie parties.  </p>

The Brazilian fashion brand, co-founded by Kátia Barros and Marcello Bastos in 1997, is beloved for its bold, colorful, nature-inspired prints and relaxed beachy styles that embody the city where it all started in: Rio de Janeiro. Even more, the brand is dedicated to sustainability. Its garments are made from eco-friendly materials, like organic cotton. Meanwhile, the brand uses circularity programs that repurpose surplus fabric and upcycle items to reduce waste (with a zero landfill waste by 2030 goal) and has a tree-planting initiative, One Tree Planted, to offset carbon emissions. There's so much to love, especially with vibrant pieces like this Black Flowershop Ruched Waist Jersey Blouse.<br /><br /><strong>Farm Rio</strong> FARM Rio's Black Flowershop Ruched Waist Jersey Blouse, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffarmrio.com%2Fproducts%2Fflowershop-mini-black-jersey-blouse&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fbrazilian-apparel-brands"">Farm Rio</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1120"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954638.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1422&amp;height=1120&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=711:560"" width=""1422"" /><figcaption>Since 1979, the Brazilian <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fbrands%2Fmelissa--6559&amp;sref=www.refinery29.com%2Fbrazilian-apparel-brands"">footwear brand Melissa</a> has been famous for its colorful, retro-inspired jelly shoes, which they now make from a vegan, recyclable PVC called Melflex.

<p>If I were to rifle through your current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare lineup</a>, I’d bet I’d find at least one of the following: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">salicylic acid</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glycolic-acid-peel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">glycolic acid</a>, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10385578/drunk-elephant-protini-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lactic acid</a>. Thanks to brands like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary</a>, Paula’s Choice, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/drunk-elephant-skin-care-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Drunk Elephant</a>, exfoliating acids have become staples in many routines. (Don’t ask me to pick a favorite — I’m loyal to all three.) From unclogging pores to fading hyperpigmentation and brightening dull skin, their benefits are well documented, but there’s another acid quietly vying for your attention, and if you have sensitive skin, might just replace what you’re using now. </p>



<p>Enter: citric acid. </p>



<h2>What is citric acid, and how does it work in skincare? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://mariamabbas.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mariam Abbas</a>, an advanced facialist, says citric acid is basically an acid — specifically an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) — and it comes from citrus fruits, which is where it gets its name. </p>



<p>“In high enough concentrations, citric acid can have an exfoliating effect on the skin,” says Abbas. It encourages old or dead skin cells to shed, revealing fresh, new cells and improving the appearance of dull skin, Abbas explains. It can also help unclog pores and prevent new breakouts, but it does all of this with far less irritation: “Citric acid is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acids,” she says. This is because its larger molecules aren’t absorbed into the skin as easily as glycolic acid’s much smaller ones. “As such, it is better tolerated as an exfoliating agent by sensitive skin,” says Abbas. </p>



<h2>Is citric acid good for the skin? </h2>



<p>Besides gentle exfoliation, Abbas says citric acid also has an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">antioxidant effect</a> on the skin, helping protect it from things like smoke and pollution that can cause dullness or congestion. Not only that, but it can also boost the effectiveness of other antioxidants like trusty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C</a>: “In this way, it can indirectly have a brightening effect on the skin when used in combination with actives like vitamin C,” explains Abbas. That’s why you might spot it on the ingredient list of your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C moisturizer or serum</a>.  </p>



<h2>How do you use citric acid in a skincare routine? </h2>



<p>Because citric acid is such a beneficial addition, it appears in a wide range of skincare products, but mostly exfoliators. More often than not, citric acid is combined with other exfoliating acids, like glycolic or lactic acid — both of which also brighten the skin, unclog pores, and minimize hyperpigmentation. Think of citric acid as the supporting actor in your exfoliating cleansers, toners, leave-on exfoliators, or serums.  </p>



<p>One of our favorite products — and a staple in many beauty editors’ skin, hair, and body routines — is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-glycolic-acid-7-toning-solution-P427406"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toner</a>. While glycolic acid is the star ingredient, citric acid also smooths rough texture, boosts radiance, and exfoliates skin. Top tip: It works just as well on a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">flaky scalp</a> or <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7085863692784438533"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rough feet</a> as it does on your face. </p>



<p>If leave-on toners tend to irritate your skin, consider a wash-off cleanser instead. Abbas recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skinbetter.com%2Frefresh%2Frefining-foam-cleanser-M032.html%23tab%3Dingredients"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Skin Better Science Refining Foam Cleanser</a>, which combines citric acid with gentle AHA lactic acid and BHA salicylic acid. The salicylic acid penetrates a little deeper into the pores to break up the glue-like mixture of oil and dead skin cells that can lead to breakouts. If you have less to spend, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsalicylic-acid-acne-blackhead-cleanser-P443833"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser</a>, also with salicylic and citric acids. </p>





<p>Because citric acid has antioxidant benefits, you’ll also spot it inside plenty of brightening serums alongside vitamin C. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fbarrier-15-vitamin-c-ferulic-acid-serum-P517666"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Try Skinfix Barrier+ Serum with 15% vitamin C</a> and antioxidant ferulic acid, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP516231"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum</a>, with ascorbyl glucoside — a version of vitamin C that’s kinder on reactive skin.  </p>





<h2>Are there any downsides to using citric acid in a skincare routine? </h2>



<p>Lastly, Abbas notes that, like any exfoliant, citric acid can cause dryness, irritation, or sensitivity if overused or used in very high concentrations. She adds that it’s also sometimes added as a fragrance in skincare, which could trigger allergic reactions or irritation in those with perfume-sensitive skin. If this sounds familiar, it’s always worth patch-testing any new skincare product before applying it to your face. Try the inner elbow, neck, or the area behind your ear. </p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out.

January is the activation point. It represents the threshold where intention meets momentum. It’s energetic activation. The choices you make daily and the emotions you lock into can shape the rest of the year. <br /><br />As you may know, 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse. It represents a year that conjures boldness, movement, and the willingness to run toward what calls you without looking back for approval. But none of that happens by accident. It happens because you choose it. Because only you can activate the frequency within yourself that matches the life you say you want.<br /><br />These tarotscopes aren’t predictive; they’re channeled directions. It’s Spirit showing you exactly what needs to come alive inside of you to make this year everything you've been building toward. This is your roadmap to alignment. It’s your permission slip to step into the fullest expression of who you came here to be.<br /><br />Read for your sun, moon, and rising signs. Let the messages land where they need to. And then do the work of activation.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954052.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries (March 21 - April 19) The Tower + Seven of Wands</strong><br /><br />Stop defending what's already dead and chasing past regrets. You’ve been fighting to keep structures standing that were never meant to survive your next level. Whether these are limiting beliefs or old shadows and traumas, this year requires you to activate your capacity for complete demolition. It’s not the gentle release you’ve been attempting, or possibly avoiding, but the full burn. The Tower is here to tell you that what needs to fall will fall, with or without your permission, and your job is to stop trying to save it. Instead, focus that warrior energy on claiming new ground and observing what the Tower’s destruction reveals to you about yourself and what you’ve allowed. Your best year comes when you stop protecting old territory and start building your empire from the ground up. Let it collapse. You were made to rebuild from nothing.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) The Empress + Five of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Activate your divine right to receive all the desires you want.

This year demands that you embody the Empress, the one who knows abundance is her birthright, not a reward for good behavior. Stop waiting for permission to live well and luxurious. Stop punishing yourself with lack and limitation as proof of your worthiness. Your best year unfolds when you plant yourself in the soil of your own value and refuse to negotiate. The harvest is already yours.

You’ve been sitting on the fence, hedging your bets, and keeping your magic theoretical. That’s over. The Magician demands sharp decisions. It requires commitment, the willingness to speak your vision into being and then back it up with strategic action. Your best year happens when you stop intellectualizing and start declaring or delegating to your Spirits. Make the choice. Say it out loud.

This year activates your emotional sovereignty. It’s the part of you that moves through the unknown with your inner compass as your only guide. Your best year comes when you stop treating your sensitivity like a weakness and start recognizing it as your superpower — no ifs, ands, or buts. The path isn’t clear, but your intuitive GPS is so sharp. Prepare to shock yourself. Ultimately, you’re not supposed to see the whole way. Move anyway. Your body knows.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954056.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo (July 23 - August 22) The Sun + Three of Cups<br /></strong><br />Shine like it’s your spiritual assignment, because it is. You’ve been dimming yourself to make others comfortable and performing humility like it’s a virtue. It’s not. This year demands that you activate your full radiance and let it be medicine for your community. Your best year unfolds when you stop rationing your gifts and start pouring them out like libations. Celebrate loudly. Gather your people. Let them see what it looks like when someone refuses to shrink. Your joy is your offering. Your brightness gives others permission. Stop playing small. It’s boring and it's beneath you. You are a living road opener. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954057.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo (August 23 - September 22) The Hermit + Eight of Pentacles</strong><br /><br />Virgo, your activation for 2026: mastery without self-punishment. You know how to refine the craft, but you’ve been using discipline as a weapon against yourself. There’s a difference between devotion and self-flagellation. This year asks you to honor the process without making yourself wrong for being in it. Your best year comes when you stop perfecting yourself into a corner and start building something that reflects your actual genius, not your fear of being exposed. You’re already good enough to do the work. Now do it without the side of shame.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954058.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra (September 23 - October 22) Justice + The Lovers<br /></strong><br />Choose yourself with the same conviction you use to choose everyone else. You’ve been sacrificing at the altar of other people’s comfort and maintaining peace at the expense of your power. This year demands reciprocity and equity. The scale is tipping in your favor for once. Your best year happens when you activate your understanding that self-selection is sacred, not selfish. Stop negotiating your needs down to make room for everyone else’s wants. This year is about you being selfish. The right people will meet you where you are. The wrong ones will reveal themselves. Both outcomes serve you.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954059.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio (October 23 - November 21) Death + Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />You love transformation, the phoenix moment. But this year asks you to activate rebirth without the addiction to intensity. What if you could open to new love, new emotional terrain, and new beginnings without requiring everything to go up in flames first? Your best year comes when you learn that transformation doesn't have to hurt to be real. And you don't have to keep “healing” in order to learn important lessons. Let something be born from softness. Let yourself feel without destroying yourself in the process. You can change without the drama. Try it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954060.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21) Temperance + The Chariot<br /></strong><br />Harness your fire instead of letting it burn you out. You’re all acceleration, no integration. You’re moving so fast the lessons never land. This year activates your ability to embody your philosophy instead of just preaching it. This will bring your vision into your actual life instead of just talking about it. Your best year unfolds when you realize that sustainable momentum requires alchemy, not just speed. You don’t need to move faster. You need to move with purpose. Direct your energy. Let it build.

Legacy without luxury is just suffering with better branding. This year demands that you let yourself enjoy what you’ve created. The chains are self-imposed. The key has always been in your hand.

Your best year unfolds when you stop waiting for the revolution and start being it — in every area of your life. Your difference is your contribution. Your vision is valid. Now make it real. Ground it. Build the structure that holds your dream. Stop floating. Start creating.

This year demands that you activate your ability to take inspired action even when the path isn’t clear. You are rebuilding your entire life this year and on an elevated level. Your best year comes when you trust that your intuition is enough, that the way reveals itself as you walk it. Stop surrendering to paralysis and start surrendering to movement. You don't need the whole map. You just need to take the first step. The path builds itself beneath your feet.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jess Gonzalez</a>, Pravana color expert and celebrity colorist, predicts that bronde — a mix of blonde and brunette — will evolve, taking inspiration from fashion, specifically the neutrals in our closets, like khaki. “Soft, melted, and cozy is the vibe of khaki bronde,” says Gonzalez — but don’t let the word khaki put you off; it’s nowhere near green. “Using a color melting technique, khaki bronde is a muted gold with hints of ash,” explains Gonzalez, much like this color created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tay Ramirez.</a> </p>



<p>The addition of darker, ashier tones dials down the intensity of the blonde, lending the overall finish a more organic-looking, lived-in effect. “It flatters a wide range of skin tones, and it’s great for clients that want their hair to look natural or natural-ish,” says Gonzalez. She suggests asking for a “seamless lift and a color melt” over the top.  </p>

<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cowgirl-copper-hair-color"">cowgirl copper</a> is entering a new, brighter phase: soft apricot blonde. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Michael</a>, owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, describes this as a “warm blonde with a subtle peach undertone,” occupying a cozy space between copper, strawberry blonde, and golden blonde. “It creates a bright and luminous look without the harsh contrast of icy or very cool blondes, which makes it appealing as more clients shift toward softer, warmer tones this year,” explains Michael. </p>



<p>Happily, he says this shade works well for both natural blondes and brunettes who want a vibrant result that still looks natural and blended. Even better? “It photographs beautifully in natural light, which is contributing to its growing popularity for 2026,” adds Michael. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJkgE6JT1UR/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Madeleine Kay</a> gets it so right here. </p>

<p>Barron-Hough describes lush truffle as a “sophisticated, expensive-looking shade that’s full of warmth, glowy tones, and indulgent truffle pigments.” She adds, “This trend reflects a shift away from cooler brown hues towards rich brunettes with a slightly warm, red glow.” Think Kelly Gale, Kiera Knightly, and Lana Del Rey — or curly hair specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesseniaspallet?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a> here.  </p>



<p>Barron-Hough says there isn’t a hair texture that it doesn’t look great on. For multi-textured hair, she suggests asking for a semi-permanent color. “This will add depth, tone, and lots of hydrating properties,” she says.  </p>

<p>Hazan says that striking blonde will be just as popular this year as it was in 2025, but this time, the focus is on dialing up the shine. The key?

<p>Cashmere brunette is defined by a handful of very fine wisps of blonde throughout, rather than strong, high-contrast highlights, says Michael. “It reflects light evenly, photographs well, and grows out cleanly, which makes it a good option for people who want a lower-maintenance color that still has dimension,” he adds. </p>



<p>Michael says it looks especially beautiful on natural brunettes with medium to deeper skin tones. “It’s a strong choice for anyone who wants professional, polished, but healthy-looking color with longer wear between appointments.” This shade posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJg9HB5TQp8/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miho Mai</a> is beautiful. </p>

But it’s not for the fainthearted or those short on time. “A bold color like this requires monthly salon visits and treatments,” explains Gonzalez, specifically bonding treatments to counteract the drying effects of bleach. “It’s a high-maintenance color,” adds Gonzalez, “but when done right, it’s so striking.” She recommends asking for a bleach and tone with icy, milky highlights. We love this shade by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSMt9ezjOF1/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bella Björklund.</a> </p>



<p>Barron-Hough also makes a case for blanche blonde and has a feeling that it’s going to be <em>the </em>shade of 2026: “As blanche contains neither warm nor cool hues, it appears bright and ultra-reflective, making it a very fashion-forward look,” she says, adding that it looks especially cool on bobs and shorter cropped styles. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/siobhan_haug/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Siobhan Haug</a>, creative director of <a href=""https://www.hauglondon.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Haug London Haus</a> and a prominent London hair color specialist, wants to see more saturated, vibrant hues. Think Chappel Roan’s statement red or Dua Lipa’s cherry cola. To achieve something this rich and intense, Haug suggests asking your chosen pro for a “double-process color” — essentially a two-step technique that requires lightening the hair first so that it takes the second color better. “Think of it as a double layer of color for maximum impact and staying power,” says Haug. </p>

<p>Highlights are getting an upgrade for 2026. At Haug, they’re delicately threaded into a darker base to create the illusion of depth, as though hair has been lightly sun-kissed rather than bleached. The goal? To make the color look as natural as possible, says Haug. And placement is paramount. Around the face, shoulders, and near the temples, where hair naturally has bounce, allows the highlights to really pop — like this shade by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGEcTPjPY2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Annabelle Arnold</a>. </p>

<p>Kicking off the show, often touted as Hollywood’s biggest party, two-time host <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9339653/nikki-glaser-taylor-swift-apology"">Nikki Glaser </a>made a subtle allusion to the current political and social climate,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hpHj5wNYDw""> welcoming celebs and viewers</a> to the event that was “without a doubt the most important thing happening in the world right now.” And then, that was pretty much it.</p>



<p>To recap: the past year has seen a brutal decimation of human rights across the United States. Since the start of his second term in office, President Donald Trump and his administration have <a href=""https://civilrights.org/trump-rollbacks/#2025"">rolled back DEI initiatives </a>across sectors, issued executive orders to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/birthright-citzenship-trump"">end birthright citizenship</a> and suspend the admission of refugees to the country, as well as targeted Transgender Americans by defining “sex” as binary and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/trump-transition-healthcare-funding-hhs"">proposing an immediate pause on gender-affirming</a> care. In addition to this, his administration has increased <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/big-budget-act-creates-deportation-industrial-complex"">funding to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a>, <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy9z7yg2n7o"">deploying the National Guard </a>into cities across the country and inciting violence. Earlier this month, a Minneapolis citizen, Renee Good, was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o"">shot and killed by an ICE agent</a>. Oh, and the President of the United States is set to<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/09/france-delays-g7-summit-white-house-ufc-trump-birthday""> hold a UFC figh</a>t this July to celebrate his 80th birthday, held on the White Houses’ South Lawn. (Which isn’t a social injustice, but <em>is</em> tacky as hell). </p>



<p>These are arguably the most unprecedented of unprecedented times; yet the Golden Globes felt like something straight out of  the 2016 feminism and activism handbook — ie: soap boxing with little to no substance. Talking around some of the most prevalent and dire issues of the moment without actually speaking to them in a way that would cause conversation or discomfort (which, to be clear, is needed). </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.”  </p><cite>Jameela Jamil </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Presenting the award for Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, Made for TV Movie, Kathryn Hahn and Melissa McCarthy took to the stage to sarcastically congratulate men on finally being recognized for their acting chops, as well as their abilities to show their range playing so many roles, as McCarthy put it “Husband! Ex-husband! Secretary! And everybody’s favorite: nosy neighbor.” It was a moment of comedy meant to be a tongue-in-cheek jab at ongoing conversations around men’s dominance in the profession that failed to be either funny or actually impactful. The feeling was similar to actress Natalie Portman’s now-infamous statement at the 2018 Golden Globes while presenting the award for Best Director, where she <a href=""https://deadline.com/2018/01/natalie-portman-all-male-directors-category-remark-prompts-reaction-golden-globes-1202238326/"">pointedly called out the categories’ list of all-male nominees</a>. It was a strong statement, until you consider the fact that — between 2018 and this year — Portman has herself worked with no female directors. (In the words of queen <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">Kirsten Dunst</a>: “<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11932309/kirsten-dunst-female-directors-hollywood-tiff-2025"">It’s very simple</a>” to work with female directors). </p>



<p>Later in the show, Noah Wyle, the hunky lead of hit HBO series <em>The Pitt  </em>– which unflinching depicts the reality of being a healthcare worker in America — picked up two Golden Globe Awards, during which he broadly thanked healthcare workers, without speaking to any of the current ways in which the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/us-health-insurance-system-doctors"">health care system is inaccessible </a>to the majority of Americans. And Nikki Glaser ribbed Leonardo DiCaprio for continuing to date women under 30 instead of questioning why someone who claims to be a climate activist would<a href=""https://variety.com/2025/biz/columns/jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-wedding-bad-taste-1236442892/""> attend Jeff Bezos’ wedding</a>. And even though <em>One Battle After Another </em>is a satire about revolution, critiquing anti-immigration and extremist white nationalist groups, those issues weren’t directly addressed in the speeches when the film won. </p>



<p>It was…dissapointing to say the least. </p>



<p>Maybe this characterization is unfair. And some celebrities did subtly use their platforms for good last night. But the idea of asking and expecting celebrities to speak truth to power is nothing new. In fact, fans have been demanding it for years. Largely, these calls to action have been met with a divisive response from people both in and outside of the industry. In 2020, then- Golden Globes host <a href=""https://deadline.com/2020/01/golden-globes-politics-ricky-gervais-1202821552/"">Ricky Gervais directly warned celebrities</a> not to talk about politics in their acceptance speeches, saying:  “You’re in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg. If you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and fuck off.” </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954276.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In 2021, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/01/11638286/golden-globes-2024-apolitical-genocide#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20long%20history,glitz%2C%20glamour%2C%20and%20escapism."">reflecting on that comment after yet another apolitical Golden Globe awards</a> ceremony, Refinery29’s Senior Content Director, Entertainment Kathleen Newman-Bremang wrote about understanding the inclination to want to tell stars to essentially “shut up and look pretty.” It’s one that many stars we look to seem to hold, or at least cower behind, themselves.</p>



<p>In a November 2025 interview, <em>Die My Love</em> actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke about her decision to not speak openly about her politics, specifically the actions of President Donald Trump. In an interview with The New York Times’ <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQotp7ejvJi/?igsh=eDVnZWtuNG41ZHFh""><em>The Interview </em></a>podcast, Lawrence said that, after spending the President’s first term “running around like a chicken with [her] head cut off,” she felt speaking out wouldn’t have an impact. “We’ve learned election after election, celebrities do not make a difference whatsoever on who people vote for,” Lawrence said. “So then what am I doing? I’m just sharing my opinion on something that’s going to add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart. We are so divided.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. </p><cite>katherine singh</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Lawrence went on to say that she wouldn’t want her personal politics to deter people from coming to see her films, media that, in her words, could “change consciousness or change the world.” While we admire the ambition and trust in her craft (and yes, it is true that art can literally change lives) — please, give us a break. Just say you don’t want to alienate people that will contribute to your bottom line. </p>



<p>But the fact remains that, despite what any comedians or Jennifer Lawrence may think, these celebrities and their platforms do have influence and can elicit change, especially when it comes to <a href=""https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/the_oprah_effect"">political leaders</a>. When Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-president-us-debate-cat-lady"">publicly supported Kamala Harris</a> ahead of the November 2024 Presidential election, sharing her intent to vote for the candidate on Instagram, she <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-vote-gov/"">drove over 400,000 people</a> to the <a href=""http://vote.gov"">vote.gov</a> site over the next 24 hours. <em>Bridgerton</em> actress Nicola Coughlan, who has continued to post frequently to Palestinian aid organizations, has helped <a href=""https://tribune.com.pk/story/2476904/bridgerton-star-nicola-coughlan-raises-over-2-million-for-palestine-despite-hollywoods-warnings"">raise over $2 million USD</a> to date. </p>



<p>To be fair, that’s not to say that celebrities have completely eschewed speaking up and out about what’s currently happening in the country. Walking the red carpet ahead of the 83rd annual Golden Globes show, a handful of stars did speak out about the need for celebrities and lay people alike to be vocal about the current climate in the United States. Speaking to <em>Refinery29, Poker Face</em> actress Natasha Lyon, who donned a pin declaring ICE OUT, said: “I just think it’s important that we don’t normalize what’s going on in this country right now. I love America, I love us, I love our communities,  free speech, I love the Trevor Project and all that. I think it’s important. Renee Good, say her name.” Lyon was one of several actors, including Tessa Thompson, Wanda Sykes, and Mark Ruffalo, who wore pins that said “<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/11/golden-globes-ice-protest-pin-mark-ruffalo-wanda-sykes/88134903007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good</a>,” speaking out against the actions of ICE and in support of Good and Keith Porter Jr., who was also killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/heres-why-stars-are-wearing-ice-out-and-be-good-pins-at-the-2026-golden-globes"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Be Good campaign</a> was launched by advocacy groups in response to ICE’s $1000 million “wartime recruitment campaign” aimed at expanding enforcement officers. <em>Hacks</em> star Hannah Einbinder also walked the carpet donning an <a href=""https://www.artists4ceasefire.org/about"">Artists4Ceasefire pin</a> — a red carpet fashion staple for her. </p>

<p>Later on the same carpet, actress Yvette Nicole Brown was even more explicit with her distaste for the current administration, telling <em>Refinery29</em>’s Unbothered the thing that’s bothering her deeply is, simply: “Our government. That orange ghoul that is terrorizing us everyday,” before warning viewers that “it’s about to be really real, get ready.” </p>



<p>And while accepting her third Golden Globe for Actress in a Musical or Comedy Series, <em>Hacks</em> star Jean Smart also took her moment on-stage to<a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a69966807/jean-smart-best-actress-tv-comedy-golden-globes-speech-transcript-2026/""> encourage viewers to take action</a>, saying: “There’s just a lot that could be said tonight; I said my rant on the red carpet, so I won’t do it here….But let’s all do the right thing. I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do. So let’s do the right thing.” Smart was referring to earlier comments she made on the carpet, telling reporters that filming of the upcoming season of the show was overshadowed by the current goings on in the country, stating: “I feel like we’re kind of at a turning point in this country, and I hope people can keep their heads because that’s actually, really, the hardest thing, I think, is to keep our heads. It’s going to take a lot of courage and concerns, but I think that’s important.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11954340.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=695&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A695"" /></figure>



<p>While fashion has long been political, and these small moments of resistance can be important,  it’s hard to feel like a handful of celebs donning obscured, teeny-tiny pins or making veiled comments about triumphing over fear is enough, or anywhere near enough — because it’s really not.</p>



<p>We need celebrities, with platforms and the ability to reach to and speak to people on every side of these issues, by virtue of their influence, to be vocal about the reality of what’s happening and what the impact is for everyone. We need these big names with big money and big studios attached to them to take action — whether that’s boycotting award shows or refusing to speak to anything other than these issues at this moment in time. </p>



<p>It feels like the bare minimum, and actress Jameela Jamil agrees. Speaking to <em>Refinery29 </em>at the Spotify x The Hollywood Reporter Golden Globes Nominees Night, the British actress — who is a vocal activist — spoke to the inability of many of her colleagues to speak out against injustices, pondering, “Am I brave or are they cowards?”</p>



<p>“I think they’re being greedy and weird and disappointing,” Jamil continued. “Look at the billions of eyeballs on all of us collectively, there should be no outliers of the industry who are the outspoken ones…out there on their own with this amount of privilege.” Jamil pointed to actors like Mark Ruffalo, who has<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DTZBbZLDI3c/?hl=en""> often and vocally spoken out against injustices</a>, noting that, when we look at people like him, we weaponize the word “brave” as a way to separate ourselves, removing ourselves from the expectation that we can and will do the same. “So we rely on individuals to do what would be so much easier to achieve as a collective.” </p>

<p>And if the Golden Globes are any indicator of what this upcoming awards season will hold when it comes to celebs speaking out, it feels like — once again — Ruffalo will be an outlier. </p>



<p>But as disappointing as the apoliticalness of this awards show was, maybe the bigger disappointment is the fact that we continue to hope and ask for anything different from those we look up to onscreen, and continue to be disappointed when they don’t follow through. Because truly, what can we really expect? At the end of the day, this industry is all about the bottom line. And our faves, who we idolize, meme, emulate and form a parasocial bond with, are largely going to stay on the side of the line that makes sure they get their bag – as long as these injustices don’t impact or affect them directly. </p>



<p>So, for the next few months, award show contenders, winners, and Hollywood ingenues will have the spotlight on them. As they have every other awards’ season, they’ll thank their families and agents; tearfully, they’ll talk about hardship and determination, picking themselves up and trying again. And maybe it’s time we stop hoping for more. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615800.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s 8 p.m. on a Saturday in 2023 on my 30th birthday and I am standing on my own, stone-cold sober, wailing my way through Robbie Williams’ “Angels” at a crowded Italian restaurant in London. Up until this moment, karaoke had always been something I would have never done without drinking, in part because of my fear that people would judge me or find me embarrassing. But here I was, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sober-curious-trend-companies"">a year into sobriety</a>, savoring the mad and euphoric feeling of being fully aware of my actions, surrounded by both loved ones and strangers, and not feeling a shred of social anxiety.</p>



<p>The biggest and most mortifying surprise of my life was just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-non-alcoholic-drinks-to-buy"">fun I could have without drinking</a>. While I wouldn’t say I was addicted to alcohol, I was definitely dependent on it throughout my twenties — it was my social lubricant and tool for emotional regulation in unfamiliar settings. It’s how I celebrated, commiserated, and ended an otherwise banal work day. I’d come to expect drinking to always equal fun and therefore fun to always equal drinking.</p>



<p>There were of course plenty of times when this wasn’t true and the hangover, anxiety, and impact on my debit card showed it was far from worth it. But there was always the hope that this next dinner or night out or post-work drinks would be as glittering as some past one I remembered. Even when I’d tried reducing or stopping my drinking before — especially when I found it was triggering my debilitating <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10714981/ocd-pandemic-photos-emotional-impact"">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> — I subconsciously held firm onto this idea that any fun I had sober would be even more fun when drinking.</p>



<p>It was only when I started a new medication for my OCD [Obsessive Compulsive Disorder] at the beginning of 2022 that I truly began to confront this idea. I stopped drinking and life went on. After a few pub evenings and birthday parties where I felt awkward and withdrawn, I began to embrace acting like a fool and being fully cognizant of it.</p>



<p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking. Two full years on, I maintain that stopping drinking is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my adult life. And more importantly, I’ve experienced all the fun and giddy glee sober that I was inadvertently chasing in a bottle.</p>



<p>This is why I am a firm believer that everyone who drinks should try life without alcohol in some capacity and that if you are considering quitting entirely, there’s no time like the present. But, now, as we roll into another unavoidably grey and miserly January, it is also why I think that for some, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dry-january-tips-las-vegas"">Dry January</a> (spending the whole month sober as a mental and physical reset) might not be the way you begin to experience the joy of a reduced or even alcohol-free life.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Celebrations became riotously fun as I had as much, if not more, fun as I ever did drinking.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I want to be very clear that I’m not criticizing Dry January. It’s a really important initiative led by the brilliant charity <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlC_dCV3SllAnAyUM_X49ajHaShnQGpiZKzdz4f3-Nxrp5Uy98bMp47xoCyIcQAvD_BwE"">Alcohol Change UK</a>, who do important work reducing alcohol harm. It also gives people a “socially acceptable” reason to stop drinking if they struggle with peer pressure. Moreover, people’s relationship with alcohol varies greatly — the more dependent or addicted you are, the more you need to <a href=""https://alcoholchange.org.uk/help-and-support/get-help-now"">consult a professional</a>, like your doctor, before making any big changes, and so the framing that works for me or someone else could be irrelevant for you.</p>



<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach to reworking your relationship with alcohol, and for some people it may mean complete abstinence. <a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"">Tara Swart Bieber</a><a href=""https://www.taraswart.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, MD</a>, tells us: “If someone is misusing or abusing alcohol then medical supervision would be necessary if they wanted to stop. If someone stops and gets symptoms of withdrawal then they should contact their [doctor]. If they are drinking socially and not more than the recommended limits, then they can stop without medical guidance.”</p>



<p>My point though is that taking a month off, especially in January’s grim weather and post-holiday-decadence haze, can just reaffirm the idea that sobriety is boring. As Annabelle Bonus, director of research, policy and strategy at <a href=""https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAsIGrBhAAEiwAEzMlCxuWH2oLE6dQY6DfPY08UEDAQ62RKzAReWwGTkHuavi6XOc83-pwNhoCZDAQAvD_BwE"">Drinkaware UK</a>, tells Refinery29: “Initiatives like Dry January can give people a really clear target if they want to cut down or try to stop drinking completely. While they work really well for some people, other people can find them hard to stick to and that’s completely normal.”</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliegooch/?hl=en"">Millie Gooch</a>, founder of <a href=""https://sobergirlsociety.com/"">Sober Girl Society</a>, a community safe space for sober women changing their relationship with alcohol, agrees. As an advocate for Dry January, she underlines why she supports the initiative. “Where people might have overdone it over the holiday season, Dry January can provide a much-needed break for your body and mind,” she says. “On the flip side, not much socializing happens in January and although this can make not drinking easier, it doesn’t give you as much of a chance to flex your sober socializing muscles.” This can mean the idea of a dinner/night out/festival sober maintains a veneer of intimidation.</p>



<p>The way I’ve combatted this is to focus on getting in at least one social activity where you would in the past have been drinking and experiencing it sober. This can be intimidating at first, especially if you experience social anxiety in social situations. But one big secret I only realized when I stopped drinking is that pretty much <em>everyone</em> feels that way in new social situations. I’ve learned that it will dissipate after an hour or so as people relax — whether they’re drinking or not. And riding that anxiety out becomes far less challenging as you keep trying.</p>



<p>“This [technique of riding out the anxiety] is one of the central tenets of exposure therapy,” explains Sheri Jacobson, PhD, a retired psychotherapist and founder of psychotherapy clinic <a href=""https://www.harleytherapy.co.uk/sheri-jacobson.htm"">Harley Therapy</a>. “You can track your anxiety on a self-reported scale one to 10, and you will notice the anxiety comes down at each 10-minute interval that passes. Most things will dissipate over time.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jacobson emphasizes that it’s psychologically important to make positive associations around not drinking, whether that’s just for one evening or for the foreseeable future. </p>



<p>“What happens in drinking is that there’s a general lowering of inhibitions, which may allow us to speak more freely and be less anxious,” she explains. “The short-term motivation is that we gain these benefits of maybe being more sociable than we would be and a greater sense of freedom. In order to stop drinking, we have to look at the things that are negative for us, and then switch those into something more positive.”</p>



<p>The positives of not drinking are very clear to me. In my experience, it is not just those to your physical and mental health (though those are significant) but learning to overcome social anxiety in awkward situations, feeling at ease in yourself, having better ability to listen to your body when it says it needs food or rest, and then actively choosing to go home (or stay out). You can feel the crispness of euphoria in high definition without it being clouded by booze, you can dip out of repetitive, drunk conversations without anyone being offended (because they’re drunk), and save money. What’s even more fun is that you channel it into something else, be it something you’ve always wanted to try (pottery!) or silly little treats (chocolates!).</p>



<p>Drinking is fun and for many can be the spark that lights the best night of your life. But it doesn’t have to be. Whether you’re attempting Dry January or not, it’s truly worth trying to have a good night without it — one that’s not just calm and clarified but raucous and silly, if that’s what you need. </p>



<p>That won’t be guaranteed the first time you order a lime and soda at your local. As Bonus puts it: “With any sort of behavior change, like cutting down drinking, it should be thought of as a journey rather than something that’s going to change overnight.” But if you find a whole month a prescriptive suggestion or you’re worried that losing drinking will hamper your joy, I am proof that it won’t. And don’t let the grim weather trick you into believing otherwise.</p>
