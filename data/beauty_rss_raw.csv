<p>Just like its subject matter, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8R6DMlDtxk""><em>After The Hunt</em></a> is polarizing. The <a href=""https://www.gq.com/story/luca-guadagnino-wants-to-run-a-film-festival"">Luca Guadagnino</a>-directed and <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/after-the-hunt-screenwriter-nora-garrett-interview-1235154652/"">Nora Garrett</a>-written psychological thriller is being met with mixed reviews. In one camp, you have those who think the film (starring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11504839/ayo-edebiri-bottoms-sag-aftra-strike"">Ayo Edebiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/andrew-garfield"">Andrew Garfield</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/julia-roberts-hair-stylist-interview"">Julia Roberts</a>), which wades into the treacherous waters of depicting the aftermath of a sexual assault on campus, is <a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-the-hunt-film-review-2025"">“sharp”, “well-calibrated” and “provocative”</a> and in the other, you’ve got those who have written the film off as <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/hunt-review-julia-roberts-stars-173419042.html"">“wasted potential” full of “unlikeable characters.”</a> <em>The New Yorker</em> called <em>After The Hunt </em>“<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">a pleasurably ludicrous house of cards</a>” while the <em>New York Times</em> pegged the film as “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/movies/after-the-hunt-review.html"">uncomfortable, for the wrong reasons</a>.” The opposing responses are inevitable when you’re plunging headlong into a <a href=""https://metoomvmt.org/get-to-know-us/tarana-burke-founder/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">topic like #MeToo</a>, a movement turned hashtag turned buzzword that stirs passionate defenses or ardent attacks at its mere mention, usually depending on your political leanings. There’s never going to be a general consensus on cancel culture, racism, sexism, and feminism, or overwhelming unity on how to approach the zeitgeist’s most hotly-debated subjects. The inconsistency is the point. That’s not to say that <em>After The Hunt</em> doesn’t take a clear stance on these issues by its end — it does — but it deftly captures the push-and-pull (and cringe) of where these discussions have landed in the past five years, sometimes clumsily but with nuance, complexity, and self-awareness. </p>



<p>And it’s in that audacity to let its waters stay murky, to allow its characters to be unreliable and unlikeable, and to live in the grey, where I think <em>After The Hunt</em> shines. Roberts plays Alma Imhoff, a Yale professor whose star student, Maggie (Edebiri), accuses her colleague and best friend, Hank (Garfield), of sexual assault. From pretentious pseudo-intellectual debates over whisky to hard-to-watch faceoffs between two women from different generations and races who throw jabs about pronouns and intersectionality at each other to the unfairly messy politics of consent, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCC7iIMHq2U"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a> </em>dares to capture the frustration, hypocrisy and absurdity of the past five to six years (the movie is set from 2019-2025). It doesn’t deliver answers necessarily, but neither does that white dude in your Ethics 101 class — or your timeline — trying to debate you about your humanity. Mostly, these topics shouldn’t be up for debate at all. <em>After The Hunt</em> asks you to confront your own participation in making sexual assault a punchline and complicity in twisting the push for victims into fodder for the culture wars. The movie’s biggest flaw is that the racial dynamic between Maggie and Alma isn’t mined enough, but thanks to stellar performances by Roberts (her best in years) and Edebiri (consistently proving she’s a <em>star</em>), the gaps in the script are filled in with subtext and loaded stares. Throw in a live wire Garfield (he’s riveting and infuriating) and you’ve got a film that grabs hold and doesn’t let go until its final frame.</p>

<p>The week I saw <em>After The Hunt </em>was the same week news broke that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple TV was shelving </a><em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Savant</a></em>, a series in which <a href=""https://time.com/7320232/the-savant-apple-tv-jessica-chastain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Chastain</a> plays an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to take down violent extremists, in the aftermath of the murder of <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-ezra-klein-tanehisi-coates?srsltid=AfmBOoqCp4lcrSX-2nZEsCKOrppLRX-Blw6tyBZrPK9fVFiDIjEhU8Mq"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">right wing podcaster Charlie Kirk</a> reportedly because its subject matter was too sensitive and too close to real life. To me, that’s exactly <em>why</em> that series should have been released. <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain agreed</a>. I’m tired of Hollywood’s fear of tackling relevant topics, I’m tired of films that don’t try to say anything at all. I’m tired of movies that seem built by an algorithm designed to garner the least backlash. At least <em>After The Hunt </em>has a backbone. Throughout the film, Guadagnino delivers a “<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">borderline trollish act of homage</a>” to famously “cancelled” Woody Allen, and it’s a rare, bold confrontation of the real-life controversies <em>After The Hunt</em> is trying to satirize. It was a big swing, and whether you like it or not, the film is an accurate snapshot of the #MeToo era. </p>

<p><em>After The Hunt </em>documents a moment in time — a disturbing, delicate, and awkward moment in time, one that we are still navigating. And for better or worse, shouldn’t we have art that reflects these times? Sometimes, I think I can tell when a movie is going to outlive its discourse. With time, <em>After The Hunt</em> may hold up as a page to be read in the chapter of this so-called cultural reckoning. Think of it as a sleek and uncomfortable time capsule of the past five years of #MeToo discourse, or as a character study of flawed intellectuals desperately attempting to perform their values while clinging to the facade of their respective identities. Or, as Edebiri told me, <em>After The Hunt </em>is a “<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-2795806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rorschach test</a>” that interrogates your discomfort. </p>



<p>Refinery29 spoke to Edebiri and her co-star Garfield over video chat during the film’s press junket in New York City and the duo discussed everything from their hesitation to play these parts, the psyches of their divisive characters, and the more lighthearted generational debates that dominate our timelines. <em>Mild spoilers ahead.</em></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: One of the biggest things I was thinking when I was watching<em> After The Hunt </em></strong><strong>was,<em> wow, they really went there. </em></strong><strong>The movie thrives in the discomfort of some of these big cultural conversations. Did either of you have any apprehension or hesitation when it came to tackling such lightning rod issues?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ayo Edebiri: </strong>Yes, definitely, definitely. But I think part of that was the reason that drew me to this [film] and interrogating within myself: <em>what are my apprehensions? Why am I self censoring my thoughts about these conversations? </em>It’s proof in a lot of these spaces that the reason why we’re not done is because we don’t want to touch certain areas — on all sides. So being able to then go here’s this amazing, intentional, thoughtful, caring group of people and we all want to dig into this thing with each other. It was an honor to get to dive in.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937718.png?width=1024&amp;height=640&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A5"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Andrew, do you feel the same way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew Garfield: </strong>I do, and I think we’re in a moment in time right now where artists can feel fearful around what they’re allowed to express or explore. And we’re all looking to survive out here in this life. We want to make sure that our work gets sponsored and we rely on sponsorship. We rely on studios, on institutions, on people with paychecks to get projects made, to get our work into people’s hearts, and that can be costly to our own integrity sometimes. And with this [film], it was like, <em>Oh, we get to explore a very, very tender arena of subjects, and we get to really do it. </em>And I’ve said this before, but when Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal, because not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a very, very caring, sensitive position of humility and care. Obviously, this is a series of subjects that require that kind of care. </p>



<p><strong>I think that care came through. And I think it’s also just important for films to reflect a snapshot of what the cultural conversation is, especially in the last five years. But much as it is about these big topics, it’s really just a character study that digs into complicated people and the ways in which they are selfish, manipulative, and not always the most moral people. There’s no clear hero or villain throughout most of the movie. Can you both talk about the importance of those moral grey areas and characters who aren’t necessarily likable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>It’s been interesting and honestly really cool listening to people who have watched the film, and sometimes more than once, saying how they felt the day they saw it, versus a week later, when you’ve had more time to marinate on it. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937773.jpeg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p>All of these characters have their own context, their own histories, their own baggage, that they’re walking around with — however conscious or unconscious. And I think in the same vein, when you’re a moviegoer, that’s happening too. You’re thinking like,<em> Oh, here’s what I’m gonna expect out of a Luca Guadagnino film, or out of a Julia Roberts performance.</em> These are the characters. And this one is the Black girl. So this is what she’s going to do in the story engine. We’re walking around with all these things. And you can watch the movie one way and get what you want out of it, or you can realize something is being subverted, both in the film and in yourself. I think it’s like this really cool, tricky, layered Rorschach Test that Luca put together, and it’s very intentional. </p>

<p>The more that I watch the movie, or the more I sit with it, I’m like<em>, Oh my God, there’s this thing that I didn’t notice</em>, even though I was fully there. I think that act of conversation is what’s really important to me. If we can, in this type of work and play, get to lead people to these conversations, that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ayo, I keep thinking about the first time we see Maggie, and she’s looking at this African artifact in Alma’s house. To me it told me a lot about this character and her discomfort in this predominantly white space. I know you went to NYU, a predominantly white institution. What were the ways in which you related to Maggie and do you have any advice for Black women navigating those spaces? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>What’s interesting to me about Maggie is that I feel we have very different ethoses and in places I think there’s discomfort. We’ve been talking a lot about the subconscious versus the conscious. I don’t know if Maggie would describe herself as uncomfortable in that moment.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t know if she would, to be honest, and that’s its own very loaded thing. And I don’t know how much she’s aware of that, but it is operating outside of her. There’s also a scene where she hugs Julia [playing Alma] and she looks up at a statue. That statue is one of Yale’s founders. That man was a slave owner. The movie ends on the shot of money. Who is the President on the money? These sorts of things are just operating all the time underneath us, while we’re also engaged in these person-to-person interactions day-to-day where we’re maybe forgetting them or ignoring them. That’s what I have to say about the Maggie of it all. </p>



<p>As for advice, yes, I went to a PWI for college. That’s not an uncommon experience. I think finding your people, finding your safe space, whatever that looks like, and making space for connection and sanity — where you need it —  is important. I don’t know if that’s advice, but that’s just what I would say.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937728.jpg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>That’s good advice. Andrew, Hank is so sure he is a good guy but proves by things he says and his actions that he is not. How did you approach that nice guy facade he puts up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, I think he believes he is. He really does believe he’s a good person. I think he feels victimized, and that’s interesting. I just play it as it lays, you play it as it is. And he’s someone that feels like he’s worked very, very hard to get to where he’s got to, that he’s come from a less privileged background, even as a white male, and that he’s had to put in extra hours, extra time, extra energy, and he thinks he’s on the receiving end of an unfair kind of witch hunt. And it’s a really fascinating place to experience, particularly as Hank in the sense of<em> oh yeah, but there’s no way that anyone else is going to see it like this. </em></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>When Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal.. not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a caring, sensitive position of humility and care.</p><cite>andrew garfield</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The isolation of it is really interesting. The loneliness is really interesting. And the comprehension of that loneliness, the awareness of, <em>well, I’m fucked and there’s nowhere to go. </em>I think what’s interesting mostly is the very brief moment that he gets to have of self reckoning at the end of his journey in the film where he maybe gets a glimpse of a part of himself that he had been trying to avoid throughout the story, a part of himself that is able to behave in ways that he would rather not look at. And I think that’s in every scene, whether he knows it or not, that’s in every single time we see him, that ability, that capacity, that entitlement.</p>



<p><strong>Entitlement is a good word for Hank. The idea of generational divides is a big theme in the movie so we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions about millennials versus Gen Z. Ayo, you are technically Gen Z, but I heard you spiritually identify as a millennial, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I’m not technically Gen Z. I’m technically a millennial! I’m literally turning 30. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> And I’m a geriatric millennial. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> Everyone kept calling me Gen Z. And Luca I kept being like, “Stop saying you’re about to be 30. People need to think you’re Gen Z.” And they do that to me and Rachel [Sennott]. They’re like ‘these girls, who you think are young, are actually turning so old? Can you believe [these girls] are about to die at the end of this year, because they’re so old?’<em> [laughs] </em></p>

<p><strong>OK, settle these online debates once and for all. Gen Z prefers TikTok and millennials prefer Instagram. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>Neither. Burn it all. <br /><strong>AG: </strong>Neither, kill it! Burn it! </p>



<p><strong>Gen Z prefer staying home and millennials prefer going to the club. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>In between. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> Let it be. Let everyone be what they want to be, man. I like being at home. </p>



<p><strong>Millennials value stability while Gen Z puts more of an emphasis on finding their dream job. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>We need to have a foot in both worlds. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> General strike! <br /><strong>AG:</strong> We gotta survive.<br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! <br /><strong>AG: </strong>But we also have our souls. <br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! </p>

<p>Get whisked away from mundane days and adult responsibilities, even if just for a moment, with the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gap x Sandy Liang collaboration</a>. </p>



<p>Announced via an <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPjJRG-DUkg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">animated short film</a> created by Annie Choi, Liang’s childhood in New York is reimagined through a nostalgic lens. We see her sketching before her own “dream closet” comes to life with new clothes that empower her before she captures a shooting star. The aesthetic and playfulness perfectly captures Liang’s signature whimsical designs. </p>



<p>“‘Sandy’s Dream Closet’ illustrates how wearing Gap made me feel growing up as I imagined being an adult one day and who I could be,” Liang said in a press release. “I wanted to take the pieces that meant something to me as a kid and reimagine them through my lens today — celebrating girlhood in all its forms, while honoring the iconic styles that make Gap so timeless.”</p>



<p>And with Gap’s portfolio of collaborations, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-beis-luggage-collaboration-2025"">with Béis</a> (and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-summer-new-arrivals"">GapStudio</a>’s recent <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/new/gapstudio?cid=3045197&amp;mlink=5058,1,HP_MERCH_BANNER_GAPSTUDIO_LAUNCH_W_ShopCollection"">partnership with Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and Apple Martin), we know that this on-point designer collab will be another sought-after and successful one.</p>







<p>Known for her feminine aesthetic via pastels, ruffles, and bows, Liang is bringing her style to Gap via a trench coat with an oversized bow, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">Mary Jane ballet flat</a>-printed sweater, and a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=853294002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">denim baseball cap with “star”</a> written in Gap’s logo font. You’ll also find Gap essentials, like hoodies and low-rise jeans with the Liang treatment (AKA bow stitching, vegan fur, and the designer’s first name). And don’t forget about the children (not just your inner child) — there will be <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX#department=165"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">online-exclusive baby and toddler styles</a>, like a onesie, sweatsuit, and spotted fur jacket (which matches the womenswear style lower down). </p>



<p>“Sandy Liang has cultivated both an engaged community and an iconic design perspective, which has allowed her to reimagine our heritage pieces into something entirely new, yet familiar,” said President and CEO of Gap, Mark Breitbard, in the release.</p>

<p>I’ve never been much of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11876654/best-festivals-to-attend-2025"">festival girlie</a>. It’s not because I don’t love live music (I do); Between big crowds (I’m barely 5’2 and main stage GA is not the most short-girl-friendly situation), prolonged time in the sun, and expensive food and drinks (in this economy?!), I always resolved to a life of catching the action on social media from the safety of my couch. However, when <a href=""https://www.t-mobile.com/"">T-Mobile</a> invited me to experience Austin City Limits the magenta way, I jumped at the chance. It felt like kismet: I’ve been a T-Mobile girlie for years, and as a newly-minted Texan (I moved to Dallas during the summer), what could be more fun that getting to channel my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tecovas-cowboy-boots-new-arrivals"">inner cowgirl</a> at the state’s biggest music festival?</p>



<p>Ahead, join me as I document three days of discovering my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/festival-fashion-trends-2025"">festival style</a>, and how to try the look out for yourself.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day One: Floral Frontier</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937352.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The first thing I kept in mind when packing for ACL was that it was going to be hot. As in, 90-degrees-in-direct-sunlight hot. In general, I love to “shop” my closet — I’m a proud outfit repeater — and found an old Reformation dress I bought at a sample sale ages ago but never worn. (<a href=""https://www.thereformation.com/products/everett-mini-linen-dress/1318183TRU.html"">Here</a>‘s a similar one in linen.) Paired with my favorite <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-annie?color=fawn-suede"">Tecovas cowboy boots</a> (also from my closet, a gift from when I moved to Dallas), I decided to lean into the yee-haw vibes with a chocolate bandana I got at <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/bridgette-bandana-hair-scarf/?color=025"">Free People</a>. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Two: Lace &amp; Leather</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937516.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>For day two, I decided to go for an off-duty cowgirl look featuring a romantic <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/how-sweet-is-it-cami/?color=011"">lace tank</a> and faux suede <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/nova-fringe-shorts/?color=020"">fringe micro shorts</a>, both from Free People. (This is not an #ad, I just genuinely love the brand!) I recently found the cutest cowboy hat ever at Anthropologie — it works as a neutral but has teeny-tiny sequins sewn throughout for a hint of sparkle. It was a total compliment magnet, and also helped keep me cool during a day of truly incredible sets seen from the T-Mobile stage. (Also keeping me cool: The AC, fans, and drink stations at Club Magenta — in the club, we’re all fam!)</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Three: Midnight Rodeo</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937351.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>My last festival outfit was a bit of a departure from my usual jeans-and-a-tee everyday style, but when at ACL right? This look was vaguely inspired by <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/all-about-lainey-wilsons-signature-outfits-at-the-2023-cma-awards/"">Lainey Wilson’s 2023 CMA outfit</a>, a black Carolina Herrera strapless jumpsuit with dramatic bell-bottom flares. I found (or rather, they found me via Instagram ad) these <a href=""https://amzn.to/4h1riCp"">lace wide-leg pants</a> on Amazon, which ended up being a perfect choice since they were airy and breathable. I styled it with a DKNY corset top in black satin — another old closet find, but Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has a <a href=""https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/lace-and-satin-balconette-corset-52554319"">similar style</a> I love. I wore the same <a href=""https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/sparkle-cowboy-rancher-hat?color=024&amp;quantity=1&amp;size=0000&amp;type=STANDARD"">Anthropologie cowboy hat</a> from the previous day, plus a black silk bandana tied around my wrist to tie (heh) everything together. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>All in all, I left my first Austin City Limits feeling more confident in incorporating Western and Americana elements in my outfits, and can’t wait to continue experimenting with my personal style in my new city. And as much as I enjoy shopping for an upcoming trip/date/event, I also loved repurposing what I already had, and figuring out new ways to style existing pieces in my closet. Same time next year?</p>

Lola Tung has been serving immaculate press looks for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-to-watch-after-summer-i-turned-pretty"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> Season 3</em>, and with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">the movie</a> on the way, we can expect more Y2K-inspired dreamy updos in the future. The star landed her breakout role in <em>TSITP </em>when she was just 18. She has since gone on to make her Broadway debut in Hadestown and has two other films, <em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30691214/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forbidden Fruits</a></em> and <em>The Young People</em>, yet to be released.<br /><br />There's plenty of beauty inspiration to take from Tung's gorgeous looks, so if you need something to take to the hairdresser or an idea of what hair accessories to try next, look no further. From a sleek blowout at the Paris finale celebration to her 60s-inspired pony at Paris Fashion Week, here's a look at all of <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7535217274479824159?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lola Tung's</a> best hairstyles over the years. <figure><img height=""2999"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935191.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2999&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2000:2999"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Lola Tung's sleek blowout at <em>TSITP</em>'s Paris celebration<br /></h2><br />For <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty's</em> Season 3 finale celebration in Paris, the actor opted for a middle part with a sleek blowout.

While she was game to chop her hair off for the show, due to scenes being shot out of order, it was faked slightly with a wig. So, if you want to sport a bob but don't want to commit, a wig could be an option for you. Showrunner and creator Jenny Han <em><a href=""https://people.com/summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-hair-lola-tung-transformation-11811899"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">told People</a></em> that Tung had the front of her hair cut, while the back was placed into a U-line wig.<br /><span class=""copyright"">Photo: Courtesy of Prime Video.</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""3000"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935195.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Her gorgeous boho headpiece<br /></h2><br />Lola Tung's boho outfit is one to inspire us as the weather gets warmer, and shows how simple accessories can elevate your look.

Wearing a 2003 Versace purple mini slip dress and white slip-on heels, her look reminded us of Jennifer Garner in <em>Suddenly 30</em>.

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla perfume trend</a> isn’t going anywhere soon — if anything, perfume’s favorite gourmand has only gotten more ubiquitous these days. And when it comes to vanilla scents, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/"">Noyz</a> is down bad. The Los Angeles-based perfume label has multiple interpretations of the popular note, including editor-favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-detour-vanilla-perfume-review"">Detour</a>, which debuted earlier this year.</p>



<p>But we’re here to talk about the brand’s latest launch, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>. The vanilla-forward scent combines the warm, cozy appeal of gourmands with the intoxicating vibe of another major fragrance trend: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-skin-scents"">Skin scents</a>.</p>



<p>Notes of vanilla bean, ambroxan, and cedarwood blend with invigorating pink pepper, bergamot, and lily to create a scent that’s complex, addictive, and perfect for fall. Combining vanilla with woody notes isn’t unheard of (Case in point: Another editor-beloved scent, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">7 Virtues’ Vanilla Woods</a>.) But as the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a> is all about tapping into the sensual alchemy of two people connecting — per the brand, it’s rumored to smell a bit different on everyone, <em>à la </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-glossier-you-perfume-new-formula"">Glossier You</a>.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Noyz Only Human 50ML</a>, $85 </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937307.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>I personally think that <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>‘s magic lies in its tightrope-like balance of sweet vanilla, spicy pink pepper, citrusy bergamot, and floral waterlily. At first spritz, the vanilla definitely comes through. But throughout the day, it dries down, leaving room for the floral and ambrox notes to emerge. As with all Noyz creations, you can choose (or indulge in all) from a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">50mL full size</a>, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human?variant=50542921122075"">15mL travel spray</a>, and twist-up <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/the-solid-fragrance-only-human"">solid fragrance balm</a>. To say that I’ve found my favorite fall fragrance isn’t just fun alliteration — it’s a fact, thanks to Noyz.</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween"">Spooky season</a> is here, a time of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scary-ghost-stories-legends"">ghost stories</a>, flickering candles, and marathons of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror classics</a>. But for many of us, autumn isn’t just about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/208186/scary-halloween-costumes-horror-movies"">scary costumes</a> and pumpkin carving (though we definitely love all of that, too). This season opens a portal for honoring ancestors, embracing transformation, and connecting to the unseen.<br /><br />As the days shorten, leaves fall, and the earth prepares to rest, the veil between the physical and spiritual realms thin. In this liminal space, we can feel our ancestors getting closer, guiding, protecting, and reminding us of who we are and where we come from. From the marigolds and copal on Mexico’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> altars, to rum offerings to the orishas in Afro-Caribbean traditions, to pachamama rituals that return food to the soil in gratitude in the Andean region, this is a time of conversation between the living and the dead. <br /><br />But it’s also a season of harvest, moments when we gather the lessons and blessings of what we’ve sown throughout the year. Brujas and healers use this energy to reflect, give thanks, and release. Across Latin American and Latine communities, this could take many forms: a limpia with ruda or rosemary to clear energy, lighting copal or palo santo to call in guidance, or creating a small bóveda espiritual to honor those who came before us. <br /><br />Whether you come from a long line of spiritual practitioners or are beginning to follow your mystical curiosities, autumn invites us to embrace the spiritual. We've gathered some of our favorite Latina-owned witchy brands and tools to help you cleanse the energy around you, connect with yourself and your ancestors, manifest your next chapter, or create your own rituals.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Many of Bruja's items — from candles to oils — are naturally and wildly hand-crafted by Martinez and other local Indigenous spiritualists and artists.<br /><br />""Our ancestors practiced centuries-old healing methods that included native plants and herbs as well as undocumented rituals that have been passed down generation to generation, and we are striving to keep these alive,"" Martinez, who founded the shop in October 2023, tells Refinery29 Somos. ""When people ask why ancestral practices still matter, I say because our bodies remember what our calendars forget. Ritual is how we slow down, heal, and reconnect — to ourselves, to each other, and to the land.""<br /><br />With her <a href=""https://www.bruja.store/bruja-boxes"">Bruja boxes</a>, Martinez makes it easy to bring this ritual work into your life. The <a href=""https://www.bruja.store/product-page/manifest-money-abundance"">Ultimate Money &amp; Abundance Manifestation Box</a>, for instance, includes items like Pyrite, Citrine, Green Aventurine, Tiger’s Eye, a Selenite wand, Seven Chakra white sage, Palo Santo, copal incense, a natural Lion’s Paw shell, apothecary matches, a gemstone bracelet, a tarot card, and a mantra card. Each of these pieces is believed to attract prosperity, abundance, good fortune, and harmony, helping you manifest wealth and positive energy for yourself and your home.<br /><br /><strong>Bruja</strong> Bruja's Money &amp; Abundance Manifest Box, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bruja.store%2Fproduct-page%2Fmanifest-money-abundance"">Bruja</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1558"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11868906.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1244&amp;height=1558&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=622:779"" width=""1244"" /><figcaption>Founders Alex Naranjo and Marlene Vargas created <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhouseofintuitionla.com%2F&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fwitchy-gifts-halloween-magic"">House of Intuition</a>, their metaphysical oasis dedicated to enlightening, empowering, and uplifting our communities, in 2010 in Los Angeles.

<p>After playing stubborn, anti-capitalist, one-of-the-boys <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/07/10607247/outer-banks-season-2-cast-new-characters-list"">Kiara “Kie” Carrera</a> for four seasons on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYBRxU8XSy8""><em>Outer Banks</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9690851/outer-banks-netflix-cast-friendship-roommates"">Madison Bailey</a> is entering her rom-com era. In <a href=""https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Maintenance-Required/0MXYDY9ZW9JL8NF3C0EX7DIG33"">Prime Video’s <em>Maintenance Required</em></a><em>, </em>she plays Izzy, one part of an all-female mechanic shop who loves wearing head-to-toe pink as much as she loves giving manicures to people as they wait for their car repairs. Izzy’s best friend Charlie (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9937462/madelaine-petsch-interview-birth-control"">Madelaine Petsch</a>) owns the shop and is in a complicated situationship with Beau (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jacobscipio/?hl=en"">Jacob Scipio</a>), her anonymous online crush she doesn’t realize is also her corporate rival IRL. While sparks fly on and offline for Charlie and Beau, her besties Izzy and Kam (Katy O’Brian) provide the comedic relief and humor often lacking in recent romance movies. The movie is a classic rom-com (a nice modern twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/youve-got-mail""><em>You’ve Got Mail</em></a>) that allows Bailey to show off, as she puts it, a “more feminine” side we have yet to see from her onscreen.  </p>



<p>Now that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/outer-banks-netflix-review-teen-drama""><em>Outer Banks</em></a> is filming its <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/outer-banks-season-5"">fifth and final season</a>, which Bailey is feeling “deeply sentimental” about, she’ll have the chance to explore whatever she wants. Whether that’s music (her first love), more acting, or all of the above, Bailey is certain she wants to explore all the different facets of her identity as a Black, queer woman. Over Zoom, Bailey talks to Refinery29 about OBX season 5, what’s next for her after <em>Outer Banks</em>, putting the “com” in rom-com <em>Maintenance Required</em>, and her thoughts on the age-old nail shapes debate: square or almond? </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: This is such a fun part and a fun movie. What made you want to take on this role? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Madison Bailey: </strong>It is such a fun movie, and I think that’s why I wanted to be part of it. I read the script and [was excited] to be the comedy part of a rom-com. It just felt like something very different from what I’ve done before. I’m also playing a much more feminine character than I’ve got to play on screen. And so I got to tap into this side of me, this girly girl side of me, that was really fun. Also the cast is amazing, and I wanted to work with them as well.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>In my 11 years of being an actor, it was maybe the easiest scene I’ve ever done.  </p><cite>madison bailey on singing ‘super bass’ by nicki minaj in ‘maintenance required’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>I love rom-coms and I love what you said about your character being the comedy part of this rom-com. In some recent “rom-coms” I feel like they are missing the comedy part, and this is a true romantic comedy in that it is very funny. So talk a little bit about that genre. What is it about the genre specifically that you love so much?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>​​Rom-coms are one of my favorite genres because they’re just fun to watch. You can fall for the characters quickly, and it’s an easy watch. Personally, one of my favorites is<em> 50 First Dates. </em>And I think it was really fun to do this genre that sort of had its peak in the early 2000s and I wish we were making more of them. I was happy to be doing a movie that I would be excited to watch.</p>



<p><strong>Bring them back! </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>We need more! Just fun, easy, watches!</p>



<p><strong>We have to talk about the nails. Your character Izzy is a mechanic and also a nail tech. How long did those take? What was the process of coming up with the nail looks? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> The stylist and the nail tech on set definitely had some free reign. I have a green set and a pink set that I wear for the majority of the movie. I think I have four or five nail changes in total, two of them that I pitched and sent pictures for inspo for it was super collaborative. </p>



<p><strong>Where did you find the inspiration? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> Pinterest, Instagram, TikTok, just on my socials. And I was like,<em> Oh, this is so cool.</em> I love fun nails personally. I love a simple fringe, but I also love doing all of the things and making every nail different. The process of putting on the nails was pretty easy. We just did nail stickers because I couldn’t actually do acrylic due to having to change them per scene. So it was a little bit of a task because they weren’t as secure. I didn’t get to just live my normal life with acrylic nails. They were very lightly on, so the whole day kind of looks like this<em> [motions gingerly picking up things with her nails]</em>, and a lot of being so careful. I just accepted that they were gonna pop off throughout the day.</p>



<p><strong>Was there ever a moment where you had to stop a take or stop rolling mid scene because they popped off?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Absolutely!<strong> </strong>Or I was just like, and we’re rolling, and I’m like, <em>no, no, no, I don’t have my nails. I’m missing two. I cannot! </em></p>



<p><strong>What’s your answer to the age-old debate: almond or square nails? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>In the movie I had two long square sets and two shorter almond sets. Personally, I like long and tapered squares, not completely square. But not stiletto because I feel like it’s hard to do that. So just a tapered square for me personally.</p>



<p><strong>I’m an almond girlie right now but it’s okay, we’ll agree to disagree.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong><em> [laughs] </em>I love the long almond though! I like the long almonds better than the short almond.</p>



<p><strong>The chemistry between you, Madelaine Petsch and Katy O’Brian was my favorite thing in the movie. How did you develop that bond? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>We were really fortunate for the majority of it to just come very naturally to all of us. As far as bonding, we did a lot of dinners, we did some activities, like an escape room, just fun things hanging out. Off set [hangouts] always help. But also I think we just clicked immediately.</p>



<p><strong>It really leapt off screen. There’s a scene where you’re all in the car and you’re all rapping along to “Super Bass” by Nicki Minaj. I know you’re an artist yourself. Did you have to prep for that scene or were those lyrics already right here?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>No, honestly, in my 11 years of being an actor, it was maybe the easiest scene I’ve ever done. <em>[laughs]</em> I was like,<em> I know my lines. I’m off book. I’m ready to go call action. Where are we starting? </em>“Super Bass” is one of those songs that people dedicated to learning the lyrics like 10 years ago and you’ll never forget them.</p>



<p><strong>Yes! I’ll be in a nursing home and still know “Super Bass.” Are you a Barb?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>I would say I’m a Barb. I definitely am.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937221.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p><strong>You mentioned the femininity of your character’s style and having to tap into that. How fun was it to tap into that feminine side when that’s not  necessarily what we’ve seen you do on screen in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> It was just so fun. I would say I’m a girly girl [but] I typically play very tomboy characters so I was very excited to tap into this side of myself and map out the looks and collaborate with the stylist. We wanted her style to be funky, but not unrealistic, just maximalist and fun and then with the jewelry, bringing some Oakland swag to her. </p>



<p><strong>We know that <em>Outer Banks </em></strong><strong>is ending with Season 5, which you are shooting now. How are you feeling about it? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Deeply sentimental. Not only are we just trying to absorb everything for the last time and just really take it in, I think we’ve all been overwhelmed with gratitude this year. I would say that’s the number one word: gratitude. We show our love to each other every day. We always tell each other that and we’ve just built such a support group and such a bond. It’s going to be so insane to not be working with these people anymore, and I think we’re feeling all that comes with that. Like, the other day, we were like,<em> This is our Is this our last boat day? </em>Like,<em> is this our last time going out on the boats and coming back in at sunset? </em>We’re all in our feels this year.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Not only are we just trying to absorb everything for the last time and just really take it in, I think we’ve all been overwhelmed with gratitude this year… We’re all in our feels.</p><cite>madison bailey on the end of ‘outer banks’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>What can you tease about Season 5? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>What can I tease? I would just say that this season holds a different space tonally than we’ve seen in past seasons. We’re all dealing with this loss [JJ’s death], and we see it pan out for all of these characters that are typically free-for-all, nothing-to-lose kids, and then we experience a loss and it hits all of us.</p>



<p><strong>That vibe seems like maybe it felt very apropos to how you are all feeling about grieving the end of the show.</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Yeah. I mean, there’s definitely moments where we’re in tears [for the show] and there’s more to cry about. I’m looking around like, <em>Ah, everything’s so sad. This is it! This is our last year! </em>But like I said, just feeling so grateful.</p>



<p><strong>On the flip side of that, is there something that you’re most excited for when it comes to life after <em>Outer Banks</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>MB:</strong> I think I’m excited to just to really be able to pick the projects that I want to do. I think I have done amazing projects that I really wanted to do. But it’s also like there is an element of what I can do in this timeframe? And there are scripts that I’ve loved that [I couldn’t do] because they were shooting while I’m shooting [<em>Outer Banks</em>]. So I’m excited to have the availability in my schedule to really map out what I want to do.</p>



<p><strong>You’re someone who’s been so outspoken about the intersections of your identity as a queer person and a biracial Black person. Is that something that you’re thinking of when you’re looking at what you’re going to do next? </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>Absolutely. I mean, it’s my hope that by the time I’m done with this amazing job that I have, that I will have been able to tell not only stories that I’m not that familiar with, but also to be able to tell all the stories within myself. Because, like you said, I am intersectional. I’m a woman, I’m Black, I’m queer, and I want to tell all of those stories from different perspectives and multiple times. I’m excited for those opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>We are Refinery29 so one of the questions we love to ask is: what advice would you give to your 29 year old self? I know it’s only in a couple years. </strong></p>



<p><strong>MB: </strong>What do I want to tell my 29 year old self? You know what? I’ve said that 30 sounds a lot better than 29 so I would tell my 29-year-old self to just wait it out. Like, next year is your year. Next year the fun starts. Enjoy your last year in your 20s for what it is but they make it sound so fun. I’m 26 and I’m telling you, 30 has got to be good, because this is tough. So I would say just soak it in and know that the best years are on the way.</p>

<p>It’s officially boot season (thank goodness) so it’s time to upgrade your shoe game with classic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">knee-highs</a> and suede booties, trendy moto and slouchy styles, and especially <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-cowboy-boots-summer"">cowboy boots</a>. I never personally embraced the Western aesthetic… that is until I tested my first pair of <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tecovas</a> boots almost a year ago.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-jolene?color=caramel-bone--cowhide"">Jolene boots</a> (with their horseshoe pattern) have become a cross-seasonal staple in my wardrobe. Whether I dress them up with a leather blazer or down with flare jeans, these boots are surprisingly versatile (although it’s probably <em>not surprising</em> to all those in the West and South who regularly wear them).</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936926.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>So when Tecovas recently opened its first New York storefront, I knew I had to visit. And, wow, did I get a taste of Texas’ Southern hospitality. From the complimentary (!) customization bar (I got the limited-edition Statue of Liberty design branded onto my new boots) to an actual 21+ bar (I recommend the Bourbon &amp; Birch cocktail), the warm, saloon-like space is like a Western escape in the middle of Manhattan.</p>



<p>After exploring additional in-store amenities (including hat shaping and boot cleaning), I tried new styles across the brand’s boots, hats, and bags. But Tecovas isn’t just in the accessories game; Tecovas’ <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/shop/apparel/womens"">new fall styles</a> include everything from cozy cardigans and kitschy graphic tees to vintage-inspired jeans.<br /><br />Read on for my honest reviews of some of the <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/shop/womens?collection=new-arrivals"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">newest Tecovas styles</a>, and to shop your own pair of boots or accessories for the upcoming seasons (especially since there’s no sign of the cowgirl aesthetic going out of style). </p>

<h2>New Tecovas Leather Cowboy Boots</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936920.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936921.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Unsurprising to myself, I was immediately drawn to one of the brand’s most expensive boot styles. <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-annie?color=bone-cowhide"">The Annie boot</a> is a bestseller that typically ranges between $345 and $365, but the limited-edition, color-blocked eel leather costs a pretty $595. The shiny leather and rich colors are very luxurious, and pair perfectly with the brand’s new eel <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/eel-concho-clutch?color=green-eel"">Concho Clutch</a> for special occasions. <br /><br />Another special option (with a lower price tag) is the bestselling <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-sadie?color=toasted-almond-suede"">Sadie boot</a>, which has a shorter profile and now comes in metallic goldish-greenish cowhide leather. These are the perfect pair for nights out — like going line dancing with your besties, which is surging in popularity — or to channel an anticipated Act III album from Beyoncé. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>New Tecovas Suede Cowboy Boots</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936922.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936923.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m a sucker for suede boots, so I was excited to try new styles. The Annie in suede is very classic, but the new distressed charcoal color is a bit more fresh. The Sadie is also available in suede, and this pair features intricate braiding that I found really beautiful.<br /><br />Now, onto the boot I <em>couldn’t</em> wear: <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-abby?color=eclipse-suede"">The Abby</a>. I generally have to order wide-calf boots for myself, so I was skeptical about trying the brand’s knee-high and over-the-knee styles. While The Annie is offered in wide-calf options, others are not, so I couldn’t quite slip The Abigail all the way up. But pro tip: every Tecovas store offers free boot stretching. I witnessed this service in person when a worker stretched the shaft of a boot up to an extra inch wider. This is a huge perk if you’re able to make it into a store so that your boots fit perfectly.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>New Tecovas Cowboy Hats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11936925.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I don’t typically wear hats because of my stingy bangs, but I was eager to try my first cowboy hat. The brand has a range of styles — from “cowboy hats” with curved brims to “cowgirl hats” with flat wide brims — that are available in several sizes. The unisex <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/cattleman-straw-cowboy-hat?color=natural-straw"">Cattleman Straw Cowboy Hat</a> and <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-belle-wool-cowgirl-hat?color=medium-brown-wool"">The Belle Wool Cowgirl Hat</a> were my favorite.<br /><br />Tecovas also offers tons of trucker caps, including new styles you can shop below. I finally left the store with the new <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/mechanic-denim-6-panel-mid-pro-hat?color=blue-denim"">Mechanic Denim Hat</a>, which seems more feasible to wear around NYC for weekend walks, to baseball games, or at festivals than a wide-brim hat. I think it’ll also pair great with my go-to denim-on-denim outfits and cowboy boots for fall outings. </p>
