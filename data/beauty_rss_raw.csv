<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958198.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In the midst of all the chaos going on in the world, it’s nice to know that Venus in Pisces is bringing us a fairytale vibe. Venus in Pisces, which lasts from February 10th to March 6th 2026, is pulling out all the lovely stops, allowing us to feel confident in ourselves as well as relationships (both platonic and romantic). This is a moment of gentleness. We are finding solace and comfort through intimacy in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-lookbook-editor-letter-2025"">the depths of winter</a>. Whether we’re involved with others or not, it’ll be easy to feel the warmth and kindness regardless.</p>



<p>Venus in Pisces is in its “exaltation,” meaning the position of the planet in the water sign is favorable. The reason Venus thrives in Pisces is that the planet yearns to be unconditional, adaptable, tender, and creative. Venus in Pisces is all that and more — encouraging people to be forgiving and sacrificing for others. This transit encourages us to lead with the heart, ask questions later, and to understand those we care about through compassion. At times, Venus in Pisces can make us idealistic, but it’s only that we want to believe in the fantasy we set in our minds about what partnerships should be and look like. Anything less than that won’t suffice.  </p>



<p>On occasion, Venus in Pisces can be a tad mischievous, since the water sign is a mutable sign and absorbs the energy around it. People could take advantage of our goodwill, demanding more without reciprocating, and in turn, pushing us to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">call for boundaries.</a> Therefore, we have to be careful about what we allow in our lives and the quality of people we associate with. Be mindful of those who aren’t serving us anymore. </p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Pisces encourages us to be dreamy and artistic. Eclipse season and Mercury retrograde cross paths with Venus in Pisces, pushing us to focus on camaraderie and self-care more than anything else. Aligning with partners that are on the same page won’t be hard, although our desires are currently evolving and in flux. Three major aspects are essential to defining how Venus in Pisces will affect us. Fortunately, the North Node of Destiny, Jupiter, and Uranus are cultivating greatness for everyone. </p>



<p>Embrace switching up your style, if you want to. If you do, then use the weeks before February 26th, when Mercury turns retrograde, to ensure no regrets.</p>



<p>On February 17th, the same day as the Lunar New Year and annular solar eclipse in Aquarius, Venus aligns with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces. The karmic moment makes us more passionate and optimistic about relationships. Our confidence is high, pushing us to shoot our shot when it comes to asking out our crush, evolving commitments, and trying a new approach to dating. Since we’re feeling ourselves, we will not shy away from being bold and experimenting with different styles of expression, even acting through a leap of faith and believing the best in those we care about, regardless <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-red-flags"">of the red flags</a>.</p>



<p>Venus and Jupiter in Cancer bring luck on February 22nd. Both planets are two of the “greater benefics,” bringing positive energy and favorable news. Together, they can refine our ethics, promise abundance, offer security, and intensify our rizz. It encourages us to strive for the good life. We must listen to our gut. Intuition can be a lifesaver — now, more than ever. </p>



<p>Uranus in Taurus adds a streak of wildness and excitement to Venus’s cosmic mix on March 4th. If a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">situationship isn’t working</a>, we aren’t going to allow it to bring us down. We’ll break out and be free, helping us soar on the wings of love with someone who is worthy of our time. This could also mean that we are dating against our type to insert freshness into dating. And we lived happily ever after? Fingers crossed!</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958552.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We know where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> stood on political and social issues because she told us, vehemently, loudly, and often. She told us in her music with songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWM"">Mississippi Goddamn</a>” and her cover of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vBga68Xdc"">Strange Fruit</a>,” two songs about lynching and the brutalization of Black folks during the civil rights era. <a href=""https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-radical-politics-of-nina-simone"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">She told us explicitly</a> through quotes like the one that’s been making its rounds on social media lately: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo"">an interview from the ‘60s</a><em>. </em>“How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</p>



<p>The quote has been used so much it’s been flattened into a meme. But it’s true that there are few artists in 2026 who are as committed to reflecting the times. Sixty years after Simone, then one of  the most notable singers in the world, used her voice to denounce systemic racism, critique capitalism, and unequivocally support the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190444/black-panther-movies"">Black Panthers</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-panther-style"">Black Power movement</a>, it’s hard to imagine a famous singer of her stature being as specific, bold, and unflinching in their activism and political outspokenness — within their music and outside of it. Silence is the standard. Sure, there are a few exceptions and after the Grammys, when multiple artists did speak out against <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205854/abolish-ice-origins-twitter-undocumented-immigrants"">ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-2026-bad-bunny-political-references-halftime-show-11487269"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance,</a> the energy seems to have shifted slightly. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-grammy-boy/story?id=129980775"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCn2cmfEgA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/best-new-artist-grammys-lost-brits-1236174909/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Dean,</a> <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2026-02-04/shaboozey-responds-grammys-speech-backlash"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shaboozey</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/sza-ice-grammys-1236170851/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Eilish</a> all used their platforms at the Grammys to talk about how <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/presidential-debate-trump-harris-immigration"">ICE is dehumanizing immigrants</a> and terrorizing American communities. </p>



<p>To varying degrees of eloquence and effectiveness, these artists attempted to meet the moment at the Grammys, which came just a week after anti-ICE demonstrations erupted across the U.S. to protest the killings of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-transformed-federal-immigration-alex-pretti-renee-good-rcna256032"">Renee Good and Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis by ICE agents. Their statements were met with overwhelming support online and applause from the audience, like everyone was waiting for celebrities to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">stop treating awards shows like it’s business as usual</a> and capitalize on the attention that comes with the stages they are afforded. For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p>



<p>On the red carpet for the Golden Globes last month, I asked<em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Poker Face</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> star Natasha Lyonne</a> about the “ICE OUT” pin she was wearing. She mentioned Renee Good by name. That interview garnered over six million views. And when I spoke to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUB5W6jDwM/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">actress Jameela Jamil</a> on another red carpet about how she gets called “brave” when she speaks up about social issues while other celebs stay silent, she responded, “Am I brave or are they cowards?” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Call it cowardice or bravery or anything in between, but what celebrities choose to say — or don’t — about the state of the world is always a hot topic. So, what do we <em>really</em> want to hear from artists in times of crisis? It may be too simple to say that every single celebrity should be performing their activism on social media or during awards speeches. A social post is the bare minimum. And many of these artists do not have the range to engage in a productive political debate. There are many different ways to support causes you care about, and if you have money, funding movements, giving to organizers on the ground, or to victims’ families can be more powerful than simply posting an Instagram story. I don’t think it’s a useful pastime to litigate what each celeb has or hasn’t said on their personal social media accounts. But two things can be true. And we live in a time when celebrities wield more power and access than ever, with legions of stans ready to act on command. We know that when famous artists do speak up, it works. </p>



<p>Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration"">increased voter registration by 23 per cent</a> (the number of 18-year-olds registered more than doubled) in 2023 with a non-partisan plea for her followers to vote. Swift is an example of someone who, despite making a documentary that was heavily about her decision to start <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump"">speaking out against Donald Trump</a>, has chosen to remain neutral in a time that demands partiality. Telling fans to vote without making it clear that their basic rights and freedoms are on the line is like inviting people to dinner without telling them the menu is a choice between hot dogs and razor blades. One option ain’t great; the other will kill you. But most artists try to toe the line. On one hand, Beyoncé will deliver an album that can be interpreted as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/04/11698236/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-country-music-history-reaction"">searing critique of America</a> while highlighting oft-forgotten Black history and on the other, she’ll be spotted <a href=""https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/jadegomez510/beyonce-ivanka-jared-charity-dinner"">partying with members of an administration</a> hell bent on erasing that very history. In 2026, there are only a handful of celebrities who seem to be truly channeling the spirit of Simone. The rest opt into conversations about social justice when it’s comfortable, convenient, and popular. </p>



<p>The Grammys were proof of this. From the vague (Shaboozey) to the sincere (Olivia Dean and SZA) to the specific (Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, and Kehlani), the show ended up being an unintentional showcase of the typical range of celebrity responses to social injustice. To be clear, I think it’s important and necessary that each of these artists chose to use their speeches to stand up for immigrants and stand against ICE. But if you are going to speak up, as <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/2026-grammys-review-politics.html"">Craig Jenkins put it for Vulture</a>, we’re going to need more “naming and shaming.” Jenkins wrote, “The ingredients for a broadcast that could brashly outline the regime connections in the building were in play, but any elephant in the room that was tacitly acknowledged was also rarely explicitly named and shamed.”</p>



<p>Take Shaboozey for example. “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them,” the singer said as he accepted the Grammy for Best Country Group/Duo Performance. “For all children of immigrants, this is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunities, to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it.” It’s a nice sentiment, but Shaboozey didn’t say “ICE” once in his speech and his “immigrants built this country” line not only erases the labor of enslaved Black Americans, it also plays into the harmful idea that immigrants deserve to be treated fairly solely because of their labor instead of the fact that they are human beings. <a href=""https://people.com/shaboozey-addresses-backlash-immigrants-built-this-country-remark-grammys-speech-11899304"">Shaboozey has since apologized</a> and clarified his statements. I’m sure that the risk of receiving backlash for clumsy comments is why many stars refuse to say anything at all, but the stakes are too high to be scared of some silly social media fallout. Plus, the potential repercussions — like losing followers or brand deals — are trivial concerns compared to the violence people are facing at the hands of ICE, and in the wake of the Trump administration’s tyranny.</p>



<p>Someone who seems to understand this is Bad Bunny, and his career hasn’t suffered. Bad Bunny is also one of the few artists topping the charts in 2026 who actually incorporates his beliefs into his music. Bad Bunny speaks to the colonial violence America has enacted globally, and refuses to conform to the white supremacist ideals it continues to perpetuate. In a recent piece for NPR called “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/05/nx-s1-5701460/where-are-the-protest-songs"">Where Are All The Protest Songs?</a>, Ann Powers writes, “Bad Bunny stands out in 2026 not only for his historic success as the first artist win album of the year for a Spanish-language album, but because DtMF does <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-political-lines-explained"">explicitly enact resistance</a> in songs like “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” calling out American imperialism, gentrification and the displacement of his fellow Puerto Ricans.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s [Bad Bunny’s] clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In fact, Bad Bunny’s success hasn’t been hindered by his outspokenness, I think it’s added to it. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is unapologetically himself, a proud Puerto Rican, and someone who believes in the power of art to be political <em>and</em> personal. “Before I say thanks to God,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech for Best Música Urbana Album, “I’m gonna say ICE out… We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” And when he won Album of the Year, Bad Bunny accepted in Spanish and dedicated his award to Puerto Rico. At the Super Bowl, Bad Bunny displayed a sign that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and during “El Apagón,” a song which mentions the <a href=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/19/bad-bunny-el-apagon-music-video-puerto-rico-hurricane-gentrification/10426694002/"">power grid issues Puerto Rico</a> has struggled with since Hurricane Maria (due in large part to the inaction of the U.S. government), the set featured Bad Bunny and dancers hanging from utility poles. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Bad Bunny also listed countries</a> across Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America in his Super Bowl set, speaking to our diasporic connection and bookended his performance with holding up a football with the words, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Together, We Are America</a>” scrawled on it, pushing the message that borders are imaginary and cultures are global. It’s this clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ask is for celebrities to show us their values, some of them will also show us their asses. Despite being dubbed “MAGA Barbie,” Sydney Sweeney has yet to specifically denounce the actions of the party she’s associated with (Sweeney is reportedly a registered Republican). In a <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">recent interview with Cosmopolitan</a>, Sweeney said, “I’ve never been here to talk about politics. I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of. And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” Later <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">in the Q&amp;A</a>, Sweeny vaguely defines her beliefs as being rooted in love by saying, “I’m not a hateful person” and doubles down on the idea that art is not political. </p>



<p>“I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am,” Sweeney told Cosmo. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form.” These statements are genuinely so stupid, I almost don’t want to give them the dignity of a rebuttal. The last time <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">I wrote about Sweeney</a>, I swore it was the last time. But this notion that entertainment and politics should be segregated, that one has no bearing on the other and vice versa, isn’t just a false belief held by Sweeney to justify her inability to emphatically condemn an image of herself she helped create. Since the Grammys, the sentiment has been echoed by <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/why-don-t-stfu-mark-130425855.html"">Kevin O’Leary</a> and <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/ricky-gervais-celebrities-leave-politics-out-speeches-grammys-1236494483/"">Ricky Gervais</a>, two old white men no one should be paying attention to and yet, here we are. </p>



<p>O’Leary posted that Eilish should “STFU [shut the f-ck up]” after she said “No one is illegal on stolen land” in her speech accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year. “I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE,” Eilish continued. Based on their recent statements, Sweeney, O’Leary, and Gervais seem to agree that the artists who spoke up at the Grammys should just “shut up and sing.” But art <em>is</em> political and it always has been. Every piece of art – a song, a movie, a TV show, an album — is created within the social context of its time. Sweeney ran an unsuccessful Oscar campaign for playing an abused lesbian boxer in <em>Christy</em>. Victims of domestic violence and members of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3lT_r0MYA"">LGBTQ community</a> are two vulnerable groups whose <a href=""https://time.com/7332225/domestic-violence-victims-shelter-trump-immigration/"">legal protections have been under attack</a> since Trump was elected again. </p>



<p>And while art has been used by governments to weaponize, propagandize, and manipulate populations, it has also been suppressed and censored to shut down resistance. Art can be a joyful act of defiance and a powerful instrument of protest. When Sweeney calls herself a storyteller without acknowledging how stories can push narratives, preserve history, propel representation forward or stereotype entire demographics, she’s either being wilfully ignorant or just illiterate (literacy is another example about how art is political). And when artists use art to lure in victims or cover up their crimes (R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood elite in the Epstein files, I could go on), it’s impossible to say that the two are separate. </p>



<p>At the Grammys, country singer<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jelly-roll-allegedly-confronted-reporter-185644570.html""> Jelly Roll came under fire</a> for proclaiming that “people shouldn’t care to hear my opinion” because he’s “a dumb redneck.” This is also a common refrain from celebrities (and influencers). They claim not to be informed enough to speak on current events. If they are going to be given microphones, you’d think they’d put some thought and care into what they are going to say into it. There is a responsibility that comes with fame and feigning cluelessness isn’t a good excuse, it’s a copout. Jelly Roll can speak about Jesus and preach about his religion, but he refuses to interrogate the teachings in the very Bible he totes around in order to stand up for the basic human rights of his neighbors. Jelly Roll’s comments probably didn’t come as a surprise. He’s a white country star and the genre tends to lean heavily conservative. The music industry is a business, and when the majority of your fan base is Republican, artists aren’t staying silent out of ignorance, they are choosing money over morals. </p>



<p>Money is the only explanation for Nicki Minaj’s recent behavior — even though her fanbase is overwhelmingly queer and Black. In the past, the Trinidad-born, New York-raised rapper hailed herself as a proud immigrant standing in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Now, she’s full MAGA. “I am probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change,” Minaj said last week at the U.S. Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit. “And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> My wish is for these artists to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Along with holding hands with Trump (shudder), Minaj “thanked the president for getting her a Trump Gold Card, a kind of visa for wealthy foreigners to help them secure expedited U.S. residency,” <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/nicki-minaj-trump-gold-card-husband-citizen-grammys-trevor-noah-don-lemon.html"">according to Slate</a>. “The visa normally requires a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go?accountMarketingPreferences=off"">$1 million contribution, plus fees</a>; Minaj… nabbed the Trump Gold Card for free.” There’s conflicting reports as to whether Minaj’s visa is legit, but it’s clear that cozying up to Trump is for her own personal gain. As digital creator and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUZnISvjqZl/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Raven Schwam-Curtis says in a video</a> posted to her @ravenreveals account, Minaj “has chosen to side with a president that uses the optics of Black women as ‘proof’ that his regime is doing good things for our communities while actively harming us,” she says. “Representation doesn’t equal liberation or solidarity. If anything it shows how easily representation can be weaponized by the right when your class position pulls you out of solidarity with regular Black folk.” Through her art, Minaj gained wealth, status, and standom that she has now leveraged to push her far-right agenda. And <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-fans-barbz-vote-republican-trump-11482667"">according to Newsweek</a>, legions of Minaj’s fans, dubbed “Barbz” are following her pivot to the Republican Party. </p>



<p>It’s already problematic that we live in a time where celeb worship is at an all-time high. We shouldn’t be looking to these people to tell us what to believe, but they are influential, whether we want them to be or not. If Minaj and Bad Bunny stand at two opposite ends of the celebs speaking up politically spectrum, they each represent the <em>dos</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of celebrity political activism. One is emphasizing how culture and community can combat oppressive regimes (Benito) and the other is proof that conformity and greed can make you complicit in upholding them (Minaj).</p>



<p>The Grammys, and the Super Bowl halftime show, served as hopeful examples of celebrities meeting the moment, even though they both still exist within institutions that sustain the status quo. My wish is for these artists — and anyone with a platform — to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. Like Bad Bunny and Kehlani (who has been a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7508887896628219178"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro-Palestinian advocate</a> in her music as well as on social media), my hope for all public figures to use every avenue of their influence to try to shake the table and push back against powerful people who aim to snuff out dissension and stifle diversity.</p>



<p>“We’re too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of a statement in our country,” Kehlani <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suQNZoLVrdE"">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> on the red carpet at the Grammys. “I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists and speak out against what’s going on, and I’mma leave this and say “‘Fuck ICE,’” she echoed during her speech. </p>



<p>I started this piece by quoting Nina Simone and as cliche as it may be, I’m going to end it the same way. Because Simone was decades before her time. And every artist (including actresses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DURBiKkEoQZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kerry Washington</a>, <a href=""https://iop.harvard.edu/events/artist-public-life-sophia-bush-activism-artistry-and-courage-speak"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Bush</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacks-star-hannah-einbinder-criticized-ice-shouted-free-palestine-emmy-rcna231320"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Einbinder</a>) who dedicate their platforms to advocacy for those whose voices need to be heard, are doing so because of the path Simone, and others like her, paved. I think their legacy should be more than just memes. So, I’ll leave you with Nina Simone’s full quote: </p>



<p><em>“An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</em></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, a liminal checkpoint between what has already climaxed and what is about to be reborn. Last quarter moons are not about manifesting or initiating, they’re about editing. This one asks us to release what the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-full-snow-moon-in-leo-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo Full Moon</a> revealed is no longer sustainable, especially around power, control, emotional attachments, and unspoken resentments. You may encounter small speed bumps, emotional flare-ups, or moments of resistance. Instead of pushing through, pause and ask yourself: <em>What am I being asked to let go of so I don’t carry it into the eclipse?</em> Scorpio energy reminds us that release is rarely neat, but it is necessary.</p>



<p>Midweek, the emotional tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, a placement where Venus feels especially at home. Under this transit, compassion rises and defensiveness melts. With Mercury already in Pisces, conversations become more heart-centered, intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. This is a powerful week for forgiveness, creative expression, spiritual connection, and choosing love over fear, not in a bypassing way, but in a grounded, human one. As Pluto continues its work in Aquarius, reshaping collective systems and futures, Venus in Pisces reminds us that revolution without tenderness is unsustainable.</p>



<p>The emotional and spiritual weight of the week peaks on February 13th, when Saturn leaves Pisces and enters Aries, closing a chapter that began in March 2023. Cosmic beings, give yourselves credit. Saturn in Pisces asked for surrender, boundary repair, grief work, and deep spiritual accountability. Its exit may bring relief, but also unexpected emotion. This is the final full week of the Year of the Snake, and grief can surface alongside excitement.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries begins a brand-new 29-year cycle at the very start of the zodiac, but this is <em>not </em>a race. With Mercury approaching its retrograde shadow and eclipse season arriving next week, this remains an in-between time. The momentum is real, but so is the need for gentleness. Trust that the tides are turning. You’re allowed to move forward slowly, intentionally, and with love for both yourself and the collective you’re helping to shape.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, emotional debts, and energetic entanglements. For you, this is a clearing moment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary"">Something tied to money</a>, power dynamics, trust, or emotional obligation is ready to be released. You may realize you’ve been carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours, or holding on out of loyalty rather than alignment. The discomfort here is real, but so is the relief. This is about lightening your load before the eclipse ahead, not pushing through out of pride.</p>



<p>On February 10th, Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your spirituality, rest, and closure sector. This is a softer, quieter shift that asks you to slow your pace emotionally, even if your external life feels busy. You may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or open-hearted than usual. Old feelings, dreams, or memories can resurface, not to distract you, but to be integrated. This is a beautiful time for forgiveness, creative flow, and releasing what you no longer need to carry into your next chapter. You don’t have to fix everything this week. Some things resolve through compassion, not effort.</p>



<p>The major moment arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters your sign, beginning a brand-new 29-year cycle for Saturn and a defining chapter for you. Having Saturn in your sign is not always easy. It brings accountability, responsibility, and a mirror that asks you to take yourself seriously. You may feel more visible, more scrutinized, or more aware of the weight of your choices. But here’s the balance: Neptune is also in your sign, softening Saturn’s edges with vision, faith, and imagination. This combination asks you to build your dreams in real time. The spotlight is on you now, yes, but this is not about perfection. It’s about integrity. With great power comes great responsibility, and this week reminds you that you’re more than capable of rising to both.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, are you ready for a more social, emotionally open week than you’re used to? The energy shifts fast, starting with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, which activates your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. This is a release point around dynamics that feel intense, imbalanced, or emotionally draining. A pattern in a close relationship may become impossible to ignore, not to provoke drama, but to help <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">you reset boundaries</a>. The invitation is to let go of power struggles and choose honesty over control. What you release now creates space for healthier connections moving forward. Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your friendship, community, and technology sector. This is a beautiful shift for you.</p>



<p>Conversations feel warmer, connections more compassionate, and social interactions less transactional. You may feel drawn to collaborate, reconnect with friends, or show up more authentically online. Creativity flows more easily when you’re surrounded by people who genuinely support you. Just be mindful of over-giving… Pisces energy loves to merge, but your energy is still precious.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious sector. This begins a longer chapter of inner work, emotional accountability, and spiritual discipline. You may feel called to take your mental health, rest, or healing practices more seriously. While Saturn here can feel heavy at times, remember that Neptune is also in Aries, softening the experience by reminding you that healing doesn’t have to be harsh. This is about building trust with yourself, honoring your intuition, and releasing old fears gently rather than forcefully.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to clean up your schedule and your energy at the same time? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your work, routines, and well-being sector. This is a checkpoint moment where something about your daily life clearly isn’t working anymore. You may notice burnout creeping in, ineffciencies piling up, or commitments that drain more than they give. Instead of pushing harder, this moon asks you to subtract. Let go of habits, tasks, or expectations that don’t actually support your health or focus.</p>



<p>On February 10th, the vibe shifts as Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your career and public image sector. Suddenly, conversations at work feel softer, more emotionally intelligent, and less transactional. This is a great week to lead with empathy, creativity, and intuition rather than trying to logic your way through everything. You may feel more visible professionally or inspired to align your work with something meaningful. Just watch the tendency to overpromise. Pisces energy is generous, but clarity still matters.</p>



<p>The biggest internal shift comes on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This begins a period where you’re asked to take your dreams and social connections more seriously. Saturn here can feel like a reality check around who you’re building with and which visions are actually sustainable. Neptune’s presence in Aries softens the edges, reminding you that purpose and imagination can coexist. This is about committing to goals and communities that feel aligned, not just exciting.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, are you ready to get honest about what actually brings you joy versus what just looks good on the surface? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your creativity, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a release point around old patterns in romance, fun, or creative pursuits that no longer feel nourishing. You may realize that certain ways of seeking validation or distraction aren’t giving you the fulfillment you crave. Letting go here creates space for joy that feels more genuine and less performative.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy lifts as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your expansion, travel, and belief sector. This is a beautiful alignment for you, bringing emotional ease, inspiration, and a renewed sense of faith. You may feel called to learn something new, plan a trip, or reconnect with a spiritual practice that grounds you. Conversations feel more hopeful and heart-centered. This is a reminder that growth doesn’t have to be stressful. It can feel gentle and meaningful at the same time.</p>



<p>The most important shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your career and public life sector. This begins a longer chapter of professional accountability and leadership. You may feel more visible, more responsible, or more aware of expectations placed on you.

This is not about hardening yourself. It’s about building something meaningful without losing your heart.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, are you ready to soften without feeling like you’re giving up your power? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to home, emotional roots, and private foundations. This is a release moment around family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns that have been quietly influencing your decisions. You may feel called to let go of an old story about where you come from or what safety is supposed to look like. It’s not about cutting ties dramatically, it’s about loosening emotional grips that keep you from feeling fully free.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy deepens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging. Conversations may turn more vulnerable, and you might feel more open to trust, heal, or share parts of yourself you usually keep guarded. This is a powerful time for emotional honesty, but also for discernment. Compassion doesn’t mean overextending yourself. Let closeness feel mutual, not draining.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to growth, wisdom, and long-term vision.

This week reminds you that expanding your world requires both courage and care.</p>

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to stop explaining yourself and start trusting what you already know? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to communication, thought patterns, and daily exchanges. This is a release moment around how you speak to yourself and others. You may notice mental habits, assumptions, or conversations that feel draining or unnecessary. The invitation is to let go of overthinking and choose clarity over control. Not every thought deserves your attention.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a relational softening as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the zone of partnerships, collaboration, and one-on-one dynamics. This is a heart-opening influence that encourages empathy, compassion, and emotional presence in your closest connections. Conversations may feel more tender or vulnerable, and you may crave emotional attunement over logic. This is beautiful territory for healing, but remember to keep your boundaries intact. Connection doesn’t require self-erasure.</p>

<div id=""libra""></div>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready to get clear about what you truly value, not just what keeps the peace? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life connected to money, self-worth, and personal resources. This is a release point around financial habits, energetic exchanges, or beliefs about what you deserve. You may realize that something you’ve been tolerating out of comfort or fear is no longer aligned. Letting go here creates space for more intentional stability.</p>



<p>Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the part of your life tied to daily routines, work rhythms, and well-being. This is an invitation to bring more compassion into how you treat yourself day to day. You may feel drawn to slow down, care for your body, or approach work with more heart and less pressure. Productivity looks different under Pisces energy. It’s about flow, not force.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your relationship and partnership realm. This begins a longer chapter where commitments, boundaries, and mutual responsibility take center stage.

<div id=""scorpio""></div>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to release the version of yourself that’s been holding it all together a little <em>too </em>tightly? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in your sign, moving through the core of your identity, body, and emotional truth. This is a powerful shedding moment. You may feel more sensitive, introspective, or aware of patterns you’ve outgrown. Something about how you show up in the world is ready to change, not through force, but through honesty. Let go of the need to control the narrative. What’s real will remain.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life tied to creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a beautiful counterbalance to the intensity you’re feeling. Inspiration flows more easily, and emotional connections feel sweeter and less guarded. You may feel drawn to art, intimacy, or moments of joy that don’t require explanation. Let yourself enjoy this. Healing doesn’t always come from doing the work… sometimes it comes from remembering how to play.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of your life connected to work, health, and daily responsibilities. This begins a longer chapter of learning how to structure your life in a way that actually supports your energy. Saturn asks for discipline and accountability, while Neptune in Aries adds sensitivity and intuition. You’re learning how to work smarter, not harder, and how to honor your limits without guilt. This week reminds you that power doesn’t come from endurance alone, it comes from sustainability.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to slow down just enough to actually hear <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">what your intuition</a> has been trying to tell you? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life tied to rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. This is a behind-the-scenes release moment. You may feel more tired, reflective, or emotionally porous than usual, and that’s not a weakness. It’s information. Let go of habits, expectations, or internal pressure that keep you running on autopilot. This is a reset, not a setback.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a softer, more nurturing tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life connected to home, family, and emotional grounding. You may crave comfort, familiarity, or deeper emotional safety. Conversations with loved ones can feel more tender and healing, and you may feel inspired to make your space feel more like a sanctuary. Just be mindful of nostalgia pulling you backward instead of helping you integrate. Comfort is meant to restore you, not stall you.</p>



<p>The biggest shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This begins a longer chapter of taking what lights you up more seriously. Saturn asks you to commit to your passions, not just chase excitement. Neptune’s presence in Aries keeps the magic alive, reminding you that discipline doesn’t have to kill the fun. This week sets the tone for building a life that feels inspired <em>and </em>sustainable.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you noticing how your definition of success is quietly changing? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. This is a release moment around social dynamics or goals that no longer feel aligned with who you’re becoming. You may realize that certain group spaces, collaborations, or dreams need updating. Letting go here isn’t a failure, it’s refinement. You’re making room for more meaningful connections and intentions.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of communication, learning, and everyday exchanges. Conversations feel more heartfelt and less transactional, and you may find yourself speaking from intuition rather than strategy. This is a supportive time for writing, teaching, or reconnecting with people you haven’t spoken to in a while. Just be mindful of mixed signals. Clarity still matters, even when compassion leads.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn, your ruling planet, re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to home, family, and emotional foundations. After years of Saturn pushing you to grow through responsibility and public-facing pressure, this marks a turn inward. You may feel called to restructure your private life, redefine stability, or take emotional boundaries more seriously. With Neptune also in Aries, this process is softened by imagination and sensitivity. You’re learning that true authority comes from being grounded internally, not just accomplished externally.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to get honest about what kind of future you actually want to build, not just talk about? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating the part of your life connected to career, reputation, and long-term direction. This is a release moment around professional expectations, public roles, or ambitions that no longer reflect who you are becoming. You may feel tension between where you’ve been visible and where you actually want to invest your energy. Letting go here isn’t dramatic, it’s strategic. You’re clearing space before a major reset.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a shift in tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of money, values, and self-worth. This softens your relationship with security and abundance, encouraging you to lead with intuition rather than anxiety. You may feel more compassionate toward yourself around finances or more open to receiving support. Creative or spiritually aligned income ideas can surface now. Just stay mindful of boundaries. Generosity is beautiful, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of stability.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your communication, mindset, and learning zone. This begins a longer chapter of taking your ideas seriously and committing to your voice. Saturn asks for discipline and follow-through, while Neptune in Aries keeps imagination alive. You’re learning how to turn insight into impact. This week sets the tone for speaking with clarity, intention, and responsibility, knowing that what you say and how you say it carries more weight than before.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to honor how far you’ve come instead of focusing on how much more there is to do? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life tied to growth, faith, and perspective. This is a release moment around outdated beliefs, limiting narratives, or paths you once thought you <em>had </em>to follow. You may feel called to let go of a version of the future that no longer resonates. Trust that releasing an old vision makes room for something more aligned to take shape.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a beautiful homecoming as Venus enters your sign on February 10th, joining Mercury already there. This softens everything. You’re more magnetic, intuitive, and emotionally open, and others are more receptive to your presence. This is a time for connection, creativity, self-care, and gentle honesty. Just be mindful of over-giving or absorbing other people’s emotions. Compassion is your gift, but boundaries are your anchor.</p>



<p>The biggest energetic shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn leaves your sign and enters Aries, ending a demanding chapter that began in 2023. This week, you may feel both relief and reflection. Saturn in Aries activates your relationship with money, values, and self-worth, beginning a new phase of building stability from a more empowered place. With Neptune also in Aries, dreaming and doing begin to work together. This week reminds you that softness and strength are not opposites. You’re learning how to build a life that supports both.</p>

<p>The latest text in a group chat with a few of my beauty editor peers reads: “Can we stop pretending that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sacheu-stayn-lip-liner-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lip liner stains</a> are good?” I get it. While TikTok’s beauty enthusiasts would have you believe they’re the best thing since sliced bread — sculpting and staying put for hours on end — those videos are often edited and carefully curated. From drugstore launches to luxury versions, most lip liner stains I’ve tried apply patchy, suck the moisture out of my lips, and flake off by midday. Not even the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/huda-beauty-lip-contour-stain-controversy"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Huda Beauty Lip Contour Stain</a> could convert <em>this </em>naysayer. </p>



<p>But I’ll eat my words, because a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">new launch from Summer Fridays</a> — my favorite lip care brand — is changing everything I thought I knew about this notoriously finicky product. </p>



<h2>What is Summer Fridays’ Flushed Lip Stain, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Just this week, Summer Fridays unveiled its <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520759"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Flushed Lip Stain</a>, a long-wear pen that works as both a lip liner and an all-over stain. The range includes six shades, from Almond, a soft neutral brown, to Plum, a deep berry hue.  </p>



<p>What immediately sets this liner apart is the angled felt-tip nib, which makes sculpting and defining lips a breeze. Unlike other pens, it’s not scratchy — you can even create a full lip look by applying it all over, then topping with a swipe of gloss. </p>



<p>Besides the unique shape, Summer Fridays claims that the formula is transfer-proof, buildable, and non-drying. The latter caught my eye, especially because most pen liners are so drying, they make my lips feel tight and itchy. But this one doesn’t, thanks to a handful of smart skincare ingredients. </p>



<p>First, aloe vera gel, which I’m convinced gives the pen more slip, preventing it from snagging. Then there’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-b5-hyaluronic-acid-serum-combination"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">panthenol, a skincare ingredient</a> that dermatologists rate for boosting hydration and supporting the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin barrier</a>, essentially the outermost layer of skin that keeps good stuff in (like moisture) and bad stuff out (like bacteria). Since lip skin is thinner than elsewhere, these plumping, moisture-locking ingredients are especially welcome. </p>

<p>This is the sort of product that makes me want to earn a degree in cosmetic chemistry to understand why it works so well. Unlike others, it’s not immediately soaking wet, so it doesn’t run, drip, or require a futile clean-up operation. Instead, it’s so precise that it feels almost like using a pencil liner to trace my lip line. That said, there are a few seconds of blending time. Some lip stains dry instantly, but I use my finger or a fluffy brush to blur this slightly for a natural, lived-in effect rather than harsh lines. </p>



<p>For a seamless lip look, I recommend pairing the stain with a gloss or balm in a similar shade. My favorite combos <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940476%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">are Almond</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsummerfridays.com%2Fproducts%2Flip-butter-balm-hot-cocoa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm in Hot Cocoa</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-P520759%3FskuId%3D2940385%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap520759%3Aproduct"">Rosette</a> with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP515960%3FskuId%3D2874287"">Glow Recipe Glass Balm in Blackberry Bingsoo</a>. Adding a gloss or balm on top further blurs the lip line, making lips look naturally defined, not obviously drawn on. </p>



<p>I’m a big tea drinker, and the only thing that transfers onto the mug is the gloss. On me, this stain stays pretty much intact for around six hours before I even think about topping up, and I can still see the ghost of it at the end of the day. Happily, I never need to scrub to remove it; I use <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fskinactive-micellar-cleansing-water-all-in-1-cleanser-makeup-remover-xlsImpprod13531031%3Fsku%3D2298445"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water</a> on a cotton round and swipe gently. The micelles — tiny molecules that act as surfactants — dissolve and lift the product away effortlessly. </p>

<h2>What to know about Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain </h2>



<p>• Available in six shades to suit all skin tones: Almond, Plum, Mocha, Maple, Rosette, and Slipper. </p>



<p>• The transfer-proof formula is buildable, depending on how opaque you want it. </p>



<p>• Features a soft, tapered felt-tip nib for precise application. </p>

<h2>Is the Summer Fridays Flushed Lip Stain worth it? </h2>



<p>My makeup bag is a dumping ground for lip liner stains that have disappointed me, but these have their own special jar. On days when I know I won’t have time to keep my lipstick topped up, I apply this all over and finish with a balm, which gives a satin-like lipstick effect. </p>



<p>To really get the most out of a lip liner stain like this, prep is key. My lips are always the last step in my makeup routine, so before I even start, I apply a thick layer of moisturizer (or eye cream — trust me, it works!) to soften them. When it’s time to line, I use a tissue to blot away as much as I can, and that’s when I go in with the product — applying it to lips that are naked but moisturized. (I’m a firm believer that moisturized lips hold onto pigments far better than parched ones.) Lip balm or gloss can be a little too thick, and in this case, the pigment might not cling as well.  </p>



<p>Lastly, I’ve found that these stains dry out far less quickly than others, but I like to store them upside down, so the formula is always ready when I go to line my lips. </p>

Currently, I’m using Williams <a href=""https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/hold-everything-glass-containers-with-lids-14-piece-set/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sonoma’s Hold Everything Glass Food Storage Containers</a>, a 14-piece set with both rectangular and round containers that easily store full meals as well as core ingredients for salads, pastas, rice bowls, and more. As I work to minimize my use of plastic, I appreciate that they’re made of glass, feature silicone gaskets to keep them airtight, and are refrigerator-, freezer-, and dishwasher-safe. <br /><br /><strong>Williams Sonoma</strong> Hold Everything Glass Food Storage Containers, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.williams-sonoma.com%2Fproducts%2Fhold-everything-glass-containers-with-lids-14-piece-set%2F"">Williams Sonoma</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Sonoma </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""800"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957695.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1318&amp;height=800&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=659:400"" width=""1318"" /><figcaption>My main goal for 2026 is to save money, and that means I must significantly cut down on where my variable expenses have been going: eating out. That said, I’m doing everything I can to make cooking at home as seamless as possible. And as a single girl who lives alone, that means using cookware that’s less daunting, pots and pans that are perfect for smaller meals and have easier cleanup. Right now, I’m loving <a href=""https://fromourplace.com/products/mini-cookware-duo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Our Place’s Mini Cookware Duo</a>, which includes a mini Always Pan and mini Perfect Pot. This multifunctional, non-stick ceramic, and truly beautiful (mine is in the off-white color Steam) cookware has allowed me to make just the right amount of food for the week and easily reheat leftovers when I need to.  <br /><br /><strong>Our Place</strong> Mini Cookware Duo, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffromourplace.com%2Fproducts%2Fmini-cookware-duo"">Our Place</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Our Place </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1152"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957700.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1038&amp;height=1152&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=173:192"" width=""1038"" /><figcaption>Also saving me time in the kitchen is the <a href=""https://www.sharkninja.com/ninja-crispi-pro-6-in-1-countertop-glass-air-fryer-bone/AS101LG.html?dwvar_AS101LG_color=e7e6e1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ninja Crispi® Pro 6-in-1 Countertop Glass Air Fryer</a>. It roasts, reheats, crisps, and even bakes faster and easier than a stove or oven. With two containers, one sized at 2.5 quarts and another at 6 quarts, I can easily swap between them depending on whether I’m cooking for one or hosting family and friends. This model saves me even more time because it cooks and bakes in a glass bowl that comes with an airtight lid, making storage and reheating as simple as moving it in and out of the refrigerator. But my absolute favorite part is how easy the non-toxic glass is to clean. I can simply remove the bowl and wash it in the sink, no need to scrub to remove grease from trapped crevices or coatings. That also helps to keep the appliance looking polished on my countertop. <br /><br /><strong>Ninja</strong> Ninja Crispi® Pro 6-in-1 Air Fryer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fninja-crispi-pro-6-in-1-countertop-glass-air-fryer-bone%2FAS101LG.html%3Fdwvar_AS101LG_color%3De7e6e1"">Ninja</a><span class=""copyright"">Image Courtesy of Ninja </span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""5712"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957828.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=4284&amp;height=5712&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=3:4"" width=""4284"" /><figcaption><h3>Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer</h3></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""984"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957705.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1166&amp;height=984&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=583:492"" width=""1166"" /><figcaption>I’m fully in my cozy era, and this <a href=""https://www.target.com/p/faux-shearling-bed-rest-pillow-room-essentials/-/A-90789939?preselect=81781520&amp;clkid=7b5a2284N011d11f1886cd72cae7825f4&amp;cpng=PTID1&amp;TCID=AFL-7b5a2284N011d11f1886cd72cae7825f4&amp;afsrc=1&amp;lnm=81938&amp;afid=R29%2C%20LLC&amp;ref=tgt_adv_xasd0002#lnk=sametab"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">under-$20 Target boyfriend pillow</a> has absolutely leveled up my at-home nesting game.

<p>Ahead, learn more about the collection, how to use it, and why it deserves a spot in your self-care routine.</p>



<h3><strong>What is Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection and what are the benefits?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty is a sustainable, Los Angeles-based, Latina-owned beauty and skincare brand using natural ingredients to nourish the skin and support self-care rituals. Its Milk &amp; Rose collection makes up the brand’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fradiant-skin-trio&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"">Radiant Skin Trio.</a> It includes a luxurious <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fbody-scrub&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">body scrub </a>crafted from nourishing goat milk, hydrating coconut oil and shea butter, and calming roses that both exfoliates the skin and leaves it feeling moisturized and smooth. Next, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fmagnesium-salt-soak&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak</a>, which uses Epsom salts, pink himalayan salts, goat milk powder, flower oils, and rose petals to relax your body while also moisturizing your skin so you leave your bath feeling hydrated rather than dried out. And lastly, there’s the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fspicebeautyco.com%2Fproducts%2Fhair-and-body-mist&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fspice-beauty-milk-rose-collection-bath-skin-care"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hair &amp; Body Mist</a>, which uses rose extract, chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, and Pro Vitamin B5 to hydrate and revitalize your hair and body and leave you smelling as luxurious as the bath you just walked out of.</p>



<h3><strong>What makes Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection special? </strong></h3>





<p>The Milk &amp; Rose Collection blends soothing botanicals, skin-loving milks, and hydrating natural extracts. Many of the products share the same ingredients, like goat milk to hydrate the skin and rose extract, rich in antioxidants, to soothe and brighten the skin. Other ingredients work together to support the skin barrier and promote lasting moisture. For instance, gentle exfoliants like brown sugar and lactic acid smooth away dry skin so nourishing oils, shea butter, and vitamin E can absorb more deeply, while Pro-Vitamin B5 and calming botanicals help soften the skin, lock in hydration, and relax the senses.</p>



<h3><strong>How to use Spice Beauty’s Milk &amp; Rose Collection?</strong></h3>





<p>Spice Beauty recommends starting with a body scrub to gently exfoliate dead skin cells, rejuvenate dull areas, and support skin repair. When you’re done, draw a warm bath, sprinkle in about ¼ cup of the Milk &amp; Rose Magnesium Salt Soak, and immerse yourself in the milky water and delicate rose petals for about 15 minutes. I like to enhance the experience with a soft candle, light music, and maybe even a good read. When you’re out of the bath, your skin will feel hydrated (and look radiant!), but you’re not done yet. To complete the pampering ritual, spritz some of the Hair &amp; Body Mist all over to smell as softly floral and refreshed as you feel.</p>



<h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>





<p>My favorite part of this collection is the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. While the floral petals can be a little annoying to clean up after a shower, I still try to use it once a week. It’s honestly the best scrub I’ve used at this price point because it doesn’t just remove dead skin, it also helps restore moisture and leaves my skin feeling velvety smooth when I step out of the shower. I save the full routine for special occasions, and by special occasions I mean whenever I feel like I need some extra pampering. It really is a treat for all of my senses. At $77, it’s a pretty powerful trio. But if you’re only going to choose one product, I’d absolutely recommend the Milk &amp; Rose Body Scrub. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>The rumors are true: Fashion is transporting us back to 2016. For proof, look no further than the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">nostalgic shoe trends</a> making a comeback. After seasons and seasons of minimalism and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pierced-fashion-trend-tory-burch-shoes"">quiet luxury</a>, consumers are returning to a more expressive way of clothing themselves in 2026, and they’re starting from the feet up. <br /><br />“There’s a real appetite right now for dressing with more emotion and intention, and less interest in things that feel disposable,” says <a href=""https://www.miista.com/en-US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miista</a> CEO and founder Laura Villasenin. “It’s all about balance: Soft but strong, familiar yet a little unsettling, traditional but rebellious. That contrast feels very honest — it’s how people want to show up now. You can be refined and strange all at once.”<br /><br />There are a slew of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vibram-five-finger-ugly-shoe-trend"">shoe trends</a> making waves in the new year. From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/03/11330463/floral-fashion-3d-flowers-trend"">3D flowers</a> at <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/christian-dior/slideshow/collection#11"">Dior</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/proenza-schouler/slideshow/detail#53"">Proenza Schouler</a> that look like they were picked by hand, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">gothic details</a> fueled by brands like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/detail#3"">Alexander McQueen</a>, as well as inspiration derived from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">this year’s color trends</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11933378/margot-robbie-red-carpet-looks"">Margot Robbie</a>’s stellar <em>Wuthering Heights</em> press run, this season’s footwear is all about using your wardrobe to convey who you are to the world.<br /><br />“For a lot of people heading into 2026, that kind of dressing feels empowering — choosing pieces with character, story, and a point of view, rather than just following what’s next,” Villasenin says. However, don’t just take our word for it. Keep reading for a list of subversive shoe trends that will make your outfits feel very now indeed.</p>

<h2>Goth Glamour</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958011.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Between the promotion campaign for Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> movie and a very specific shade of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">dark plum noir</a> trending upward, 2026 is all about dark romance. This includes goth-inspired footwear with buckles, grommets, studs, and witchy lace-up vamps. Margot Robbie recently donned a pair of edgy rosary sandals from the new <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen/slideshow/detail#3"">Alexander McQueen</a> collection during her expectedly epic press run, while <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/studio_constance/"">Studio Constance</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/copenhagen-fall-2026/skall-studio/slideshow/collection#3"">Skall Studio</a> embraced the edge with deconstructed ballet flats and lattice detailing during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2026"">Copenhagen Fashion Week</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miista/p/DTN7rJXjBvV/"">Miista</a> showed a lineup of striking silhouettes for spring 2026 that certainly fit the bill — and come with New York City first lady Rama Duwaji’s seal of approval. <br /><br />“Our designs often sit outside traditional ideas of ‘prettiness,’ favoring strong, sculptural shapes and an outsider energy that resonates with people who see fashion as a form of self-expression rather than a way of fitting in,” says Villasenin. And while Miista shoes may be polarizing, she adds that is precisely the point: “The ‘ugly’ or ‘weird’ label is not just about provocation for its own sake but more about doing things differently –– challenging fashion’s business-as-usual practices and creating pieces with care, intention, and longevity.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>A Cut That Fits Like a Glove<strong> </strong></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958015.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Glove pumps were initially popular during the 1980s, and earned an aughts-era revival thanks to the hipster set. Designers have since adapted that nostalgic V-cut silhouette to complement flats and strappy sandals, too. Brands of all sizes, including heritage fashion houses like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balenciaga/slideshow/detail#20"">Balenciaga</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/chanel/slideshow/collection#28"">Chanel</a>, are embracing a high vamp for 2026 to accentuate the shape of the wearer’s foot. Cool-girl labels like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/moschino/slideshow/detail#31"">Moschino</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/khaite/slideshow/collection#28"">Khaite</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/attico/slideshow/collection#47"">The Attico</a> took a bolder approach with playful animal prints and exaggerated features. The key to successfully pulling these shoes off IRL is wearing them with leg-baring hemlines like skirts and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">dresses</a>, allowing your footwear to really shine through. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Flat Sock Boots</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958001.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2025"">boxing boot trend</a> set the stage for a  more prim and polished throwback in 2026. Enter the sock boot. Perhaps you remember the 2016 version of this boot, and how the structureless silhouette looks great with pretty much anything. Opting for a leather or suede pair à la <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/courreges/slideshow/detail#2"">Courreges</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/christophe-lemaire/slideshow/collection#38"">Lemaire</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/ann-demeulemeester/slideshow/collection#17"">Ann Demeulemeester</a> will earn you plenty of sartorial mileage. Those looking for something playful should opt for a floppy moccasin style like the sock boots from the <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/louis-vuitton/slideshow/detail?share=app#1"">Louis Vuitton</a> runway. Either way, layer these kicks under dresses or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">wide-leg pants</a> for well-balanced proportions.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Updated PVC</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958018.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you needed confirmation that 2026 is the new 2016, the resurgence of PVC footwear really seals the deal. It feels like just yesterday that see-through heels and boots were everywhere. They’re now back thanks to the likes of <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/pre-fall-2026/chloe/slideshow/collection#22"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chloé</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/detail#10"">Maison Margiela</a> — the latter of whom updated their signature Tabi shoes with a nearly invisible outline. Take styling cues from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/detail#21"">Loewe</a> by layering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">colorful hosiery</a> underneath your PVC shoes for a dynamic look that you can customize again and again. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Sculptural Wedges</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958006.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Stilettos not your thing? Try sculptural <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-sneakers-trends"">wedges</a> as an equally glamorous alternative. This season, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/isabel-marant/slideshow/detail#78"">Isabel Marant</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/lanvin/slideshow/detail#86"">Lanvin</a> seamlessly blended practicality and style with discreet and manageable heel heights. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/detail#65"">Balmain</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection"">DSquared2</a>’s interpretations offer stark contrasts, with phantom heels and thigh-high shafts that are a lot more wearable than you may think. Subtle yet artful details bring a necessary update to an otherwise retro silhouette. Leverage your next pair of wedges to give <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-pants"">longline trousers</a> and floor-sweeping dresses an instant lift. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Soft Sneakers</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958004.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Gone are the days of chunky, dad sneakers dominating the market. Their replacement is both <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">sleek and malleable</a> for the seasons ahead. Soft sneakers are having a huge moment, both on and off of the runway, with designers like <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/dries-van-noten/slideshow/detail#76"">Dries Van Noten</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/prada/slideshow/detail#50"">Prada</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/jacquemus/slideshow/detail#75"">Jacquemus</a> leveraging stripes and satin to create a derby-like effect. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/miu-miu/slideshow/detail#155"">Miu Miu</a> has your next vacation covered with a canvas and jute style that will take you from beach to street with ease. Looking for a mid-range option? Alo’s retro-inspired Sunset sneaker has become a fan favorite among influencers and editors alike. The best part about these shoes is their versatility; wear them with everything from tailored trousers and flared leggings to an off-duty dress.</p>

<p>Slip-on shoes are timeless, but when designed with a prominent toe shape that protrudes from underneath pants and long dresses, they can feel a lot more of the moment. Statement mules from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/victoria-beckham/slideshow/collection"">Victoria Beckham</a> and<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection#47""> Acne Studio</a>’s respective collections from spring 2026 are prime examples of 2010s nostalgia with a modern twist.  </p>
