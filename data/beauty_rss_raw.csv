<p>Sags, it’s your season! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscope-16-november-22-2025-meaning-effects"">From November 21st to December 21st</a>, the heat will be on in our homes and personal lives as we escape from the coolness outside and engage in the cozy vibes inside instead. There is so much to complete from our monthly agendas, and such little time to do it — so we’ll feel the rush to finish up the loose ends in our lives before moving forward into winter.</p>



<p>Sarah Potter, author of<a href=""https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/sarah-potter/sober-magic/9781668652381/""> <em>Sober Magic: Using the Tarot and Ritual in Your Journey Away from Drinking</em></a>, says that “Sagittarius season is where curiosity becomes a compass and desire becomes direction. This is the moment to listen to what lights you up and let it guide you. Let your passion be purposeful. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Sag energy asks you</a> to trust your own vision, widen your world, and choose the path that feels like exciting possibilities. Let it remind you that joy is a spiritual practice and expansion begins with radical honesty.”</p>



<p>Potter suggests the following activities to evoke the essence of Sagittarius: “Say yes to a new experience. This is the time to finally take that workshop, trip, class, ritual, or anything that opens your world. A walk with a fast song, dancing in your living room, stretching like you’re taking up more space. Let it feel good to move! Take one little action toward something that excites you. Don’t overthink it, begin! Tell one truth you’ve been avoiding. Do this with kindness and compassion. Maybe it’s to yourself first. Then, speak aloud if needed. Study something that inspires you; philosophy, magic, mythology, travel guides, anything that awakens a sense of wonder.” </p>



<p>The last month of fall is bringing a lot of clarity to our lives — so grab one more pumpkin spice latte for the road and get reflective. With three out of five of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">the planetary retrogrades</a> coming to a halt, we are going to be able to make decisions and see beyond the veil. Mercury, Saturn, and Neptune are turning direct in the month ahead, offering a new and clear perspective on situations and relationships. We will decide whether to dedicate more of our time to others or focus our energy on ourselves. Take note: Committing to a plan of action will require time and patience.</p>



<p>There may be confusing and ambiguous parts to Sagittarius season, especially with Neptune’s entanglement with the sun. We will have to look within ourselves and move towards what makes us happy, even if it is something as simple as collecting leaves or enjoying a slice of apple pie. The point is that we are making strides to understand our sentiments and strive for fulfillment on a spiritual, intellectual, and emotional level. Our visions are awakening after months of being dormant; the path we choose may take a moment to figure out, but we are taking a step closer to making our dreams a reality — there is nothing more exciting and meaningful than that! </p>



<h3>Key Dates in Sagittarius Season:</h3>



<p><strong>November 21st:</strong> The sun enters Sagittarius, making us more optimistic and willing to learn than before.</p>



<p><strong>November 27th:</strong> Saturn turns direct in Pisces, suggesting we set boundaries with others.</p>



<p><strong>November 29th:</strong> Mercury ends the planetary moonwalk in Scorpio that began November 9th in Sagittarius, clearing up matters from the past weeks.</p>

<p><strong>December 4th:</strong> The Super Full Moon in Gemini highlights our ability to communicate effectively. </p>



<p><strong>December 10th:</strong> Neptune retrograde in Pisces completes its cycle, allowing us to revisit our dreams from former months and years.</p>



<p><strong>December 11th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, reigniting the events of early November for a third time. </p>



<p><strong>December 15th:</strong> Mars swings into Capricorn, giving us power and strength in all that we do.</p>



<p><strong>December 19th:</strong> The New Moon in Sagittarius heightens our intuition and emotions. </p>



<p><strong>December 21st:</strong> Sun enters Capricorn and Winter Solstice occurs, initiating a new season when earthier elements come to life.</p>

<p>What would <a href=""https://www.bravotv.com/bravocon"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">BravoCon 2025 </a>be without the one and only <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFzhbkkcQO/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Madix</a>? It’s impossible not to acknowledge how far the <em><a href=""https://people.com/lisa-vanderpump-teases-naughtier-revamped-vanderpump-rules-11848101"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vanderpump Rules</a></em> breakout star has come. We’ve watched her navigate life under a microscope season after season, to now being the It Girl brands are dying to work with. Her latest collab is with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDtPojgQg1/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TRESemmé</a>.<br /><br />As we chatted with Madix at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKm0NYEZLy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TRESemmé’s salon activation</a>, her warm smile and cheery attitude reminded me of everything she’s endured with grace. This triple threat talent has had her share of ups and downs living her most vulnerable moments for the world to see. From highs like taking the entrepreneurial route with the <a href=""https://sahsandwiches.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Something About Her sandwich shop </a>along bestie/co-owner, Katie Malone, to lows like <a href=""https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/vanderpump-rules-ariana-opens-up-on-emotional-exhaustion"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grieving for loved ones who’ve passed on</a>, Madix has remained steadfast in being a better version of herself while maintaining the same humility we’ve loved about her since her first season of <em>VPR</em>.</p>



<p>When you look up the word “manifestation” in the dictionary, Madix’s face could be front and center. She’s been a first-hand example of how easily the words we speak can materialize into reality. An argument about batteries landed her a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@duracell/video/7242044073933131054?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Duracell commercial</a>. Long time appreciation for Broadway musicals graced her with the role of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0hn2ripy6C/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Roxie Hart in </a><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0hn2ripy6C/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chicago</a></em>. Offhand remarks about being a <em>Love Island</em> fan turned into her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3BCiFEzWvc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hosting USA’s seasons 6, 8, and </a><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3BCiFEzWvc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island Games</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3BCiFEzWvc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> 2025</a> (she’s confirmed to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11917158/love-island-usa-season-7-review-season-8-changes"">return for next year</a>). Making history as the first Bravo talent to host a reunion is another box that Madix has casually checked off. </p>



<p>But we can’t talk <em>Love Island</em> without acknowledging what’s on every viewers’ mind each episode: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ariana-madix-love-island-usa-fashion-season-7"">Ari’s glam</a>. We continue to thank producers for those <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKf-pZysei2/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">slow-mo entrances</a> because every look has been chef’s kiss. However, looks aren’t the only reason Madix has been quenching our thirst lately. Her genuine love for <em>Love Island</em> is also why we love her. She shares a selfless, refreshing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DNW2FUgPVZK/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bond with her </a><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DNW2FUgPVZK/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LI</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DNW2FUgPVZK/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> cast</a> in the villa that continues after the show. Madix has been the contestant’s ultimate champion, never afraid to show support and voice her opinions on post-villa activities.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943820.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure></div>



<p>Here we talked about navigating friendship and business, what TRESemmé products defy Fiji humidity, how she’s getting through her grieving process, and which Broadway show she’d love to take on next. </p>



<p><strong>Refinery 29: I think the first question everyone needs to know is how the heck [hair stylist]  <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlbembridgehair"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carl (Bembridge)</a> has been able to defeat Fiji’s weather from messing up your hair?!</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ariana Madix:</strong> “Let me tell you, Carl is a magician, first of all. But I’ve been using <a href=""https://www.tresemme.com/us/en/end-look/lamellar-gloss.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TRESemmé’s Lamellar Gloss</a> products. They have amazing hold of 72 hours. So 72 hours of BravoCon and 72 hours of staying out there in Fiji humidity.”</p>



<p><strong>With 20 years in the industry, it seems like you’re sort of the fairy godmother to a lot of the <em>Love Island </em>girls post villa. What advice did you give them to help adjust to their newfound fame?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“I think, honestly, the best advice I could give them is to just lean on each other because it’s such a unique experience that they went through together that no one else can understand. If you’re able to find a great friend in that villa, hold on to them and lean on them. Your friends outside of <em>Love Island</em> as well.”</p>



<p><strong>You witnessed Jana and Kenny’s love story from the very beginning, and witnessed the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/07/11923428/jana-craig-love-island-kenny-rodriguez-breakup"">breakup</a> from a personal angle. How would you describe how Jana’s grown over the years?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“Oh my gosh. Jana is one of the most kind, beautiful people I know. Resilient. Stunning. I mean, the way her smile radiates, I feel like it radiates from within. It’s not just beauty on the outside. It’s beauty within.”</p>



<p><strong>A lot of people say you should never mix business with friendship, but Something About Her is a success and your and Katie’s friendship has been very comforting to watch. How have you both managed to maintain that healthy balance? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“Well, we share the same vision for the shop. Both of us are so open and willing to each other’s ideas, as well. If we have an idea the mantra is a little bit of “Let’s try it and see what happens.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> The best advice I could give [<em>Love Island</em> contestants] is to just lean on each other because it’s such a unique experience that they went through together that no one else can understand.</p><cite>ariana madix</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I think she’s a great business person and a great friend. But, honestly, I think a little bit of it is the Capricorn-Cancer vibe.”</p>



<p><strong>Aw! I’m a Capricorn!</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“Oh my God! I’m a Cancer! There’s definitely something to that.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943821.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>You popped your hosting cherry being the first Bravo talent to host reunions, so if Andy ever gave you the chance to host an episode of <em>Watch Watch Happens Live!</em>, who would be your two dream guests?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong><em>[Laughs]</em> “I would want to have on Beyonce and of course, I think that Beyonce is a guest that deserves the one chair! But if I were going to have on a Bravolebrity with her, aside from Katie obviously, maybe Paige DeSorbo would be fun!”</p>



<p><strong>You pretty much manifested your Duracell commercial, so what Broadway show are you manifesting to be your next?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“Oh my gosh! Maybe <em>Mamma Mia!</em>.</p>



<p>That was the first show I saw on Broadway so I have a very big place in my heart for it.”</p>



<p><strong>Congrats on your <a href=""https://www.out.com/out100/2025/disruptors/ariana-madix"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Out100 honor</a>! You spoke about grief with the loss of your loved ones, Ali, Grandma Bonnie, and Charlotte. Are there any words of advice you can give someone who’s facing the same challenges?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AM: </strong>“For me, what’s helped is looking or little signs of them —  of their love, like little reminders. In the beginning, reminders can be really hard, but as time goes on, I feel like the reminders make you smile. You remember those things more fondly, and you start to look for them. That’s something that’s really helped me.”</p>

When it comes to gifting, the best fashion presents are the ones that get real use — not just admired in the closet. And while the classic “new coat for winter” is always a safe bet, pairing it with the perfect bag? That’s where things get personal (and <em>a lot</em> more exciting).<br /><br />This season, <a href=""http://dkny.com"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DKNY</a> makes it easy to match every personality on your list with its lineup of trendy outerwear and handbags. Think a tailored wool coat and structured tote for the minimalist who lives by a neutral palette, a belted plaid jacket and bold chain bag for the friend with an It-girl sensibility, or a snuggly sherpa and slouchy shoulder bag for the cozy queen whose entire personality revolves around soft, plush pieces. <br /><br />Whether you’re shopping for a ‘90s die-hard, a downtown-cool type, or someone who simply loves a good outerwear moment, consider this your shortcut to gifting something that’ll actually get worn (and photographed) all season long.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943132.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Minimalist<br /></h2><br />Clean, classic, and all about quiet luxury — this pairing could’ve stepped right out of a ’90s style moodboard. The tailored gray wool coat brings timeless structure, while the chunky chain bag adds that touch of city sleek. Perfect for the friend whose wardrobe is mostly black, beige, or any perfected neutral.<br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Single Breasted Wool Coat, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fdl3mwm95clgy%3F_pos%3D1%26_sid%3D255455930%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a><br /><br /><strong>DKNY</strong> Riona Flap Crossbody, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dkny.com%2Fproducts%2Fr54edo11c01s%3F_pos%3D2%26_sid%3D7fa88bb9f%26_ss%3Dr%3Futm_source%3DRefinery29%26utm_medium%3DDisplay%26utm_campaign%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Display_Refinery29%26utm_content%3DAssembly_UpperFunnel_Views_HO25_Refinery29_Display"">DKNY</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943133.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>For The Cozy Queen<br /></h2><br />She’s the one who owns at least eight loungewear sets and believes coffee runs count as an outing.

<p>Every year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-clothes-accessories-2025"">winter fashion</a> is defined by a handful of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">specific prints</a>. Lighthearted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-gingham"">gingham gives way</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-midi-dresses"">complex plaid</a>, with its crisscross of graphic lines and harmonious colours, while playful florals are replaced by more serious herringbone and houndstooth. This winter, however, one print is taking over everything. Enter: argyle — and it’s coming for your manicure, too.</p>



<h2>What are argyle sweater nails?</h2>



<p>With overlapping diamonds and clever use of negative space, argyle occupies a cozy space between harlequin and plaid. Inspired by the tartan of Scotland’s Clan Campbell, it’s a classic winter knit, but this season it’s bigger than ever, popping up everywhere from Zara to Sandro. It was only a matter of time before manicurists drew from the pattern. Head to Instagram, and you’ll see that the biggest nail art trend this winter is, in fact, argyle. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/chummy.nails/?hl=en"">Oksana Zavora</a>, a Milan-based creative nail artist, is one professional who has been inundated with likes and comments since fashioning <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRFHfNbDK5h/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this set</a> for content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sarahbrezel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Stasi</a>. “Trendy nail designs are definitely influenced by fashion trends,” she tells Refinery29, “so this one already felt like an obvious success from the start.”</p>



<p>Zavora adds, “No matter the season, my color palette often naturally leans toward browns and those cozy ‘fall’ shades, so when my client came in with screenshots of argyle sweaters, I instantly knew it would turn into something amazing.”</p>

<h2>How do you create the argyle sweater nail trend?</h2>



<p>Unless you consider yourself a dab hand with a nail art brush, this one is best left to the professionals. “When you create designs completely from scratch, the most important part is trusting the process,” says Zavora. In other words, you just have to let your nail tech wing it. Oh, and gel polish — cured after each step — is your best bet to keep the colours crisp and long-lasting. </p>



<p>The graphic lines are probably the trickiest detail to perfect. To create the black and white stripes on her clients’ nails, Zavora says she first drew a dark line across the nail, then hand-painted the white stitches on top to mimic the fuzzy texture of a sweater. </p>

<p>On her recent argyle manicure, Zavora says, “I’m super nerdy about details, and I’m always focused on perfecting the final result, so this set was definitely a fun challenge! A lot of lines, layering of colors and shapes, some patience, and voilà — argyle nails.”</p>



<p>If Instagram is anything to go by, the argyle nail trend is set to blow up this winter. Here’s all the inspiration you’ll need for your next salon visit.</p>

<p>This indigo argyle pattern, complete with golden threads, looks so good on a nude base with a classic almond-shaped nail. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">From haircuts</a> to skincare, I change my mind as often as the wind — but one thing that’s stayed constant in my beauty routine over the past few years is my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nails-gel-acrylic-manicure-burning-pain"">biweekly manicure</a>, where I always opt for builder in a bottle gel (aka BIAB).</p>



<p>As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">former nail-biter,</a> I never imagined I could have <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/short-nail-beds-beauty-standards"">elegant nail beds</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latina-girlhood-acrylic-nail-art"">long nails</a> worthy of compliments, but BIAB, specifically <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/biabtm-shop-all"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The GelBottle’s builder gel</a>, has made it entirely possible. And while BIAB is far more durable than other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">gel polishes</a>, it doesn’t make me immune to the occasional <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">chip, bend, or break </a>once my nails grow past a certain point — especially since I insist on using them as tools. How else is a lazy girl supposed to open her packages?</p>



<p>It’s as if the nail gods heard my dilemma, though, because this month The GelBottle unveiled <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/hard-biabtm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hard BIAB</a>, its strongest builder gel formula yet. I was among the first beauty journalists to try it, and here’s why I’m recommending it to everyone I meet.</p>

<h3>What is Hard BIAB and what are the benefits?</h3>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daisykalnina/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Daisy Kalnina</a>, founder of The GelBottle Inc., says Hard BIAB boasts the same easy application and self-leveling formula (for a professional-looking, smooth, and even finish), but is designed to be much more rigid and durable. “It’s a hybrid gel that combines the strength of a traditional hard gel with the simplicity of BIAB,” adds Kalnina, “so if you want serious length, whether that’s growing out your natural nails or doing sculpted extensions, this is what you need.”</p>



<h3>What’s the difference between BIAB and Hard BIAB?</h3>



<p>While regular BIAB is stronger than your standard gel polish, it still allows short- to medium-length nails some flexibility. Hard BIAB does exactly what it says on the tin; it’s tougher and more solid, perfect if you want to grow your nails long but find they just keep breaking. “It’s for clients with a really hands-on lifestyle or anyone who wants to push their nail length further than they’ve been able to before,” says Kalnina.</p>



<p>The application process is exactly the same. I went to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lunaandwilde/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Luna and Wilde</a> in London, where pro nail artist Georgia applied a bond base straight to my natural nails, followed by a thin slip layer of the shade Bonnie before curing. To create an apex for strength and shape, she then applied another bead of Bonnie, building structure while forming the perfect curve. We both remarked on how good my nails looked afterward!</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943177.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Happily, Hard BIAB is available in twelve shades to suit all skin tones, including tried-and-true favorites like Dolly (a demi-sheer baby pink), Teddy (a rose taupe), and Bonnie (a strawberry milkshake pink), which is what I chose.</p>



<p>Just like regular BIAB, Hard BIAB can be filled. One key difference is the removal process: while regular BIAB can be soaked off in ten minutes, Hard BIAB must be filed off, either with a rough emery board or an e-file, thanks to its more durable structure. If you ask me, it’s more like a hard gel, which also requires filing. When I went to have mine removed at my local salon, they tried soaking it off with acetone, to no avail. You’d just be wasting your time. Kalnina recommends booking a fresh set every three to four appointments to keep an eye on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-greenies-pseudomonas-infection-biab-gel"">health of your natural nails</a> underneath.</p>

<h3>Is Hard BIAB better than traditional BIAB?</h3>



<p>I usually get my nails filled every two weeks to prevent BIAB from lifting or my nails from growing so long that they chip or split at the sides. With Hard BIAB, though, I stretched it out to three and a half weeks. Honestly, I’ve never had longer or stronger nails. Even when they softened in the shower, I didn’t have to worry about bending them backward — a truly cringe-worthy feeling. I could also swear that, applied in layers, this new formula caused fewer — if any—heat spikes, where your nails feel uncomfortably hot under the UV lamp.</p>



<p>To be doubly sure, I went back to regular BIAB to compare, and my nails feel a little more pliable in comparison. Don’t get me wrong — they’re still strong, but nothing beats the comfort blanket of Hard BIAB. I’m sold and have already DM’d my salon to call in the entire range of Hard BIAB shades to keep me in nails.</p>



<h3>Where can I get Hard BIAB and how much does it cost?</h3>



<p>If your current nail salon already offers The GelBottle’s BIAB range, just give them a nudge to upgrade to the Hard versions. One-shade BIAB manicures on natural nails typically start at $40 to $60, though prices vary from salon to salon.</p>

<p>With Turkey Day just around the corner, I’ve been busy saving the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-2025-nail-manicure-trends"">cutest fall nail designs</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"">trending textures</a> that will lend themselves perfectly to the occasion. Whether it’s a colorblock manicure in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/guava-nails-manicure-trend"">shades of the season</a> or a more intricate design to honor the holiday itself, these 13 ideas are festive without feeling cheesy. </p>



<p>And most importantly, whether you’re dressing up in your finest or chilling in your sweatpants, there’s a nail design to vibe with whatever Thanksgiving you’re having this year. </p>

<p>Thanksgiving is officially the start of the holiday season and, for me, that means any excuse for a little shimmer. This cat-eye manicure created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/beautybyelee/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eleanor Szejner</a> is packed with perfect fall tones, from deep copper and burnished brown to pumpkin orange and rose gold. </p>

<p>Get ready to rock ‘n’ roll! The second <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-moon-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon of fall</a> occurs on November 19 Pacific time and November 20 Eastern time. The Scorpio New Moon is a rollercoaster of raw emotions and intensity. Prepare for the drama by meditating and cleaning our auras to ensure we aren’t negging 24/7. <br /><br />Hate to break it to you, but the New Moon in Scorpio is not going to be a walk in the park. It is a sensitive time that is asking us to mend our spirit through acts of self-acceptance. This lunation aspects seven planets, five of which are moonwalking in the sky — wowza! They are: the Sun, Moon, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde in Scorpio</a>, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn retrograde in Pisces</a>, Uranus retrograde in Taurus, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde in Pisces</a>. Before we freak out from the cosmos, let’s put this all together so we can understand what to expect. </p>



<p>Obviously, all these planets moonwalking in water signs will push us to be in our feelings and longing for the past. We may decide to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-back-together-relationship-ex-partner"">connect with exes </a>and old school friends to take a stroll down memory lane. Looking backward is ideal, if we are trying to heal. However, we must proceed with caution and care. Although our hearts will yearn for the chance to rekindle these relationships, we must protect ourselves to ensure we don’t get hurt again. There is a tenderness lingering in the air that requires gentleness. If people can’t give us that sentiment, we must focus on harnessing that emotion for ourselves. </p>



<p>Of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus’s retrograde</a> has a challenging vibe because it opposes the Sun, Moon, and Mercury retrograde. The Sun’s alignment to Mercury retrograde creates “cazimi,” bringing truths to light. We are going to be shaken to the core by a big reveal. It’s important to note that the clandestine information we receive could be about politics or pop culture — it doesn’t necessarily guarantee we’re the hot topic. Pay attention to the news cycle that begins under this new moon because it will make headlines in the next several weeks. Personally, the need for security might force us to look inward and meditate on what makes us happy. As the saying goes, “out with the old and in with the new.” The same applies to securing our financial bag — implement a budget, focus on necessities, and set limits. </p>



<p>Later, Uranus and Neptune retrograde dance, make a little love, and get down to our desires (when they formally link up). Significant shifts bring us closer to our innermost visions, helping us tune into our goals. Being that both of these planets are retrograde, we may want to reassess former aspirations that were left on the back burner to find our way. Revisit the hopes and objectives from years ago to firmly plant our feet in the ground and make plans (which will be subject to revision because of the retrogrades). Journaling the steps could be a great asset to ensure we remain on task. </p>



<p>The day before the New Moon, on November 19, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> harmonizes with the Nodes of Destiny, allowing us to comprehend the romantic and financial possibilities that lie ahead. As a result, we are deciding who and what we are thinking about committing to. It may be confusing and frustrating, but it gives us a sense of where we are heading. <br /><br />It would be remiss not to mention that the asteroid Lilith and Black Moon Lilith are in orbit with the degrees of the New Moon, adding fierceness to the events that will unfold. We are unleashing our darker and edgier sentiments, unapologetically letting our shadow selves be seen. We are tired of being swept to the sidelines and ignored. The upside of anger is that it can motivate us to take action that sparks change. So, be mad if you want to. Just use it to dismantle outdated institutions, practices, belief systems, and theories — not to cause irreparable harm to those we care about and ourselves. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Scorpio is going to be a wild ride. Be kind to yourself and others to swim through the deep and turbulent waters. Going with the flow could sweep us up in a sea of ambiguity, so keep one foot on the ground as an anchor. Remember, emotions and relationships are complex. Don’t hold yourself to a standard or mindset because everything is in a state of evolution.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, welcome to the grand finale of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>… and it’s not going out quietly. This week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio</a> on the 18th, joining Venus and the Sun in this emotionally raw, fiercely transformative water sign. With so many planets swimming through the shadows, don’t be surprised if your inner world feels louder than usual. Conversations may rewind to long-forgotten truths, secrets might slip, and connections — especially romantic or financial — could deepen or dissolve. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> craves intimacy with a capital “I,” and Mercury’s return here suggests the Universe is giving us one last chance to revisit what was left unsaid. <br /><br />Meanwhile, from November 17 to 19, the Moon disappears from the sky. This is the dark moon phase: the quiet, liminal space before a new beginning. It’s a cosmic cocoon that invites stillness, surrender, and deep emotional excavation. Old insecurities, shadow selves, and fears may surface during this time, not to punish you, but to be witnessed, embraced, and alchemized. If you find yourself overthinking, oversleeping, or even crying unexpectedly this week, you’re not broken… you’re unraveling. This is the fertile soil where your next version takes root. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, offering us a powerful collective reset. This lunation is your chance to transmute pain into power. Scorpio teaches us that endings make space for beginnings, and this new moon is a portal to rise from the ashes.

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to intensity, Aries, but this week’s Scorpio cauldron is bubbling <em>extra hot</em>. With the Sun, Venus, and (starting the 18th) Mercury all activating your sector of emotional bonds, vulnerability, and energetic entanglements, you may feel like you’re walking around with a lie detector strapped to your chest. Under this Scorpionic haze, secrets get whispered through dreams, eye contact, or accidental texts. Venus is dialing up your sensual magnetism, but she’s also pulling you into deeper questions: who do you trust with your body, your story, your money, your fears? Mercury retrograde here isn’t subtle either… it’s a cosmic exorcism, and you’re being asked to <em>feel</em> your way through instead of force clarity. </p>



<p>Then comes the real underworld reset: the Scorpio New Moon on November 20. This one hits different because it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">ruled by </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/boss-zodiac-sign-personality-meaning""> planetary boss Mars</a>, currently adventuring through Sagittarius and pumping you with courage, faith, and a hunger for reinvention. Between November 20 to 30, set intentions around transforming your relationship to intimacy, power, and truth. You’re not meant to stay bonded to people or patterns that drain your magic. Let yourself grieve, release, and then get free. This is your phoenix moment. Yes, it may sting. But you’ve outgrown your old ashes, babe, and Mars is guiding you to rise with humor, passion, and just the right amount of chaos. Trust that. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week’s Scorpio energy has you in a <em>deep soul gaze</em> with your connections, Taurus, and I mean <em>deep deep</em>, like “what are we really doing here?” levels. With the Sun, Venus (your cosmic ruler), and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> all highlighting your relationship sector, things are feeling both intense and deliciously mysterious. One minute you’re like, “I could marry them,” and the next, you’re spiral-texting your bestie like, “wait… do they even like me?” This week is asking you to look beneath the surface of your partnerships, your agreements, and even your patterns. Venus wants harmony, yes, but in Scorpio? She wants <em>honesty</em>. If it’s fake peace, she’ll burn it down. </p>



<p>And then there’s that epic Scorpio New Moon on November 20, activating your rebirth in love. Whether it’s a relationship with someone else or with yourself (or honestly, both), this is your chance to wipe the emotional slate clean and choose deeper alignment. Mars in Sag is pushing you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/living-for-the-plot-dating-adventure-travel"">stop playing it safe</a> — especially when it comes to how much you <em>really</em> share, how open you let yourself be, and how fearless you are in choosing passion over obligation. Set intentions this week that are rooted in <em>truth</em>, not fantasy. Trust that real love, whether romantic, platonic, or spiritual, can handle the heat. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This final week of Scorpio season is turning your daily life into a bit of a pressure cooker, Gemini, but like, in a “this is forcing me to grow” kind of way. With the Sun, Venus, and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) all spotlighting your sector of routine, health, and systems, you may feel hyper-aware of what’s draining you vs. what’s sustaining you. Little things you’ve been brushing aside (like that lingering cough, that glitchy calendar, or that coworker you secretly loathe) could suddenly feel like cosmic emergencies. This isn’t a punishment… it’s your chance to clean house. Venus wants you to fall back in love with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/self-care-ideas-rituals"">your rituals</a>, while retro Mercury is like, “btw, here’s the mess under the rug.” Own it. Rework it. You’re not behind — you’re in a period of profound refinement. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon hits on November 20, you’re being invited to completely reimagine how you tend to your mind, body, and spirit. What does it <em>actually</em> mean to feel balanced, energized, and emotionally clean? This lunation’s giving detox, but like, the soulful kind. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> (your opposite sign) is stirring up momentum through partnerships — whether romantic or professional — so accountability is key. Set intentions to create supportive rhythms, clear communication channels, and sacred boundaries. You don’t have to do everything alone, but you do need to do what’s <em>aligned</em>. Trust your gut — it’s louder than your mind this week. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, the final week of Scorpio season is activating your pleasure sector with the intensity of a dramatic love letter, and yes, you’re both the writer <em>and</em> the muse. With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury all huddled together in your realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression, it’s giving sexy rebirth. That project you abandoned? The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">situationship</a> you thought was over? The artistic impulse that felt too indulgent? All of that’s back for review, but not for chaos… for refinement. Your inner child is knocking and your inner lover is whispering. Be true to your heart’s desires. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is a call to rise from the ashes of your old joy habits. What used to excite you but no longer fits? What desires feel dangerous but divine? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars</a> (the ruler of the new moon) currently in Sagittarius, fueling your sector of wellness and devotion, the next six months are about sustaining your pleasure, not just chasing it. Set intentions that let joy be your compass <em>and</em> your strategy. You don’t need to apologize for craving beauty, sensuality, or spotlight. You just need to trust the parts of you that want to shine. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is lighting a match in your roots sector and asking, “You sure you want to keep hiding that?” With the Sun, Venus, and now retrograde Mercury digging into your inner world, you may find yourself unpacking long-held secrets, family patterns, or private memories that still hold weight. This isn’t about spiraling… it’s about seeing things clearly. Venus wants softness, retro Mercury brings the receipts, and the Scorpio Sun is like, “Let’s transmute this into art, therapy, or both.” You’re being asked to feel what you’d rather skip. Let the deeper emotions come up, and let them move through you. Healing isn’t always loud — but it is potent. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, you’re being handed a blank page for rewriting your roots. What do safety and home <em>actually</em> look like to you now — not just what you were taught? The next six months are about defining that for yourself and planting seeds that honor your emotional truth. With your ruler the Sun still in Scorpio for a final week and Mars in Sag blazing through your play zone, don’t be afraid to fight for joy, even in the shadows. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> around reclaiming softness, embracing vulnerability, and building a sanctuary that reflects <em>your</em> soul. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re not imagining it, Virgo: conversations feel heavier, glances more loaded, and even silence carries meaning. That’s the final week of Scorpio season activating your sector of communication and perception, and with Venus and retrograde Mercury (your ruler) joining the Sun there, you’re being called to read between the lines <em>and</em> speak from the depths. You’re rewriting mental scripts that have kept you small or overly cautious. The way you talk to yourself? Under review. The way you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-communicate-argument-relationship"">let others speak to you</a>? Getting a major upgrade. This week isn’t about rushing to respond; it’s about finally <em>hearing</em> what your soul’s been trying to say. </p>



<p>When the Scorpio New Moon arrives on November 20, the pages of your inner journal feel charged with spells. What truths do you want to claim out loud? What ideas are begging for form? With Mars in Sag heating up your foundations sector, this isn’t about pretty words, but rather about anchoring them. You’re planting seeds in your voice, your mindset, and the way you connect to those closest to you. Speak like the future you is listening. Because they are. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Money, worth, and what you refuse to beg for are the themes this final week of Scorpio season is dredging up, Libra. And with retrograde Mercury and your ruler Venus both in Scorpio, activating your value sector, it’s time to examine not just your finances, but the deeper beliefs <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">fueling your sense of “enoughness.”</a> You’re being asked to shift from “What can I get?” to “What do I <em>deserve</em>?” This isn’t a week to undersell, overgive, or people-please your way into crumbs. Your magic is currency and your time is gold, so let that reframe how you ask, spend, save, and receive. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to reset your relationship with wealth and self-esteem alike. What new habits, rates, or rituals would help you feel more rooted in abundance? What old stories around scarcity are ready to be composted? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sag</a> now energizing your expression and visibility sector, the Universe wants you seen, compensated, and celebrated — but you have to claim it. Set intentions that treat your worth as non-negotiable. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve been walking through fire with grace, Scorpio, and this week the ashes start to shimmer. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> is reaching its final chapter, and you’re no longer the version of you who whispered affirmations hoping they’d stick. You’re the one who <em>knows</em>. Who’s been watching yourself alchemize in real time. Who’s bled, cried, purged, stayed silent, screamed out loud — and still showed up. And now, the Universe wants to know: Are you ready to live like you survived it? Are you ready for your thriving era? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograding into your sign starting the 18th may stir the ghosts one last time, bringing up old lovers, doubts, “almosts” and “should haves.” But remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is here too, wrapping you in beauty, magnetism, and truth. You don’t have to armor up to feel worthy, and you don’t have to be ultra mysterious to be respected. You are worthy <em>now</em>, in your clarity, in your softness, in your voice that’s trembling but still choosing to speak. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 is your personal renaissance. It’s a cosmic mirror asking: Who do you dare to become if you stop hiding from your own power? If you drop the need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/11/8894550/why-dont-people-like-me"">control how others receive you</a>, and just embody your essence fully, audaciously, and unapologetically? This is Phoenix energy — pure rebirth. Shed the last of what you’ve outgrown. Grieve it, kiss it, release it, and then rise into your next timeline with a body that remembers, a spirit that’s wiser, and a gaze that sees beyond illusions. This is the week it all changes for the better, Scorpio. The week you’ve been ready for. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this final stretch of Scorpio season feels like a spiritual prelude… like the air right before a thunderstorm, thick with omens and revelations. With Mercury and Venus both moving through your sector of healing and closure, you’re being guided to listen to what you haven’t said out loud yet: the unspoken dreams, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/biggest-fears-zodiac-sign-8th-12th-house"">fears that still whisper</a> when you’re alone, the patterns you’ve outgrown but keep rehearsing. And while you usually prefer momentum over introspection, your ruling planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter is retrograde in Cancer</a> right now, pulling you into the emotional depths you’ve been skimming. This is less about solving everything, and more about sitting with what’s real. Let yourself grieve a version of you that’s ready to be laid to rest, because Sag season begins this weekend, and you deserve to greet it from a lighter perspective. </p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on November 20 invites you to set soul-deep intentions around trust, closure, and surrender. With Jupiter retrograde harmonizing with this moon in your intuitive sector, your dreams may feel unusually prophetic — pay attention. From now through November 30, ask yourself what quiet, restorative rituals you can commit to, not to get ahead, but to <em>come home</em> to yourself. This lunation isn’t about forcing breakthroughs — it’s about creating space for them. Think journaling, prayer, unposting, or even just letting yourself nap without guilt. The rebirth this moon brings may be invisible at first, but it’s happening beneath the surface. Trust that. The next chapter begins with a whisper, not a bang… and if you listen closely, you’ll hear your future calling your name. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Scorpio season’s final act could feel like the deep exhale you didn’t know you were holding. With the Sun, Mercury (starting the 18th), and Venus all swirling through your sector of social influence, tech, and legacy, you’re being asked to rethink how you show up in collective spaces, not just as a figure of power, but as a vulnerable human being with dreams, quirks, and stories that need to be told. <br /><br />Mercury’s retrograde in Scorpio may unearth old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"">group dynamics</a>, unprocessed feelings about friendships, or questions about the future you thought you were building. Don’t run from these insights. If certain people or platforms no longer feel aligned, you’re allowed to walk away. Venus softens the burn, helping you reconnect with kindred spirits who actually <em>get you</em>, especially as you re-evaluate your digital presence. The algorithm may be mysterious, but your intuition is clearer than ever — trust it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Scorpio New Moon on the 20th offers a chance to rebirth your relationship with community, visibility, and your greater mission. What if the people you’re meant to lead or serve can only find you when you finally let go of playing small or being too “perfect”? Set intentions this week around the impact you want to leave behind, not just the results you want to achieve. With your ruler Saturn still retrograde in Pisces for another two weeks, activating your communication sector, this is also a prime time to assess the way you speak to yourself and others. The universe is preparing to hand you a mic in December, but right now, it’s checking your soul script. Edit it with care. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, it’s giving phoenix season, and this time, you’re the one shedding layers of “<em>shoulds</em>” and “<em>not yet</em>” to embrace what your soul has <em>actually</em> been craving. With the Sun, Mercury (as of the 18th), and Venus all lighting up your career, visibility, and reputation sector, you’re entering a renewal portal that’s far less about performance and far more about <em>power</em>. Mercury retrograde in Scorpio might stir up past professional doubts, old bosses, former ambitions, or a version of you who once thought “success” looked a certain way. Let it all resurface without shame. This isn’t about rehashing old storylines… it’s about reclaiming the pen and writing your next era from a deeper, wiser place. </p>



<p>By the time the Scorpio New Moon lands on the 20th, you may feel a rush of divine clarity: <em>it’s time to stop playing it safe</em>. Let this lunation help you visualize what a bold, soul-aligned legacy could feel like — not just professionally, but energetically. What do you want to be known for? Whose lives do you want to change? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus (your modern ruler) still retrograde in Taurus</a>, activating your roots and home sector, you’re being reminded that real success starts with safety, grounding, and emotional truth. The applause may come later, but the alignment starts now. Say yes to your deeper mission. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s something ancient waking up inside of you, Pisces… and no, it’s not just Mercury retrograde nostalgia. With Scorpio season’s final week activating your adventure, travel, publishing, and philosophy sector, and Mercury swimming backward into that same realm on the 18th, you’re being asked to revisit long-lost dreams, studies, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/141240/spiritual-but-not-religious-meaning"">spiritual beliefs</a> that shaped the person you are today. Venus is there too, helping you fall back in love with the parts of your worldview you once doubted. Whether it’s a literal journey or an emotional pilgrimage, this week whispers: <em>What if your next breakthrough comes from remembering, not rushing? </em></p>



<p>The Scorpio New Moon on the 20th is your official cue to set intentions around expansion, publishing, higher learning, and sacred study. Whether you want to write your first book, travel to your ancestral lands, or simply explore a new spiritual truth, this lunation is a reminder that you don’t need to know how — it’s enough to <em>believe</em> you can. With your traditional ruler <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter retrograde in Cancer</a>, still reviewing your creativity and joy sector, you’re learning how to feel your way into abundance instead of forcing it. Stay soft, but intentional. Stay mystical, but grounded. This week is proof that your dreams are still very much alive, and they’re waiting for you to say yes. </p>
