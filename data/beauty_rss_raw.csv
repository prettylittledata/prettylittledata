<p>Melissa Butler, founder of <a href=""https://www.target.com/b/the-lip-bar/-/N-hw51c"">The Lip Bar</a>, knows what it’s like to experience failure — and on a <em>very</em> public level, too. When her inclusive beauty brand was three years old, she went on a national reality TV show to pitch The Lip Bar to a panel of investors…only to be told that her business would never grow. “They were so mean to us, they were so cruel. They said, ‘One of the big guys would crush you like the colorful cockroaches you are,’” she says in the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, recounting that devastating moment. “A lot of people have praised me for continuing: What gave you the courage to keep going forward? And I tell them: ‘I didn’t start my business for them, so I wasn’t going to end it for them.’”</p>



<p>Now, a decade later, The Lip Bar, is hugely successful, with its line of shades that complement *and* celebrate dark-skinned women available on the shelves at <a href=""http://target.com"">Target </a>nationwide. But Butler credits her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) education for preparing her for the realities of entrepreneurship, for helping her develop the fortitude to keep going and to strive for excellence, and for equipping her with the tools to ultimately succeed.</p>



<p>As a graduate of Florida A&amp;M University, Butler says that the competitive spirit at her school inspired her to push herself. “HBCUs remind you that there are no handouts, that you will have to work twice as hard,” she says. “Everyone knows that HBCUs are fun, for sure, but HBCUs have a unique ability to prepare students for the real world, and that’s the beauty of an HBCU — there’s that perfect balance.”  </p>



<p>And that’s precisely the subject discussed at length in the most recent episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, done in partnership with Target. Butler is joined by Kathleen Newman-Bremang, the senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29 (who went to a Predominantly White Institution); Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered (who attended a PWI that was really an unofficial HBCU), and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered (who’s a proud HBCU alumna). </p>



<p>Listen to the podcast in its entirety to learn more about Butler’s story (and how she learned more from her time as a student at her alma mater than on Wall Street), the unique cultural experience that is Homecoming at an HBCU, and so much more. </p>

<p>I count down to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11741501/bridgerton-michaela-stirling-francesca-queer-backlash"">new season of <em>Bridgerton</em></a> like football fans count down to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11853433/super-bowl-lix-parties-recap-new-orleans-2025"">Super Bowl</a>. They are 108 and 118 days away, respectively. The official release date for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11860364/bridgerton-season-4-netflix-black-characters""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4</a> was just announced so now we know that on January 29, 2026 — with part two dropping in February —  we’ll get to see the romance play out between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Benedict (Luke Thomspon)</a> and his new love interest <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Sophie Baek (Yerin Ha)</a>. We’ve already watched <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10243310/bridgerton-netflix-sex-scenes-daphne-actress-interview"">Benedict’s older sister Daphne</a> burn for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10244470/bridgerton-review-blackness-representation"">Simon the Duke of Hastings</a>, his big brother <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10926918/bridgerton-season-2-review-sex-chemistry"">Anthony find love</a> with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGCj2XlHVGI"">bane of his existence</a> and object of all his desires Kate Sharma, and his little bro <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96vIHgSgwU"">Colin take a memorable carriage ride</a> and trip down the aisle with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview"">Penelope aka Lady Whistledown</a>. Throughout those seasons, Benedict was the aloof middle brother, too busy drinking too much and partaking in gender-indiscriminate dalliances to want to settle down. That’s all going to change in January, starting with a masquerade ball and a chance meeting. </p>



<p>Fans of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bridgerton-season-3-penelope-weight-loss-showrunner-interview""><em>Bridgerton</em> books</a> have been waiting patiently for Benedict and Sophie’s story since theirs is considered one of the strongest of Julia Quinn’s storylines. And even if you aren’t a <em>Bridgerton</em> book truther, Benedict has consistently been one of the most intriguing characters on the show. He hasn’t found much romantic luck so far, but he also hasn’t wanted to. He’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2024/05/11718497/bridgerton-queer-storylines-future-showrunner-interview"">a queer king</a> who’s been prioritizing freedom over commitment. What will make Sophie the person that changes his mind? And how will <em>Bridgerton </em>incorporate Sophie and her family — the first major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/11/11813897/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">East Asian characters</a> — into its cinematic universe? </p>



<p>Below, here’s everything you need to know about <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4, including the plot, release date, teaser trailer, and what the cast and crew have said about the upcoming season. </p>



<h2><strong>How did <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 3 end? </strong></h2>



<p>At the end of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982332/bridgerton-season-3""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 3</a>, Colin (Luke Newton) and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan) have worked through the issue of Penelope being the town gossip who repeatedly sullied the good Bridgerton name with her pen — as a fellow petty bitch, I am a Penelope apologist — and Colin refusing to see his best friend as the baddie she is, and are finally happily married with a baby boy. After ditching Lord Debling and getting well acquainted with the woman in the mirror, Penelope reveals herself as Lady Whistledown and realizes the value in the writing empire she has built. In Julia Quinn’s <em>Romancing Mister Bridgerton</em>, this reveal also marks the end of Lady Whistledown’s column. While the future of Whistledown is unclear in the show, the Queen and Penelope seem to come to an understanding.“If [the Queen] affords me the chance to continue, I aim to wield my quill more responsibly,” Penelope says in the final episode of Season 3. “What is life without a little gossip?” the Queen responds and it’s safe to assume that Penelope Bridgerton will be allowed to keep writing. </p>

<p>As for the other budding romances, at the end of Season 3 <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11738825/bridgerton-season-3-lady-danbury-storyline"">Lady Danbury</a> gives her blessing for Lady Violet Bridgerton and her brother Lord Marcus Anderson to stop staring at each other longingly and actually start dating –  her reasoning being that she owes Violet for that time she had sex with her dad (a plot point from prequel series<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/queen-charlotte-a-bridgerton-story-review-race""> <em>Queen Charlotte</em></a> that I’m still trying to forget). Francesca and her new husband Sir John Kilmartin are headed to his estate in Scotland with Eloise and his cousin, Michaela Stirling (a character gender swapped from the books). My faves Anthony and Kate are headed to India to have their baby because <s>Jonathan Bailey and Simon Ashley are booked and busy</s> Anthony sweetly says he wants his children to know that part of their heritage. The Mondrichs, the only Black couple in the BCU, have mostly adjusted to their newfound wealth and status and — thank god — are as happily married as ever.</p>

<p>Season 3 ends with Benedict breaking up with Lady Tilley Arnold after a threesome with her friend Paul Suarez. Lady Tilley catches feelings for Benedict (if there’s one thing we know about the Bridgertons, they got that good D) but he’s just finally figuring out his sexuality and exploring himself so he opts to stay single and enjoy his freedom. </p>



<h2><strong>What is the plot of <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>Here’s what we know from the season’s official logline: “The fourth season of <em>Bridgerton</em> turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” In a teaser clip released from the season, we learn that the mysterious Lady in Silver is<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4""> Sophie Baek</a> (<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Yerin Ha</a>) and when they meet at Lady Bridgerton’s famed masquerade ball, Benedict is immediately down bad. In this Cinderella story, Benedict (with the reluctant help of his sister Eloise), sets out to find his masked lady. The twist: Sophie is actually a maid working for the lady of the house,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview""> Araminta Gun (Katie Leung). </a></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938185.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. (L to R) Isabella Wei as Posy Li, Katie Leung as Lady Araminta Gao, Michelle Mao as Rosamund Li in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s what else we know about the Season 4 plot, <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-4-cast-release-date-news"">thanks to Netflix</a>. Sophie Baek is “a resourceful maid for a demanding employer, disguises herself to attend Violet Bridgerton’s masquerade ball, where her life changes drastically after meeting Benedict Bridgerton.” As for Benedict: “While managing Bridgerton House’s affairs during Anthony’s honeymoon, Benedict, eager for new adventures, becomes the focus of Bridgerton’s fourth season, remaining reluctant to settle down unlike his married brothers, until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother’s masquerade ball.” </p>



<h2><strong>Which Bridgerton sibling is leading Season 4?</strong></h2>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton</em> series diverged from the order of the books last season when they opted to focus on Colin and Penelope instead of Benedict. Now, it’s Benedict’s time. It’s exciting not just because Thompson has proven he is a wonderful actor and I’m betting the best leading man we’ve had since Anthony (Coughlan carried Newton last season) but also because it’s the first time we’re getting a queer lead character in a <em>Bridgerton</em> season.</p>



<p>“We had talked a lot in Season 1 and 2 about whether or not Benedict might be queer. But we felt like we didn’t want to just tell that story as a side story,” Showrunner <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-3-ending"">Jess Brownell says to Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “We wanted to give it a little bit more space, and we wanted to get to know the character and develop him first.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful… To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering.</p><cite>yerin ha to tudum on changing sophie’s last name </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Benedict has been developed and I think he is the most fully formed and fleshed out character we’ve had as a lead so far. As the seasons progress, that’s natural, but it’s also clearly an intentional choice from the creative team. While we don’t know yet who will be the lead in Season 5 (it’s a toss up between Eloise and Francesca), we do know that every single Bridgerton sibling will get their moment to shine. </p>



<p>“Everybody’s going to have a main arc every season,” executive producer Shonda Rhimes <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a41734448/inside-bridgerton-book-shonda-rhimes-betsy-beers-interview/"">tells Town &amp; Country</a>. “There’s going to be one for each one of the Bridgertons. We laid out the story in a way that felt right and necessary for us. And, eventually, every last one of those Bridgertons is going to have a love story.”</p>



<h2><strong>What has the cast said about <em>Bridgerton</em></strong><strong> Season 4? </strong></h2>



<p>One of the most exciting parts of this season will be the introduction of Baek and her family, the first East Asian family in <em>Bridgerton</em> history. And because of Yerin Ha’s casting, they changed the character’s last name from the books. “A name is the first bit of identity that you share with the world, and that’s why changing a name can be so powerful,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Netflix’s Tudum</a>. “To make Sophie’s name fit someone who looks like me is really empowering. All credit to Jess Brownell, our showrunner… It’s a really nice way for me to feel like the role is fit for me, rather than me having to fit a certain mold. It’s amazing what it can do just in a psychological sense. So it means a lot that Jess did that for me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938186.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton. Yerin Ha as Sophie Beckett in episode 401 of Bridgerton. Cr. Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ha is a Korean-Australian actor who starred in <em>Halo</em> for two seasons and will be seen in the upcoming prequel series <em>Dune: Prophecy. </em>Playing Ha’s employer Lady Araminta Gun and the “evil stepmother” equivalent in the Cinderella archetype is Katie Leung, but Leung swears her character is just misunderstood. “I would never call her evil because I adore her — I think she’s absolutely fabulous. She’s just heavily misunderstood,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11807404/katie-leung-harry-potter-bridgerton-interview"">Leung says to Refinery29</a>. “But if there’s anything that I can say, I mean, the costumes. They’re always brilliant on that show, but hers are something else.” </p>



<p>Along with the costumes, we can’t wait to see the dynamic between Lady Araminta Gun and Sophie play out. What we know so far is that Sophie is going to have some challenges, and her working for Lady Gun will be one of them. “What drew me to Sophie was that she immediately has obstacles — something that she constantly has to overcome,” <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/yerin-ha-sophie-bridgerton-season-4"">Ha tells Tudum</a>. “Whether it’s this battle around social status or trying to hide her feelings from Benedict.”</p>



<p>Speaking of Benedict, here’s what <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi9enqPOmUY"">Thompson says about the new season</a> to Shondaland: “The main thing we can expect is that it’s a really nice mix of fairytale and reality. It’s a fairytale love story but it’s also got the Bridgerton element of trying to tether it to some sort of reality as well. We’ll see how that pans out.” Ha adds: “You can expect this an emotional tug of war, this push-and-pull between what their heart desires and what society desires for them.” </p>



<p>And yes, you can expect all your favorite Bridgertons to be back. Colin and Penelope will be deep in their happily ever after, according to what Luke Newton <a href=""https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a60803762/bridgerton-season-4-penelope-colin-romance-nicola-coughlan-luke-newton-interview/"">says to Town &amp; Country</a>: “I’m excited for the happily ever after and to see what that brings… I have so much trust in Jess [Brownell, the showrunner] that it will always be interesting and always be exciting. That’s also the joy of being in the Bridgeton family: There’s always going to be drama. There’s always going to be something I get to help out with or causing mischief or whatever it is.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938188.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Bridgerton.

<p>And on Good Morning America in August 2024, Jonathan Bailey confirmed he’ll be back as Anthony for Season 4. “Being the elder brother, I’m going to be there to support the youngsters.” And Anthony’s better half, Kate, will also be back. Simone Ashley told <a href=""https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/simone-ashley-interview-2024-glamour-women-of-the-year-awards"">Glamour</a> in October 2024 that she will be making an appearance in Season 4: “I know that I am returning, but that’s all I can say. I absolutely adore the show, and the more I can be a part of it, the better. They’ve been really kind to work around my schedule.”</p>



<h2><strong>When will <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 be released? </strong></h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1423699/bridgerton-season-4-release-date-teaser-trailer""><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4</a> will be arriving in two parts in 2026. The first half premieres on January 29 and the second half arrives on February 26. </p>

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong><em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32159989/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a></em> is a perfect Oscar-bait film. Filled with hefty dialogue, emotional scenes and topical questions, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/challengers-zendaya-josh-oconnor-mike-faist-interview"">Luca Guadagnino</a> draws out incredible performances from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/my-best-friends-wedding-julia-roberts-25-year-anniversary"">Julia Roberts</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/07/11919489/the-bear-sydney-ayo-edebiri-emmy-nominations-comedy"">Ayo Edebiri</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/men-hair-transplants-restoration"">Andrew Garfield</a>. The drama follows Yale University professor Alma Imhoff (Roberts), who is caught in the middle when her student protégée, Maggie Resnick (Edebiri) accuses Alma’s friend and colleague, Hank Gibson (Garfield) of sexual assault. For over <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">two and a half hours, <em>After The Hunt</em> is unrelenting, making audiences feel increasingly uncomfortable with its </span>blurred lines and unanswered questions. There’s no comic relief or light moments to take you away from the tough topics, which makes<em> </em>Guadagnino’s piece stick with you long after the credits have finished rolling.</p>



<p>Roberts and Garfield’s characters have a will-they, won’t-they style relationship throughout the film, with Hank making it clear that he adores Alma. While Alma is married to Frederik Imhoff (Michael Stuhlbarg), the pair eventually break into a round of passionate kissing near the end of the film. It’s raw and hard to watch, with Alma changing her mind halfway through and having to yell at Hank to stop and push him off her. </p>



<p>When <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> spoke to Roberts about <em>After The Hunt</em>, she surprised us by revealing the actors had decided not to use an Intimacy Coordinator for this scene. There was no nudity involved, which may have contributed to the decision. “They asked us if we wanted [an Intimacy Coordinator], I said no, Andrew said no,” Roberts explains. “Andrew and Luca and I had a lot of conversations, we had a lot of rehearsal that morning, and then Andrew and I, when we were back at the dorms where we get ready, he came to me and was like, you know, ‘Is there anything you are not comfortable with?’ And I said, ‘Between the two of us, I am completely at ease’.”</p>



<p>Guadagnino is famous for preferring fewer takes when it comes to making films, so Roberts and Garfield only shot one take of the scene. “All this conversation, and then it was like 35 seconds and then over. It was crazy,” Roberts adds.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>[Andrew] came to me and was like, you know, ‘Is there anything you are not comfortable with?’ And I said, ‘Between the two of us, I am completely at ease’.</p><cite>Julia Roberts on her Intimate Scene with Andrew Garfield</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The role of an Intimacy Coordinator was popularised in 2018, after the #MeToo movement took hold, and it focuses on keeping actors, directors and sometimes crew safer when it comes to intimate scenes. “An Intimacy Coordinator position interrupts the production power dynamics and provides a confidential space for actors, directors and producers to discuss concerns and potential barriers to consent,” Michela Carattini, SAG-AFTRA-accredited IC Trainer and Company Director of <a href=""https://www.keyintimatescenes.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Key Intimate Scenes</a> tells <em>R29</em>. “An intimacy coordinator provides risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies to support the actors, the director, the production, and in some cases, the crew. ‘Intimate scenes’ can vary in definition, but universally include scenes with simulated sexual activity (including sexual assault) and/or nudity.”</p>



<p>Carattini notes that in Australia, while it’s recommended to use an Intimacy Coordinator when there are intimate scenes, it’s not currently mandated. However, due to Screen Safe Australia adopting Australia’s National Intimacy Guidelines into Work, Health and Safety mandates, productions are left open to “negligence or duty of care claims” if anything goes wrong. </p>



<p>In terms of Garfield and Roberts’ decision to forgo using an Intimacy Coordinator on <em>After The Hunt</em>, Carattini says this can be “perfectly valid” depending on the circumstance. “The decision not to use an intimacy coordinator has to be made by the production, the director and all the actors involved in the intimate scene together, in terms of whether they are all willing to take steps to minimise risks. It is comparable to a decision not to use a stunt coordinator for a scene involving stunts,” she explains. “It is important to remember that the purpose of an Intimacy Coordinator’s work is to support consent, empowerment and safety. If those things have truly been supported for everyone involved, it is perfectly valid not to use an Intimacy Coordinator — although I grant it would be much harder for those without expertise to assess this accurately.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> It is important to remember that the purpose of an Intimacy Coordinator’s work is to support consent, empowerment and safety. If those things have truly been supported for everyone involved, it is perfectly valid not to use an Intimacy Coordinator.</p><cite> Michela CarattinI, SAG-AFTRA-accredited IC Trainer</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Some viewers may also wonder why you would consider an Intimacy Coordinator for a kissing scene without nudity or simulated sex, but Carattini says the question should always be asked. “Whether or not to use an Intimacy Coordinator for a kissing scene only is an open question, and very much depends on the director’s vision and the individuals involved. Each actor brings their individual history and lived experience, possibly including trauma, to their roles and with their bodies,” she tells us. “For some, kissing is less psychologically safe than simulated sex, and from a physical safety perspective, bodily fluids are being exchanged — which they are not for simulated sex without mouth to mouth kissing.”</p>



<p>On a film which broaches the heavy topic of sexual assault, it’s important that <em>After The Hunt</em> producers offered Roberts and Garfield the chance to work with an Intimacy Coordinator should they require it. The more normalised the position becomes, the more protected those who feel vulnerable or unable to speak up will be.</p>

It’s finally time for Target’s annual designer collaboration, and this one stands out from its most recent slate, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-kate-spade-collaboration-shop"">Kate Spade</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-diane-von-furstenberg-collaboration-lookbook"">DVF</a>. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has partnered with the nearly 200-year-old <a href=""https://www.woolrich.com/us/en/"">outdoor lifestyle brand Woolrich</a> on an ultra-cozy, adventure-ready, and dare we say: lumberjack-chic collection. <br /><br />Beyond buffalo-check womenswear and menswear — which Woolrich popularized — you can fully embrace your adventurous side out on the trails or in your humble abode with a range of Target-exclusive accessories, homeware, outdoor gear, and food and drinks. Think: <a href=""http://goto.target.com/55rXmn"">landscape-printed fleece zip-ups</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/GKWAoE"">sheep-covered pillows</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5GX"">binoculars</a>, and new <a href=""http://goto.target.com/2aDGXD"">maple syrup Kodiak pancake mix</a>.  So while Woolrich’s high-quality and durable apparel may typically cost you a pretty penny, this Target collaboration makes the heritage brand’s designs (and expanded categories) more accessible to a broader audience — with most price points falling under $40.<br /><br />“Woolrich x Target is all about fashion meeting function to help consumers embrace the outdoors in style,"" said Jill Sando, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, apparel &amp; accessories, home and hardlines of Target in a press release. ""From the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/e1zOBg"">Quilted Sheep Tote Bag</a> to the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/mOMDrD"">Buffalo Check Outdoor Wearable Throw</a>, to the amazing<a href=""http://goto.target.com/jebM2a""> inflatable kayak</a>, and so much more, I love how Target and Woolrich have worked together to create something that's fun and affordable.""<br /><br />The classic utilitarian aesthetics and functional features get a playful Target spin à la vibrant colorways, playful sheep graphics, printed reversible styles, and even a campaign shot in New York to show how Woolrich’s designs can translate into “modern urban style.” So whether you break up your buffalo check ""Pennsylvania tuxedo” with a graphic tee, cargo pants, or quilted skirt, you’ll look and feel confident taking on camping sites <em>or</em> bustling crowds. <br /><br />Woolrich’s creative director, Heekyun Kim, said in the release: ""This collaboration with Target represents an exciting opportunity to introduce our iconic designs, like our legendary buffalo check, to a new generation of explorers. We are proud to create a collection that honors our archives while making the Woolrich spirit of adventure accessible to all.”<br /><br />The collection officially drops on <strong>October 18</strong>, but you can preview the 100-plus item range now. And, for the first time, Target Circle 360 members can shop three limited-time styles — the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/nXM9ba"">Patchwork Plaid Throw Blanket</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/vPMoON"">Sheep Shaped Throw Pillow</a>, and <a href=""http://goto.target.com/N9LnmN"">Sheep Print Beanie</a> — <strong>between today and October 16 </strong>only.<br /><br />Click on to preview the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5xX"">Target x Woolrich collaboration</a>.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938036.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Venus’s movement into Libra couldn’t be happening at a better time! The days between October 13th and November 6th is pivotal to shaping our relationships and emotions as we couple up and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/moving-for-love-experiences"">look for lasting love</a> that fills us with optimism and happiness, whether it’s with another or for ourselves.<br /><br />Venus is extremely content in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-zodiac-sign-characteristics-personality-traits"">idealistic Libra</a>. This placement is the airy part of Venus, allowing us to be concise and direct about what we want — a desire for equitable partnerships. We are looking for someone with juxtaposing views and perspectives, allowing us to balance energy and find a middle ground. Opposites attract now, more than ever. </p>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11129292/venus-in-libra-september-2022-meaning-effects"">Venus flirts through Libra</a>, we’ll try to avoid conflict, which may be challenging. The universe promotes chill vibes, rizz, communication, and gentleness — so focus on centering the vibe. The best day to call these energies into our lives is November 1st, when Venus and the fortunate star Spica meet up in the sky, granting our wishes and bringing in magic. This particular celestial encounter happens once a year, so use it to your advantage by setting amorous intentions. The universe will provide, if you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifest your passions</a>.  <br /><br />A really special moment is when Venus creates a grand air trine with Uranus retrograde in Gemini and Pluto retrograde in Aquarius on October 14th. This energy will bring out our creative side and we will work hard to bring our artistry to the world. On a romantic level, we might find ourselves fighting for who we love the most, leading to stepping up our game and showing how much we care. Power struggles and manipulation tactics might appear in partnerships because we want to be in control. Step back and find an even playing field to make the relationship last.<br /><br />Not all is doom and gloom with this astrological transit. A grand air trine is a rare and magical aspect. To use it to one’s advantage, consider the type of friendships, family alliances, and romantic connections you wish to have. It’s essential to focus on who embraces your strengths and quirks (the same goes for your ideas about those you care for). Those who allow you to feel seen and understood are worth keeping around. Know that you are loved in all ways, especially for your wit, intellect, and personality above anything else.</p>



<p>Overall, Venus in Libra will be a whimsical time to embrace our affections and aspirations for a select group of special people or one individual in particular. Although we might not see it at first, this is a magical moment to make commitments and to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/define-the-relationship-advice"">define our relationships</a>. Yes, we may have to take a stand to assert our needs and defend our values, but doing that is a way to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">state our boundaries</a> and to ensure we aren’t being taken for granted. Love is a two-way street, and the person/people we are fawning over must reciprocate the sentiment; otherwise, we are outie. Don’t stress, because they will. Who can resist you?<br /><br />Important Dates: <br /><br /><strong>October 13th:</strong> Venus in Libra forms an opposition to Neptune retrograde in Aries. Watch out for misinterpretations of emotions and feelings of inadequacy. Don’t let delusions (especially those planted by gaslighters) guide your thoughts and heart. Know that you are fabulous. You deserve the best!<br /><br /><strong>October 14th:</strong> Venus in Libra links up with Uranus retrograde in Gemini, urging us to be more spontaneous and lighthearted. Break out of a rut by being open to novel approaches toward love and by being less codependent.<br /><br /><strong>October 14th:</strong> Venus in Libra gently trines Pluto retrograde in Aquarius, making us feel jealous and desirous at the same time. Use the cosmic energy to your advantage by healing and transforming dynamics.<br /><br /><strong>November 2nd:</strong> Venus in Libra squares Jupiter in Cancer, intensifying and expanding the need for commitment in our lives. Simply put: We want it all and won’t stop until we get it in matters of the heart.</p>

October is marked as a month of deep integration and refinement. After <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/september-tarotscopes-solar-eclipse"">September’s eclipse season</a> brought a sudden transformation, we’re left standing in a new landscape — stripped of illusions, but holding unexpected treasures. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solar-eclipse-in-aries-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Eclipse energy</a> is notorious for clearing that which cannot follow us forward, and this month is about understanding what was removed, what was revealed, and what has been gained in the process.<br /><br />This is not a season of rushing. It is a season of processing, polishing, and integrating. Think of October as a pause where we gather the fragments, sift through the rubble, and realize which pieces of gold were buried in the dust. It is in this month that the vision becomes clearer, sharper, and more honest. Utilize this month’s tarotscopes to help you gain further clarity over what has transpired, what is still being put into place, and what is still needed to be released. <br /><br />May these scopes help you align with your highest path.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938002.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />This month is about being intentional with selecting specific communities to align with in this next chapter<strong>.</strong> The eclipses cleared out false alliances, leaving you with the partners, mentors, and communities that truly see your vision and support your glow up. It has revealed to you the importance of collaboration, community, networking and vocalizing your ideas. The 3 of Pentacles asks you to let others add value to your work, polishing your craft through synergy instead of solo effort. It is also a period of building something stronger and sustainable, what you envision can come to fruition through the help of others that can add on value.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938003.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Sun</h2></strong><br /><br />October brings you sudden revelation after the intensity of eclipse season. With The Sun, illusions fall away and the light returns, illuminating where you’ve been hiding and where your true joy lies. This is a month of refreshing clarity. You’re being shown what is real, what is lasting, and what is only shadow. This can be a time when you stand up for yourself more than ever; your authenticity is not only magnetic but life-changing. Allow your radiance to be seen, celebrate yourself and your progress, and trust in the blessings unfolding. What remains in your life is meant to be. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938005.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />This month is instilling a new level of wisdom, patience, and presence. The aftermath of the eclipses has reminded you that sometimes you must let the Universe take the wheel rather than force your own plans and agenda into place. October isn’t about speeding ahead but rather finding the comfort, grace, and clarity in slowing down and paying extra attention to the magic in the present moment. You will be carried to where you want to go, but the route will be much more different than you anticipated. Trust the process. There are reminders about what you must resume and be consistent in, and other areas of your life that are calling for an extra dose of discipline and dedication. Show devotion to yourself and let the magic unfold organically.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938006.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: Queen of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Your gift this month is the ability to cut through illusions and distinguish the truth from the noise surrounding you. The eclipses have shown you where you’ve been carrying dead weight or entertaining half-truths, and now the revelation is undeniable: you thrive when you lead with precision, honesty, and boundaries. This is a month of calling things as they are. Trust your judgment, speak with authority, and protect your energy from distractions. Work on simplifying your commitments, polishing your communication, and making choices that are rooted in truth, not obligation. Balance being wise and uncompromising.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938007.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: Queen of Cups</h2></strong><br />October opens your heart after the intensity of eclipse season, inviting emotional discernment and deeper self-trust. You’re being guided to sit with what you feel, without judgment and without rushing to fix anything, so that true emotional intelligence can emerge and provide you with clarity. The revelations now are emotional, subtle, and impactful. You can finally sense what your spirit has been trying to tell you all along and trust your intuitive gifts even more. Swim in your inner waters and listen more than you react so that you can be nurturing rather than controlling. Flow, don’t force. Your intuition is your greatest ally, and it gets stronger when you honor it consistently. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938008.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 10 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />October will bring a powerful ending that clears the way for your renewal. The 10 of Swords marks the final stage of an old karmic cycle, one that may have tested your spirit, drained your energy, or revealed who and what no longer serves your path. Eclipse season successfully stripped away what was false, and left behind what will journey with you onto your next chapter. This is a period of releasing and re-birthing the self; allow this month to liberate you. Sometimes that means accepting closure without resisting it. Allow any endings that come to sharpen your wisdom and prepare you for what is meant to be in your life.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938009.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: 7 of Wands</h2></strong><br />The aftermath of eclipse season serves to remind you that not every battle deserves your fire, but the ones that do require your full conviction. This month is all about learning where to direct your energy, where to hold your ground, and where to stop defending what no longer aligns with who you’re becoming. You’ve leveled up, and this process will always come with new levels of both internal and external resistance. Choose to meet it with observation instead of reaction. This chapter is about new boundaries and a deepening of your inner peace. Stay rooted, and trust that the version of you emerging now can no longer be shaken by old tests. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938010.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: King of Swords</h2></strong><br />This month’s theme is all about mastering your thoughts and words so they serve as a sword in your favor. Clean up the aftermath of eclipse season and its remains by cutting through emotional noise, analyzing situations with wisdom, and choosing truth over comfort. The eclipses have revealed where you’ve been too lenient, too patient, or too quiet about your needs. Now, you’re invited to speak with authority and to lead your life from logic aligned with spirit. Define your standards clearly, make strategic decisions, draw sharper boundaries, and communicate from power rather than reaction. You are being called to become your own powerful leader without compromising your truth or vision. Your voice is a tool of alignment. When you express yourself with precision, the universe responds in return.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938013.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: 2 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />You may still be juggling multiple priorities, trying to stay balanced as life demands both focus and flexibility — especially after these recent eclipses. September may have shown you where your energy was stretched too thin, and now you realize you can do many things but not everything at once. This month is about bringing more structure to your flow. Reorganize your routines, adjust your expectations, place boundaries, and realign your commitments so they serve your long-term vision. Focus on what truly deserves your energy and where you’ll get the most energetic gain and let go of what scatters your life force. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938014.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: Knight of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Refine your ability to move with precision and channel your drive intentionally without scattering your energy. Post-eclipse season is showing you how much being in tunnel vision, with focus and precision, can help you win and accelerate your achievements. Impulsivity is out; implementing strategy is in. It’s time to be bold and aggressive, but that doesn’t mean reckless and aimless. Experiment with infusing every word, move, and plan with intention. Watch how your momentum builds up and you can execute all the downloads that were presented to you the month prior. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938015.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: The Empress<br /></h2></strong><br />Post-eclispe season has you blossoming with so much potential and the space to generate more abundance than ever. This month you win by slowing down and embodying that magnetism that knows it cannot fail in attracting opulence with ease. Allow abundance to knock at your doorstep versus seeking for it yourself. You are overpouring with creative juices and ideas, so start generating from that and see where it takes you. Fuel your inner child with love, adorn your soul with sensual pleasure, and know that less you do, the more you receive. Pleasure is the key to having more. Know your worth and act on that. Softness is your new power.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938016.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: King of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Eclipse season may have revealed how your sense of security depended on others or on external validation. You are the key to your own abundance. Your new revelation is that managing your energy, banking on your ingenuity, and flowing with what life gives you will all lead you to wealth. You have magnificent gifts that are now revealing themselves. Play with them and see where they lead you. Begin to tend to yourself like a garden and be devoted to your own curiosity, well-being, and growth. Consistency and dedication are how the rewards will pay off. The ability to turn your dreams into reality is apparent more than ever. Allow your inner alchemist to shine and prove others wrong. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>POV: You slept just <em>okay</em>, and it was one of those mornings where you hit snooze and begrudgingly forced yourself out of bed. As much as I prioritize sleep — and it has been documented that I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nighttime-sleep-routine-editors-picks"">very much do</a> — sometimes, you can’t help feeling tired. And for me, my eyes are an undeniable tell; when I’m low on <em>zzz</em>‘s, my undereye area is puffy and purplish (I am not genetically prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-under-eye-cream"">dark circles</a>, so I know it’s bad when I need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/color-correcting-makeup-review"">color-correct</a>). I’ve consciously uncoupled from eye creams, but still love a lightweight <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-peptide-eye-serum-review"">eye serum</a> or better yet – an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/under-eye-mask"">undereye patch</a>.</p>



<p>At first look, eye masks more or less seem the same across the board: Usually made from a hydrogel or lyocell and/or bio-cellulose material, saturated with a serum-like goo to help soothe, brighten, and hydrate under the eyes. Well, not only are they very much not created equal (many that I’ve tried simply feel nice, but that’s about it), but I’m here to report that I’ve found an unlikely favorite in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">Rhode</a>‘s new <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a>.</p>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about a lot of patches just feeling nice but not actually doing much? Not these. Hailey did her big one with these, because <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a> doesn’t only contain peptides (somewhat of a hero ingredient for Rhode), but also caffeine, sodium PCA (an amino acid that works similarly to hyaluronic acid to trap and lock in moisture), and glycerin to visibly depuff, brighten, and moisturize under the eyes. After a night of too many cocktails and not enough sleep, I put these on while walking my dog the following morning. Right away, these felt instantly cool and refreshing (even without putting them in the fridge), and the symmetrical bean shape meant that I didn’t have to play a guessing game of how to properly place them. (There is somewhat of a hotly contested debate over the Nike <em>swoosh</em>-shaped ones, and whether the tapered end should face your inner or outer end of the orbital area.) </p>





<p>When I got back to my apartment about 10 minutes later, I removed them and inspected the results. To my surprise and delight, my puffiness was nearly gone, and my dark circles visibly less noticeable. But perhaps most noteworthy is that I actually felt like my overall eye area was perked up and <em>felt </em>awake. I’ve liked most Rhode products that I’ve tried, and admit that at first, I thought these logo-printed patches were just a viral beauty moment — and a clever one at that. But after trying these out a few times, I have to say that I’m impressed. Peptide Eye Prep definitely earned its spot in my airplane beauty routine as well as my makeup bag before getting ready for a night out. Are they a bit pricey at <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">$25 for six</a> (or <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/the-peptide-eye-prep-set"">$47 for 12</a>)? Well, yes — but not at all unheard of for premium eye masks. (My other fave, <a href=""https://www.wanderbeauty.com/products/baggage-claim-eye-masks"">Wander Beauty’s Baggage Claim</a>, are similarly priced at $26 for a set of six.) The individual packaging adds to the cost, but makes them infinitely more travel-friendly in my opinion — which I personally am willing to pay more for. And the Rhode-club selfies you’ll post while wearing ’em? Priceless.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>At first, Sandra Campos hesitated about joining the TikTok trend taking over her feed. In the five years since immigration officers had dropped her off at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-border-stories-art-joy"">the Mexican border</a>, she had chosen to keep her life-altering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">deportation story</a> off of her social media page, fearing rejection. </p>



<p>But as deportation videos multiplied across social media platforms under President Donald Trump’s second administration, she found that deportees, like herself, were picking up their phones and telling their side of the story. In May, she joined the trend with a playful, 6-second clip.</p>



<p><a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSUrXrQBx/"">In the video</a>, Campos whips her long hair in disbelief. The on-screen text reads: “When you get deported after living in the U.S. for 20+ years and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10971837/no-sabo-kid-meaning-new-definition"">barely know Spanish</a>.” </p>



<p>To her surprise, the response was massive. The video quickly went viral, racking up more than 14 million views and 12,000 comments. While some messages were negative, most were supportive, wishing her luck or sharing that their own loved ones had been deported, too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page. But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page,” 28-year-old Campos told Refinery29 Somos during a video call from Guanajuato, a colorful city nestled in the mountains of central Mexico. “But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p>



<p>Campos is part of a growing wave of deportees using TikTok to reclaim their stories and shed light on a side of immigration rarely seen: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11180964/undocumented-daca-immigrants-leaving-us"">what happens after<em> </em>deportation</a>. Through hashtags such as #LifeAfterDeportation, creators share clips about finding work, struggling with Spanish, enrolling their kids in school, and other challenges of rebuilding a life in an unfamiliar place.</p>



<p>“ When I got deported, it wasn’t really big,” said Campos. “Now, everybody’s talking about it.” </p>



<p>For Campos, who was deported in 2020 under the first Trump administration, opening up about such a traumatic event wasn’t easy. “I feel like I was a bit embarrassed about what happened,” she explained. That year, police stopped her for a traffic violation and handed her over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p>



<p>Despite qualifying for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10003291/daca-trump-supreme-court-immigrant-experience"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA), the program that allows for deportation protection and work permits for immigrants who were brought over as children, Campos said that her lawyer had advised her not to renew her permit, which she now regrets. Although Campos fought her case, she was deported to Mexico after having lived in Missouri since the age of two.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Thinking about it now is just crazy, but I hated my life so much [after deportation],” Campos said. “I missed everything about the U.S. I didn’t wanna be here for another minute.”</p>



<p>After spending almost a year with distant relatives in Mexico City, she moved to Guanajuato, found a job as a server, and pursued social media more seriously. Earlier this year, she discovered that what people most resonated with on TikTok was her deportation story. Since her first post in May, she has gained 23,000 followers and received an outpouring of support.</p>



<p>“They say things like, ‘I’m really glad you put your story out there.’ And I’m like, ‘Dang!’ I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do,” she said.</p>



<p>Anna Garcia, a 35-year-old mother of five, knows that feeling well. In 2018, she was arrested at a custody hearing in Utah and deported to Mexico, with $40 in her pocket. Forced to restart her life far from her children felt “like a death sentence,” she told Somos. “I felt like my life was over.” </p>



<p>But over the next year, she pieced her life together in Puerto Vallarta, a city on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, with the goal of regaining custody of her kids. She began <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx"">documenting her journey</a> on TikTok, gaining half a million followers and becoming a prominent voice for deportees.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions.”</p><cite>Denise Serrato</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""http://tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7200468260947578154?_t=ZS-90Qzv7ESaRR&amp;_r=1"">One of her most viral videos</a> captures her reunion with her kids, with a teary-eyed Garcia embracing her children in the Puerto Vallarta International Airport. It’s a moment that might have otherwise gone unnoticed offline, but on TikTok, it allowed for thousands of followers to hold space for her.</p>



<p>One user responded: “So happy for you…I wish you and your babies the best!”</p>



<p>Another said: “My kid’s dad got deported when they were 2 and 6 mo. They are now 6 &amp; 8. I pray they get to reunite with their father one day.”<br /></p>



<p>Denise Serrato, a mental health clinician who often works with immigrant clients, says it’s unsurprising that people who have been affected by deportation are connecting with these stories. “When someone sees deportation stories online, it can trigger a sense of ‘I’m not alone.’ Social media gives visibility to experiences that are often silenced or stigmatized,” she said.</p>



<p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions,” she added.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p><cite>Anna Garcia</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>While Garcia has used the #LifeAfterDeportation hashtag for years, she said that interest has picked up in recent months as more deportations make headlines and anti-immigrant rhetoric intensifies. “ I’ve seen a huge influx of the same type of content,” she said.</p>



<p>For Garcia, who experienced backlash when she first shared her story, seeing more deportation stories online feels like a breakthrough. “It was kind of shameful back then. I have seen a lot of people more comfortable with talking about it now and being empathetic hearing these stories.” </p>



<p>Garcia said that some followers are also reaching out seeking legal advice for loved ones facing deportation. While she tries to offer individual support, she now shares videos offering useful resources for deportees, such as how to access immigration records from the U.S. government or how to seek assistance from Mexican authorities following deportation.</p>



<p>Wanting to help immigrants has motivated Garcia to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney. In August, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7538154075041352990?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-90Q7KhU9lm1"">posted a video</a> celebrating the completion of her first year as a law student. The text read: “Watch me turn pain into purpose and grow into a law student in my home country.”</p>



<p>Her message, she said, is simple: life doesn’t end with deportation.</p>



<p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p>

<p>Cosmic crew, welcome to a week that feels like the rom-com scene after the messy breakup montage. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-virgo-horoscope-september-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, the planet of love</a>, beauty, and “let’s just vibe in harmony,” is officially back home in Libra on October 13th, and the energy is immaculate. After weeks of Virgo nitpicking (“does this person spark joy <em>and </em>meet my 17-point checklist?”), Venus in Libra is like, “girl, relax. Flirt, paint, wear the glitter eyeliner, text them back.” This is us <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">hard-launching</a> joy again in Q4. We’re still intentional, but now the assignment is to let life be a little lighter, a little sexier, a little <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/witchy-gifts-halloween-magic"">more about connection</a>. <br /><br />And Venus doesn’t come alone. Five hours after she steps into Libra, Pluto, the planet of transformation, obsession, and revolution, wakes up from its five-month retrograde nap in Aquarius. And not just any nap: Pluto basically took an ancestral vision quest and came back like, “okay, I’ve got the blueprint for liberation.” The kicker? Venus immediately trines Pluto. Babe, that’s cosmic exhibitionism. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air trine</a> is basically the equivalent of them cosmically making out in public, combining forces to remind us how to love harder, freer, and more honestly — both in our own reflections and in the ways we see each other. It’s giving: make love, start revolutions, repeat. </p>



<p>Of course, Mama Luna’s got her own flavor shifts to keep us on our toes. We kick off with the Cancer Moon, which squares Venus in Libra. Translation: tenderness meets tension. You may feel misunderstood in love, or you might over-extend yourself financially/emotionally trying to “keep the peace.” Don’t fall for every sob story, and don’t let someone guilt-trip you out of your boundaries. Midweek, the Moon strides into Leo (Oct 14–16), where it opposes Pluto in Aquarius. Expect collective drama — headlines about power struggles, group accountability, and maybe some performative flexing. On a personal level, check if your pride is clashing with someone else’s truth. </p>



<p>By the weekend, the Moon slides into Virgo (Oct 16–18), syncing beautifully with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio</a>. That’s our cosmic reset: after all the emotional highs, fiery declarations, and power showdowns, we’re reminded to get back to basics. Clean the space, re-organize the notes app, and actually implement the downloads from last week’s Aries Full Moon. Virgo Moon energy is like a Sunday ritual stretched across the weekend — grounding, practical, but still deeply healing. By the end of this week, we’re collectively learning that love, revolution, and liberation don’t have to be abstract. They can show up in small, consistent choices that build a freer, softer life. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831490.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week kicks off with Venus sliding into Libra on the 13th, activating your partnership sector, and it feels like a cosmic reset button for your relationships. If Venus in Virgo had you second-guessing every little thing about compatibility, Venus in Libra is like, “hey, love can be graceful too.” This transit reminds you that you don’t have to white-knuckle your way through intimacy. It’s about balance, sweetness, laughter, and finding joy in the <em>togetherness </em>of it all. For you, this could mean softer conversations, magnetic new connections, or simply remembering that healthy love feels easy, not heavy. <br /><br />Then comes Pluto, freshly direct in Aquarius, activating your friendship and community sector. Pluto’s been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">retrograde for five months</a>, digging through the basement of your social world, and now it emerges with clarity. This is about owning your power in groups, knowing which collectives actually feed your growth, and realizing where you’ve been silencing yourself to “fit in.” Pluto direct is also about revolution in the digital/tech space for you — maybe you’re stepping into a new online platform, finding your voice on social media, or joining a movement that feels too aligned to ignore. Whatever the form, it’s liberation time. </p>



<p>Here’s the kicker: Venus and Pluto, both in Air signs, are trining each other this week. That’s harmony between your partnerships and your friendships, your one-on-one bonds and your wider circles. Gorgeous energy, but remember: even too much harmony can get dizzying. The shadow here could be projecting ideals onto people or chasing the rush of connection without grounding it in reality. Because Venus in Libra still opposes your Aries placements, this week may bring both attraction and tension: what feels sweet could also stretch you outside your comfort zone. The key is balance. Let yourself be inspired by the vision of love and community this trine opens… but don’t forget to keep your feet on the ground and your boundaries intact. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Venus entering Libra on the 13th is basically your ruling planet coming home and tossing you the keys to the wellness suite. This lights up your sector of health, routines, and daily balance. Where Venus in Virgo had you micro-analyzing who or what was draining your joy, Venus in Libra is here to restore harmony, but in practical, embodied ways. This is about making your body feel like a temple again: cooking meals that are both nourishing <em>and </em>aesthetic, finding beauty in your workspace, or bringing more play into your exercise routines. Love doesn’t have to stay in the bedroom this week — it can live in your rituals, your self-care, and how you treat your day-to-day as sacred. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, turning the lights back on in your career and long-term vision sector. For the past five months, you may have been privately rethinking what success really means to you, and now the Universe says it’s time to own it out loud. Pluto direct here can feel like an unveiling: a role you’re meant to step into, a professional project that suddenly has momentum, or an inner voice that refuses to let you play small in public anymore. It’s not about overnight fame — it’s about stepping into authority and knowing your voice can shift systems, even subtly. </p>



<p>Now here’s where it gets juicy: Venus in Libra trines Pluto in Aquarius, weaving together your health sector with your career sector. This is cosmic support for aligning what you do daily with the bigger mission you’re building — basically the “habits meet legacy” moment. The high road: designing routines that fuel your professional glow. The shadow? Romanticizing your future vision so much that you forget to show up in the present, or over-committing to roles that drain your body. Remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-taurus-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus is your ruler</a>, so its harmony with Pluto is powerful for you, but grounding is key. This is the week to let your self-care and your calling be on the same team, not fighting for your attention. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Venus enters Libra on the 13th and beams straight into your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. This is cosmic permission to flirt with life again. After Venus in Virgo had you stress-testing every detail, Libra says: lighten up. Lean into play, beauty, and love that feels like art. Whether it’s someone you’re crushing on, a passion project you’ve been circling, or just the act of letting yourself <em>enjoy, </em>Venus here reminds you that pleasure is a form of medicine. The more you indulge your inner artist or lover, the more the world mirrors that joy back to you. <br /><br />Then Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, illuminating your expansion sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reflecting on what freedom really means: what you want to study, where you want to travel, how you want to push past the limits of your current story. Pluto waking up here is like a lightbulb moment — you suddenly see where you’ve been conditioned to think too small, and you’re ready to stretch. This isn’t about reckless leaps; it’s about claiming your right to live bigger, wiser, and braver. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your creativity and joy align seamlessly with your expansion and growth. This is the Air-sign magic you thrive on: ideas, art, and experiences flowing like oxygen. The high vibe? Love that teaches you something new, creative projects that expand your worldview, travel or studies that spark romance. The shadow? Chasing ideals so fast you forget to ground them, or projecting fantasies onto people who can’t deliver. Venus in Libra does oppose your Gemini placements by modality (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardinal-mutable-fixed-signs"">cardinal vs. mutable</a>), so pacing matters. Let yourself be enchanted by the possibilities, but also anchor them — sketch the dream, but also build the frame to hold it. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, are you ready for some necessary shake-ups at home? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, highlighting your sector of family, roots, and emotional foundation. This isn’t about surface-level décor changes (though you may feel called to rearrange your space); it’s about bringing harmony where there’s been tension. Venus here wants you to ask: does my living environment feel like love? Does it reflect balance, beauty, and peace — or just clutter and compromise? Shadows could show up if you’ve been people-pleasing with relatives or ignoring your own needs in order to “keep the peace.” Venus in Libra pushes you to re-center yourself as much as you care for others. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, is stationing direct in Aquarius in your intimacy and shared resources sector. For the past five months, you’ve likely been reflecting on power dynamics — financially, emotionally, or sexually — and Pluto direct brings all of that into sharper focus. This isn’t light energy; it’s about transformation through vulnerability. Maybe you’re renegotiating financial commitments, maybe you’re deepening a bond, or maybe you’re finally letting go of an entanglement that’s been too heavy. Pluto asks: where have you been afraid to surrender, and what would true liberation feel like? </p>



<p>Now, Venus and Pluto are trining each other — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air-sign</a> magic — connecting your domestic world with your deeper bonds. This is gorgeous energy for building a home life that actually supports the intimacy you crave. It could feel like a breath of fresh air in relationships, or like the courage to merge resources in a way that uplifts both of you. But here’s the caution: trines can get intoxicating. Don’t get swept away in fantasies of the “perfect” partner or the “ideal” home setup without checking in on reality. The sweet spot for you this week is grounding… finding the balance between dreamy upgrades and tangible foundations. If you can do that, you’re stepping into a new level of security that feeds both your heart and your future. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you ready for your words to turn heads? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your communication sector and making your voice magnetic. This is the week where conversations turn flirty, your writing or content pops off, and even casual chats feel charged with charm. Venus here wants you to find beauty in the exchange — to say what you mean, but also to say it with grace. On the shadow side, you could be tempted to smooth things over with pretty words instead of being real. Remember: harmony is cute, but honesty is what sustains connections. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your partnership sector. After five months of retrograde review, the dynamics in your closest bonds are about to shift. This could look like a deeper level of intimacy in a romantic relationship, a business alliance leveling up, or a friendship where truth finally surfaces. Pluto in Aquarius isn’t casual — it’s about collective liberation through personal honesty. You’ll feel the push to show up fully as yourself in relationships, even if that means releasing dynamics that no longer honor your growth. </p>



<p>Here’s the magic: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining each other, harmonizing your communication with your partnerships. Translation: your words have the power to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11877498/dreamville-festival-2025-north-carolina-travel-diary"">transform your connections</a> right now. The high road? Conversations that bring clarity, confessions that strengthen bonds, agreements that feel like fresh air. The shadow? Getting swept up in love-bombing, saying yes too quickly, or over romanticizing what someone <em>could </em>be. Balance your fire with discernment. When you stay grounded in your truth, this trine helps you build relationships that are both magnetic and sustainable. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to rethink your money moves? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of income, values, and self-worth. After weeks of Virgo-Venus energy that had you hyper-analyzing every detail, this shift feels like a sigh of relief. Venus in Libra asks: how can you bring more balance to your finances and more beauty to your relationship with abundance? Maybe that looks like investing in something that uplifts you, or finally realizing that wealth isn’t just about numbers — it’s about alignment with what you truly value. Shadow side? Spending just to “keep up appearances” or ignoring the deeper work of budgeting because it feels less glamorous. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, shaking awake your health, work, and routine sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reconsidering how you pour your energy into daily tasks — and who benefits from it. Pluto direct here says: no more leaking your power through endless to-dos or toxic workplace dynamics. This is transformation at the ground level of your life — how you move through your mornings, how you care for your body, how you decide what <em>really </em>deserves your focus. The changes might feel subtle at first, but they’re foundational. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your money and values sector aligns with your work and wellness sector. Translation: it’s time to let your values <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/human-design-astrology-skincare-routine"">shape your routines</a> and your routines support your values. Gorgeous synergy, but it comes with a caution: don’t over-idealize quick fixes or chase shiny purchases as a substitute for deeper discipline. The beauty here is in building harmony that lasts. If you commit to balance — financially, physically, spiritually — this trine helps you create systems that feel like love in action. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready for your cosmic glow-up? Venus, your ruling planet, enters your sign on the 13th and suddenly the spotlight is squarely on you. This is the start of a season where your aura feels magnetic, your style feels on point, and people can’t help but orbit closer. Venus here is like, “remember that you are the art.” It’s a call to celebrate yourself — not in a shallow way, but by honoring your beauty, your charm, and your ability to create harmony just by being present. The shadow side? Over focusing on external validation or smoothing over conflicts so much that you erase your own needs. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, stations direct in Aquarius, activating your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. For the past five months, you’ve been internally processing what sparks passion and what feels stale. Now, Pluto’s direct turn invites you to step fully into your desires: to reclaim the parts of yourself that crave fun, artistry, and intimacy without shame. This isn’t about casual thrills — it’s about digging into what actually transforms you. You may feel pulled toward lovers or projects that change the way you see yourself forever. </p>



<p>And here’s where it all clicks: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining, weaving your sense of self with your creative and romantic fire. This is cosmic electricity, making you irresistible to opportunities that reflect who you truly are. The high road? Using this magnetism to create, connect, and inspire. The shadow? Getting swept away in the rush of attraction, or romanticizing people/projects that look shiny but lack depth. With all this air energy, stay grounded. When you center your authentic self, this week can feel like the start of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">new personal era</a> — bold, beautiful, and deeply true to you. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to face what’s been lurking in the background? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of rest, healing, and the subconscious. This is a tender placement for Venus — it asks you to soften, retreat, and reconnect with the unseen parts of yourself. Think: more solitude, more journaling, more dreaming. Instead of chasing external validation, Venus here helps you rediscover harmony inside. The shadow? Escaping into fantasies or romanticizing unavailable people just because it feels safe at a distance. Venus in Libra reminds you: intimacy with yourself is the foundation for intimacy with anyone else. <br /><br />At the same time, Pluto, your second planetary ruler, stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your sector of home, family, and roots. For the past five months, you’ve been excavating the stories you inherited from your past — the patterns around safety, power, and belonging. Pluto’s direct turn can feel like a breakthrough: suddenly you see clearly which ancestral cycles you’re meant to break, or how to reclaim control in your domestic life. This could manifest as literal home changes or as emotional clarity about where (and with whom) you truly feel at home. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">inner healing</a> sector links with your home and family sector. This is potent for mending old wounds, repairing family dynamics, or finally creating a sanctuary that actually reflects your soul. But remember: too much air-trine harmony can feel intoxicating, like you’ve already transcended the work. Don’t get carried away by the idea of a “perfect” healing breakthrough — keep showing up for the daily practices that anchor it. If you do, this week can feel like a deep exhale: the merging of inner peace and outer stability in ways you’ve been craving for years.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, are you ready to shake up your circle? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">friendships, community</a>, and collective vision. Suddenly, you’re the connector — introducing people, sparking collaborations, and feeling the love in your wider networks. Venus here is about harmony in your social world, reminding you that the right community feels like art: balanced, supportive, and fun. The shadow? Getting caught up in popularity contests or trying to keep the peace when deeper truths need to be addressed. Venus in Libra asks: which relationships are worth the effort, and which are just background noise? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, electrifying your communication and learning sector. For the past five months, you’ve been digging deeper into how you speak, teach, and share your ideas — maybe even confronting fears around being misunderstood. Now Pluto’s direct, your words carry weight. This is a season where your voice can catalyze change, whether that’s through content, conversations, or speaking up in rooms that used to intimidate you. Your mind feels sharper, braver, and ready to break through outdated narratives. </p>



<p>Together, Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius form a trine, linking your friendships with your communication. Translation: your voice has the power to rally your community, and your community has the power to amplify your voice. The high road? Building movements, friendships, or projects that feel revolutionary <em>and </em>joyful. The shadow? Getting swept away in the echo chamber — mistaking group hype for true alignment, or chasing ideals without grounding them. This week, stay rooted in your truth. When you combine your natural optimism with Pluto’s intensity and Venus’s charm, your words can spark the kind of connections that change everything. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to step into the spotlight? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your career and public recognition sector. This is your cue to shine professionally, whether that means your work finally gets the applause it deserves or you simply feel more magnetic in public spaces. Venus transiting Libra smooths over authority dynamics, helps you attract collaborators, and gives you the charisma to pitch, present, or lead with ease. The shadow? Over-polishing your image to the point where you hide your real self. Venus in Libra reminds you: true success is when your outer reputation matches your inner alignment. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your money and values sector. For the past five months, you’ve been rethinking your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10960772/building-generational-wealth-latinx-experts"">relationship with wealth</a> and worth — what you spend on, what you save, and what you expect in return for your efforts. Pluto direct here can feel like a breakthrough: maybe a new financial opportunity, a deeper awareness of your value in professional settings, or the courage to say no when something doesn’t align with your standards. This is empowerment through resources, not just survival. </p>



<p>Now, with Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your career sector aligns beautifully with your money and values. The high vibe? Work that feels rewarding <em>and </em>pays accordingly, opportunities to negotiate your worth with ease, or finding harmony between your ambitions and your bank account. The shadow? Getting carried away by external validation — chasing titles, applause, or financial wins at the expense of your deeper purpose. This week is about grounding your ambition in authenticity. When you lead from that place, the recognition and the resources flow naturally. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to feel like you’ve woken up from a five-month dream? Pluto stations direct in your sign on the 13th, and it’s like the lights come back on. For months, you’ve been internally dissecting your identity, power, and long-term vision. Now Pluto’s direct turn says: it’s time to embody what you’ve been processing. This could feel liberating — like a fresh layer of skin — but also intense, as you recognize just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/let-them-theory-tiktok-relationships-dating"">you’ve changed</a>. The shadow? Clinging to outdated versions of yourself because it feels safer than stepping into the radical transformation that’s calling you. <br /><br />At the same time, Venus enters Libra and blesses your sector of expansion, travel, education, and big-picture dreams. This is a beautiful transit for saying yes to adventures, whether that means booking a trip, signing up for a class, or diving into a philosophy that lights you up. Venus in Libra says, “make it beautiful, make it joyful,” reminding you that expansion doesn’t have to feel like pressure; it can feel like pleasure. The shadow here would be chasing escapism… running off to find harmony somewhere else instead of tending to what’s right in front of you. </p>



<p>Together, Venus and Pluto form a trine, linking your sense of self with your growth sector. Translation: this is cosmic support for becoming a more expansive, liberated version of you — one who knows their worth and isn’t afraid to explore new horizons. The high road? Aligning with people, projects, or studies that stretch you in ways that feel inspiring. The caution? Getting carried away with ideals and forgetting to ground your progress in the present. This week is about marrying transformation with adventure, liberation with joy. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to go deep? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and deep trust. This is a week where your closest bonds could feel sweeter, deeper, and more harmonious — whether financially, emotionally, or romantically. Venus here invites you to explore what reciprocity feels like when it’s balanced and beautiful. The shadow? Romanticizing unavailable people or ignoring red flags just to preserve the illusion of peace. Venus in Libra wants you to ask: does this connection truly feel mutual, or am I just playing nice? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your subconscious and healing sector. For <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">the past five months</a>, you’ve been moving through shadow work quietly, processing fears, dreams, and old conditioning that shape your present. Pluto direct here is a revelation: suddenly, what’s been hidden becomes undeniable. This can feel intense, but it’s also freeing, because you can’t heal what you don’t see. Pay attention to dreams, intuitive nudges, and subtle patterns this week — they hold the keys to liberation. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your intimacy sector links with your subconscious. Translation: deep healing and transformation are possible through love, trust, and vulnerability. The high vibe? Relationships that feel like medicine, money moves that free you from old limitations, or breakthroughs in therapy or spiritual practice. The shadow? Getting lost in fantasies of merging so fully with others that you forget yourself. Balance is key. This week, intimacy is powerful, but it works best when you bring your full, sovereign self into the connection.</p>
