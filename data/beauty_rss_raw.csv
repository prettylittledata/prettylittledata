<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946768.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>There are several reasons why finding the right dry shampoo is a tricky feat. For starters, it’s not guaranteed that it will actually help your hair feel cleaner and absorb excess oil — and that’s not even taking into consideration whether or not it’ll leave a chalky cast in its wake. And if there’s one person who feels uniquely primed to put the stuff through its paces, it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-snowboarder-mental-health-interview"">Chloe Kim</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-interview-olympics-identity-laneige"">Olympic snowboarder</a> — who the world met in the 2018 Winter Games as a bleached blonde — has recently returned to her brunette roots. Given that her job requires more time in a snug, sweat-trapping helmet than the average person, when she says she swears by Batiste to keep her roots feeling and looking fresh, I — a fellow dark brunette — am inclined to believe her.</p>



<p>“I remember using Batiste for the first time and being like, <em>oh my gosh, this works</em>,” she tells Refinery29, days before going to intensive training ahead of the upcoming 2026 Olympics in Italy. “Especially with my travel and training, it’s one of those necessities that I need on the go.” Her favorite formula? The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a>, which uses rice starch to mop up excess oil and has a refreshing chamomile, green tea, and sandalwood scent.</p>

<h2>On her favorite skincare of the moment </h2>



<p>“My skincare routine these days consists of Medicube,” Kim tells me — and it makes total sense considering the brand’s toner pads have become a cult staple among K-beauty obsessives and R29 staffers alike. “I love their toner pads and face masks, especially the collagen masks,” adds Kim.  For her, that reliability becomes essential when she’s travelling: “When I’m on the road, especially for snowboarding, where I’m in very dry climates, it’s all about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.” We love <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/collagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650?sku=2645369"">Medicube’s Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream</a> for its glass skin-bestowing ingredients like collagen, squalane, and niacinamide.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her Olympics hair routine</h2>



<p>Kim’s secret to excellent hair is practice — and then some. “Honestly, it’s like muscle memory at this point. I just know where to pull from,” she says of her accidentally perfect strands. “I will say when I sleep with heatless curls in, I get a really cute wave. So when I pull my strands out, they’re perfect.” To make the most of your beauty sleep, try <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/satin-heatless-curling-set-pimprod2031918?sku=2592934"">Kitsch’s Satin Heatless Curling Set</a>, which cuts down on frizz and breakage while delivering bouncy, defined ringlets.</p>



<p>Kim laughs as she thinks back to her early snowboarding days, when bigger always felt better. “I used to like [my waves] really thick,” she adds, “so I’d pull out a pretty big chunk, but then it started obstructing my vision when I was doing tricks, so I had to tone it back a bit.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her experimenting with beauty</h2>



<p>Looking back on her beauty routine throughout the years, Kim — whose signature look is a matte nude lip and feathered brows — says she’s switched things up so many times. “I got into makeup when I was young, and then hair came shortly after. I wanted to dye it all these crazy colors and do all of that fun stuff — I’m all about it. When I first started doing makeup, I always had to have eyeliner, usually a little wing. I also loved mascara and got into BB cushions too.” (One of her go-to’s is the <a href=""https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA230518794"">Laneige Neo Cushion</a>, which packs hydrating properties and sheer coverage in a light-as-air formula].</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On returning to her brunette roots</h2>



<p>While Kim might be known for her incredible hair today, the journey getting there wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. “Bleaching was rough for my hair, I’m not going to lie. I had to chop it when it was bleached, which was sad, but when I went back to brunette, I was able to grow it out, and I started caring more about my hair when I saw that it was growing back very healthy.” Kim says that it’s about having a consistent routine, but mainly, taking care of your scalp. “My scalp was always so oily and congested, and I would wash it all the time. And then that’s when I discovered Batiste dry shampoo,” she says. The Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo buys you more time between washes — ideal if you’re as busy as Kim — thanks to oil-absorbing rice starch. It’s also packed with moisturizing glycerin and calming plant extracts to keep your scalp healthy and comfortable.</p>

December opens a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 3 of Swords</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: King of Swords<br /></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: Judgement<br /></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946447.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /><figcaption>04 November 2025, Brandenburg, Biegen: The moon, which is about 99 percent visible and waxing, shines in the sky. On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>



<p>Even though things may seem grim before the Full Moon, the energy will give us the motivation to tap into the power within ourselves. This is an opportunity for us to make things better — especially for ourselves and those we care about.</p>

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>

<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director.

Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil.

The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p>This isn’t your average <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/hydr8-b5"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hyaluronic acid serum</a>. It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

Ah, Christmas. A time when we string colored lights around our homes, whip out Christmas stockings, bake gingerbread and gorge ourselves on, well, everything. But what's a Christmas without sitting in front of the TV with a glass of champagne in hand, devouring a wholesome, corny or just <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">so bad-it's-good Christmas movie</a>? <br /><br />Whatever you're looking for — a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/christmas-movies-toxic-men"">cheesy rom-com</a> to play in the background while you ice some gingerbread people, a thrilling Christmas <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror with an edge</a>, a Christmas musical that'll have you singing along, or you only want to see <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/set-visit-netflix-knight-before-christmas"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> in another outlandish Christmas film, we've got you covered.<br /><br />Ahead, the very best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11946456/7-christmas-movies-tv-netflix"">Christmas movies</a> of all time.<figure><figcaption><h2>It's A Wonderful Life (1946)</h2><br />Universally hailed as <em>the</em> best Christmas film to watch each year, <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em> has come to define the genre. It stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has become suicidal. But he's soon visited by an angel who shows him what really matters in life and what life would be like without his existence. A compelling, moving and heartwarming masterpiece, courtesy of Frank Capra. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Die Hard (1988)<br /></h2><br />Sparking arguments and transforming friends into enemies, <em>Die Hard</em> reinvigorated the discussion on what is meant to be a Christmas movie (and for the record, it definitely is one). Set on Christmas Eve, it follows an NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) as his Christmas plans are interrupted thanks to a group of terrorists (featuring the late Alan Rickman). In true Bruce Willis fashion, he's the only one that can save the day (and Christmas!).  </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)<br /></h2><br />Is it a Christmas movie? Is it a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/10/11572922/amazon-prime-halloween-movies-horror"">Halloween movie</a>? Who cares. When you've got a gorgeous stop-motion film as charming as this, you'll be wanting to make your Christmas morning as macabre as possible. Written by the notable Tim Burton, a visit to Christmastown should be on the cards every year (just don't forget to sing along). </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Gremlins (1984)<br /></h2><br />If you think all Christmas movies need to be peppy and upbeat, think again. <em>Gremlins</em> pumps us full of Christmas cheer, but not without the help of some demonic creatures.  This horror-comedy follows a father who finds an extra special Christmas gift for his son, but with a proviso — don't expose it to bright light, never add water, and only feed it after midnight.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Elf (2003)<br /></h2><br />A Christmas staple. Will Ferrell excels in this classic as Buddy, a childish adult/large elf who searches for his biological father in New York City. As he navigates the human world, we're treated to instantly quotable lines and enough laughs to give us an ab workout.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)</h2><br /><br />Written by John Hughes (best known for classics like <em>Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink</em>, and<em> The Breakfast Club</em>), <em>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</em> is a bible on how to do a flawless Christmas comedy. Clark Griswold (Chevy Case) wants the perfect Christmas and plays it safe by staying at home, but things go wrong pretty quickly after his hick cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his family show up without an invite. Watch this, then treat yourself to the other five <em>National Lampoon's Vacation</em> movies, just because.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Carol (2015)<br /></h2><br />Say it with me: more queer Christmas films! <em>Carol</em> has easily cemented itself into the Christmas movie rotation of many thanks to the bittersweet love it portrays. Starring Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, it follows two women as they fall in love and have a forbidden affair. And while it's just an objectively good movie, it also features plenty of Christmas hats, cookie decorating, and Christmas cheer to fill that festive hole in your heart.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Batman Returns (1992)<br /></h2><br />Batman in a Christmas movie? Well, almost. While Bruce Wayne doesn't exactly don Christmas getup head to toe, <em>Batman Returns</em> landscape is spectacularly festive. With a huge Christmas tree in the centre of Gotham, plenty of decorations to go around, and even a Grinch-esque character in the form of Max Shreck and Penguin, this is the perfect Christmas movie for comic book fanatics.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)<br /></h2><br />Have you heard of Whoville? If not, you're in for a treat. It's one of the most wonderfully blissful and friendly places that'll have you returning for your dose of Christmas cheer, every year. We all know who The Grinch is — he's a bloody grouch. He doesn't believe in Christmas and most certainly won't be participating in any local decorating competitions. But things change when he meets six-year-old Cindy Lou. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bad Santa (2003)<br /></h2><br />Dark comedy and Christmas is an unexpected match made in heaven, seen nowhere better than in <em>Bad Santa</em>. The star of the show, Billy Bob Thornton, stars as a gross, vile, alcoholic, chain-smoking and horny shopping centre Santa Claus ripoff — and we love him for it. Just don't make the mistake of showing this one to the kids. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holiday (2006)<br /></h2><br />You've got your <em>Love Actually </em>girlies, and you've got your <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11596077/is-the-holiday-a-christmas-movie"">The Holiday</a> </em>girlies. Whatever side you fall on, you'll still appreciate this as one of the best Christmas movies of all time. It follows two women (played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) who swap lives and their perfect homes for a fortnight to escape their problems and heartbreak. Jack Black and Jude Law also star in this fan favorite. Someone bring out the mistletoe, stat. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silent Night (2021)<br /></h2><br />An apocalyptic dystopian Christmas film starring Keira Knightly? Sign me up. After a couple invites their friends over for Christmas dinner, they soon discover that it's their last night on Earth, thanks to a toxic cloud sweeping across the planet. Coined as a ""<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">f*cked up </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">Love Actually</a></em>"" by Refinery29's own Maybelle Morgan, this gem is satirical, self-aware, and well worth a rotation on your telly over the holidays. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Actually (2003)<br /></h2><br />While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-actually-is-the-worst"">polarizing, <em>Love Actually</em></a> is still a firm favorite among many lovers of Christmas movies. With a stellar ensemble cast including Emma Thompson, Jude Law, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant and more, this 2003 film shows different aspects of love through ten separate stories. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holidate (2020)<br /></h2><br />Starring Emma Roberts and our own Aussie Luke Bracey who decide to be each other's holiday dates, Holidate is a rom-com with all the predictability and cheesiness we crave come Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Lord Of The Rings (2001)</h2><br />If <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>wasn't a Christmas movie, then why was it released on Boxing Day every year? Checkmate. A tradition in the Koster residence and our Christmas movie of choice every year, prep yourself to settle down for 10+ hours of Middle Earth shenanigans. One movie for Christmas Eve, one movie for Christmas Day, and one movie for Boxing Day. You're welcome.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Hard (2021)<br /></h2><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">Love Hard</a></em> combines romance with the holiday spirit. Starring <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> actress Nina Dobrev, the Netflix original Christmas film sees her character Natalie get catfished when she thinks she's chatting to a dreamy guy, Tag (Darren Barnet from <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/07/10586990/most-underrated-line-never-have-i-ever"">Never Have I Ever</a></em>), but it's actually Tag's childhood friend Josh (Jimmy O. Yang).<br /><br />This movie is just as much about the challenges of dating in the online world as it is about our desire for love and connection, especially during the festive season. It's also a big win for Asian representation in Hollywood. As <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> writer Maggie Zhou puts it, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">casting of Jimmy O. Yang as a potential love interest</a> welcomes a change from the problematic stereotypes about Asian men that have so often been perpetuated in Hollywood over the years. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (2020)<br /></h2><br />With visuals that look like they've been plucked from a storybook, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10222779/jingle-jangle-best-black-christmas-movies"">Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</a></em> is a cute and fresh Christmas flick from Netflix. It follows a toymaker (Forest Whitaker, no less) and his apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key), who steals one of his prized inventions. It's up to his granddaughter (Madalen Mills) to save the day and reignite the magic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)<br /></h2><br />With Michael Caine as Scrooge, Gonzo the Great as Charles Dickens, and a whole bunch of Muppets, <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol </em>has easily cemented itself as one of the most easily recognizable and well-loved Christmas movies out there. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Princess Switch (2018)<br /></h2><br />In what is the best work by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/10/10698806/vanessa-hudgens-nude-photo-leak-2007-reaction"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> since <em>High School Musical</em>, this movie is perfect if you're looking for a 90-minute happily ever come Christmas time. You'll be seeing double because Hudgens plays two women: Stacy DeNovo, a baker who runs a popular pastry shop in America, and Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro in Belgravia, London. When they meet, they do their best <em>Parent-Trap</em> style swap of sorts and switch places. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Falling For Christmas (2022)<br /></h2><br />Speaking of <em>The Parent Trap, </em>the Lindsay Lohan renaissance is upon us! And I, for one, welcome our new overlord. <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/11/11185134/falling-for-christmas-lindsay-lohan-netflix"">Falling For Christmas</a></em> is a fresh Christmas flick in which Lohan plays a spoiled heiress who loses her memory after a skiing accident. She falls (literally) into the arms of a supremely hot widower. You can probably guess what happens next.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Violent Night (2022)<br /></h2><br />An R-rated Christmas movie? Yes, please. Starring everyone's daddy, David Harbour, this black comedy action flick features a heroic Santa Claus who must step in to save the day after a group of mercenaries attack the estate of a wealthy family.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Home Alone (1990)<br /></h2><br />Another John Hughes classic, <em>Home Alone</em> is a holiday essential. Featuring Macaulay Culkin as the sadistic kid we knew him as, Kevin ends up being left home alone after his preoccupied parents head off on a holiday. Soon, he has to protect his house against burglars — a feat which he accomplishes in a very creative fashion.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lethal Weapon (1987)<br /></h2><br />In <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover gift us with an action-packed thriller that's chock-full of blood and violence. Doesn't quite sound Christmassy? Let this movie convince you otherwise. Shane Black, the MVP of writing screenplays that always somehow involve Christmas, has done it again. This time, it's with two cops on a mission to take down drug dealers — on Christmas, of course. If <em>Die Hard</em> is a Christmas movie, <em>Lethal Weapon</em> should definitely get a seat at the table. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Single All The Way (2021)<br /></h2><br />In an attempt to avoid judgement from his family for being single, Peter (Michael Urie) convinces his bestie, Nick (Philemon Chambers), to pretend that they're in a relationship. Aaaand, cue the romance. If the fake-dating trope isn't enough to reel you in, perhaps some Jennifer Coolidge might do the job.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tangerine (2015)<br /></h2><br />If you haven't noticed yet, queer Christmas films are excellent. And <em>Tangerine</em> is no exception. Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a pair of transgender women (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor), a pair of sex workers who search for a heart-breaking pimp. Shot entirely on an iPhone, it's a cinematic feat as well as just a bloody good Christmas film.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Story (1983)<br /></h2><br />A cult classic, <em>A Christmas Story</em> tells the tale of a young boy who tries to convince his parents, teacher, and Santas Claus that a BB gun is the perfect Christmas gift.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Krampus (2015)<br /></h2><br />Who says Christmas movies can't also be horror? Not us! <em>Krampus </em>is a scary goodie. It features Toni Collette and Adam Scott as they deal with a festive Christmas demon who has been summoned into their home. And you thought Christmas dinner with your conservative uncle was bad.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe (2005)<br /></h2><br />The MVP of cosy movies, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> embodies childhood joy. Based on C.S. Lewis' novel, we see four children enter a magical, snowy land through a wardrobe door. Father Christmas even makes an appearance (plus James McAvoy as a very hot half-faun/half-human). <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2><br />Whilst not explicitly Christmassy, I'm sure many will agree that Harry Potter's first instalment just gives off that fuzzy, Christmas morning feeling. If you don't mind, we'll just be off pretending that we're unwrapping gifts at Hogwarts on Christmas morning.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Knight Before Christmas (2019)<br /></h2><br />In a strange turn of events, Vanessa Hudgens is now known as <em>the</em> Christmas movie star. I know, I didn't see it coming either. In <em>The Knight Before Christmas, </em>she meets a hot medieval English knight (Josh Whitehouse) who magically time-travels to present-day America.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Scrooged (1998)<br /></h2><br />Based on Charles Dickens' novel, <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, <em>Scrooged</em> features Bill Murray as a cynical, mean television exec who's visited by three spirits. Here, they give him a chance to right his wrongs — all on Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Black Christmas (1974)<br /></h2><br />After a group of sorority girls plan to go away for the Christmas holidays, they're soon confronted by a terrifying stalker. An intelligent, unnerving Chrissie slasher that's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-horror-movies"">a must for any horror fanatic</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>In Bruges (2008)<br /></h2><br />If you're hankering for a not-so-Christmassy Christmas movie, <em>In Bruges</em> should be at the top of your list. Set in Bruges, Belgium, we're treated to a wonderfully festive landscape. The plot, however, isn't as festive — two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), head to Bruges to hide out. But things get complicated when their boss (Ralph Fiennes), asks Ken to kill Ray.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)<br /></h2><br />In possibly the cutest addition to this list, <em>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer </em>is the epitome of Christmas joy. It's the story we all know and love, but artistically, it's way beyond its years. With groundbreaking stop-motion animation using puppets, you'll find it hard to wipe the smile off your face. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Polar Express (2004)<br /></h2><br />This animated musical adventure is based on the 1985 book of the same name, and as cliché as it sounds, it reminds me of the magic of Christmas that you beautifully embrace as a child and then look back on fondly as an adult. You'll never feel too old to watch this movie, where a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole aboard the Polar Express train. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)<br /></h2><br />Is it even Christmas if you don't listen to a bit of Judy Garland? In this musical masterpiece, we meet four sisters as they learn about life and love, and face their childhood fears.  It makes for perfect background viewing while some gingerbread people decorating, thanks to its stellar soundscape. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Little Women (2019)<br /></h2><br />Set during two life-changing Christmases, Little Women is the perfect Christmas movie. In this soul-crushing and spellbinding adaptation, we follow the March sisters (played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen), as they enter womanhood. With snowy landscapes, Christmas parties, pine trees and fireplace-laced stockings, it's hard to not consider this one of the Christmas greats. Just maybe skip over <em>that</em> marriage proposal scene if you want to keep the mood light. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)<br /></h2><br />For the anti-consumerist Christmas critics among us (hello!), <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> is the perfect way to get into the festive spirit. Stanley Kubrick's last film, considered his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"", follows Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), after she admits to dreaming of having an affair. Everywhere you look, it's hard to ignore that the spirit of Christmas is rife — holiday parties, strung-up lights, toy stores, and mall Santas. But it's not without its criticism. Instead of whimsical, Kubrick presents Christmas as critique of the Western world's obsession with consumerism. File under: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/holiday-movies-sex-scenes"">Christmas movies to watch when you're horny.</a><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Night Before (2015)</h2><br />A Christmas movie for those who flock to stoner comedy (read: any Seth Rogan film), <em>The Night Before</em> features the man himself, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie as they say goodbye to their years of Christmas traditions in anticipation of fatherhood. With one last night of debauchery, they head to New York and hunt down the elusive Nutcracka ball. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)<br /></h2><br />An icon in itself, this <em>Peanuts</em> Christmas film tackles Christmas materialism in a lighthearted way as Charlie Brown tries to find a deeper meaning to Christmas. We love some Charlie Brown existentialism!<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Santa Clause (1994)<br /></h2><br />After Tim Allen accidentally causes the death of Santa, he magically transforms into the new big man. A cornerstone of any 90s kid's Christmas,<em> The Santa Clause</em> is a heartwarming story of a dad repairing his relationship with his family.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Happiest Season (2020)<br /></h2><br />Another queer Christmas movies, <em>Happiest Season </em>stars the likes of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/kristen-stewart-spencer-interview"">Kristen Stewart</a>, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Dan Levy and more. It follows a woman who struggles to come out to her conservative parents while she and her girlfriend visit them during the Christmas holiday. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017)<br /></h2><br />In <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em>, we take a deep dive into how Charles Dickens wrote one of the most quintessential Christmas tales — <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Anyone who's had writer's block will resonate.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Four Christmases (2008)<br /></h2><br />There's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/why-we-love-bad-christmas-movies"">something about objectively bad Christmas films that make them so good</a>. I'll be straight with you — this is not a good movie. But it is a good movie for Christmas. Featuring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, a couple spends Christmas Day jumping between family get-togethers after their holiday to Fiji is cancelled.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Dolly Parton's A Christmas On The Square (2020)<br /></h2><br />Everyone's Christmas could do with a little more Dolly Parton. In this campy song-and-dance story, a Scrooge-y woman who's planning on selling off a small town, receives a visit from an angel (Dolly Parton, of course).<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966)<br /></h2><br />In the original 1966 rendition, Dr. Seuss' classic is told to us true to form as a cartoon spectacle. This Christmas movie is like watching the book come to life. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Spirited (2022)<br /></h2><br />Starring Christmas legend Will Ferrell, and everyone's boyfriend, Ryan Reynolds, this fresh festive flick is a musical version of Charles Dickens' famous story. But with a cast like this, there's no way it's the same story we've seen time and time again.   <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Prince (2017)<br /></h2><br />With a Hallmark essence that's so bad it's good, <em>A Christmas Prince</em> follows a young reporter who is sent abroad to get the scoop on a very hot, very vanilla prince. With a whopping IMDb rating of 5.8/10, it's the perfect bad Christmas film to watch these holidays.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Miracle on 34th Street (1994)<br /></h2><br />Young Susan (played by Mara Wilson of Matilda fame) doesn't believe in Santa. When an elderly man is called in by Susan's mother to replace an intoxicated department store Santa, things start to change. Introducing himself only as Kris Kringle, he claims he's the real Santa Claus, leading to locals trying to sabotage him and landing him in a court case. There's a heartwarming message in this movie about the beauty in believing and Christmas wishes. The 1947 original is also well worth a viewing. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)<br /></h2><br />Set during Christmas in Los Angeles, this film looks closer to a Christmas in Sydney than it does in a winter wonderland US. In true Shane Black fashion (a la <em>Lethal Weapon</em>), the Christmassy elements are just background noise. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan in a sexy Santa suit, <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </em>is a witty crime comedy that doubles as a murder mystery. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Last Holiday (2006)</h2><br />Queen Latifah shines in this early naughties movie that sees her as a saleswoman and budding home chef named Georgia Byrd. After receiving a terminal illness diagnosis, she then uses her life savings to fly to Czechia and spends the last few weeks of her life like a lavish billionaire. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holdovers (2023)<br /></h2><br />While Christmas time often invites us to watch downright <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11605440/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">bad holiday flicks</a>, The Holdovers cannot be considered in this category — it's a great Christmas film. In fact, it's a great film, period. Directed by Alexander Payne (of <em>Nebraska</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>), <em>The Holdovers</em> follows a cranky instructor (Paul Giamatti) who's forced to remain on campus during the Christmas holidays to babysit the kids who have nowhere to go. Expect tears.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Best. Christmas. Ever! (2023)</h2><br />Starring Brandy (!) and Heather Graham, Netflix's new Christmas movie, <em>Best. Christmas. Ever!</em> is so bad it's good. Honestly, you don't even need to know the plot of this one to add it to your queue list. It has Brandy in it! I repeat, it has Brandy in it!</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Klaus (2019)</h2><br />This gorgeous hand-drawn animated film is a welcome addition to our Christmas movie rotation. It's sweet, funny, and just oozes that warm nostalgic feeling. It also happens to feature a packed cast, including Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and J.K. Simmons.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022)</h2><br /><br />Whether or not you're a fan of the Marvel movies, <em>The Guardians of the Galaxy</em>'s Christmas special is a go-to if you're after an action-packed holiday film. With a special appearance from Kevin Bacon, we see the usual Guardians crew as they set off on another adventure. It's not the same calibre we expect from the Marvel heavy hitters, but when it's Christmas, don't you just want something fun?</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>I look forward to December every year, simply for the chance to sit in the lounge and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-australian-christmas-movies"">binge Christmas movies</a>. I love the classics, from <em>Home Alone</em> to <em>Love Actually</em>, but there’s always a new set of films that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/8-tv-film-netflix-watch-december"">appear on Netflix</a>. The streamer has come out with some gems over the past few years, like <em>Love Hard</em>, <em>Hot Frosty</em> and <em>Klaus</em>, so I’ve been eagerly awaiting their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-christmas-movies"">holiday slate</a>.</p>



<p>From Alicia Silverstone’s new <em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em> to <em>Jingle Bell Heist</em>, there’s some great festive options to pull up on your screen. If you prefer lifestyle shows over movies, Meghan Markle has conjured up a special holiday edition of her show <em>With Love, Meghan</em>. To take a look at the best Christmas content coming to Netflix, read on.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em></h2>

<h2><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em> shot to number one on Netflix’s most-watched movies list just hours after it was released, it’s one to watch.

It’s about a woman named Layla (Christina Milian) who is on a quest to meet James, the man of her dreams (Kofi Siriboe), so she races across New York City with a Christmas concierge (Devale Ellis) hoping to find a ticket to a sold-out Pentatonix Christmas concert.</p>
