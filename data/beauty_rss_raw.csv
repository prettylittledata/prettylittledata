<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We’ve made it to month 12 of 12, cosmic beings, and it’s starting off with a whirlwind. The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th wants us to say everything, do everything, schedule five coffee dates, and buy twelve books we’ll only read three pages of. Gemini’s curious, chatty, and chaotic energy can be fun — or overwhelming — especially  because it’s ruled by Mercury in Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">still in its retroshade</a> until the first week of the  month. Translation? Be careful not to spill your tea before it’s fully steeped. You don’t have to post every realization. Mind your business <em>and </em>your bandwidth. It’s okay to love variety and still be discerning. Sometimes your mind just wants to spin… That doesn’t mean you have to follow it down every rabbit hole. </p>



<p>Then, something rare and quietly miraculous starts building: on December 10th, Neptune stations direct in Pisces, joining Saturn, who just did the same a few weeks prior. This is the <em>last time in our lifetimes </em>that both of these outer planets will be moving forward together in their shared home sign. Neptune is dreams and illusions. Saturn is structure and discipline. Together, they ask: what do you want to build, and is it real enough to last, but dreamy enough to still make you weep a little? This is spiritual architecture. Soul strategy, sacred boundaries. It’s rare to feel this mystical and grounded at once. You don’t have to “figure it out.” But you <em>do </em>have to listen, especially when the guidance comes through silence, or tears, or poetry. </p>



<p>One day later, on the 11th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mercury enters Sagittarius</a>, and things brighten. You’re encouraged to laugh again, to tell a story out loud, to say what you believe without over-explaining it. That playful Sag energy only intensifies as the sun and Mars continue moving through the sign all month, but on December 15th, Mars trades the fire for earth, entering Capricorn for a six-week stay. The vibe shifts: still motivated, still active, but more focused and grounded. And if you’re tempted to sprint toward the  finish line of the year, ask yourself why.  </p>



<p>2025 is a 9 year in numerology and we are in the Year of the Snake, and these both represent cycles of endings, surrender, and preparation. You don’t have to prove anything right now. Mars in Capricorn wants your <em>integrity</em>, not your overexertion. Ending the year strong might just mean getting enough sleep, finishing your personal projects, or walking away from what you know doesn’t align anymore. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius arrives on December 19th, and it’s a beautiful reminder that even if this year didn’t unfold the way you expected, hope is still alive. Sagittarius teaches us how to zoom out. How to trust our own resilience. How to envision six months from now and still smile. The astro new year doesn’t begin until March 21st,  2026, so this is not a “wrap it all up” kind of month — it’s a <em>what could grow next </em>kind of moment.  </p>



<p>And when the Winter Solstice hits on December 21st, ushering in Capricorn Season, the energy pivots fully toward sustainability, maturity, and alignment. By the time Venus (Dec 24th) and Juno (Dec 29th) enter Capricorn too, many of us will be craving clarity in our relationships, our finances, our commitments. Not for control, but for peace. We want to <em>want what we’re building</em>. And that’s what the end of this year is really about. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, December begins with your voice returning: stronger, bolder, and maybe even  louder than you remember it. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your  communication sector with insight and closure. Conversations that have been circling for months may finally land. A pitch that sat in your notes app since June? Suddenly  sharp. A truth you’ve been avoiding? It wants out. But with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow until December 7th, pace yourself. Just because you <em>can </em>say something doesn’t mean you have to say it all at once. This is a great time to write, teach, or start recording that podcast you’ve been procrastinating on. But be mindful not to info-dump or overshare just because the mic is hot again. Full moons are  culminations — don’t forget to pause and see what’s already come full circle before rushing into more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a quiet but cosmic transition is taking place behind the scenes: Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, who did the same just weeks prior, in your sector of solitude, endings, and deep spiritual healing. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two karmic giants will be moving forward together in this realm — the basement of your subconscious, the attic of your past lives. Neptune’s been here since 2011. Saturn since 2023. That’s over a decade of spiritual unlearning, grief  processing, and karmic re-patterning finally preparing to complete. If you’ve felt foggy, withdrawn, or like you’ve been carrying the weight of something ancient without knowing why… this is why. But now, the energy is shifting. The past is still there, but it’s behind you, not breathing down your neck. You may find yourself dreaming more vividly, forgiving more deeply, and craving more solitude before big decisions. Honor that pull inward, because in a few months, Neptune enters Aries, and you’ll begin a  whole new soul cycle. For now? Breathe. Reflect. You’re almost through the tunnel. </p>



<p>Then comes December 19th’s New Moon in Sagittarius, landing in your sector of  adventure, wisdom, and future planning. Suddenly, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/solo-trip-maldives-luxury-destination"">new long-distance trip</a>, course of  study, or leap of faith starts calling your name. And you’re so close to saying yes. But  just four days earlier, Mars, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, launching a six-week  journey through your career and public life zone. That’s where the tension begins. This Sag new moon says <em>go wide</em>. Mars in Capricorn says <em>go deep</em>. One wants the bird’s eye view. The other wants the blueprint. You may feel pulled between freedom and responsibility, spontaneity and strategy, vision and execution. That’s okay. Don’t make it either/or. Let this be the season where you ask yourself: what’s worth building, and  what’s just distracting me from my real power?  </p>



<p>Capricorn Season kicks in on December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno joining the party, and you may feel a slow, steady pressure to be more structured, even if your Aries fire would rather blaze. This isn’t about restriction. It’s about <em>direction</em>. Don’t fight the focus. Let it guide your fire where it can actually <em>last</em>. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>December starts with a mirror held up to your self-worth. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-manage-your-money"">illuminates your money</a>, value systems, and energetic exchange. If you’ve been undercharging, over-giving, or stuck in a pattern of “I’ll receive after I prove myself,” this lunation cracks something open. It’s not just about finances, it’s about where your time, presence, and power have been leaking without you noticing.  Something from the last six months might culminate now: a contract wrapping, a debt paid off, or a realization that you’re finally done tolerating breadcrumbs. But with Mercury still in Scorpio (aka your relationship zone), keep communication grounded. You don’t have to perform your boundaries — just <em>honor </em>them. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a subtler, long-range transformation is clicking into place. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your sector of community, long-term goals, and collective belonging. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two planets will be conjunct and direct in Pisces, in your vision zone.  Neptune has been here since 2011, asking you to reimagine what friendship, leadership, and legacy could mean for you. Saturn joined in 2023, bringing structure to  what used to be only dreams. If you’ve felt disconnected from community or unsure of your purpose within a larger movement, clarity is coming — not as a blinding flash, but a quiet alignment. You may realize that a group, platform, or network no longer fits who you’ve become. Or you may feel yourself pulled to share something vulnerable with the right people. Let your people find you. But first, make space for them by clearing what’s expired. </p>



<p>The mood shifts again on December 19th, when the Sagittarius New Moon arrives in your intimacy and shared resources zone. This lunation is about energetic merging with another person, a purpose, a source of power that stretches beyond your ego. You may feel a surge of desire, a temptation to go deeper in a connection, or a hunger to be emotionally seen in ways you’ve been shielding.  </p>



<p>But don’t rush, because just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a six week chapter of expansion, risk, and long-term vision — and that could add tension between staying in control vs. surrendering to something bigger. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium in the skies reminds you to walk your talk. It’s not just about climbing — it’s about meaning. As the year closes, ask yourself: where do I feel brave enough to let go of control? And where am I ready to rebuild, slowly, with  devotion? Your next chapter doesn’t need to be rushed. But it <em>does </em>need to be real. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this month starts with your name in lights, but it’s the kind of spotlight that asks: <em>are you being seen for who you really are, or who you’ve been performing as? </em>The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands directly in your sign, closing out a six-month identity cycle and bringing your emotions to the surface in unexpected ways. You might be smiling at brunch but crying in the car. You might suddenly feel ready to  dye your hair, quit a gig, or tell someone the truth you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/confrontation-friendships-relationships-trust"">rehearsing in your head</a>. This lunation is emotional clarity wrapped in chaos. And with Mercury, your ruler, still in  Scorpio and moving through its post-retrograde shadow, you’re being asked to speak less from impulse, and more from embodied truth. You’ve changed. This full moon wants the real you to lead now. </p>



<p>What makes this emotional shift more potent is the subtle, oceanic current moving  beneath the surface. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your career, legacy, and public reputation zone. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>that these two planetary elders will move together, direct, in Pisces. Neptune’s been here since 2011, softening your ambitions, mystifying your path, and teaching you to lead with intuition, not ego. Saturn arrived in 2023 to put  scaffolding around your dreams. And now? You’re ready to step into your role — with  less hustle, more heart. You don’t need to have the five-year plan. You just need to trust the wisdom you’ve earned. Let yourself be visible <em>without </em>needing to perform. Let the right people come find you when you’re grounded in your message. </p>



<p>Then comes a rush of new energy: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your partnership zone, just four days after Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your intimacy and soul-merging zone for a six-week deep dive. Translation? Your love life, and your ability to share your energy, is going through a shift. If you’re in a relationship, you may crave more depth, more transparency, or more space. If you’re single, a connection could spark with someone who feels intense, but oddly familiar. And from December 21st onward, as Capricorn Season hits and Venus and Juno pile on, your relationships — romantic, financial, spiritual — become the mirror. Who are you when you’re <em>not </em>trying to impress anyone? What’s worth sharing, and what needs more boundaries? Let this be the month you return to your truth and let others meet you there. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, December begins like a dream you can’t quite remember but can’t fully shake.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th activates your sector of closure, healing, and  spiritual release, and suddenly, you’re ultra-sensitive to what’s <em>behind the scenes</em>. You may feel more tired than usual, more emotionally raw, more protective of your time and your nervous system. Old emotions surface through strange dreams, random  memories, or even a song that sends you spiraling. You don’t need to explain it. Just <em>feel it</em>. And then let it go. With Mercury still in Scorpio during the retroshade, this isn’t the time to spill all your secrets. It’s the time to check in with the parts of yourself that you’ve been emotionally ghosting. Forgive where you need to. Unfollow what you need to. You’re clearing spiritual clutter before stepping into something real. </p>



<p>And that something real? It starts to crystallize around December 10th, when Neptune stations direct in Pisces, just weeks after Saturn did the same. This is the <em>final direct  Neptune-Saturn pairing in Pisces in your lifetime </em>— and it’s all happening in the part of your life that governs faith, expansion, and your broader worldview. Since 2011, Neptune has been softening your belief systems, inviting you to trust something bigger than control. Saturn joined in 2023 to show you where that trust had to become a practice, not just a Pinterest quote. If you’ve felt spiritually disconnected or unsure of where you’re headed, this month brings grounding to your growth. You may feel called to deepen your studies, return to a forgotten spiritual practice, or even plan a trip that shifts your perspective. This is cosmic wisdom, not just wanderlust. Listen to what your soul has been trying to tell you all along. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy pivots fast. The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your sector of health, rituals, and daily rhythm, giving you a fresh start with how you care for your body and manage your mental load. You’re setting intentions around vitality — not perfection. But just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your relationship zone and kicking off six weeks of serious energy around your partnerships.  Translation? You’ll need to balance your own wellness with the demands of others. From December 21st onward, Capricorn Season — joined by Venus and Juno — deepens your desire for commitment, but also asks for boundaries. Don’t let someone else’s structure become your stress. You’re allowed to prioritize your peace without justifying it. This season teaches you that love isn’t just a feeling: it’s a daily decision to show up, <em>with </em>yourself and <em>for </em>yourself. And that, my friend, is what will make 2026 your thriving year. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, December starts with all eyes on you, but that doesn’t mean you have to say yes to every invite. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your social sector, putting friendships, group dynamics, and future plans under a magnifying glass. You might be the one everyone wants at the party, or the one they call when things fall apart. But you’re also the one who needs to check in with your own capacity. Are you  showing up out of joy, or obligation? This lunation brings a culmination from the past six months: maybe a long-term goal starts showing signs of fruition, or a friendship quietly reaches its expiration point. And with Mercury still in Scorpio in retroshade, words carry weight. So before you commit to one more “collab” or group chat or invitation, ask: does this still light me up, or just drain me? </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, something deeper is shifting. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on  December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your most vulnerable, transformational zone. This is the last time in your life these two will move forward together in this part of your chart, and it’s a big deal. Since 2011, Neptune has asked you to surrender your tight grip on control when it comes to intimacy, trust, and merging — emotionally, sexually, or financially. Saturn came in 2023 to put some structure around all that soul work. And now, you’re beginning to feel the payoff. You’ve  grown. You’ve released. You’ve survived things you didn’t think you could name, let alone move through. This month might bring an invitation to go deeper with someone — or to go deeper with yourself. Either way, you’re not here for shallow exchanges anymore. If it’s not real, it’s not for you. </p>



<p>And then comes your reawakening: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your pleasure zone. This is a cosmic green light for fun, creativity, love, and unapologetic joy. You might feel pulled to start a new artistic project, flirt more boldly, or reenter your soft era. But just a few days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, activating  your health, wellness, and daily routine zone for six weeks — and here’s where the tension sets in. One part of you wants to dance barefoot under the stars. The other part needs to clean your inbox and fix your posture. When Capricorn Season arrives on  December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno, your days may start filling up with tasks, obligations, or wellness goals. Don’t let the pressure to “optimize” steal your sparkle. Your joy <em>is </em>sacred work. So is your rest. Let December be both a celebration and a sacred recalibration. You’re allowed to shine on your own terms, and 2026 is the year you’ll do just that. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, December begins with a spotlight on you, and for once, you might not deflect it.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands at the peak of your chart, illuminating your career, reputation, and long-term vision. Something you’ve been working toward  since summer may finally reach its moment of clarity or culmination. But this lunation is  less about the achievement and more about <em>how it feels</em>. Are you proud? Are you exhausted? Are you pretending to be fine because that’s easier than admitting you’re running on empty? With Mercury, your planetary ruler, still in Scorpio’s post-retrograde shadow, the energy is intense. But you’re being asked to name what success means to you <em>now</em>, not what it meant six months ago. You’ve changed. Your needs have changed. Let your definition of accomplishment evolve with you. </p>



<p>Beneath the surface, a more intimate reckoning is underway. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn in your relationship sector — both now moving forward together in this part of your life for the <em>last time in your lifetime</em>. Since 2011, Neptune has blurred the lines between you and others: between love and illusion, giving and over giving, merging and losing yourself. Saturn arrived in 2023 to draw  boundaries where there were none. Now, you’re integrating those lessons. You may be seeing a current or past relationship more clearly than ever — not because someone changed, but because <em>you </em>did. This isn’t about judgment. It’s about discernment. Who do you become in the presence of another? Where do you compromise your truth in the name of harmony? These are questions you’re finally ready to answer, and act on. Whether a partnership deepens or dissolves, the clarity will feel like relief. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th invites you back into your emotional roots — your home, your body, your past. It’s a chance to redefine safety and reclaim softness. Maybe you’re moving, renovating, or just finally clearing the emotional weight from your living space. You don’t have to do it all at once… just begin where your heart feels ready. But don’t get too cozy: Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, igniting your creativity, romance, and joy zone for six weeks. You’re being called to pour energy into something <em>you </em>love — not something others expect from you. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium invites a passionate reset. Prioritize play. Take your  dreams seriously. Your inner child has been waiting for your attention — not your  perfection. Let December be a mix of softness and fire. Your tenderness is part of your power now, and that’s what’s going to make 2026 your best year yet. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this month kicks off with a zoomed-out, wide-angle lens on your life. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lights up the part of your chart that rules your perspective  — your sense of meaning, belief, truth. Something clicks into place. Maybe a story you’ve been telling yourself reveals a deeper thread. Maybe you realize a chapter has closed, even if you never said it out loud. There could be literal travel or legal  paperwork involved, or a publishing opportunity that opens a door. But the deeper shift is internal: you’re not willing to pretend anymore. And with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow, it’s wise to choose your words carefully. You don’t need to make a grand declaration… you just need to honor the version of you who’s growing out of old frameworks. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, something more embodied is quietly taking shape. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your sector of wellness, routines, and energetic boundaries. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>these two will be direct together in Pisces. Since 2011, Neptune has been washing away your  illusions around perfection, service, and “fixing” things through busyness. Saturn came in 2023 to ground your rhythms. Now, it’s time to integrate. You may feel a call to simplify your schedule, recommit to your health, or finally stop performing balance and <em>actually </em>cultivate it. The healing won’t come from controlling everything, it will come from honoring what your body already knows. Ritual. Boundaries. Sleep. Water. Less noise. More breath. You don’t have to earn your rest. You just have to <em>choose </em>it. </p>



<p>Then comes a shift in momentum. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your communication sector, helping you reset your mindset, clarify your message, or start something that requires your voice. This is a powerful time for pitches, posts, writing projects, or simply reconnecting with curiosity. Say what you need to say. But keep it honest — and kind. Just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a  six-week activation of your home, family, and emotional roots.  </p>



<p>And from December 21st onward, Capricorn Season begins, followed by Venus and Juno stacking up in the same part of your sky. You’ll be asked to get more honest about your foundations: where you live, who you lean on, what “safety” means to you. Home isn’t always cozy. Sometimes it’s confronting. Let December show you where structure can liberate you — not trap you. You’re not seeking control, you’re seeking  peace. And you’re brave enough to build it as we enter 2026. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’re no stranger to transformation, but this month asks you to <em>release power struggles you didn’t realize you were still holding onto</em>. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th brings something hidden into full view, likely around money, sex, or trust. You may realize you’ve been overly dependent on someone else’s resources, or  you’ve been overly guarded around your own. This is the kind of lunation that makes you whisper “never again” and <em>mean it</em>. But it’s not about cutting people off — it’s about reclaiming the energy you’ve unconsciously leaked. If you’ve been stuck in a  loop around fear of loss, this moon might help you <em>choose liberation over control</em>. Pay  attention to what conversations come up around shared finances, inheritances, debt, or intimacy. The message? You don’t have to prove your power. Just live it. </p>



<p>Then comes a turning point that’s as subtle as it is seismic. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joined by Saturn — both moving forward now in the part of your life that governs joy, play, and creative expression. This is the <em>last time </em>Neptune  will move direct in Pisces in your lifetime, and with Saturn in the mix, you’re being asked to take your joy seriously. Have you been romanticizing suffering? Avoiding your true desires? Over the past 14 years, Neptune’s been dissolving illusions around who you need to be to receive love, while Saturn’s been building boundaries that protect  your heart. This month, you’re invited to honor the creative muse within, whether through art, children, romance, or unapologetic fun. Pleasure is sacred. Don’t postpone it. </p>



<p>Mid-month, your energy gets grounded in practical magic. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th sets the stage for new beginnings in your money and self-worth zone.  This is your annual opportunity to rewire your relationship to earning, spending, and valuing your time. Ask yourself: what am I <em>really </em>worth? Then ask again. If you’ve been undercharging, overworking, or waiting for external validation, this lunation helps you  plant seeds for more aligned abundance. Four days earlier, Mars, your traditional ruler, enters Capricorn, kicking off a six-week period of laser-sharp focus in your communication and planning sector. You’ll end the month writing, speaking, negotiating, editing, and strategizing your way to the next level. Ascension season is here, and 2026 will be your most brilliant year yet.  </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your month, but before the confetti starts flying, the Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th throws a sharp spotlight on your one-on-one relationships. Is there harmony or imbalance in the way you show up for others — and the way they  show up for you? Someone may reveal their true intentions, or you might realize you’ve  been dimming your brilliance to keep the peace. This is a “define the relationship” moon, whether in romance, business, or collaboration. If things have been unsaid, now’s the time to say them. And if you’ve been waiting for a cosmic green light to walk away from something that no longer aligns? This moon hands you the keys and says “Drive.” </p>



<p>Mid-month, you might feel a quiet but deeply emotional shift as Neptune and Saturn station direct in Pisces, activating your home and roots sector. These two planets have been unearthing buried stories from your lineage, resurfacing generational patterns, and reminding you that “home” is more than a place, it’s a feeling. Neptune’s final months in Pisces mark the end of a 14-year chapter of dissolving illusions around family, safety, and belonging. If you’ve felt untethered or nostalgic, these feelings might peak before clarity finally arrives. With Saturn also moving forward, you’re ready to take grounded, mature steps to create a foundation that actually supports you. Don’t ignore the urge to nest, cry, write letters you don’t send, or create altars for your ancestors. It’s healing season, even in the middle of your birthday glow up. </p>



<p>Then comes your cosmic reset. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th is your personal New Year. It’s a rare chance to rewrite your story and step into a new level of self-actualization. If you’ve been feeling like you’ve outgrown your own skin, this lunation gives you the freedom to expand into your next evolution. Reintroduce yourself… not just to others, but to <em>yourself</em>. What would it look like to truly embody your purpose without apology? What would it feel like to no longer filter your light? Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, and a powerful stellium begins activating your money and value zone. Yes, you’re the main character, but the universe wants to make sure you’re paid like it, too. Just don’t burn out trying to be everything to everyone. This month is a masterclass in pacing, presence, and potency. Be bold, but be intentional, and most importantly, be ready for the expansive gifts 2026 has in store. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the month of December begins with a cosmic cleanse. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th hits your sector of health, service, and routine, illuminating  what’s been neglected or overworked. This is the universe’s way of saying: check in before you check out. Have you been pushing yourself too hard without proper rest?  Have you fallen into habits that no longer serve the version of you you’re becoming?  Use this lunation to recalibrate. Small, consistent shifts now can lead to major upgrades later. If a job, task, or daily rhythm feels hollow, it may be time to release it. And if your body has been sending messages through fatigue or tension, this moon amplifies them so you <em>finally </em>listen. </p>



<p>The middle of the month ushers in a quiet but powerful frequency shift as Neptune and Saturn go direct in Pisces, your zone of communication and mental processing. It’s like waking up from a long dream and realizing what was fogged is now coming into view. You may have revelations about past conversations, family dynamics, or the way your inner voice talks to you. Saturn helps you get honest — even if it’s uncomfortable — while Neptune reawakens your poetic, visionary side. Writing, teaching, or sharing your  thoughts publicly could bring healing, not just for others, but for <em>you</em>. If you’ve been silencing yourself or doubting your voice, this month gives you the courage to speak from a deeper place. </p>



<p>Then, the magic begins. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th falls in your sector of surrender, dreams, and the unseen. This is your time to retreat and reset before your season begins. Rather than rushing ahead with big goals, pause. Reflect. What inner narratives need to be rewritten? What subconscious patterns are you ready to dissolve? Don’t underestimate the power of rest, ritual, and release. Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, activating your identity and willpower. The final days of the year are a portal: you’ll feel your energy shift from introspection to embodiment. A whole new you is emerging, but first, give yourself permission to integrate all that you’ve learned. What’s done is done. What’s coming is yours. Step into 2026 with quiet confidence. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, December begins with a jolt of heart-centered electricity. The Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th lights up your sector of joy, flirtation, and self-expression.  Suddenly, your inner artist, romantic, or performer is wide awake. Something you’ve  been creating or dreaming about since the summer may come full circle now — especially in your love life or creative pursuits. If you’ve been craving connection or validation, this lunation reminds you that it starts with <em>you</em>. Write that poem, take that selfie, or plan that spontaneous date. But also: notice where your inner child might still be waiting for your attention. What if play was your medicine? </p>



<p>As the month deepens, so does your relationship with security. Saturn and Neptune shifting direct in Pisces in your income and values zone marks a turning point in your financial story. Neptune’s fog lifts, so you might get clarity on where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or chasing illusions. Meanwhile your ruler Saturn brings the blueprint. This is the last chapter of a long lesson in knowing your worth and building from it. You may revisit your budget or launch a new stream of income that’s both  spiritually aligned and materially grounding. Money isn’t just about survival anymore…  it’s becoming a reflection of your energy. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th brings a wave of visionary inspiration through your sector of networks and purpose. Who are you becoming, and who’s coming with you? Whether it’s launching a digital project, joining a mission-driven group, or redefining your circle of trust, this lunation is a portal into the future. You’re redefining what “community” means and attracting people who feel like soul fam, not just followers. Set intentions that stretch beyond borders; this moon is big-picture energy, and it’s got your name on it. </p>



<p>Then comes a whisper from the deep. Mars enters Capricorn just as the sun nears your shadow sector, initiating a six-week inward journey. The Capricorn stellium starting December 21st pulls your energy toward reflection, endings, and recalibration. This isn’t  about pushing through, it’s about moving <em>with </em>your inner tides. Some of your most important work this month will be done behind the scenes, in silence, or in dreamspace. Let go of what’s expired. Release guilt about needing more space. Your season is coming, Aquarius — and when it arrives, you’ll be crystal clear on what to  leave behind and what to boldly carry forward. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, December begins with a spotlight on your roots and emotional security. The  Gemini Full Moon on December 4th electrifies your home and family sector, bringing  buried feelings to the surface and illuminating patterns you’re ready to outgrow. You might feel more sensitive than usual to your environment, especially to the words,  rhythms, and energy exchanges within your household. Maybe you’re realizing how deeply your early upbringing shaped the way you express yourself or how you navigate relationships. This is a chance to rewrite the narrative. What would it look like to feel safe <em>and </em>free? To let yourself be both soft <em>and </em>sovereign? </p>



<p>Then comes the cosmic homecoming. Both Neptune and Saturn station direct in your sign, marking a massive turning point in your self-concept and spiritual evolution. Neptune’s been with you for 14 years, and this is the final chapter of an identity dissolving, soul-rebuilding era. Saturn joined in 2023, offering structure to all the sacred mess. If you’ve felt blurry, slowed down, or extra sensitive lately, their direct motion may feel like the fog lifting from your mirror. You’ll see yourself more clearly, name what  you’ve outgrown, and remember that boundaries don’t block love… they <em>channel </em>it. </p>



<p>In the second half of the month, the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space — especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready for  your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed  I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re growing. </p>



<p>Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, followed by a Capricorn stellium that  culminates at the solstice. This energizes your friendships, community, and long-term visions. You might feel pulled to collaborate, lead a group project, or finally launch something that’s been incubating all year. But beware of burnout… not every connection is meant to be kept. Stay rooted in your values as the invitations and DMs roll in. You’re not just building momentum this month — you’re building meaningful moments. </p>



<p>And then, a surge of support arrives. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space, especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready  for your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re  growing, and 2026 is the year where some of your deepest desires manifest with ease. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945890.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /><figcaption>Getty Images. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>From November 30th to December 24th, Venus is flirting and taking chances in Sagittarius. At this point, we are seeking pleasure and adventure. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a> allows us to experience and explore the attributes of the Fire sign in a personal way, which includes honesty and directness. Plus, an optimistic outlook and approach to dating. We tend to give a lot of ourselves and bet on love. Nothing can hold us back!</p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Sagittarius might make us long to connect with others. Urging us to be adventurous and noncommittal, we are currently wanting to form connections and unions with others. The caveat is that when Venus aspects Saturn and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>, we might get caught up in the illusion or dream of another. Be cautious to recognize the red flags and trust your intuition. Saturn’s square to Venus will make us feel like we aren’t enough, which is why we have to do some internal healing to boost our confidence. Neptune’s fraught position to Venus makes us hazy and unsure of our motives, but pushes us down the rabbit hole when it comes to romantic matters.</p>



<p>Saturn’s presence could suggest a financial deficiency. Neptune’s moonwalk alongside Venus (until December 10th, when Neptune turns direct) means that we might be deceived or played with when it comes to money matters (even through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-personalities-spending-habits-explained"">an investment opportunity</a>). Be cautious not to lend money to someone you know will be unlikely to repay it on time. Keep all the receipts from holiday shopping to check if anyone is making excessive charges on your credit card that require verification. Chances are that returns are made since you may be enticed to spend beyond your budget. The best way to handle this energy is to be in control and aware of the situation.</p>



<p>The good news is that our creativity will shine brightly in the weeks ahead. These planets are highlighting our artistic senses, giving us some insight and clarity into our emotions that we need to showcase to the world. Any ventures, even if they’re hobbies, will prove to be lucrative at this time, inspiring us to take our dreams to the next level. Perhaps opening an online shop to sell our services and objects could elevate our confidence as well as our wallets. As long as we believe in ourselves, it’ll happen. </p>



<p>On a personal level, we will be called to confront the real versions of ourselves. This means that we are letting people catch a glimpse of our hearts, passions, and authentic identities, which we’ve been hiding from the world for some time, and breaking out of self-imposed ruts. Venus in Sagittarius wants us to push through to the other side and heighten our successes. We shouldn’t hold ourselves back, nor should we let others do so. Giving people a peek into our souls is going to be the best way to create openness and to feel seen. Confronting ourselves and nature will help us grow and reveal the greatest versions of ourselves. </p>



<p>Venus in Sagittarius offers us a rare glimpse into what we want and need in partnerships. We are currently writing the script, so focusing on what resonates with us on a deep level is essential. Pay attention to how you treat yourself and try to give yourself more TLC. After all, it is the most crucial relationship that you’ll ever commit to.</p>

<p>I was warned about<em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYcgQMxQwmk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hamnet</a>. </em>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a crier and that I am easily susceptible to emotional manipulation; whether it’s a schmaltzy commercial with an intergenerational storyline or a corny Hallmark movie about the healing capacity of Christmas, I will weep. So, when it comes to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/marvel-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-interview"">Chloe Zhao</a> directed, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/movies/hamnet-review.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">critically-lauded drama</a> about the loss of a child and art as a tool to cope with grief, people in my life knew that it would break me. And despite their disclaimers, it did.</p>



<p><em>Hamnet</em> unfolds slowly, telling the story of William Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/paul-mescal-normal-people-season-two"">Paul Mescal</a>) and his wife Anne Hathaway, or Agnes Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/jessie-buckley-lost-daughter-interview"">Jessie Buckley</a>) as she’s known in this adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s book <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell.html""><em>Hamnet: A Novel of the Plague</em></a>, as they fall in love and have three children including their son, Hamnet. The names Hamnet and Hamlet were often used interchangeably back then and this is O’Farrell’s interpretation of what led to Shakespeare’s masterpiece. </p>



<p>In the first half, <em>Hamnet</em> is about the tender beginnings of a relationship and the complexity of marriage. It’s about a free spirit and a neurotic writer navigating their different desires and a long-distance relationship. There are sly nods to Shakespeare’s most famous work, like the fact that William and Agnes are star-crossed lovers as he presumably scribbles down<em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/127977/romeo-and-juliet-movie-what-is-true-love""> Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> </em>by candlelight or that William’s relationship with his dad proves Shakespeare’s daddy issues were in full effect. The subtlety stops there. The second half of <em>Hamnet </em>is unflinching, a devastating portrait of the grief that accompanies unconditional love. At certain moments, <em>Hamnet</em> made me angry; I was begging for a break from the onslaught of emotional tyranny it was reigning over its audience. At others, I was grateful for its vulnerability and unabashed sentimentality. If Zhao and co. were manipulating me into crying so hard I had a headache for hours after the credits rolled, it worked. Anything that succeeds in eliciting that much emotion and draws out these extraordinary performances from two of the best actors of their generation is, to me, a triumph.  </p>



<p>When I speak to Mescal and Buckley over Zoom, they’re a lot gigglier than you may expect considering both are known for playing roles that rip your heart out and give your tear ducts a workout. They are thoughtful, polite, and playfully rib each other with the ease of old friends. Below, the Irish actors talk about the emotional weight of <em>Hamnet</em>, the first movies that made them cry, and gush about their co-star to the hilarious discomfort of the other. </p>







<p><strong>Refinery29:</strong> <strong>I’m sure you’ve gotten this a lot today but this movie fucked me <em>up</em></strong><strong>. I was sobbing hysterically by the end. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal: </strong><em>[Both laugh].</em></p>



<p><strong>I feel like people need a disclaimer that they are going to cry a lot. Can you just give a warning or any advice on how to prepare for the emotional experience of watching this film? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley: </strong>To feel is quite scary. To feel at all is scary. I think we try to control what that is in our lives and in some ways, there’s so much catharsis to connect again to the epicness of just being alive. And this film is so full of love. It’s so full of the courage to love fully and to live fully, and to lose. And anytime you choose to love, you also choose to potentially lose. You’re risking to lose somebody in your life. But I think there’s a lot of catharsis and hope and healing in this film, and you’re not on your own. There’s going to be somebody beside you who’s going to have a tissue, and they’re going to give it to you, and you’re going to have a big chat and a hug afterwards and you’re going to think<em> that was great.</em></p>



<p><strong>Paul Mescal:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>Okay, that was great! </p>



<p><strong>Make it a community experience! </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>That wasn’t my experience. I locked myself in a toilet for half an hour afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, I needed to decompress! Do either of you remember the first movie that made you cry or made you feel like this film does? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yes,<strong> </strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-35142c55-bb03-459c-8646-302379fb29b6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Darby O’Gill and the Little People </a></em>[1959]<em>. </em>Because there was a banshee and I thought that was the most terrifying thing in the whole wide world. I was inconsolable. Have you seen it? I mean, it’s not a huge hitter, it’s quite niche.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>What’s it called again? </p>



<p><strong>JB:  </strong><em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That’s not a real movie.</p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> It is a movie! </p>

<p><strong>Paul, what’s the first movie that made you cry? </strong></p>

<p><strong>JB and PM</strong><em> [in unison]</em>: The potato and the horse! </p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yeah, that made me cry.</p>

<p><strong>Well, you both made <em>me</em></strong><strong> cry. But the movie doesn’t work without your chemistry. William and Agnes are two big characters to embody and you both did so beautifully. I want to give you a moment to look at each other and gush about working with each other and what makes each other so great. </strong></p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> Jessie is just [<em>laughs</em>] — This is not just a performance of the year, this is a performance, and I’ve said this before, but this is going to be studied in drama schools. Actors around the world, if you want to see what great acting is, not only just watch <em>Hamnet</em>, watch anything that Jessie has ever been in, and you’d be well fed. And that’s all the time we have for today! [<em>laughs</em>] </p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No <em>[laughs]</em>. I feel like I’ve met somebody so significant and giant in my life in working with Paul on this. Firstly, he is absolutely… No, firstly, he has the most…  </p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>Firstly, <em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>No, no! He has such a gigantic human heart, and he’s such a team player. He holds the biggest parts of you. He can drink a case of you, and not many people can, especially co-leads. Not many people can just, with absolute care and courage, help you to tell the story. I mean this with so much sincerity and belief: he is a movie star, and he wears it — </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong><em>[nervous, uncomfortable laughter] </em></p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No, you are! You just are. It’s true for you, and that’s because you have this capacity of being a giant. You are a giant person.</p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> I am of average height <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong> <em>[laughs]</em> No, your heart is gigantic. It’s no coincidence that he’s going from playing William Shakespeare to <a href=""https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/paul-mescal-on-taking-on-shakespeare-in-hamnet-and-paul-mccartney-in-beatles-biopic"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney,</a> and being a gladiator. Not many people can manage that, and he can, and that’s because of who he is as a man.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That was lovely. </p>

<p>If minimalist nail art is more your thing, then <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mydumbnails/"">Wendy’s</a> pared-back take on festive nails will certainly appeal. There’s still glitz in the form of 3D pearls and golden rhinestones, and the petite dots of color really pop against a sheer, milky base color.

<p>If there’s one thing we can count on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers for, it’s a hyper-specific pop culture reference. For the last decade, the comedic duo have mined the deepest corners of queer cultural zeitgeist on their podcast<em> Las Culturistas</em>, which snagged iHeartRadio’s Podcast Of The Year Award in 2023. This holiday season, their new <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/index.jsp"">Marshalls</a> campaign — <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267"">It’s Giving Gifts!</a> — channels their encyclopedic archive of niche archetypes into the highest form of holiday-season community service: helping shoppers find the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">perfect present for every type of person</a> in their lives.<br /><br />From best gifts <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts/_/N-3830075267?icid=11.17.25:Marshalls:Homepage_Desktop::Its_Giving_Gifts_Block1_All"">“for the homebody who loves their sourdough starter more than you, and you have accepted that”</a> to selections for <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-made-in-italy/_/N-2758068732?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:MII"">“the cool girl who is always late and makes you think punctuality is kind of embarrassing”</a> and <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/shop/marshalls-it-s-giving-gifts-gifts-for-teens/_/N-3954653793?auxcid2=11.10.25:Marshalls:LP_Desktop:Its_Giving_Gifts:For_Teens"">“the teen who has so much drip you were left with no choice but to use the word “‘drip’ to describe them”</a> — each gift guide offers meticulously curated, cross-category selections from designer labels and beloved brands at a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">wide variety of price points</a>. <br /><br />“Saying that you love Marshalls is like ordering Diet Coke for the table,” Yang tells Refinery29 while we chat in-store at Marshalls in Manhattan. “You empower other people to say something they thought was buried: ‘Oh, wait, I’ve always loved Marshalls too.’”<br /><br />Below, Yang and Rogers share their best tips for picking the perfect gift, their most formative holiday memories, and the greatest presents they’ve ever given — and received.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>





<p><strong>Let’s talk about my personal favorite gift-guide archetype — gifts for “the cool girl who is always late and makes punctuality seem kind of embarrassing.” To reference the recurring segment on your podcast — what are the cultural moments that made this cool girl who she is today?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Bowen Yang</strong>: We all know this girl. We might even be this girl. This girl saw <em>Mean Girls</em> in theaters at least 5 times in 2004. She really imprinted on — not Romy and Michelle — but she identified with their bullies. Maybe [they identify] with Janeane Garofalo ’cause they like a quick-smoke cigarette because they have places to be and they are always late to those places.<br /><br /><strong>Matt Rogers: </strong>I would say it’s that girl from high school who you’re like: “You learned the wrong thing from Regina George.”  But… she looked good.</p>



<p><strong>There’s so many cute purses and shoes in the “cool girl” gift guide. Where is the cool girl wearing these accessories while out and about in Manhattan?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>She’s taking this to Balthazar, Carbone, the Whitney, the Circle Line Cruise so she can swing around [her purse] while the DJ plays a song on a boat. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> She’s going to take this to Zero Bond. She’s going to walk past Taylor Swift, and Taylor’s gonna go: “So sorry, where did you get that bag?” She’ll say: “Marshalls.” And she’s going to wink at Taylor, and Taylor’s gonna be like: “Travis, we gotta go. Let’s get to Marshalls.” </p>





<p><strong>Be honest, did you have any specific friends in mind when creating the “cool girl”” gift guide?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>I would say our friend Greta [Gerwig] — who we love. Greta is giving both Sabrina Carpenter and early aughts SJP, plus the dad’s girlfriend from <em>The Parent Trap</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>Yeah. Any stepmother from any movie where the stepmother comes in and is like: “It’s off to boarding school with you.” But we love that stepmother. We aspire to be her.</p>



<p><strong>For the person who just can’t decide on a gift — what picks from your gift guides do you think are the most universal crowd-pleasers?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Silk pajamas, skincare… this bag is a star. <a href=""https://www.marshalls.com/us/store/jump/product/Rhinestone-Handbag/4000410744?colorId=NS4155705&amp;pos=1:33&amp;Ntt=silver%20purse&amp;bsp=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This bag</a> has been with us the entire campaign. And I will never forget about her — she’s high impact. <br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>And you really can’t go wrong with a candle.</p>





<p><strong>You’re clearly both great gift-givers — but what about receiving? Was there a childhood gift that genuinely shaped who you are today</strong><br /><br /><strong>Rogers: </strong>This was the year that PlayStation 2 came out. I was a video game kid — Bowen Yang still is — and I really wanted that PS2. And they were like: “You’re not getting it. It’s too expensive and no one can get it.” And then on Christmas day, I kept opening up PS2 games, and I was like: “Well, I guess you got me the games for one day when I get the system, right?” They were like: “Exactly, one day when you get the system.” Low and behold, the last gift hiding under the couch was the PS2, and I was a very happy boy.<br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Mine was after <em>Batman Forever </em>came out. I had a Batgirl, Alicia Silverstone action figure — that really spoke to me and has since. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the most unexpected place you’ve ever spent the holidays?</strong><br /><br /><strong>Yang: </strong>Someone in my family recently pitched, out of nowhere: “What about Scottsdale this Christmas?” I said: “What about it? We don’t know anybody there.” No shade to Scottsdale it’s just like… why would we go there? <br /><br /><strong>Rogers:</strong> I will be doing a Tampa Christmas because my parents snowbird down there. People who know me are like: “Matt Rogers, Florida for Christmas, checks out.”</p>





<p><strong>What are your favorite types of gifts to give? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Yang: </strong>Candles are a go-to. I think we’re finally, as a culture, coming out of the stigma around candles as gifts. For a while there, it was like: “Oh, you got a candle? How impersonal.” No. No one’s gonna turn down a candle.</p>



<p><strong>Rogers: </strong>I really hit the jackpot one year when I realized that I could get bespoke drink coasters and customize them for my friends. So I got coasters with different pop stars on them and I gave them to all my friends for the pop star that they stan. And I do think that was my best idea and now I have to think of something else creative.</p>

rss,www.refinery29.com,https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/movies-about-thanksgiving?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss,1764176738,"There Are A Few Thanksgiving Movies, Actually","There Are A Few Thanksgiving Movies, Actually

You can probably think of ten Christmas movies off the top of your head, but when it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/11/180821/thanksgiving-movies-on-netflix"">Thanksgiving movies</a>, that's not so easy. Even though, like Christmas, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/11/10172292/thanksgiving-alone"">Thanksgiving is a holiday when people spend hours</a> sitting around doing nothing but eating, but there aren't many feel-good Thanksgiving-specific movies to watch while you're doing all that sitting around. Make us some genuine Turkey Day rom-coms, Hollywood!<br /><br />Until that happens, there are actually <em>some</em> Thanksgiving movies out there. We've rounded up 14 of them, ranging from movies that are actually Thanksgiving-focused to good movies that that merely contain Thanksgiving scenes, to one that is definitively <em>not</em> about Thanksgiving because it definitively <em>is</em> about the mob. We have our reasons; just hear us out.<br /><br />But don't expect to get too many of the warm and cozy feelings with these Thanksgiving movies, like you do with Christmas films. A lot of them are about estranged family members and fights at the dinner table, whether they're dramas or comedies or some mix of the two. But, hey, maybe something a little emotional and relatable is what you need during this stressful time of year. <br /><br />If not, there's also a superhero movie on this list. In case you didn't know, Spider-Man eats Thanksgiving dinner, too. <figure><figcaption><h2><em>Addams Family Values</em></h2>Hear us out. Sure, <em>Addams Family Values </em>isn't fully about Thanksgiving, but it does have one of the most <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We_Ztqv9FJU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">iconic Thanksgiving scenes</a> in movie history. During a Thanksgiving play at Camp Chippewa, Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and her friends go rogue and decide to adapt their counselor's script to more accurately depict the real events that led to Thanksgiving and in true Wednesday fashion, mayhem ensues. If you love Wednesday on Netflix, this season is the perfect time to revisit this classic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Pieces of April</h3></em><br />Let's start with a movie that is explicitly about Thanksgiving. Katie Holmes stars in 2003's <em>Pieces of April</em>, a dramedy about a young woman who invites her estranged family to Thanksgiving dinner in her New York City apartment. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Holidate </h3></em><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">Holidate</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10132405/holidate-netflix-emma-roberts-rom-com-lead"">, which was dropped on Netflix</a> this year, is a Thanksgiving movie because it's an every holiday movie. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey star as two people who pretend to be dating at every holiday gathering that they're invited to in order to avoid questions about being single. Of course, they start to actually have feelings for each other. It's not great, but it's the closest we've got to a Thanksgiving rom-com right now.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sweet November</em></h2><br />Who doesn't love some romance and emotional manipulation over the holidays? <em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/60004446"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sweet November</a></em>, starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron, may have been panned by critics when it came out in 2001, but it's got a cult following of fans who love the sweet story of an overworked, selfish workaholic (Reeves) who falls for a free spirit (Theron) after moving in together for the month of November. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Oath</h3></em><br /><em>The Oath</em> is a comedy about a family who gets together for Thanksgiving just as the U.S. asks residents to sign a ""Patriot's Oath."" Things get more unhinged from there. Ike  Barinholtz, who also wrote and directed, and Tiffany Haddish star.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Home for the Holidays</h3></em><br /><em>Home for the Holidays</em> stars Holly Hunter as a single mom who visits her family for Thanksgiving after losing her job. Her wacky relatives include Robert Downey Jr. as her brother and Anne Bancroft as her mother. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Friendsgiving</h3></em><br />A group of friends — and a sassy mom played by Jane Seymour — get together at a big, gorgeous house for a Thanksgiving full of drinking and innuendos. Malin Åkerman, Aisha Tyler, Kat Dennings, Chelsea Peretti, and more make up the ensemble cast. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Miracle on 34th Street </h3></em><br />Yes, <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em> is a classic Christmas movie, but it's also technically a Thanksgiving movie since it starts with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The story about the parade's Santa (Edmund Gwenn) claiming to actually be the real Santa continues from there.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</h3></em><br />Steve Martin stars in <em>Planes,</em> <em>Trains and Automobiles</em> as a man who is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving, but due to a flight issue, ends up stuck with a traveling salesman (John Candy). They set off on an adventure filled with hijinks as they try to make their way to Chicago.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Krisha</h3></em><br />If you're in the mood for something dark this Thanksgiving, look no further than <em>Krisha</em>. It stars director Trey Edward Shults actual aunt Krisha Fairchild as a woman suffering from addiction, who visits her family for Thanksgiving after years of being estranged.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Ice Storm</h3></em><br />1995's <em>The Ice Storm </em>features all sorts of drama taking place during one family's Thanksgiving weekend in 1973. There's young love, an affair, a key party, and more. Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Kevin Kline, Joan Allen, and Sigourney Weaver star.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>Spider-Man</h3></em><br /><em>Spider-Man</em>? A Thanksgiving movie? That's right. In 2002's <em>Spider-Man</em> (that's the Tobey Maguire one), <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYL9aKsb4ro"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">there is a scene</a> in which Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) holds Thanksgiving dinner and Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin very menacingly prepares to carve the turkey. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>For Your Consideration </h3></em><br /><em>For Your Consideration</em> is a mockumentary about the production of a horrible-looking movie and the Oscar buzz it generates. The melodramatic movie they're making ends up being titled <em>Home for Thanksgiving</em>. You see, it's a stretch, but the Thanksgiving theme is still there. Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, and Harry Shearer star. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><em><h3>The Godfather</h3></em><br />Lastly, we have a very Thanksgiving-y movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the holiday. <em>The Godfather </em>has become a Thanksgiving movie thanks to it being <a href=""https://crimereads.com/how-the-godfather-became-an-unlikely-holiday-classic/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">played on TV all day long</a> on Turkey Day for years. This year, you can <a href=""https://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-godfather/tv-listings/124688/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">check out the marathon</a> on BBC America.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>

Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C serums</a> leave skin feeling itchy and red, but <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8’s C-Tetra</a> is built differently. It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p>This isn’t your average <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/hydr8-b5"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hyaluronic acid serum</a>. It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>
