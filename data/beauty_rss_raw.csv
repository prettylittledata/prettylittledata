<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941439.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>

In November, the veil between the living and spirit realms is thin. This traditionally is a prime opportunity for us to tune into the silence and grasp the guidance that is being given to us through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">our ancestors</a> and spirit allies. Between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> and Gede Season, spirit reminds us that death is not an ending but an additional chapter in our lives. It’s a new beginning of sorts. <br /><br /> This month, our task is to listen to the direction we are being pointed to. This will help us sharpen our intuitive and psychic gifts that we’ve inherited from our ancestors and surrender to whatever is meant to shed from our lives so that a new beginning can arise. This is a time to celebrate your lineage, pour libations, and embody the prayers that made you possible. November’s tarotscopes will grant you clarity on your next steps during this season.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941368.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />This month is an emotional rebirth. Prepare to embody a more mature and abundant you. The ancestors and guides are pouring into you, whether that is through mirroring to you your truth and magnificence, providing juicy opportunities that will have your cup overflowing, or giving you the space to process your emotions and release in a safe way. Allow your heart to lead you. You’ve spent enough time surviving; now it’s time to receive. The Ace of Cups opens a new cycle of intimacy with yourself, your spirit, and the people who see you clearly. Don’t overthink. Let whatever is coming up to flow. What’s meant for you won’t require force. Your ancestors are blessing this new beginning. Drink from it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941369.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />This season implores you to slow down, milk the present moment, and seek the portal to all possibilities by enjoying the luxuries you have now. Find ways to devote to yourself versus rushing onto your next destination or attempting to control outcomes you have no control over. You are the wealth and success that you seek, so you do not chase something you already are. You are being asked to be disciplined on the homework your spirit guides have appointed to you. If you know doing something is for your betterment, commit to it. Be consistent. Everything you do, act on, say, think, and believe is sacred work. You are powerful. Focus on alignment and precision. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941370.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 7 of Wands<br /></strong><br />Your ancestors are fighting for you.

Have you taken the time to thank them and to honor them? Have you considered what incredible qualities and characteristics you’ve inherited from them that you have yet to leverage? This season is about fighting back and ensuring that you will no longer play small or be taken for granted. Enough is enough. It’s time that you show the world what you are made of. Are you going to be a victim and just accept life’s circumstances as if you have no power of your own? Or will you invoke the flames of your ancestors to accept what is rightfully yours and enjoy every minute of it? </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941371.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: Justice<br /></strong><br />Behind the scenes, your ancestors are ensuring that justice is paid off and that the scales are balancing in your favor.

Prepare for the plot twist of your life and for a new chapter to emerge with more clarity than ever. Remain in integrity with yourself and the spirit realm. If you say you will do something, do it. If you receive benevolent guidance that will accelerate your life, act on it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941372.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 6 of Swords</strong><br /><br />You’ve got the green light to move on. You are being supported by the spirit realm to make this transition and shed that energetic weight with as least resistance as possible. Anything that has been making you stuck or showing no progress, will now be alleviating itself from your life. Your ancestors are guiding the boat now, steering you toward calmer waters. Don’t look back out of guilt or nostalgia. What’s ahead is peace, clarity, and spiritual renewal. Trust the transition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941373.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: The Star</strong><br /><br />It is safe to believe again. Prior to this month, you might have questioned your desires and possibility of you actually attaining them. You may have questioned the route you are taking and whether or not you are on the right path. This season you will be shown just how aligned you are. Your ancestors are lighting the path ahead, showing you what’s possible when you believe again. This is your season to rebuild your faith, not from fantasy but from alignment with your higher purpose. You are blessed and highly favored. It is time to believe and pour into yourself so heavily that no other assumption exists. Allow yourself to shine because it is your identity. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941374.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: 4 of Swords</strong><br /><br />Rest is sacred work, and it holds the key to you attracting all that you need. The guides want you to slow down and intentionally implement old and new ways of relaxing and resting because that's how they get to speak directly to you without resistance. You need to be open and receptive to the guidance that wants to stream through. The information and downloads you receive this month are paramount to your evolution in life. Call your energy back to you and engage in practices that bring your awareness back into your body. Catch how many times your consciousness begins to wander somewhere outside of you and gently pull it back. Pause because clarity comes in stillness. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941375.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: 5 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You’re being asked to let go. Stop replaying what didn’t work or who didn’t stay. Something more glorious and aligned is on the horizon, but grief is keeping you from tapping into it. Give your sorrows, frustrations, and angst to your ancestors. Allow the emotions to be fully felt and embraced, but don’t hang onto them too long that they become a hindrance. This season, choose acceptance over attachment and seek peace. Mourn and release. Then lift your head, because the blessings ahead need your full presence and anticipation, not your pain.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941376.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 10 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />This season is about cementing your legacy through bold quantum moves. You’re not just acting from this timeline but from four timelines above it. Envision the person who already has what they want: what would that version want, and what would that other version want, and so on and so forth. Act from that space because leaping above the mundane is what’s going to set you apart and rapidly accelerate the attainment of your desires. You are not making yourself proud but breaking barriers for your entire lineage. The abundance is overflowing from you because you are secure in the embodiment of it. The amount of value you exude and provide is tremendous. Know that you are the answered prayer and everything you do moving forward will expand. Celebrate yourself and how far you’ve come. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941377.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 2 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You are being invited to learn more about yourself through your interactions and relationships with others. Your ancestors are sending mirrors: people and situations showing you how you give and receive love. Take notes. This is a time to consider if you have been providing the right energy that will foster supportive harmonious relationships and if you’ve been poured into as well from the other end. This is an optimal opportunity to allow old dynamics to shed and transform into beneficial supportive partnerships but also to call in new community and relationships that you desire. Prepare for the truth to be revealed to you and don’t run from it. Lead with your heart. You’ll know what to do. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941378.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: The Sun <br /></strong><br />You are the center of your own universe and the source of all abundance, so move like it. This is your glow up season where all eyes are on you, but, most importantly, you are shining on yourself like no other. This period is going to bring visibility, praise, recognition, joy, creative expansion, orgasms, and the successful results of doing the inner work and embodying your highest timeline. The ancestors are celebrating you and clearing the path so you are free to live your best life and, through example, show others that they can do it, too. Trust that so much is coming your way, and you will be perpetually making room for it all. You deserve it all.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941379.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Luxury is your birthright. Don’t you forget it! There are so many ways that you will choose to indulge in luxury this season that it becomes the baseline and the standard of your reality. Your ancestors are reminding you where you come from and how to shift struggle and turn it into gold. Your ability to generate abundance will be evident by the way you glow and live your life. You’ve cultivated this season of abundance through discipline, healing, and divine timing, so enjoy it! Don’t shrink your shine or apologize for your success or for choosing joy over suffering. Dress well, move with grace, and own your softness as power. You are walking proof that self-worth attracts everything.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941401.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Every year, when Venus enters Scorpio, we dive headfirst into our passions. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio is an intense water sign</a> that instantly knows what it wants. The intuition of Scorpio is fire, leading us to align with those at our level by forming close relationships with them. When Venus is in Scorpio, the romantic planet becomes slightly more seductive and goes after what it wants, encouraging our affections to reach a feverish pitch. We do not settle for anything less than we deserve, as we know to shoot for the stars and beyond. The caveat is that we can get competitive, since our ambitions take center stage. Calming this part of ourselves will be challenging — especially with this season’s cosmic line-up. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-2024-meaning-effects"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is adding to the swampiness of the next several weeks. Since we are already in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>, the connection to Mercury retrograde in Scorpio, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, and Saturn and Neptune retrograde in Pisces is tapping into our emotions and the past. It’ll be hard to escape the present ramifications of our former decisions, urging us to be more reflective. As a result, we may spend time alone, ruminating over our choices and trying to forge a new path forward. The one positive thing is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the signs in the water element</a> keep us going; however, most planets are retrograde, making us feel like we are paddling against the current flow of energy. The best way to handle the vibe is to stop working hard relentlessly for the future and to be present. Water can heal and soothe our pain if we let it.</p>



<p>There could be moments of enlightenment during Venus’s stint in Scorpio. Having a discerning eye during the New Moon in Scorpio on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November</a> 20 urges us to break free from situations and relationships holding us back. Releasing people, whether by unfollowing them on social media or keeping a safe distance, will make us lighter. Carrying around resentments and jealousies isn’t emotionally healthy, so it’s ideal to do a cleansing to ensure we can mend our hearts. Remember, this may take a while. There is no timeline for recovery. Everyone is different and does what works with their own methods. <br /><br />Watch out for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-support-partner-with-ptsd"">trauma bonding</a> at this time because we might align with those going through parallel experiences. Although the instant reaction is to assume that they are our spiritual counterpart, the relationship will shift when Mercury turns direct on November 29 and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30 (these dates are markers for specific cycles’ ending). The lesson is to maintain boundaries and not to blur lines. Staying in our lanes is advisable to ensure we do not become upset when the rapport dissipates. Therefore, it’s best to discuss our baggage with a therapist, close friends, or family members who will be by our side through thick and thin. <br /><br />Words of wisdom: From November 6 to 30, while Venus is swimming in the deep end of the ocean in the enigmatic and provocative sign of Scorpio, make sure to do something nice for yourself. Whether buying a cute pair of shoes, driving to the countryside to bask in the beautiful foliage, or reading an exciting book. The celestial waves of Venus in Scorpio are bringing change, which means putting ourselves first. More importantly, becoming obsessed with ourselves because we are fabulous in our own unique ways.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940839.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I caught up with celebrity and editorial makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/?hl=en"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> in L.A. while she was in glam-tour mode with Dua Lipa, and we went deep on career longevity, the internet’s role in her rise, and why her namesake line, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-hyper-shine-high-lite-kit-review"">KJH Brand</a>, is built to teach—not just “trend.”</p>



<p>When I asked how posting changed her bookings, Katie didn’t hesitate. Early on, when legacy shoots felt out of reach, she treated her feed like a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/224876/katie-jane-hughes-makeup-artist-instagram-interview"">living portfolio</a>. “My page became my editorial,” she told me, a place to set her own brief, show technique, and get discovered by celebrity teams. She still swears by artists sharing work on themselves; it demystifies the process for clients and doubles as a lookbook they can point to on set.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Instagram became my editorial.”</p><cite>kATIE JANE HUGHES</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Teaching-first beauty (and the case against heavy primer)</h2>



<p>If you follow Katie, you know the mantra: <strong>skin should look like skin</strong>, even with coverage and color. One of my favorite corrections she made to my routine is simple brushwork: <strong>press and tap</strong> product in instead of swiping it around. And while she’s not anti-primer, Katie believes “priming starts with skincare,” emphasizing the importance of cleanser, moisturizer, and smart layering over extra steps.</p>



<h2>Why she built KJH Brand</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940847.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I asked what pushed her to create a line when her career was already thriving. Her answer: <strong>Education</strong>. Every formula is designed to be teachable and multi-use, with adjustable application for different skin types. Her <a href=""https://kjhbrand.com/products/soft-smudge-lip-cheek?variant=49496738627895"">Soft Smudge Blush</a> (I love the shade Soft Raisin) took years to perfect—it gives that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">diffused, powdery-meets-creamy payoff</a> that stays put and doubles on lips with a balm or serum. She also let me play with <strong>Precision</strong> micro-contour crayons for underpainting eyes and lips, plus a <strong>clear brow gel</strong> that she describes, simply, as “a damn good brow gel”, no gimmicks, just hold and flexibility.</p>



<h2>Inclusive shade thinking, from deep to fair</h2>



<p>We talked shade development, and I loved her philosophy: <strong>start deeper and work to fair</strong>. “If it works on melanated complexions, you can always shear it down,” Katie said, pushing brands to build equity into product design—not tack it on at the end. Her PD process includes testing across tones and tapping makeup artists of color on the core team.</p>



<h2>Retail dreams, startup reality</h2>



<p>KJH Brand is self-funded so far, and Katie’s considering <strong>Sephora</strong> for 2026—whether to debut on a smaller discovery shelf or go big with a full bay that tells the brand story. It’s thrilling and terrifying, she admitted; beauty ops mean long lead times, lots of POs, and real capital discipline. Her husband, <strong>Tarek</strong>, runs the finance side. As founders, they’re learning to set boundaries, take 15-minute walks, and communicate like a true startup.</p>





<h2>Getting over color fear</h2>



<p>Katie wants more of us playing with color—<strong>starting small</strong>. Try a mossy green or rust liner, a single wash of berry on the lid, or a taupe-y contour crayon as a subtle lip overliner (“aim for your <em>volume</em> lip line, not just the pigmented border”). And her reminder I cosign: it’s makeup. It washes off.</p>



<h2>What’s exciting her right now</h2>



<p>We swapped innovation picks during our chat. On the list: the new <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yummy-skin-liquid-blurring-balm-mattifying-setting-spray-P516894"">Danessa Myricks</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yummy-skin-liquid-blurring-balm-mattifying-setting-spray-P516894""> blurring setting spray</a> that leaves a soft-focus finish; <strong><a href=""https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow-arch?&amp;variant=45591166517493"">Glossier’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow-arch?&amp;variant=45591166517493""> ultra-precise brow pencil</a> with a built-in sharpener; <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yeux-paint-liquid-eyeshadow-liner-P515452"">Violette_FR’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yeux-paint-liquid-eyeshadow-liner-P515452""> buildable eye paints</a> (that royal-blue moment!); <strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/fara-homidi-essential-face-compact-refillable-concealer-and-foundation-P511747"">Fara Homidi’s</a></strong><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/fara-homidi-essential-face-compact-refillable-concealer-and-foundation-P511747""> dual-finish concealer/balm compact</a> for custom coverage; and a <strong><a href=""https://www.dermstore.com/p/is-clinical-reparative-moisture-emulsion/11287899/"">new reparative moisturizer from iS Clinical</a></strong> that makes every base sit better.</p>







<p>When I asked when she feels most beautiful, Katie said it’s when she has an hour to herself to create something bold and share it with her community. It tracks: the career, the content, the company—<strong>teach, experiment, include</strong>, and make skin look like skin.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941254.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Amidst the planetary changes this week, a Supermoon illuminates the sky on November 5. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/full-moon-names-spiritual-meaning"">Super Full Beaver Moon</a> in Taurus is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-harvest-moon-in-aries-horoscope-october-2025"">second Supermoon of the year</a>, making the Moon appear bigger and brighter than usual, since it’s hanging closer to our planet than usual. At the same time, the Southern and Northern Taurid meteor showers peak, allowing us to wish upon a star — also, an auspicious moment to manifest our dreams for the future. This is a magical time to think about our heartfelt sentiments and transcend at our own pace.<br /><br />The Full Moon in Taurus connects with the Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo lunar axis, which means that fate is at hand and our decisions will affect our future in many ways, particularly our love lives. If a relationship needs leveling up or is ending, this might be the time to commit to a direction we wish to take. On the other hand, we might meet people who will play an essential role in our future, so hop on the dating apps or ask a friend for a set-up to connect with someone special.</p>



<p>The day before and after the Supermoon, Mars is quite busy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">The “warrior planet” moves into Sagittarius</a> on November 4, aspecting Uranus retrograde in Gemini the same day. We’ll show off our unique nature and visions on the 4th, which we want to manifest into reality on the 6th, when Mars and Pluto in Aquarius link up. As a result, our rizz will intensify, urging us to go for who or what makes us happy. <br /><br />Venus changes signs from Libra to Scorpio on November 6, deepening our lust for life and others. This planetary placement encourages us to dive headfirst into romance without looking back. With the minor connections Venus is making to Uranus and Neptune retrograde on the 6th, we might be apt to be consumed with love. Remember that Mercury retrograde commences on the 9th, but we are still in the pre-retrograde zone, so an ex could come back and begin to charm us. Regardless of what happens, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">the cosmos are setting the stage for warmth and tenderness</a>.</p>



<p>Even though this is a super chill and calm Full Moon, the energy can be excitable and erratic for most of us, due to the proximity of the Moon to the Earth. Therefore, we should do grounding activities such as connecting to the Earth. Feeling our senses fill our bodies, savoring tastes, recognizing the sense of touching luxurious fabrics, and hearing relaxing sounds to make us feel calmer. We will be able to find a moment of calm in the world. Self-care is also a key theme, so booking the facial that has been on our wish list is vital. Take a long autumnal walk in the park. Treating ourselves is a suggestible act — get the fancy latte in the morning and don’t feel guilty about the cost. Do you!<br /><br />Another aspect of this lunation is to embrace fun and pleasure. The Full Moon in Taurus brings a “bring and eat, drink, and be merry” vibe, heightening our desire for indulgence. As a result, we should step into the vitality of life and embrace the comforts surrounding us by listening to good music, being with positive and uplifting pals, enjoying a fantastic spread of food, and unapologetically tapping into our hedonistic passions. All of the wonderful merriments of life are at our fingertips, which is why we should lean into them. Be present and fall into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/128990/supermoon-november-2016-beaver-full-moon-rituals"">the lovely energy of the Supermoon</a>. </p>



<p>The intoxicating energy of the Supermoon will lead us to our most genuine sentiments and yearnings. Once we’ve tasted sweetness, our thirst for more may increase. The expectations we have for the future may go beyond what we get — but in the end, we will be delighted with what we receive. We can’t always get what we want (exceptionally high); however, we will come close enough to satisfy our needs and attain greatness the following day. The universe gives us more than we ever hoped, so don’t fuss and drink it up. Let the optimism flow. Do not take anything or anyone for granted — show them you care.</p>

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. The sale is officially open to the public as of November 4, and <em>all</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glam-flexstyle-for-straight-to-wavy-hair-in-french-gold-P519274"">Shark Glam™ Hot Tool Air Styling &amp; Drying System</a>, $449</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940138.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>We<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review""> reviewed Shark’s FlexFusion</a> last year, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. This year, we’re eyeing the Glam —Shark’s latest innovation, which includes curling barrels, a smoothing brush, finishing tool, straightener, and a concentrator nozzle to achieve a variety of looks.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-cheat-lip-liner-P433516?skuId=2765618"">Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Lip Liner</a>, $26</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940228.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Charlotte Tilbury’s iconic Lip Cheat pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. From the iconic Pillow Talk rosy nude to rich reds, this makeup artist-favorite liner is a lip combo essential.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/patrick-ta-major-headlines-cream-powder-blush-duo-P458747"">Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème &amp; Powder Blush Duo</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940112.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta’s blushes are still among Sephora’s bestsellers, and with more shade duos than ever, don’t miss out on restocking (or picking up a fresh shade for fall) at a rare discount.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glazing-milk-P519160?skuId=2898419"">Rhode Glazing Milk</a>, $32</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940176.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever. If you can only choose one product, make it the Glazing Milk essence, which is perfect for adding extra hydration as the weather cools down.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/advent-calendar-us-P518496?skuId=2907772"">Sephora Collection Advent Calendar</a>, $55</h2>

<p>This blockbuster advent calendar by Sephora Collection is 30% off during the entire duration of the Holiday Savings Event, bringing the price tag down to $38.50. With a value of $163.50 in products, this is a serious steal that we predict won’t stay in stock for long.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lightwork-vii-the-freedom-makeup-palette-P518415"">Danessa Myricks Beauty LIGHTWORK VII The Freedom Makeup Palette</a>, $128</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940117.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P517217"">LORE Disfruta Eau de Parfum</a>, $88</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940102.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>



<h2 id=""modal2Title""><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/summer-fridays-the-holiday-trio-set-hot-coco-toasted-marshmallow-lbb-mini-jlm-P518536?skuId=2902054&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p518536:product"">Summer Fridays The Holiday Trio Set</a>, $48</h2>
