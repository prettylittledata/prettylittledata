My wife always leaves the hair dryer to cool down like this all day and I see no real other option as there no room on the walls for hooks. Any ideas? Also there is no outlet on the other side of the sink

It doesn‚Äôt need to cool down. Unplug and put in the cabinet when done. It can cool there
If her hair dryer is getting hot enough that it need cooling down before putting it away, she needs a new one.
Extender cord behind the cupboard there. Use commander strips or drill it on to put it on the side closer to the wall snd mirror and chose one thats safe for bathrooms and humidity.

And use a hook to hang the hairdryer on beside it
You get 3d printed holders for hairdryers too that can be used.

SOLUTION,, run the cord behind the cabinet and purchase a hairdryer holder
Buy her a wall mounted hairdryer with a coiled or retractable cord. Hang it on the side of the cabinet.
Mount this on the wall in the space between the mirror and the cabinet. https://bodpeace.com/products/wall-mounted-bathroom-hair-dryer-holder-in-bright-white?currency=USD&variant=47084828950683&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&stkn=bbbaae828239&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22958523117&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0NPGBhCDARIsAGAzpp1qIY6FzKb0QvdNp2GBBDD3dg-6CeNhT7PtUoN9_te2ucSAQfIUvikaAlugEALw_wcB

Ok so why did my dumb ass never notice the 1/2 inch gap along the side and back until your comment

Now I just need to figure a way to make the cord situation less messy and hook it on the wall. Some dryer with a retractable cord would be nice
But where would I attach it? I of course did think of that but by the plug would make the cabinet doors not open and next to the mirror would have a cord hanging across. I do admit that I might just have to accept the cord hanging
Ya look at the pic I commented
Or just put a hook on the side of your cabinet for it?
Woop! Its long enough for thatüôå 
As the other person who replied here, add a hook for the dryer
 Look up appliance cord keeper, or cord organiser, theres many options that keep cords neat and are easy to use.
The side of the cabinet next to where it already sits?"

I like these pillows but something is telling me they are clashing with the couch. (Also is the plaid green or gray? lol). Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

I would pick an art piece or rug before pillows. When you are ready for pillows, buy ones that coordinate but don't match. No two-packs that are identical. Pillows aren't like earrings, they are like bracelets. 

Yes, the colors coordinate with what you have going on, but I would pick bigger accessories first.
The pillows look great but I am curious why they are tied up?
Love the pillows and they look great against the dark grey couch.
I like it!  Fun fact, Amazon sells inexpensive pillow covers for just about any size pillow in some amazing colors and prints. You can change them out as often as you want üòä
Get a mustard yellow throw for the couch, it'll brighten it right up
*I know someone is going to call out the no curtains thing. Would you get short curtains to not block the AC unit or longer ones to cover it?
Yes, the orange is perfect.
The pillows are nice and it's a great start!  Now look for a large art piece with that orange/terracotta color in it.  Place it above the couch and it will instantly brighten the space.
The pillows are nice! I‚Äôd get a rug too, that‚Äôll help a lot!

Outside mount Roman shade. The windows look very deeply set. You won‚Äôt be able to open the windows entirely, but 3/4 of the way would work. You have to suffer for fashion. üòú
What are you wanting the window treatment for? 

Aesthetics, light control, temperature management, privacy? 

Get clear on the goal before you find a solution that fits the space but doesn‚Äôt effectively accomplish your goal. 

If you just want privacy and light control, a good-quality window film would be the easiest. (Don‚Äôt cheap out and get the cheap garbage on Amazon, you‚Äôll suffer in the install. Just learned this the hard way, lol.)
These look nice! Do you think I would I be able to mount them on the window frame above/to the side to avoid blocking the window or do you think the only way would be mounting within the frame and partially blocking the window?
Thanks for the feedback! A combination of things- mainly, I‚Äôd like to block out the sun in the summer to help control temperature, and have privacy at night, but would like to keep the option to see out the window during the day when it‚Äôs not super hot, so I don‚Äôt think the films would meet the bill. I feel like the odd window configuration is limiting so I may need to compromise on a few things so just trying to get a better understanding of what‚Äôs even possible because I have about zero baseline knowledge in this area.
I would mount the shade on the far top corners of the outer frame. Part of the shade will block the very top of the window when open, but if you choose a shade with a very tight stack it shouldn‚Äôt block too much.

Soft smoky blue. The colors you chose are too bold (but if you chose that shocking pink they aren‚Äôt too bold to you). I do not understand this ‚Äúpaint everything green‚Äù trend. Green is a polarizing paint color and the shade is hard to get just right. I would avoid green in a bathroom. It makes people look jaundiced in the mirror. üòú
Something ‚Äútraditional‚Äù, blue or green would be really nice. At the paint store, you know how they have swatches divided into ‚Äúcollections‚Äù? Find the one that fits the age of your home and take inspiration there.

I‚Äôd go for green, similar to the shade in the photo. Don‚Äôt go too dark a shade as the lack of window means no natural light.

A nice sunshiney yellow colour could look really good too!
I have a very similar bathroom. 

When we moved in it was yellow tile with black accents and then the yellow and black floor. I looked for a shower curtain that I liked that would simultaneously turn down the yellow not also give hints of it. I ended up with a gray curtain with yellow and white outlines of flowers. I then used a slightly darker gray on the walls. It actually turned out really nice. 

When we remodeled the bathroom I kept the same overall look meaning I replaced the yellow tile that was nasty and broken in spots with white subway tile but still only had it going up the walls about halfway. I again found a shower curtain I liked - this once blue and black sea monster tentacles lol and painted the walls a really vibrant blue  and did all the decor in mostly black and white and sea monster type art. It sounds awful but it turned out really nice! Lol

TLDR - Find a shower curtain you really like and play your colors off that.
If you want blue, Check out BM glass slipper.

A light sage green or a soft buttery yellow could look great with the floors and bring some light into the space.
I would say a light yellow or green.
Oh my God, I absolutely adore your bathroom! Not sure if that‚Äôs original tiling or a Renault but it looks great. Considering the era of the bathroom, I would choose a paint color that compliments that era. I‚Äôm thinking something along the lines of seafood green.

Why do i want yellow??? Feel like it would loom good but has to be the right shade
Celestial or pastel blue
The lightbulbs should be as warm as you can get. Current warmest lightbulbs are still bluer than incandescent bulbs.
sage green
I like the idea of a soft green-y blue- the current samples are still a bit too vivid imo.
Check out colors like Woodlawn  Blue or Palladian Blue by Benjamin Moore. They are soft, subdued, but still have plenty of color.
Tip- order the large peal and stick pre painted samples online instead of sample pots. You will be glad you did!
Try homedecor app, u can uplaod a picture and ask it to change the color and u see it before u do it its insane.

Black
Keep the light bulbs.
Greeeen
How about keeping it simple and a very light shade of grey?  It‚Äôs very neutral and that way your new tenants can decorate to their own taste?
A light orange.
Dusty rose pink
Benjamin Moore‚Äôs Orange Juice.
Benjamin Moore‚Äôs Orange Juice. IMO this bathroom cries out for bold color. The light soft colors people are suggesting are offputting to me.
Gray
I second this! Green and brown are two colors I don't want to see when I'm staring at the wall during a bout of intestinal cramping. Blue or even a gray or purple would be more soothing.
Yes! Try Behr Winter Veil or Farrow & Ball Pavilion. It's a sea glass blue perfect for this.
Oh, a [robins egg blue](https://www.hausmatter.com/shop/robins-egg-blue-paint-color)would be very nice. I‚Äôm in the minority with the group disagreeing with green. I‚Äôd get sick of it so fast.

Hi! 

I‚Äôm wanting to paint my powder room- I‚Äôm sick of the blue!  Which color do you prefer? It‚Äôs obviously a small space but I want more color than this pastel blue.  The vanity is gray. 

Thanks! 

I prefer the mauve/pink shade of the two, but I think these are both too saturated. I also don‚Äôt love either with the orangey wood to the left in the photo. If that‚Äôs a permanent fixture in your powder room, I‚Äôd find other options.
I think the dusky rose colour is lovely
I vote for a lighter version of the pink. 

And as a side note: check the level of your vanity, you may need to shim it level so the doors will align. Or adjust the door hinges so they hang straight, if they have adjustment screws. 

Color choices are so difficult, I hope you find one you‚Äôre happy with. I needed to pick paint quickly to be able to install the toilet and ended up with the most bland beige bathroom. But it‚Äôs good enough for now.
Very popular to have dark colours in powder rooms currently (painter and decorator here) I prefer the pink.
neither of these colors they are too dark for a small bathroom. Look at Sherwin williams  spearmint is a preety green light enough to keep the bathroom from  looking too small.
I am always team green but this mauve color is üòç
Neither. Too dark, too weird. Risky move, but if you are up for repainting when it turns out wrong, go for it.
Neither one. Sorry
I really don't like green walls in any room you're likely to check make-up in.
,, DEPENDS,, are you an intense person that consumes large amounts of caffeine? Go with the Red.. 

Relaxed, Zen like,, low stress? Go with Green
I like them both but I really love the mauve color
I prefer the mauve too, but I would love to see a darker blue like the painting in the hallway. (I personally love darker wall colors in small rooms)
I agree with the comments re: darkness, but absolutely adore that mauve. I'd just do it 2-3 shades lighter.
Absolutely favoring the pink, and it will go well with the existing cabinetry.


I'd recommend a shade or two lighter. I recently painted my bedroom Sherwin Williams Resounding Rose, it's a bit warmer than your mauve but that's yhe depth I'm suggesting because it's bold without feeling like a cave.
I was told years ago that green in bathrooms makes you look sickly in the mirror. Not sure I agree that all shades of green would, but this one might.
Have you considered wallpaper? A powder room is a fun place to get brave and do something completely unexpected.
I see Mauve and think 80s.
Is there another option?
My powder room is the red color but it‚Äôs a textured wallpaper. I would never paint that color but I love the wallpaper. I did beadboard on the bottom.
I prefer the mauve but go a few shades lighter. It will be *intense* at that saturation in a confined space
Green
I'm a green fan on a personal level, but the mauve matches your vanity much better. I'd go a little lighter as others have said, though.
With the vanity being grey, I would suggest a cool-toned color if you want a deeper color on the wall. The green and the red that you picked are too warm to coordinate with a grey vanity and a warm wood cabinet on the wall. A dark, cool-toned green, teal, blue, or purple would look lovely with the grey vanity, and if that wood cabinet is going to be there, it would be a more complimentary color since the wood is so warm.
I like the pink shade better, but I'd do something like a light tan or cream color and use it more like an accent color.
The green is too saturated and clean. A lighter green or a green with more gray in it would work.

The mauve color might work. It may be too dark.
I would pick a warmer colour, as it‚Äôs probably a better glow if you are ‚Äúpowdering‚Äù in the mirror. I like the rose over the green for this reason. 

I understand others‚Äô concern about too dark, as it may make a small space look smaller and darker. But you have the white cabinetry, etc.
I'd go with a more dusty shade of green, like sage.
I think saturated but also a little too grey.
Do you think limewash will be overrated in 5 years?
It‚Äôs kinda nice to have a moody moment in the bathroom tho!
I was thinking the same thing. That picture in the background I can‚Äôt really tell if it‚Äôs dark blue or purple, but that would be a really good color for the bathroom."

Ordered set of floating shelves but reconsidering the length/placement. Does this length work or would it be better if it stretched across the entire counter?

Personally I wouldn't go full length, and I would also hang them slightly higher, as well as centered to the wall/countertop. Reason being is the depth will be a factor, especially right at the very corner/edge, it seems like an easy way to take an eye out, or minimally bump your forehead.

reddit,HomeDecorating,1npxgb6,1758774407,Struggling with furniture layout,,"Struggling with furniture layout



You‚Äôve already got a really solid blueprint for tackling this kind of space. The main challenge is definitely the walk-through layout, since the walkway kind of bisects the room and makes it tricky to balance both the TV and the fireplace. What usually works best is leaning into that idea and treating the room as two zones instead of fighting against it. One side can hold the main seating setup with the sectional and TV, while the other can become a cozier, more intentional corner around the fireplace with an armchair, side table, and maybe a lamp. That way, the path through the room feels like a natural divider instead of something breaking up your seating.Another option is to float the sectional in the middle so the back of it defines the walkway. That makes the furniture grouping the main focus and allows both the TV and fireplace to feel acknowledged, with the armchair still creating a small reading or conversation spot near the fire. No matter which way you go, rugs are key for anchoring each area, and repeating colors or textures in both zones makes the space feel connected instead of split. Layered lighting, throws, and artwork over the fireplace will pull it all together and keep the room warm and cohesive instead of feeling like two separate halves."

Maybe get two curtain rods- one with shorter curtains when closed to go over the A/C unit and another curtain rod in front of that one with the longer curtains. This way when they're both open the shorter ones stay behind the longer ones and don't look weird.
That is indeed an awkward space. I would suggest layering curtains. Get two curtain rods and put the long floor length rod towards the front and then get some shorter curtains and put that rod in the back towards the window.
1) two curtain rods, two different length curtains.

2) one curtain rod, shorter curtains in the middle. 

3) pull curtain rod out towards you, so it covers everything.
Yea, this would drive me nuts!

Could leave like the second picture and put a pretty film up in the middle.

Do you own or rent this home? If you own, I‚Äôd suggest motorized roller shade in 3 panels - 2 each for the longer sides and one for the center, so you can enjoy full light blockage. Then you can do decorative curtains over the top. This will obviously be $$$. A cheaper option if you are renting is to get a double curtain rod and hang shorter curtains on the back rod that just clear the AC, and longer ones in the front that go to the ground. I‚Äôd do the same curtain just different lengths so it looks cohesive. Your local dry cleaner should be able to hem the curtains for you cheaply and easily.
I just wouldn't. It looks lovely and architectural without them. I'd use some kind of shades or blinds if you want more color. Even the ones you have look good IMO, they go with the modern urban vibe.
Perhaps long curtainrod holders so the curtains stand further from window. Then the middle looks like you have thick walls.
Attach rods at the ceiling bumped out to be flush with the left corner then make the space behind a cozy nook to sit in. Add seating, pillows, books, art, just making it its own space like a little room that way it feels intentional
#mildlyinfuriating material, right here.
Great suggestion!  OP you can get double curtain rod/tracks off the shelf at lots of places.
Option #2 would look vaguely like this when open, short curtains open to center.

I like option #1 the best but those are very long rods, OP might not want to buy two.

Tension rod for the win
They have double rods that come in pretty long lengths! Or they could mount them on a track from the ceiling
No, you‚Äôd still be able to push the shorter curtains to the side, it‚Äôd just look like 2 different heights of curtains pushed together, which might not be the aesthetic OP is going for.
Yeah you could do that too but it‚Äôd look odd with one rail."

Not going to lie, I like those cabinets. Maybe add new handles?
I'm definitely planning to do that I was thinking maybe do a darker wood stain on it but I've never done much with wood as this is my first venture in owning my own place and being able to do things like that with it lol.
Darker wood could be nicer, but I feel like it would make the kitchen narrower than it is.¬†
Good point I do want to replace the counter top eventually with a quartz possibly which may help with the narrow feeling I think. Also going to replace that backsplash with something with color not 100% sure what color yet but probably a lighter one like a light blue maybe."

Short term, change out your bedspread and pillows for ones with color.

Longer term, paint the walls.

Speaking as someone that likes the color gray, that gray carpet is sucking the life out of the room.  I'd recommend covering it with a large rug.  Color and design to compliment whatever color you choose for the walls.

edit:  replacing -> covering
I am generally not a fan of gray, but I think your bedroom looks terrific! It looks peaceful and elegant. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.
warmer lightbulbs in the lamps would be my first step - 2700K or warmer. warm accent lighting and no overhead lights on = instantly cozier!

some colorful throw pillows and blankets would also go a long way! this is a great blank canvas and would look amazing with just a few finishing touches!"

Cool funky shaped room.  Let your freak flag fly in it.

Replace the duvet with a darker color that won't stain so bad.
I'd move the bed out of the alcove.  It feels too claustrophobic.  Get rid of the rug, make the alcove your pet's area along with the narrow table.  Try to get rid of the clutter.  Definitely need a new duvet.  Hope this helps!  It is a cute room."

I have had these for a long time. The white wash makes them look dated. If I sand them down to wood would they look nice? Or is it time for them to go. They are real shutters with legs. Suggestions? 

They look like they would be well-suited to a beachy interior. Because of that, they make me think of a holiday rental. That's not necessarily a bad thing. 

Do they match the rest of your decor? 

Most importantly, do you like them?
The wood color is too simple. Try a different paint color. Brown or black would be good.
I like them quite a bit and they are PERFECT considering they are repurposed shutters. I wouldn't  change a thing, but what is important is what YOU like, but trying to transform the casual beauty of shutters into Mid Century Modern, Hollywood Glam,  Industrial Loft , Art Deco, British Edwardian or 19th C French Empire won't work. They are shutters. 

The tables are unique, useful and attractive and can adapt themselves to any number of timeless styles. County French or Italian. Bohemian. Coastal Chic. Country Farmhouse, Cottage, even Scandinavian. 

I think they are great."

I think the lamps are working against you - the wall by the bed seems unbalanced because it's very bright at the bottom and very dark above the bed.
That fireplace is so beautiful it should be a focal point. I‚Äôd add wallpaper to that wall that combines your two other wall colors.
For the fireplace I'd leave the inner textured arch white.  I'd want to paint every part outside of that arch with a color that ""pops""."

Hey yall! I cannot seem to find a good couch and I am so tired of spending money on couchs that dont clean and aren't comfortable 6 months in. Where can you actually buy a decent couch any more?

Living spaces
Im struggling too with my couch shopping.  

I think its two factors:

1.  The modern couches having low backs.  Whenever I want to slouch and sink into the couch my head hits the wall.  You end up buying extra pillows to prop yourself up but then you lose butt space and cant slouch.  

2. The ""high density"" foam loses resiliency too soon.  It warps easily.  The more expensive couches (that I cannot afford) are built with combination of springs, foam, down and fabric fillers which keep their support longer.  

If you can afford it, I would look into sofas with a  spring base support and fabric or down top layer that you can fluff up.

Good luck!"

Your space already has a really nice foundation, and I agree that bringing in warmer tones with lamps, plants, or even a textured coffee table will make a big difference. Sometimes just adding layered lighting (like a mix of floor lamps, table lamps, and something softer for ambiance) completely changes how a room feels.
One idea I picked up from another home decor community was trying out the Pococo star projector. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first, but it actually gives off this soft, moving glow that makes the room feel warmer and cozier without adding clutter. It could be a fun way to balance out all the blue and add that inviting vibe you‚Äôre looking for.
Congrats on your new home! 

Who are you? Who lives in your home? What do you want the space to do? How do you want the space to feel? 

If you‚Äôre a single 28 year old who likes throwing big parties, you need different things than a couple with young children who rarely host guests. 

Is this the primary/only living space in the house? 

Will you want a TV in there? 

What kind of activities do you want to do in this space? Host dinner parties? Invite friends over to watch the game? Lay on the couch with your dog and read a book? Host people for board game night? 

Figure out what you want the space to do and how you want it to feel. Otherwise, it‚Äôs easy to end up with a space that‚Äôs not functional for how you plan to use it.
Thanks! I'll look into the Pococo or something similar. I just bought this coffee table. Definitely want to figure out lighting now.

Thanks! All good questions. I'm a 29 year old guy and single so it's just me and the dog right now. I enjoy art but I struggle to pinpoint a style I like or commit to buying anything. Probably no big parties but I'd like to gather friends and entertain once I meet some new people here (MN).

My media/fun space is downstairs and for now at least I plan to just have the TV down there (just added a rug and moved my lift top coffee table down there). This space on the main floor will probably be good for board games, reading, etc.

Y E S. Thank you for this, I'm going to save as an inspiration!!! Did you have to sand/prime the trims and the wall before painting?
Gorgeous
Love it!
Exactly my kinda thing. Gorgeous.
Wow beautiful room! I like the green.
I think it is million times more relaxed space to read now
Lucky
Coming from someone who tries to preserve wood at all costs, I freaking love this. You nailed it. Love this color and the mood it brought to the room.
Im in awe OP! I should really try that color out once I graduate from my kindle and finally build my own library room aha
Yes!
Looks lovely! What paint colour did you use?¬†
Great color, however I would have left the trim unpainted.¬†
I'm not a fan of this tbh... I feel like a proper clean and polish and stain would've been better but that might be preference
I am a wood purist, but this is a darn good match. Congrats on the perfect room.
It was SO much better before.
I see the walls are SW Rosemary from another comment, but what did you use in the ceiling? And is it eggshell, flat, matte? On walls/ceilings?
I'm 99% sure I've seen this room and this transformation on Reddit before in the past six months.  For some reason I remember it being an office and in a more completed state.
What is with reddit and preserving cheap honey oak trim?
I really wanted a color-drenched look, and the honey oak would have detracted from that. It was very orange and preserving it would have just been for the sake of saying I didn‚Äôt paint over original wood.
I say drench em
Thank you!
Thank you!
They will be brass!
Lol
Thank you! Yes, light sand on the wood but otherwise make sure to use a good primer.
Definitely!
Thank you! This is SW Rosemary!
Because most of us don't even have cheap real wood trim. We have like white vinyl and mdf with no budget to change it.  Wood looks nice and is stainable.
The first thing I thought when I saw this in my feed was""oooo comments, someone is gonna roast them for painting the trim""
I covered or refinished alllll of mine
Ah okay. It seemed more brown than orange from your camera, which is why I thought it would complement it.
Its timeless and classy vs landlord special...
Stained wood trim rarely looks good unless the house has architectural characteristics that go with it. Stained wood trim in a regular rectangular room just looks outdated.
it‚Äôs been quite a while since i‚Äôve read a comment i disagreed with this much
I'm in complete agreement and have found it's almost exclusively an older gen that tends to love wood trim.
I hate it. But I've also seen it done beautifully. I'd almost definitely not have it myself.
Wait until timber drenching starts showing up on the sub, so far it hasn't really left Europe but its coming.
Thanks for letting me know

I like it- with better pillows. But if it is uncomfortable, then that is not good i guess.
I personally like it!  I like wide arm rests!  It's perfect for small space.
I hope none of my furniture has a ‚Äòsoul.‚Äô

I like it.  If you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters.
I love the material and color but I have to wonder how comfortable those low backs are. I‚Äôd add more pillows in complementary colors.
The back looks quite low to be comfortable. But actually I think the issue is the wall colour. A pale yellow/green doesn‚Äôt complement the dark green sofa in my opinion. I think it looks a bit ‚Äúsoulless‚Äù because of the washed out wall colour clashing with the warm, darker toned sofa.
Currently, yeah, this entire room does not look particularly soulful. But it‚Äôs not the sofa‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs the styling. Add some pillows and throw blanket with coordinating colors and varying textures, swap out the artwork above for something larger that really speaks to you and your personality and you‚Äôre off to a much better start. 

That said, if you can return it I absolutely would because unless this is a rarely used seating space, a stylish sofa ain‚Äôt shit if it‚Äôs not comfortable.
New pillows, art‚Ä¶
My only complaint would be too low of a back rest, otherwise it's a pretty sweet looking couch.
It has very awkward proportions. But if you love it, and find it comfortable, who cares? I‚Äôd throw some 22‚Äùx22‚Äù or 24‚Äùx24‚Äù decorative pillows to add some height to the back cushions and give it more balance.
Agree with another the proportions are unusual. Looks like you don't sink into the seat cushions at all and back is low. Love the color!!
Too low of a back for me personally, but I‚Äôm not the one sitting on it so whatever. Throw some bright/contrasting pillows or throw blankets on it and it will get some more life.
I think it needs some big pillows, but yes the boxiness looks kinda corporate office-y
I like the color but not the style. My only suggestion is to lower your two pictures.
To me they look cheap and uncomfortable
Looks like a kids nugget play couch
Get two HUGE pillows and use them as backrest, plus a few more soft smaller ones for the rest of it
colourful pillows! the sofa looks mad cozy.
I love it!
With all that character? I'd call it a bold soul - boring people can sit somewhere else.
Can you return it?
Yeah, it's a sofa for a waiting room and not for lounging at home.
Sofa is lovely, however I would definitely place some substantial pillows so short people can sit comfortably. Get something fabulous and you won‚Äôt regret it!
It is giving therapist office , but it‚Äôs not the couch. I am Mrs neutral herself but you need some colour , a throw blanket maybe? Try something that has the green from the couch / yellow from the walls/ pink from the coffee table. Toss it over the side grab a pillow that corresponds. It might be the art.
He‚Äôs the strong silent type
You must be a giant for your legs to reach the floor!
Those throw pillows are too small, but other than that, I like it! Maybe bring in more color? I like the sofa and your artwork.
I‚Äôm nervous about ordering a couch online. Where‚Äôd you get it?
I really like it and you can dress it up with thow pillow and really nice tapestry type throw blankets with slashes of the green in them. Peacocks, dragonflies, floral, ect..... Whatever you're into.
Get some big, bold pillows to soften the edges. These tiny guys are shrinking on the Hulk.
It‚Äôs not for me but I‚Äôm a small person. My legs would dangle over the front, not touching the floor & meanwhile my back would still be far from supported. But lying down to read, probably great for that.
Oh is that one of these trendy sofas that come compressed into a tiny black hole then expand?
I think its fine especially if you like it! Id get some taller throw pillows for it though
""Soulless"". What? Just not attractive or comfortable. I love green...but this is coming off FLAT. CAN you tolerate large pillows for the corners and back? Color .
Thank you! And your couch looks comfy to me. Congrats.
Get a fluffy/textured throw blanket! And scooch that sofa forward a pinch so the front is actually on the rug.¬†
Looks great imo. Keep the round pillow for sure and if you add other decorations make sure they balance out the boxiness and not add to it. I'd also add a blanket or 2 nearby and a few more soft pillows
As a pet owner, this is ideal to stop my dogs from ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pushing their toys under the couch.
I‚Äôd just jazz it up with some big, comfy, colorful pillows!  I like it.
Not enough back support
You just need an orange throw
I‚Äôd put artwork above it that has green in it
I absolutely love the color of the sofa, however...

...is that a plastic monstera adansonii?

If so, avoid artificial and plastic anything as home decor. Natural textures and materials will look more inviting
tell u how i feel bout them tiddies on the wall
I don‚Äôt think it is soulless but the proportions don‚Äôt look comfortable at all to me.
I like it. Is it boneless?
Personally, I prefer my furniture to be nonsentient and soul free.
It looks too big for me so I probably would not enjoy sitting in it. I‚Äôm also not crazy about the color. But it‚Äôs not my couch.
No, the rest of the room though? I like the style (blocky on purpose) and it adds some much needed colour to the room. Pattern and colour should be next. Be bold.
Soulless is a very strange way of describing a piece of furniture. Of course it's soulless. 

I'd add loads more cushions and a fluffy throw. Probably in varying white textures.
I don't get what they mean by the word ""soulless"" OP but I do think that it looks nice! Maybe they meant its not quirky enough for them aha
It‚Äôs not the couch! It‚Äôs everything around the couch, the wall colour/lack of art/lack of warm or brightness makes it all look a bit faded, not bad just not warm
It would be perfect for a child with short legs but the deep seat cushions and short back would be uncomfortable for an adult.
i think one should prioritize looks over function
Soulless is one word that comes to mind.
I like it, it looks very cosy. I would change a carpet though.
Looks like an asset from a late 90's video game

Its a beautiful sofa! Looks comfy, that's the main thing. Just add a bit of colour, I made this for some inspo using [https://app.seeitdone.ai/](https://app.seeitdone.ai/)
It‚Äôs kind of cool.  I do like the large arm rest and love that it‚Äôs deep so I can snuggle.  May have to get one myself.
It looks comfy and has a nice, rich texture and color. I'd change out the throw pillows for something with  a bit of color, as that corner of the room is pretty monochromatic except for the sofa. Could be a brighter green, a deep wine red, perhaps a russet or rust orange. Stick with the number of pillows, but just enrich things a bit.
I think its comfortable enough, I just need to get some decent back pillows I think. Its deep enough to lounge so some aditional back pillows make it sit nicely.
I thought so too! Maybe I just need to better decorate the space to make it work
Yea I like it, thanks for your input! Hahaha thats an interesting take on not wanting your furniture having ""soul"".
Yea its not the most comfortable leaning back, but the depth helps. I am considering getting the matching ottoman that most people get it from what I can see, so I that I can lounge like a chaise.
THIS is what I came here to say! It‚Äôs actually a nice yellow on the wall but not with the color of the couch.
Gotcha, I think I will play around with some pillows and throw blanket. And good idea with swapping out the art work. Some something large 1 piece instead of the two small piece? I guess I should probably get something pretty colorful artwork, I like more modern look, but maybe I will go with something with more personality this time. 

Regarding returning the sofa, would cost like 30% of the sofa with return and restocking fees so I probably want to avoid that. I guess I wanted to fit in with the New York art culture too hard haha
yea I think that is the route i am going, people said larger pillows and larger art piece in the back
Yea the low back rest was quite an oversight, I was thinking the seating depth would make up for it though (26"" seating depth). So maybe I just need some larger back throw pillows to help.
Yea that is a good idea on the pillows. I think I made a mistake of not getting the matching ottoman with it to make it a bit more comfortable for lounging, but the room itself is quite small
Yea the low back is my mistake, should have really look at the specs more. it is 10"" from the seat height to the top of the back, I thought that was enough. Should've known it was too short from the pictures though =/
Ooohoh nooo corporate office look sounds aweful,  okay big throw pillows for sure, ahhh i think I made a huge mistake with this sofa lol
Gotcha, I think something else suggest to get a bigger artwork so might do that and lower the picture? will be testing it out and doing a couple of swaps. Big art prints & frames are expensive though, but probably needed in this case
Whoaaaa I spent a fortune for it! =( ohhh noooes
Awww waiting room =/ yea i guess that is the vibe ahhh i need it to make it more lounging and homey lol
Ohhhhh no therapist office! That is not something I want to hear about my place lol. Yea throw blanket for sure. Good ideas on the colors, I am going to play a few bit and cheek out my local home goods store. Might need a mood board thingy too (i have no clue how to do it but its time to learn).
Yeeeeeea!
Not a giant, but larger than average, the seat height is 18"" so pretty normal I think. Might just look huge with how small the space is.
Yea ordeirng from online is always a hit or miss =/ it is from Burrow
Hahaha you are right, that makes a lot of sense and I like your analogy
Yea seems like =/
What would change about the carpet? Is the color too plain?
lol i am unsure of the reference
BIG BIG BIG pillows. Much bigger
Yea it is qutie deep at 26"" seating depth. There is also a matching ottoman I can buy that makes it more a chaise seating. I am considering it now depending on how I feel about the comfort. Even though the space is quite small, I think comfort might be more important
After having a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù couch with a low back, we recently upgraded to a classic comfy sectional - I can‚Äôt stress enough how comfortable it is to have a fully supported high backrest. I didn‚Äôt realize how uncomfortable our last couch was until we upgraded.
I like it. You need to add a few things. Add throw pillows in contrasting colors. For drama, dijon yellow mustard color, dark purple, silvery gray, and a dark blue other than navy. Add a throw.
You could find a cool print you like. Look for an old frame at a thrift store/resale shop. I got a huge one for 4.00. I repainted the frame to how I liked it. Pretty inexpensive. 
You could then pull a color from your print for a different rug if you needed it. Pillows and throws always help.
OP, I definitely think the couch will be improved with new pillows and a throw 

Also, where did you get your rug?? It would be TOO PERFECT in my space!
It‚Äôs always a challenge to find the right size/scale/look piece that also provides the comfort and durability you need.  We usually have to make compromises. You‚Äôve got some good tips in this thread, and good instincts, I‚Äôm sure you will end up with a very good result.

Personally I‚Äôm not a fan of the wallpaper or the rug. Sofa is fine.
If you're going for a calm space, then you've got it!

If you want a bit of color, a blanket and some colored throw pillows and see what you think of that.  

I don't do Pinterest, but I know they have mood boards. Look on there and decide what suits your style. What are you looking for?
i just had a vision of a rich brownish colour in place of that shiny wallpaper ‚Ä¶. oooo‚Ä¶.
I like everything you have. The wallpaper and the rug are kinda two competing patterns/textures/colors, and the couch is a nice neutral buffer that brings them together. 

If you wanted to lean into that even more, I‚Äôd maybe get a floor lamp on the side with the coffee table, or maybe hang a simple piece of artwork on the wall. I love this room!
I like the sofa but for a minimalist like me, the color of your rug is overwhelming.
I don‚Äôt like the black metal side table, it looks cheap compared to the rest of the room, get something wood.   
The rug is too green IMO, a darker shade would look rich in there.
Honestly a neutral sofa doesn‚Äôt strike me as the problem. The overall lack of graphic pattern and colour is more troubling. The sofa could help more if that‚Äôs where you have some flexibility.
The wallpaper and rug do not work together. Both can be nice but they have different undertones and saturation so they are not just different colors‚Ä¶they are different energies. The wallpaper is just overwhelming and has got to go.
Me personally OP I really like the rug aha but I do see where the others are getting at here, it does look kinda loud compared to the other elements of the room
It's beautiful. You've got this. Love the rug. Listen to your favorite music. Well done.
I love everything you are doing, and I think it‚Äôs smart to go plain, it‚Äôs really letting the wall and rug shine! 

10/10 no notes
I like it as is. No notes!
Great thank you! Yea going for a calm-ish place. I dunno exactly what I am looking for, just something that looks cohesive and ""lived in"" with a bit of color. I don't really want to go for the whole beige look (even though I chose a neatral sofa). I was thinking the neutral sofa would be best to play off of and have everything else colorful. What do you think about the curtain color?
Ooh, I wanna see that too- something visually deeper(?) on the walls. My eyes find the wallpaper a bit uncomfortable (sorry OP, no offence intended)
awww really the rug is my favorite part lol
yeah it‚Äôs giving crushed velvet and it doesn‚Äôt really go since the rug has a different texture and colour scheme.
Agree
The rug looks like grass. 

It looks calm, outdoorsy.

And the wallpaper, also is outdoorsy."

Yes.  Absolutely!
You can definitely add molding and if need be a slice of paintable luan plywood to fill in any gap. So long as you paint the additions the same color as your cabinets, it will read well, making your kitchen fell bigger & the ceiling taller.
Since 7.5‚Äù is a tough size, you can instead use 2 or 3 pieces of crown molding and some adhesive like gorilla tape (double sided) and/ or liquid cement to connect or stack them. I just hung molding all over my house and after lots of trial and error, I found the best and easiest method was just sticking it up using gorilla tape with no other nails, glue, or adhesive.

Google ‚Äústacked molding‚Äù to see some ideas like the image here.

If you can‚Äôt find crown molding tall enough to fill that gap you can use a plain piece of wood or MDF to complete the missing gap. If needed you can apply some grout and sand the union, then paint it  all the same color.
If you look at the tops of her cabinets, you can see the frames above the doors are several inches higher to achieve the look. I would frame up a box that would sit on top to extend them up, then put the molding on that box, just like her‚Äôs.
Yep!!
Thank you!! I need help finding a crown molding tall enough. I don't know what search terms to use. Everything talks about face and width and only a few talk about height. I've spent days searching. My husband just looks at me and sighs. He hates it when I say, ""Honey. I have an idea.""
I would put panels up to extend the face of the cabinet and then put reg size crown molding on that. If you can match the paint, it will look fine
You can add moulding to moulding to make it taller. It's going to look great!
I've been debating that with my husband. He thinks it would look janky but I think we could make it look pretty good, especially if we're careful to fill joints as someone mentioned previously. I have the paint, I have the brushes, he has the tools and the talent. Si se puedemos!"

Aside from a wreath (which I‚Äôve already ordered) how can I make my glass front door more private? You can see inside my house when looking at the door, especially at night. And as a millennial, I want to be able to hide when someone rings my doorbell! 



Try some decorative film. It's available online. It will make the glass translucent- allowing light in but you can see in.¬†
Privacy film. It's plastic sheets with tons of different patterns you can buy on Amazon

We use something like this
Many film options are available on Amazon.  Easily installed and removed
I bought some window film that is colorless, but has a pattern through it that obscures the view through.   It lets in light.   It will show you as a shadow moving, if the inside is lit and the outside is dark.  I put it over my door window and over the sidelights, and then also made a little notch in an odd place, with a flap over it, if I want to see out.  

The window film is from Am, online.  I found some that has tiny squares all over it, and some that is more just thick like looking through foam, little speckles.  I have the plainer ones on the front door/windows, and the other on some other windows that are direct view to the neighbor's windows.  

Easy to put on.
Look for non-adhesive film. It'll stay put with no problem and easy to remove if you ever need or want to.
I like this company:  [https://artscape-inc.com/collections/window-film](https://artscape-inc.com/collections/window-film)

Prices are similar to those on Amazon.  But they show you the actual privacy level of each pattern so you can pick one that will best meet your needs.  I've ordered some on Amazon that claimed to be high privacy but weren't.
Id look for reeded or fluted glass film. It'll give you similar privacy to opaque film but look more pleasant and allow more daylight through still!
I sprayed mine  with that frost for windows stuff.   Like $9 a can.    Spray in the inside only.   Still lets light in but no one can see in!
Curtains or Blackout Curtains.
If you don‚Äôt mind paying a bit, call a window tinting company. They could give you a frosted finish, mirrored finish, dark, etc. lots of options!
Curtains
Thanks, I figured this was likely the best option. My husband suggested curtains haha
Even just clear ones with a wavy pattern but, would still probably see shadows through it.  Something more opaque if you want it not so see-through.
I have this on my daughters‚Äô playroom and when the sun hits it it‚Äôs beautiful.
Will do! I had used film in a bathroom window previously but it peeled off so I was worried that may happen here. I‚Äôm guessing it peeled because of the steam so it may work better in the entryway
This is perfect, appreciate it!
That‚Äôs going to be such a bitch to apply on this window but I agree with this. Maybe a professional window tint company can do it lol
This is a good option actually. I‚Äôm already dreading cutting out individual pieces of film for all the separate windows
I bought the spray on fog.  It took me a couple tries to get it right, but it was simple to clean up and didn‚Äôt take long at all, even with multiple attempts.  Maybe a few minutes.   Looks great three years later.
I like curtains. Because they can be moved according to my daily whims
Thanks! I‚Äôll look for an opaque option for no see-through
Specifically, you want static cling film. Very easy to apply and remove, but won't curl up.

We installed it in our main bath which had three massive windows over the soaking tub even though there were neighbors right behind us.  üòÜ

Worked great and no issues with peeling from steam, etc. 

This is what we got, just for reference:

https://www.decorativefilm.com/solyx-sx-sc462-pixels-355-wide
It‚Äôs not really a big job for them- maybe the price would not be too bad! Worth an estimate.
I recommend reeded or fluted effect film instead of opaque."

A taller plant
The problem with having things right next to railings is that it looks cluttered when looking up from lower level. 

I would move couch  bit away from the railing and leave area next to railing empty. 

Moving couch away from railing makes the fact that couch is longer than railing less of an issue.
 More mature snake plant is a very safe option. Low light, low maintenance

Just my thoughts. I would see if I could find a tiny piece of brick to take to Home Depot (Lowe's or whatnot), get a bunch exterior paint samples that seem to blend with some of the colors in the brick. Paint some test patches on the panels up against the brick. I think you can find something that has a similar enough hue to the brick so that it just flows. 

Also, they could scan the piece of brick and mix a custom paint to try to match it. You could get a quart of it and test it out, also.
I would paint the trim of the brick a charcoal grey (SW Urbane Bronze is my favorite warm gray/black) and then paint all of the siding the same color. I would then do a stained wood door."

Reupholster them.
Are they vinyl cushions? If you don't see any signs of bedbugs, they are \*probably\* okay.  If you are concerned, bag each chair in a large black trashbag and leave it outside for several months (because it is fall).  You need to get the chairs heated up over 120F for a few hours to kill eggs (greenhouse effect in the bag from the sun), or down below 0F for at least four days.  If your climate doesn't allow it, you can reupholster."

Speckled.  Hides imperfections (ie dirt) better.

We're working with a manufacturer for the kitchen and wardrobes.

We finalized the kitchen a few months ago and now we patiently wait for it to be installed. During that time, we were planning a wedding, I was having issues at work, and overall, the stress levels were very high. Between him and me, we had multiple sessions to finalize what we want, but I feel we were distracted by everything that was going on. Based on the fact that we both like the clean and simple design, we went with all white, and tbh we were scared to commit to anything else. We were willing to explore the option with wood, but we were unsure if we would match it well with the flooring (which was not finalized at that time cuz surprise, surprise we had issue there). I wasn't willing to take this responsibility and mess it up, especially given how much money we're spending.

So the design we're going for is white, with champagne gold handles and grey+beige stone for the countertop and backsplash. The cabinet doors will be 2cm thick shaker. I'm on pinterest a lot and it seems that white kitchens are out of style and so I'm douting myself if we made the right desicion. I know that I prefer handles, bc of accessibility (i find the handleless kitchens hard to open). I also kinda regret not doing the flat cabinet doors but then it would have been way to much like ikea but x3 the price.

White is timeless, but I'd do the overhead cabinets in a color that complements the backsplash and benchtops; wouldn't be a costly variation.
White is elegant, clean, beautiful. I just finished a very large all white kitchen. The floors and dining table are a beige/oak color to add warmth. If you have warm floors, that will make a big impact.
I wouldn't do the dark wood.  It just looks like you added them because you were afraid of the all white (which is pretty much the truth).

While I don't care for white, I think your original plan will look the best.  Especially if you add in green, etc.

The one concern I DO have is the grey-beige stone.  Your white cabinets are true neutral but your handles and floor are warm shades with yellow undertones.  Your backsplash is likely going to be a cool shade with blue or green undertones.  And that's not going to look cohesive.  I would either change the stone out to something with a yellow undertone OR incorporate the grey-beige into other areas of the kitchen.  That could be in the decor or the kitchen linens or a rug or artwork.  But you want something that includes both the yellow undertone of the floor/handles AND the undertone of the stone (whatever that is) in the same piece.
Personally I vastly prefer the wood, as I find all white kitchens a little dated and extremely bland. BUT if you are risk averse, and nervous about it, the white is the safer option for what is a very expensive, fixed element. if you're in doubt, go with the white, since it is your kitchen and not mine lol, but I HIGHLY recommend adding visual interest/contrast/color in other elements that are easier to swap out, like vases, lighting fixtures, floral arrangements, cooking utensils, cookbooks, dish towels, and all manner of accessories. And especially be a bit braver with your dining chairs!
I love white kitchens. The kitchen in my previous home was white and when I sold and when the contractors stripped everything out to flip it, they put white cabinets back in, just 5 years ago.There's not a great deal of natural light so the white keeps everything bright and there are endless ways to add colored accessories.
What are you asking? Can't see any ? marks in your post.
White is going to be very difficult to keep clean.
Tbh not really worried about that. Both of us are neat freaks so we keep our home clean and cleaning brings us joy lol¬†

L- shaped couch facing the tv and fireplace. Or if you have space- a couch opposite the fireplace wall and two chairs opposed the window. 

Credenza along the wall opposite the fireplace (next to the porch.

Also maybe a bookcase next to the hall on the otherwise of the fireplace door if you need more storage.
It is a spectacular l room. Please don't ruin it with a TV... particularly one over the fireplace.
I second no tv over FP!

How about a large rug and 2 sofas opposite each other floating in the center of the room? You could put a sofa table behind one. Or

How about 2 sofas back to back with a sofa table in between them and then chairs opposite one sofa and maybe a tv opposite the other sofa? You‚Äôd effectively have two different seating areas. 

But if tv is a big part of your life orient your room around the television.

The powder room is tiny (does have a toilet). Any ideas on where to place this thing?

I think left, so you don‚Äôt crowd the space with an outlet.
I feel like reaching to the right is more intuitive.

Edit: I also wouldn't hang it that high, regardless of the side you choose.
I would go left, since there's an outlet on the right. Hypothetically, if there wasn't an outlet there, it would come down to personal preference, and really still does if you do have a strong preferred side, even more so if you don't use the outlet frequently. The space looks very uniform, so the outlet is the only thing making me say left.
I am right handed, so I would put it on the right. But lower.
I kinda like it on the right more. If I'm shaving and I have wet hands I can dry them and then disconnect the shaver. This also applies for electric toothbrushes, hair dryers and others.
Stand at the sink, close your eyes and envision you just woke up in the middle of the night to pee.  Then reach out for the towel.  Which side do you reach for?  That's the side to hang it on.

Putting it on the side with the outlet isn't going to make it look unbalanced or anything.
I‚Äôd say left since that looks like the direction you would exit, and imo everything should be in a spot that pulls you in the direction you‚Äôre most likely going next.. wash your hands ‚û°Ô∏è dry your hands ‚û°Ô∏è go out the door
I would go opposite the outlet.  I don't like things getting in the way of my hair tools, bathroom night light etc.
Further down, or you will forever have dried water drops on the mirror.

ETA also left, wouldn‚Äòt want to be caught with wet hands near an electric outlet, ever.
Are you left or right handed.... Right? Stick it on the right as thats what you'll reach for. Also I'd go below the level of the sink too. That way it is less visual clutter.
Whichever side is closest to the door so you dry your hands on the way out. Otherwise you have to turn one way, dry, then turn back the other to leave.
Place it on the right trying not to cover the outlet. One will usually gravitate to the right unless you‚Äôre left handed.
Right, but make sure you hang it maybe a bit lower than you think. I always thought they were too low so I did mine higher. But then I realized the water trickled down my arms when I went to dry, so practice where that is
Not by the outlet. You don‚Äôt want to be dripping, wet hands near the outlet for years.
I mounted mine on the right and added a neutral tea towel - less bulky than a hand towel. Not worried about the outlet, I have a scented night light that covers it.
Right.
Not quite related but looks like you're crowded for space on the sink. I recommend a floating soap dispenser that you can keep on one of the walls that doesn't have the towel.
My bathroom is narrow like yours (im guessing the toilet is behind you and the door is to your side) and my towel is on the left of the sink. It feels more natural then the right side for whatever reason
I think the right side is more intuitive as most people will reach for the towel to wipe their hands, in that direction. Also make sure it‚Äôs closer to the sink, not centered on the wall ‚Äîand thereby increasing the chance of getting water on the floor as people have to reach for the towel.
I was going to say right, but it might get in the way of the socket, so left.
Towards the door. People don't like to turn away from the door to dry then turn back to walk out. So put it (left or right) that's facing the door.
whichever side the exit door is on, so when you turn to leave its on the same wall
Right and close to the spigot so wet hands don‚Äôt splash water all over your wall. That‚Äôs what I hate most.
Most people are right-handed so I would put the soap on the right instead of left side and then a short manoever to the right to wash my hands.  I would lower it by about 6 inches and put up a nice guest towel given the fact that it is a powder room.
Same side as the door, since people dry and then leave
Right is right.
On the side of the door.
[deleted]
Yes! Mine covers the only outlet in my bathroom and it's very annoying.
this and also because you'd wash your hands and turn left to exit, just feels like a better flow to have the towel on the same side as the door
Same.
üò§ justice for lefties /s
I'm a rightie and both of mine are on the left wall and it doesn't feel awkward. One exit is left and one is right. 

I'd put it on the left, away from that outlet. ‚ö°Ô∏è
It‚Äôs less intuitive when it‚Äôs the opposite direction of the exit.. and if you just go in to the restroom to dry your hands it‚Äôs quicker to get to if it‚Äôs closer to the place you enter.
I agree - on the side toward the exit is best - that's what i'd naturally do.
Especially since it's not a GFCI outlet. ‚ö°Ô∏è
You gotta point there ü§£
WTF kind of people do you live with or visit where you're worried about how they used a hand towel? And the towel doesn't get musty if you change it out regularly. I put out a fresh one pretty much every day in my main bath. If entertaining, a fresh one goes out before people arrive and then I swap it out again after.
So what... do you use
I feel the same!! What do you do? Even my own house, Idk why I feel skeeved. I have a face towel I use after washing my face, but hand towels I don‚Äôt love. I have a box of not quite paper towels, but thicker than toilet paper. After I use it I‚Äôll use it to wipe down the cats dish, or similar. Not the most environmentally friendly though.
Why would I go to the restroom with wet hands? ü§î they either get wet in the bathroom or kitchen, and usually there are towels already
I have trust issues, haha. And had incidents. Mostly children but even adults' habits can be surprising.
Mostly paper towels but depends on my mood.
In my personal bathroom, I'll use my towel. With guest bath, I go back and forth with stuff. Mostly the select a size paper towel or the kleenex disposable hand towels if im feeling fancy. A friend has a commercial napkin dispenser, which seems pretty convenient.
Maybe invest in a roll of reusable paper towels? Basically cloth too, but maybe using them once and then washing would prevent it from coming you out?


(And then keep a little bin under the sink to throw as a laundry basket for them)
Seems pretty wasteful
There‚Äôs got to be a neat way to house commercial napkins I can find, great idea!!
It's a 'folded towel dispenser' which could be covered easier than the big bulky ones. Maybe with wood? Hers looks fine as is in her bath, but you can definitely tell it's commercial."

There is no room. Leave it bare and dust regularly.
Don‚Äôt do it.
I‚Äôm glad to see we‚Äôre all in agreement here. The answer is no, we will not help you decorate up there because it‚Äôs a bad idea. Lol.
It doesn‚Äôt need anything. It will look cluttered and  dusty
Don‚Äôt decorate-it looks clean and good as-is.
Why do you need to decorate above the cabinets?  The space isn't that big.  Anything you do will likely make it look cluttered.
Nope
Filler panel. Done.
I wouldn‚Äôt put anything up there, it‚Äôll just collect dust
For years I put stuff up there, and every six months I had to pull it all down to remove dust and grime. Now I leave it clear of clutter, with a layer of aluminum foil on the tops that I replace every few months. Best hack ever!
Do not! It looks perfect as is
Don't. If you can, a little light carpentry to remove the top molding and add a filler panel would do wonders.

That color is gorgeous, do you mind sharing if you know the name? Oddly, I think I have the exact same flooring as you.
Maybe some led lights but other than that I would leave it as is. Beautiful color on your cabinets!
I would not decorate there. Less is best.
Nothing!!  Will only add visual clutter
Nothing
Don't put anything up there. Don't clean up there. Don't look up there ever again. There IS no up there. You're welcome!
No. Keep it free of clutter, please!
What is the actual distance from the top of the cabinets to the ceiling? Looks like a decent amount. 

You can enclose the top with small cabinets with glass panels and lights. Would really look great.

Could you just‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.leave them?
Put nothing up there.
Leave it alone. You don‚Äôt need the clutter or the extra cleaning problem.
Cats.
Do nothing. Not every empty space has to have something. Love the color scheme btw.
Beautiful color! Leave it as is. Decorating the tops of cabinets is not done any more especially with such a small area. Enjoy your clutter free kitchen!
Just ‚ú®don‚Äôt‚ú®
DON'T. You do NOT want to have dusty greasy stuff to clean!
I‚Äôm not a fan of clutter.  I wouldn‚Äôt put anything up there.
Leave it as is!!
You could put taller moulding on top of cabinets to make them taller and more finished.
Don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs a dated look. Everything gets nasty and it‚Äôs hard to clean.
Unless you have something very specific that is kitchen related, that you want to display, and will clean on a regular basis, I would not put anything up there. In my own kitchen I have my cake plate collection up there, but that‚Äôs only because I actually have a small matching collection of them (started with what I collected for my wedding), I didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to store them, and they are relatively easy to clean. We also put color changing LED lights above the cabinets that we change for parties, holidays, football games and such (the kids and I love it).
No
No. Leave it empty. Every surface does not need to be cluttered up with stuff. Your kitchen looks lovely and clean just as it is. A large picture next to the cabinets and a plant or flowers on the wall end of the seating counter is all I would even consider.
Nothing but for a little whimsy a little clay cat that looks out over the cabinet
Do upper lighting. We had a similar issue, and this is our fix.
I would leave that area as it is. Focus on beautifying the kitchen by adding upgraded bar stools and an attractive piece of wall art where the peninsula joins the wall. And maybe an attractive plant in a cachepot on the peninsula
My mom keeps teapots and random antique kitchen items (egg scale, flour sifter, etc.) up there, at my old place it's where I kept miscellaneous decorative glassware and food-themed art. It's also a good place for a pile of cookbooks you don't frequently use. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to have it decorated immediately, this is where you get to have fun spending years curating your knickknacks!

Yes, they get dusty and little bit oily. Give them a good cleaning like once a year and you'll be fine.
Lego city zone. Make a main street of lego shops and buildings.
perhaps print pictures of stuff (like books, small plants, or pottery) on cardstock and stand it up in the gap. when it gets gross, chunk them and print new ones?

might be a dumb idea tho
Honestly I‚Äôd cover the gap and paint the color of the cabinets. Nothing ever looks good in those spaces. They also gather a lot of dust
Don‚Äôt put anything because it‚Äôs going to get dusty and it will be kind of inconvenient to keep it clean
If you really want something going on up there, you could do an accent paint color or fun wallpaper?
Above cabinets don‚Äôt need decoration. Decoration there draws attention to fact that cabinets don‚Äôt go up to the ceiling. Blank spaces in a home are just fine, often best left alone. Although I‚Äôd be tempted to paint the wall up there in the same green as the cabinet. To see if a green wall made that space visually disappear.
Maybe a decorative strip of lights but no room for much else.
Leave it. Please don't put fake plants up there.
Don‚Äôt clutter it. Empty space can be a design choice too
No.
You should put NOTHING.
This is apparently a VERY divisive topic. At the risk of being down-voted to oblivion, I‚Äôll be brave and share my solution. 

Wallpaper on the back wall, recessed hidden lighting, two small thrifted lamps (non-matching) in the corners that add warmth. Framed pictures of family members, either cooking or just hanging out. It probably sounds like a lot but it‚Äôs just a few pictures placed together near the lamps. 

I wasn‚Äôt trying to fill the space, just make my kitchen feel incorporated with the rest of my home.
Very pretty cabinets...what kind of paint, and name of the color? Not much room to decorate,you could look into some border paper, all kinds of designs...
That light fixture is amazing, a beautiful sci-fi feeling to a modern comfortable home.
It looks great as it
The cabinets look lovely, I might suggest painting the wall the same colour as the ceiling though.  The stripe of different colour paint along the wall is attracting attention and detracting from the nice clean look of the rest of the room
LOVE the cabinets color. It looks fine the way it is. If you put anything up there, you‚Äôre gonna have to climb up there to dust it, which makes it harder.
I don‚Äôt like clutter on top of cabinets. It always looks odd to me. I advise not putting stuff ip there. 
I like all the suggestions about painting the section above the cabinets.

Or just leave as is. Looks great!
Don't do it.
I prefer nothing up on top - nice kitchen, nice clean look.
No. That‚Äôs dated and all it does is collect dust.
Nothing. Leave it empty. It‚Äôs nice and clean and fresh so do not add clutter.
obviously a model train duh
Leave it. There‚Äôs no space to decorate and it would look weird and catch dust and oil.
It looks great as is and people seem to be in the leave it bare camp but I‚Äôd say play around with a fake pothos plant if you are looking for some added decor.
For the love of god, just don‚Äôt.
Hustler foldouts and empty import beer bottles
Why?
Nothing. Not enough space to be usable, it will just look busy.
Put nothing there. You‚Äôll have to dust and it will look cluttered
Leave them bare. It‚Äôs not a place you want to call attention to.¬†
Get some gnomes, nuff said
I‚Äôd put some type of garland like a vine of ivy or something
Only thing I would suggest is maybe a pothos on the end that‚Äôs facing the island to trail down. That is if you get enough light.
 it‚Äôs ok to have surface with nothing on it. your kitchen is lovely and uncluttered.
Put super cute wallpaper there:
""decorate"" means how your house looks as a whole, not ""cover every surface with tacky bric-a-brac"".

Leave them bare.
Board it up and paint it the same as the cabinets
I would not decorate above those cabinets. It looks good as it is. It doesn‚Äôt look plain or anything. But it will look too busy if you put stuff up there.
sister queen, don't do it!
Don‚Äôt
No.
I use this space for appliances I don‚Äôt have counter space for and cookbooks, just don‚Äôt put anything too close to the stove or it will get greasy
Please please please do NOT decorate up there. Infill with a gypsum (drywall) soffit.
Do not put anything up there.
Leave it near. Everything put up there collects dust and oil.
No need to it will collect greasy dust and it will take away from your pretty kitchen.
You add false cabinets above, extending it to the ceiling, which would add elegance to your kitchen
Add a crown molding to the top of the cabinet and put in some led strip lights up there
We closed off our space above our cabinets and added crown molding, it looks a thousand times better, don‚Äôt have to worry about dust
Don‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs a very dated look and it‚Äôs a major pain to clean. Use the old newspaper sheets or wax paper to cover the tops of the cabinets from the greasy dirt that gets up there and pat yourself on the back every time you don‚Äôt have to clean oily dust from a million little things
LED strips?
Paint the wall the same color as the kitchen cabinets so it‚Äôs not obvious you have empty space there!
Double stacked crown painted the same color of the cabinets should‚Äôve been the choice.
No don‚Äôt do anything, you don‚Äôt have to fill every space. Less is more.
Beautiful as it is. Resist the urge.
Halloween lights üéÉ
Switch to Christmas lights when the time comes!
I guess I'll be the odd man out here, but I have my favorite vintage dishware set on display and I love it! I'm very grandma/cottage core, so that's just my aesthetic. I also have a lot more space above mine and vaulted ceilings.


Happy decorating and I love the cabinet color you chose!
I think putting stuff in that space is kind of tacky but to each their own. I‚Äôm thankful the house we bought has cabinets that extend up to the ceilings so I don‚Äôt have any space there to keep clean.
find a cool wallpaper for the wall space above them!
Books. Fake ivy in vintage birdcage.
Just because there‚Äôs space doesn‚Äôt mean you need to fill it. All above cabinet decorations turn out a little tacky. Your cabinets are beautiful, so just leave them alone.
Nothing
Build a soffit up there and close it in for the appearance of having cabinets to the ceiling.
Don‚Äôt put any thing up there ‚Ä¶ it will just collect dust ‚Ä¶ leave as is ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Decorations on cabinets are kitschy and awful. Don‚Äôt do it.
Wow all of these people telling you not to do anything have no joy in their homes (and maybe lives).

I am a maxamalist who lives with someone who isn't, so I've been able to find a good happy medium. You just have to keep it clean and be intentional about it.

We collect growlers from breweries that we love, and have those above our kitchen cabinets. I have art, plants, my great grandmas Pyrex, and other treasures mixed in.

I would do fun lights, as others have said. Maybe some plants, if you get enough natural light in that room. Could opt for fake plants, but spend more so they look nice.

Life is too short to not to bring things we love into our homes because someone on the internet told you it'll look cluttered.

Try it and if you don't like it, you can always take stuff down. Play and have fun! That's what home decorating is all about!
Any decoration will make it look cluttered as the space is too small and it will be a nightmare to clean. I would suggest adding some molding but it is too large a gap for that unfortunately.  I would either leave as is or consider some warm led strips for ambiance. 

[Something like this](https://share.google/C3flhYwJ31rTbi6jM)
Nothing! It‚Äôll be dust collectors
It looks great as is. Love the cabinet color!
I‚Äôd leave it empty. Putting anything up there will just draw attention to the gap and look cluttered. Kitchen looks really pretty!!
Nothing. Dust it when you dust the rest of the house.
Leave it empty for a nice clean look.
Cleaning hack: put contact paper up there. The glossy stuff with a sticky back. Makes it super easy to dust and clean the grease that will inevitably end up there. Peel up and replace as needed over the years. I do this as soon as I move into a new place: helps keep it clean while I live there, peel up before I move and it's one less place that needs a deep clean. I always get my deposit back.
Personally, I would leave it alone. Adding items could make the kitchen look clutterd and it would be a bitch to dust and clean considering the food particles from cooking.
LEDs for sure, that‚Äôs what I done for the empty space. Love it
Your apt looks VERY similar to mine‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing. I may get some white rope light for up there for a nightlight instead.
Glad to see im not the only one that mixes dishes soap and gets gradient soap. 

Nothing above the cabinets. Maybe something to put on that right edge to block the view of the Keurig & the other black box.
No
Leave it, it is lovely!!! Such a pretty color. I have such a soft spot for dark green.
Don't do anything, you don't really want to draw attention to that space. I'd recommend painting the walls to compliment the rest of the room.
I would create the illusion of taller cabinets by adding painted boards‚Ä¶.same color as cabinets.
Paint that space the same colour as the cabinets so it looks more uniform and makes the room look taller.
Clean and bare is better. Just walk the counter twice or four times a year.
I'd find decorative wood trim that matches your aesthetic and fill in the bare area. It looks much better imo.
Maybe some peel and stick wallpaper. I'd leave it empty
This is the only word art I have. My friend is a welder and custom made it for me. It‚Äôs a quote from a film‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/7xtnerilk4rf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cb7c99a1d37c34ae24e580a446a721f641bde9a
Maybe one or two pretty blue/white (utilitarian) ceramic pieces on counter - such as a cooking utensil holder. I agree with leaving space above cabinets blank with removable paper for dust.
Just leave it or put lighting. Lighting hidden behind crown moulding.
If you really must have objects I would say plants or some pretty baking pants or something, I don‚Äôt think you have enough height for bowls.
Remember anything up there will collect dust and grease.
You could do wallpaper?
Nothing. Put nothing there
You could continue the green up to the ceiling with false panels.
You could put one trailing plant like a pothos. Otherwise leave it empty!
I had cabinets like yours but with more space. I put up some decorative bottles and baskets and fake flowers. After more than a decade, I took it all down. There really wasn't that much dust. I wiped everything away and I've left it blank ever since. It's been almost 5 years and I still haven't dusted and I haven't noticed any problems. 

I do like the calmness of the space without clutter of decor above the cabinets.
Maybe paint it the same colour as the cabinets so it doesn't stand out so much?
I have various appliances on the top of mine. But, I oddly have lots to room.
honestly, leave it
One designer suggests putting luan or other paintable panels, to close the dust area in completely. Then paint the panels to match your cabinets. This will give more height to your kitchen, look more finished, modern and way easier to clean. https://www.lowes.com/pd/47-75-in-x-7-98-ft-Smooth-Brown-Wall-Panel/3014304or other
I would actually close it in with MDF and then paint it the same colour as the cabinets. It will make your ceilings look taller.
You don‚Äôt need to decorate your cabs, you need a dynamic backsplash. That‚Äôll scratch that itch I bet. But please leave those beautiful cabinets alone. Get thee to Pinterest for inspo babes.
No advice but the green is beautiful! Looks great with your floors and counters.
You know it is a lovely kitchen,i have found that anything above cabinets is a dust and dirt collector.Old fashioned wall paper eventually goes out of style.i would pick out two great looking hanging pendant lights for over your bar area. Get them installed where existing electric down lights are and call it done.
If you really must I'd just put there flat decorative CLOSED boxes holding for instance seasonal decor. 

But if it was me I wouldn't put anything there, it's good how it is, there isn't much space, and next time just board this space up so that you don't need to dust.
‚ÄòNot a shelf‚Äô 
Put paper up there to catch grease and make it easy to replace/ clean each spring with spring cleaning tasks.
Just leave it alone. It‚Äôs a nice clean look now. You don‚Äôt need anything up there. Anything you put there would distract from the gorgeous cabinets and lighting.
Put some wallpaper up there or something instead of decor, may look a little off tho, but won‚Äôt know until you try it. It‚Äôs too small to decorate imo
The only thing I put above the cabinets is my cake stands that would take up entirely too much cabinet space otherwise. I'm a baker and have 6 cake stands (3 with domes, 3 without) so those go up there and are taken down and cleaned when I need them. Beyond that anything else looks too cluttered. Also, side note, I love the green cabinets. Do you know what brand and color that is?
Decorate everything else lol
If you paint the wall above to match the cabinets they will blend in nicely and you won‚Äôt need to do anything else beyond periodic cleaning.
why have that space? isn't that what a soffit is for?
Not every space needs to be filled with something in a home, this is one where it looks fine as is. 

If you really can't handle it being bare put a nice set of nestled mixing bowls above the spot above the microwave area. Like these below

https://www.georgetownpottery.com/products/mixing-bowl-set-3?tw_source=google&tw_adid=687961793181&tw_campaign=20950833584&tw_kwdid=pla-298113073854&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20950833584&gbraid=0AAAAAD3lZUCSoLX8wNpBY2DiF5MNXy9LQ&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5WgTTmgi2W85jpeivuY6sFml5PyWYrQRfe5BLzwsqgmI7_GKQPT6NsaAjv0EALw_wcB
Paint above the cabinets a different complimenting color, change the backsplash to a rich color, and change to gold cabinet knobs/handles, and you will have one classy kitchen.
Put led strips to match the under cabinet. I wouldn‚Äôt put any decorations up there as it‚Äôll look cluttered and get dusty fast.
Leave it empty. It is just a dust and grease collector up there
Clear glassware like small fishbowl, vases, etc.
Don't do it. It'll get dusty and gross.
plants, kitchen appliances you don‚Äôt use regularly
I don‚Äôt think you need anything up there. I like it the way it is
Or, OP can just cover it up to the ceiling continuation from the cabinets giving an illusion of tall cabinets with the same paint color.
I don‚Äôt know if u really want to decorate it maybe put some 3D postcards with white flowers up there?
Please don‚Äôt.
Don‚Äôt decorate. Things will get gross up there. Put some butcher paper down to keep greasy dust off the cabinets.
Just don‚Äôt decorate up there. If you have some fabulous plates, or other dinnerware, maybe, like something Italian. It takes a while to get dusty enough to get up there for that. Generally it‚Äôs best to just leave it and decorate at regular viewing level. Kitchen looks great, though. Pretty green colorüòä
Not everything needs decorating. I would leave as is.
The gap is not big enough to really *need* to place anything there. My gap is longer so I put some favorite pottery pieces up there, plus I have a cozy cluttery style of decorating. But yours would probably look better left alone.
Throw some wallpaper with a simple design.
Nooooo don‚Äôt put anything up there.
I would do a colorful, cool painthob like you see stair risers, If you put stuff upthereit‚Äôll just got there it‚Äôll just be hard to clean.
A garland of plastic olive leaves from the dollar store and a few straw baskets to store bulk spices so your cupboard only needs to hold cute little jars of frequently used ones.  baskets are awesome junk drawers.
Keep it empty!!!!!!
Put in a soffit to extend the eye
You could just pop a flower garland up there, but like others say, it will get DUSTY AF. 

However, there is apparently a way to clean these by putting them in a sealed bag with salt and shaking it. Can't say I've tried that myself yet as I've just wiped over them instead, but I did see a video of it working well. 

I have leafy garlands with flowers and lemons on from The Range that look pretty and would go with your kitchen cupboards.

[Lemon Garland](https://www.therange.co.uk/home-furnishings/vases-and-artificial-plants/artificial-flowers/lemon-garland#87165)
Why?
Parchment paper to line the tops. Kitchens collect greasy dust that sticks more than regular dust. Parchment paper can be wiped down or tossed when it gets dirty, much easier to clean than wood or particle board.
A backsplash or wallpaper above the cabinet to give it character and dimension
I use it to stash things I don‚Äôt like and don‚Äôt use, and after enough time has passed I say ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we get rid of x, we never use it.‚Äù Usually that works.
I keep my cat up there. She came with. Built in feather duster!
Pothos. Embrace the plants
Honestly looks really nice without anything! However, if you still decide to put something there, don't do fake ivy/flowers. Lots of oil and dust getting stuck on the leaves is gross.
Don't do anything.  Leave as is, looks great.  No dust collectors!
This is where my cats run their speedway races, I have to keep the runway clear
If you insist on ruining your beautiful kitchen with clutter, do it the right way with empty liquor bottles.  üòâ
My decor is dust! Lol
Previous house had a space like this and I had a few pieces of local pottery up there. Had to take it down and clean it when I dusted but I liked how it looked.
I would paint the wall at the top, the same colour as the side walls, not the grey that it is.  Aswell as covering the tops of the cabinets in paper
Leave it, but black or brass door handles would make that awesome green pop! Nice kitchen!
I am not someone who thinks soffets are our enemy. Love the cabinetry. I would say resist or try clear acrylic stands and cookbooks maybe mixed in with your own photos of culinary successes. The style of the kitchen doesn‚Äôt seem like it lends itself to a display of objets but if your headed in that direction I would have stands made to vary heights and display orientation of the things you select. No plants.
I have some large serving dishes that are also pretty that I keep up there. 

I keep my large serving tray on those little stands for records or books. 

I have a soup tureen, a big salad bowl, and a wok. 

This is also because I do not have a lot of cabinet space. But, I actually think they look pretty because they‚Äôre nice dishes, they match, and they fit the vibe of my kitchen
Thanks for this. My kitchen is similar and I wanted to add top cabinets but this looks extremely busy
Try adding a few neutral vases, trailing plants, or wood accents up top1 keep it simple and masculine. Skip quotes or clutter. Less is more!
Do not all anything above cabinets. No one wants to see clutter, that will become dusty clutter.
I‚Äôm gonna strongly discourage you from doing that. It looks clean and beautiful as it is. Adding stuff above the cabinets will only create dust catchers and clutter.
I love the light, where did you get that?ü§©
You could add some open shelves or hanging plants above the cabinets to create a cozy and stylish look.
Yea don't decorate it aha it already looks good as it is
It looks like a nice spot for a cat walk.  Any items put up there are game for being knocked off.  If you don't have cats, I would have to agree that it is lovely like it is.
Nothing let it be
How big is it? How much sunlight does it get? If you really want to put something maybe some plants like pothos.
I hate the space above cabinets. What a stupid waste of space that‚Äôs impossible to clean. 

I would rather a soffit or trim taken up to the ceiling than the dead zone. 

Or put cabinets above, save it for the stuff you use less frequently. (Holiday dishes, crock pot, whatever kitchen stuff you own but access infrequently.)
Why?
If the space bugs you get some pretty baskets or something. Looks nice to me as it is.
Pothos or someone other vining plant and create a natural garland. It will take a bit to grow out but it will be beautiful!
I put fake plants or plant vine across mine. Since yours is green already, maybe add color or purples and pink. Can find them in most craft stores.
Just leave it alone. It has nice clean lines now.
No
You don‚Äôt¬†
Oh you mean the dust and oil colllector?
NOT EVERY SQFT OF YOUR HOME NEEDS TO BE DECORATED
You must be a millennial. Our parents did this. That time is over
I collected a bunch of cookie jars‚Äî they were a great conversation piece
I have a couple cabinets like that and I put baskets that are the same colour as the cabinets.  A little extra storage and it blends in
Fake plants. You can find them at thrift stores. Just rinse them off to get rid of dust.
I added decorative plates/cookware to my space
If I decorate above my cabinets I like to use things that can go in the dishwasher or be handwashed in strong detergent. One house I had antique bean pots, some blue canning jars, and various other things as filler.

My cabinet tops were lower than the faces so I cut pieces of shelving wood to fit in the recessed area.
Do nothing . Leave bare putting things up that high is useless and only gathers dust . Keep it simple
Start collecting teapots.
A mural, maybe a beautiful seaside sunset scene¬†
Tile the backsplash and above the cabinets with same tile
You could maybe throw a basket up there if you need extra storage, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to put anything up there.
i think the cabinets just stop the eye too vehemently.  if it were me i would put glass in most of them and light them so your dishes and glassware can show, even with mildly opaque glass.
We‚Äôre going to need you to check in 6 months from now to show us that there are no wine bottles, wine corks, or fake flowers above your cabinets
Artificial trailing plants in wicker baskets
You can tape wax paper to the cabinets up there then you don't have to dust. You just replace the wax paper.
Why bother?
Yes, and very 1990‚Äôs
OP has ADHD and has it in their brain that above kitchen cabinets must be decorated, will not rest until decorated. Once decorated, will re-decorate 3 times until realizes they like their original idea of keeping it blank, which never actually was their original idea.
Cabinets that go to the ceiling should become the standard. If I ever do a kitchen reno, that's on my list.
This 100% if they own the house. No point in having a gap above the cabinets if you can avoid it.
Finally! There are only two best options here. This is one. The other is to make those panels functional doors for hidden storage of items you use infrequently (like party platters). My husband is a builder and we both loathe wasted space.

Seasonal decor with regular turnover would be the one thing that might ensure regular dusting and avoid becoming gross
Same! Reading these comments made me feel so sad and empty inside. It's really not hard to clean things up there, and I am definitely not a minimalist person. I have framed paintings above mine, and I'm able to clean them up just fine.

If you're reading this and dealing with stuck on/sticky grease, grab some 99% isopropyl alcohol. A paper towel with that on it will cut through just about anything sticky.  

Have fake plants collecting dust? You probably have a shower or water hose outside. Go take them for a bath and wipe them off. It's not that big of a deal! 

OP - Don't worry about what other people say. It's your house, and if decorating up there brings you joy, do it! Don't let others rain on your sunshine. Life is too short. :)
Do not do this. But, if you do, let me know and I'll mail you my extensive teapot collection.

But don't do this.
Thanks, Grandma!
Omg! I never thought about doing this, but that is so smart! Cleaning to tops of the cabinets is also such a pain!
That sounds like a lot more work than just dusting from time to time.
Or news print
I had no idea this would be my most controversial Reddit contribution. ü§£
This is a great idea to cover the tops with something. I'd actually use press and seal instead, though. That nasty greasy film that gets on top is so gross and hard to clean.
*newspaper
Great advice. I'm now curious to see if aluminum foil would help reflect some light.

My favourite cleaning influencer always does this and I‚Äôve been meaning to try!
Y'all, waste is relative. Do whatever gets the job done safely. If it creates excess waste, make up the difference elsewhere.
Why do I feel that this is the advice I have waited my whole life to hear?!
What that sounds incredibly wasteful‚Ä¶ why on earth would anyone do this
Oo, this is a fantastic idea.  Thank you!
Yep. It‚Äôs my big gripe with new-builds. Contractors are still building this stupid gap to the ceiling look.¬†
Yes! I see so many new cabinets that are hovering just below the ceiling leaving that tiny gap. I'm like, why???
The issue is in panel buildings like mine, apartments don't have even walls. On one end of the room, the room can be taller by 2 or 3 finger widths. I don't think there's a solution for these places üòÖ you will end up with a little gap anyway, that's just much harder to clean, and looks worse. If the gap is large, it's barely noticeable that the wall is uneven
What is the brand/name of that green?
Use LED strips that are the same color temp as your undercabinet lights (looks 2700-3000k?).  If you can't hardwire them, you run a small extension cord through fridge cab, and plug them into an outlet behind fridge, and use lights with remote.  They are awesome as an ambient nightlight, especially if dimmable.  I'd avoid the ones with RGB colors, as the whites/warm whites never look as good as dedicated color temp.
>Thank you!!

You're welcome!
Thank you so much...I really love that color!

But dust in a kitchen can be sticky and oiley
It's really not. It gets greasy and gross up there from cooking.
Actually it isn't.  The dust will be called with grease and stuff that you don't imagine will be up there. Trust us use wax paper.
Trust me, put down thick sheets of paper on top of the cabinets. You do not want to later on try balancing yourself on a ladder while trying to scrap off layers of grease and grime from the tops of the cabinets. I use a vent fan and try to mainly cook with the oven or crock pot. I still have to replace the sheets off the cabinets twice a year.
Are you 9 feet tall? The wax paper is way easier lol
I save and use the letters and promo documents from the mail. They‚Äôre usually made of thicker paper. I put several layers on top. They keep the tops clean after I replace them.
Butcher paper is easy to roll out and cut to fit and doesn‚Äôt contribute to plastic waste in our environment.
That stuff only sticks to certain plastic and glass
Press and seal deteriorates unfortunately, I use foil now.
If so it would likely only be directly above. It might give a wavy water look to that section of the ceiling.
I guess I don't clean enough, so the two times a year I put the wax paper up there it doesn't feel too wasteful. It is easier than hot water and cleaning solution and wiping it down.
My house had kitchen cabinets that went to the ceiling. We sold it and the contractor that bought it to flip, put in new cabinets and left a teeny tiny gap. Now why wouldn't they just put a piece of molding up there. You can't get in there to clean.

Just my humble opinion. I agree that having a space up there is just a pain.

I read this as butt dust. Signing off for the day
No way. All the oil and gunk from cooking. You just replace it every 6 months or so.
Use Murphy‚Äôs oil soap spray and a damp microfiber rag to clean.
Yes! Especially over the stove. If you decorate, only put up seasonal decorations so it doesn't get gross.
A little windex cleans it right up.
How?? My duster extends to 9ft
I put it on my watermelons when I cut them in half and then put them back in the refrigerator.
I have used it on wood when painting, I have even used it on terra cotta when painting that as well. As long as the surface it free from dust and dirt, it will stick to the top of those cabinets.
Press and Seal sticks to human skin.  Recommended to waterproof my husband's incision while showering after surgery.

Same problem here.  I'll try the foil later and see what it does.
I decided not to bother with the foil, since it wouldn't be reflective as soon as it gets dusty. Even mirrors would fail. I'll have to accept shadows. Cabinet lighting that high is a pain.

Oof, the r/tvtoohigh people are gonna have a field day
That‚Äôs going to look awful, and be awful to watch. 

Find a different wall for the tv.
Put the tv on a wall with an L-shaped sitting area that faces the tv and the fireplace.  Any tv would look awful there, but a too-large tv will look ridiculous, imo.
Do not do this under any circumstances!

1. TVs do not belong over fireplaces, art does.
2. It will be ridiculously high.
3. You have two perfectly good walls there for a console to place a tv on (not hang 4 feet above like some freak).

Take a big breath and abandon this idea immediately.
TVs don‚Äôt go over the fireplace. And especially not if it‚Äôs wider. 

Get an L shaped couch and put a tv stand and the tv on the wall to the left or right of the fireplace.
Do not put a TV there. In addition to the awkward placement of a huge TV, you have to deal with glare from the windows. I would put the TV on one of the long, bare walls.
As everyone else is saying, I concur. Way too high for a TV to be there. You're honestly gonna hurt your neck and choke on food while looking up that high. Place it on a different wall; you'll be happy you did!
I think it would be way too high up, your neck will be hurting after one show
Are you going to watch tv standing up? Otherwise, not sure how this will work. I mean they do say sitting is the new cigarette smoking, so maybe standing to watch tv is the way to go.
Might look into the Mantel Mount to lower your TV. to a height Redditors will approve of.

Offering a different viewpoint than most comments you‚Äôll get - the TV should be the focal point of a seating area if you want it to be. Ours is, because we‚Äôre never sitting without the TV on. There is no problem putting a TV over a fireplace in general, and to me it usually looks great. It might be a bit high (though again, I disagree with almost every tvtoohigh post) and this is a super cool area so you might be better off going on a side wall with the couch facing that TV wall and potentially a second seating area centered at the fireplace.
üòÇ
lol thank you, I thought it will look awkward as well. I don‚Äôt want to face away from the pool outside might need to use a different room.
I second this!
Thank you for the idea. We already have a nice L shaped couch.
The wall to the left is a large sliding glass door facing the pool, would you suggest putting on the left wall facing away from the pool?
Haha, we just bought the home and this was supposedly the entertainment room and it has a fan above it and the other room has a  chandelier for the dining table where the TV would‚Äôve been nice so I think we‚Äôre going to have to do some switches. I would like to put the dining table in this room.
Yes, this room is not suited for a TV at all.
Do anything other than putting a giant ugly tv on the main focal point in your home.
To the right is the pool I meant
I would love to have a fireplace in my dining room or kitchen nook. Go for it!
You can use pull down tv mount. So you can pull it down when watching.

I think full wall is always better! Makes your ceilings feel taller and the room feel more spacious. It won‚Äôt feel like a lot of curtain once all your furnishings are in.
What do you mean by full wall?  They certainly need to be bigger than they are.  Hang the rod almost to the ceiling and the curtains should be long enough to touch the floor. Also leave enough width on either side of the windows to stack the curtains when open and not block the light."

Robot vacuum docking station
I really like the plants surrounding it, but instead of plants inside, I would personally make it into a unique little focal point.

Using either a print that speaks to you, to cover the back wall, or possibly a wallpaper print that you like, same idea, with covering the back wall, or something more minimal like the 3D foam, faux brick panels, white, or black, or more standard red/brown brick to fill it in, back and/or sides also. (If you are able, I would also remove the baseboard.) Then I would find a tray, or dish that fits nicely inside, filling it with varying sizes of flameless candles, and again depending on your style, maybe rocks, etc...or simply plain without a tray.

I think it would throw such a cool light, especially at night with no, or minimal lights on in the room.

Running a d√©cor store means I get to hear a lot from interior designers who drop by. Over time I picked up a few rules that make an average room look like it came out of a magazine.

First,rugs need to ground the furniture. If it‚Äôs floating in the middle of the floor, it looks unfinished. The front legs of your sofa and chairs should be sitting on it.

Second, furniture works better when it is pulled in a little. Everyone wants to push things tight against the walls, but even in small spaces creating a defined zone feels more intentional and cozy.

Third, always test your layout before you start dragging heavy stuff. Tape outlines on the floor or drop the pieces into a quick mockup in xdesign. 5 minutes of planning saves you an hour of back pain.

Designers bill clients hundreds an hour to explain these basics. I tell my customers for free because I want them to actually enjoy what they buy instead of wondering why their living room feels off.

Color: different shades of the same color, rather than the exact same color, will make your space look more human and less hotel. So if you think, ‚ÄúI have to buy these pillows, they‚Äôre the exact same shade of blue as the rug,‚Äù consider what it might look like if you bought pillows in a darker or lighter shade of blue. Repeating the same exact hue in different accents, accessories, furniture, and paintings will usually look like the Holiday Inn and you won‚Äôt be able to tell why.
Putting a room together is a lot like putting a painting together‚Äî color, shape, dominance, repetition, alternation, balance, contrast, unity are all aspects you can out into a room‚Äôs layout, decor, theme(s), color and emphasis. 

Personally, I‚Äôd pick maybe three favorite colors for a room and have them in picture proportions‚Äî70 percent one, 25 the other and 5 prevent the last. I‚Äôd choose one to be light, one to be medium in color/depth, and one to be dark /darkest. 
I‚Äôd add accents to repeat colors/shapes or contrast or texture and to get in that repetition and alternation, and alternate heights for art and I‚Äôd pick a theme or style ahead of time and research it a bit as well, and see what resonates with you by covering over pieces of the room in the picture and seeing what‚Äôs making it work for you or what‚Äôs making the room itself work and try repeating it in your own room design.
It's not exactly free but: Hang art you care about and hang it lower than you think you should. I've seen the same Ikea print in virtually everyone's house, all in a cheap black frame hung about 6 inches too high, and it makes the space look impersonal and uneven. When I pick a piece I think: Do I love this? What do I know about this? Does it interest me? Does it fit with our other pieces? Is the frame good quality or will I have to reframe this? Who is the artist, what is the style, am I connected to this piece in some way?

I also suggest hanging items that aren't framed poster prints - think about texture, weight, color, and light refraction when you hang your work and how it all works together. An oil or acrylic canvas in a wooden frame reflects light much differently than a poster print in a black frame. A quilt on the wall can make a bedroom softer but isn't appropriate for a place with cooking or lots of natural light. Hanging art with a mind to location, intentionality, and personal taste take a house from ""showroom"" to ""comfortable home""
Mixing patterns, mixing decor styles, having enough decorative items (art, mirrors, and plants especially), but perhaps most importantly, having items that fit the scale of the space! A lot of people I know have items too small (only occasionally too large) for their space. Bigger wall art especially goes a long way to make a space look designed.
One of the biggest returns at furniture stores is for ‚Äúno-fit‚Äù. Be sure to measure doorways and ceiling heights‚Ä¶and keep in mind if you are going upstairs or trying to pivot in a hallway that big beautiful sofa might not make it. 

Also, just because you can fit a giant sectional, doesn‚Äôt mean you should. You don‚Äôt need every inch to be seating in a room. Be sure to leave space for side tables, floor lamps, plants‚Ä¶.otherwise it looks overwhelming and unintentional. 

Also. I have so many customers who say ‚ÄúI need a 180‚Äù sofa‚Äù because they have a 180‚Äù wall. I‚Äôm like what you doing in that room? You gonna have 8 people on one sofa all lined up next to eachother? How they gonna talk to eachother? Lean around? Think about how you‚Äôll use the space, who is in that room most and then plan what pieces to purchase rather than trying to fill a whole blank wall with sofa.
Remember that it‚Äôs YOUR space. You‚Äôre the only one who has to like it.

Design trends come and go. Rather than picking what the internet says will be the next big thing, choose what you like
I never get a helpful reminder like OP‚Äôs when I‚Äôm shopping for furniture. They just push expensive designers on me.
Be honest with me, are gallery walls out? I have so many vintage oils (not pricey) I‚Äôve collected and loved, but have not put up.
Keeping it impeccably clean and uncluttered.
Painting your ceiling
Texture matters. You know what something should feel like before you even touch it, and the eyes like to ""feel"" contrasting textures. Less is more for styling open shelving, mantle and the like. Layer your lighting, always.
I once arrange my sofa at a 45 degree angle from the wall.  The loveseat was at 135 degrees.  It was an interesting layout in an otherwise dull beige room.

Disagree on the rug thing.  Depending on the size of the room, it can work better to have the main furniture off the rug.  But the size and shape does have to be considered.
I have like 5 different shades of pink in my living space ü§£
what does picture proportions mean here?
What rules do you use for determining picture height? Typically for larger pictures I just align the top with the top of door frames.
Designer fees keep going through the roof. Just for a consultation, it‚Äôs crazy expensive.actually you can figure all this out on your own with xd and simulate the layout to come up with your own answers.
Do you like the look of a gallery wall? If so it's not out for you! (Also I still see it a lot in design groups I follow!)
I don‚Äôt personally think art can ever be ‚Äôout‚Äô - that includes ways of displaying it. Art is inherently intensely personal - and a curated collection of vintage oil paintings you‚Äôve pulled together over time is exactly the kind of thing that SHOULD be letting your personality and taste shine through.

If you‚Äôre a little uncertain, I really recommend putting in a gallery rail so you can move your art around without messing up your walls!
I would like to see an example of this situation.
Oh sorry! The proportions of shapes of colors! Like you might want 70% of a room this color/light/medium/dark, etc
Obligatory not a designer, but it really depends on the space. The general advice is to hang them at the average eye line of the viewer - for a standing person usually somewhere around 58‚Äù (This is what we use generally in public spaces in our house.)

I drop them a few inches to 56‚Äù for my own private spaces, like my bedroom - it feels cosy and intimate, and I think there‚Äôs something pleasing about design being meant for the creator rather than some arbitrary viewer. I tend to use larger‚Äîscale art placed higher at around 60‚Äù for my husband‚Äôs spaces, as he is taller than I am - the larger size helps the space feel balanced even moving things a bit higher.  

I also tend to fit art around my furniture a lot (e.g.I had a small painting hanging above my bed previously, and centred it within the ‚Äòsquare‚Äô above the bed, which ended up being higher than I would normally go but grounded the space nicely) and go for gallery walls, which start with focal pieces at the aforementioned eye line and work out from there.
What is xd?
I don‚Äôt have the design and color composition chops to go through with it just yet, I have to proceed carefully. Thanks for your input.
Yesss! I love your thoughts on this, I am currently working on drapes, but I have wanted to work on gallery rails for a while. That way the pictures can be changed out easily without nail holes on the wall. Thanks!
interesting, thanks! do you recommend a place one might read more about this kind of idea?
when you say work outwards, do you mean horizontally or also vertically?¬†
I don‚Äôt have any specific sources I use now, I just remember it from a watercolor magazine I read about  and had written down about eleventy billion years ago.
I‚Äôd just google principles of design ( there‚Äôs certainly more than what I put out there)and see which site comes up with a list that works for you. 


With composition of pictures, for example, I often think about gradation, unity, dominance, alternation, repetition, color, shape,  and value much of the time, as well as things like working in complementary colors and lost and found edges, ( where you join/blur shapes at their edges so they don‚Äôt look like cartoon cut outs) and things that lead the eye around a painting. Caravaggio‚Äôs The Taking of Christ is a real masterclass in painting design principles, for example. 
Some of those principles work great in decorating and some aren‚Äôt as useful. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs elements of design sites just about decorating that could give better and much more clear and applicable advice than mine as well; they may be better for your eye. I use the elements of design that I‚Äôm most used to when I decorate, and they‚Äôre all from painting. They‚Äôve worked for me, but I also have a real clear sense of what I like and want in a room already, most of the time. 

I‚Äôm hopefully closing on a house on Halloween and I will be decorating much of the new place in my own taste and colors. Things like shark jaws, crystal pieces, stained glass, a black kitchen, oriental rugs, Willow ware dishes, statues of crows, paintings of wolves/apex predators, an angler fish, eels, etc, ( I gave away my actual human skull that used to sit next to a white stained glass snail lamp, they provided a great contrast and anchor to the tall, feathery green fern behind them and now I kinda regret that decision ) and well, a shitload of other things and colors that are really specific to me are what I‚Äôll be bringing there from here. 

The older I get, too, lol, the less I care how my things look like weird choices to anyone else. For the fun of it, I‚Äôll put some photos up as I go in that house, even if it‚Äôs just for a room or two; what I can do will depend on my budget. Life‚Äôs too short not to live it your way, y‚Äô know? 

Feather your nest *your* way. 

To start, I‚Äôd maybe look at colors and things that are most beloved and common to *you* and think about where and/or how you‚Äôd like to see them in your house. Do you have a favorite shade of a blue or a warm ivory or a dark emerald green you like and wear a lot? Then maybe consider how you‚Äôd like to see that color in a room you spend a lot of time in‚Äî on the walls? Not on the walls, but in your comfiest throw blanket on the sofa? In a piece of furniture? In some wall art? In a rug? 

It‚Äôs really up to you what sort of self expression you want. 
Worse comes to worst, you paint over it or return the rug or blanket and try something else. 

Good luck, have fun and above all, enjoy expressing yourself and emphasize *you*."

I'd  let it be.
Love this soft cute green. So pretty!!!
It doesn't look like it needs to be painted. It's in good shape and the colour looks nice.
I like the green too!
I like the green but it doesn‚Äôt go with the brick. It‚Äôs hard to say what color/shade the brick is from the picture. 
I‚Äôd favor a light color over dark.  I think it‚Äôs really important to compliment the brick. So from this picture, I‚Äôd say a creamy white or beige. If the brick has more black tones than red tones then I‚Äôd say a light gray. 
Have you tried using an painting app to get different ideas? If so, post some pics of different combinations. Sherwin Williams has a pretty good app.
I don‚Äôt mind the colour. I think that it would look better if you took out the three box hedges and put something cuter for landscaping. They cover the brick so much. The corner one is nice tho.
I wouldn't. It's beautiful. 

I would add some more organic landscaping. The arch above the door is the only curve and that's a shame.
Love the green and white.
If you really want to paint it I‚Äôd say white and add black shutters to the windows to make it pop more. Even if you don‚Äôt paint it, you should still add the black shutters.
I‚Äôd normally say white or gray but what about a dark blue, like a navy/grayish blue
Burnt orange would be super cool.
I really liked the current color. Maybe a fresh coat of paint to make it look new.

Where I live, every new or remodeled house has been painted gray in all kinds of shades
green,
Fine how it is
Rust color to go with the brick tones and then a cream color for the trim. White is too stark for the bricks.

Here it is in a medium blue gray. Personally, I like the color you have, but something like this might be a nice change.
I‚Äôd paint it white
White?
Anything other than green. Pastel lilac/purple for example, creamy banana yellow. You can start with Pantone website
Yep.

Thank you...It needs it.¬† It's been 15 years since we painted it last.¬† This side of the house is usually in the shade.¬† The back is beat up pretty bad from the sun.

Oh wow!  Thank you so much!  I hate to ask....but can you do one that is off white?  We are debating between the blue gray and off white..
Awwwww, like every new build? Ugh, such a shame. Tell him to at least reverse that pleaseeeee.
I hope you aren't in a very hot place with no shade if he wants a dark color, otherwise it will be hot or your power bill will cost a lot more.

Any rug and curtain recommendations are much appreciated!

You have a great start. I like it very much. I didn‚Äôt study it long but a couple of things jump out at me. The white chairs are overlapping the sofa. Back them each up a couple of feet. It‚Äôs okay if only the front feet of the chairs are on the rug. Back the lamp up too. It will give the whole seating group more breathing room. If you have an end table of some size place at the right side of the sofa. (From the back of the sofa - right/ lamp side. On that table place a substantial colorful lamp to give the area some punch. Orange? Peacock blue? Hang some art at the blank white wall space between the windows. I think you have great taste. The draperies are dramatic. Just keep adding stuff you like looking at. Don‚Äôt fixate on matching stuff. That can look contrived. I think the rug under the dining table is great. It‚Äôs the right size and is beautiful. Try putting some great lamps on the buffet for starters. Light scattered around that space will dramatically improve things. Good luck. Have fun!! Buy what you love!!
I agree the dining room rug is beautiful
Thank you both! I love the rug but I‚Äôm afraid the grey and pink doesn‚Äôt go with the golden brown kitchen cabinets. I‚Äôm rethinking though, maybe it could work with different curtains?
I do really like this overall! Something about the curtains is giving fancy office instead of home. I agree, maybe try a contrasting color and also maybe add a sheer layer of curtains underneath for a more homey feel"

I think before you even try painting the walls a different color you've gotta fix that lighting. Its very white and harsh. You've probably hear the ""big light bad"" speech already before, but its true. Get some lamps and create a lighting scheme with a mixture of diffused and directional/task light, all of which are warmer than 2500k. You might find yourself suddenly not mad at the current wall color, or at the very least you'll be able to see more accurately what you want it to look like at night.
Your living room furniture isn't warm toned.  With the white trim and doors, the white cabinets in the kitchen are fine.

I would do as suggested and pull the colors from the artwork as your color scheme.  If you don't want to go that bright, then match the colors with paint chips and then go a shade or two lighter and use those as your colors.

Replace the rug with something in the new colors.
The walls in the dining/living area are a very light beige on my phone. I love the colors in the art you have on the wall. Use those colors for accessories in the kitchen like towels, and washcloths, colorful bowls, and also for sofa pillows. Add a couple wooden cutting boards in the kitchen, a colorful dining table centerpiece. Maybe get a colorful rug. Just splashes of bright color here and there would be pretty against the light background.
EDIT - for some reason I don‚Äôt have the option to edit my post, but wanted to add for clarity, that I‚Äôm looking for colors for the overall room, not necessarily the walls. The walls can‚Äôt be painted for another year per the builder‚Äôs advice. So I‚Äôm looking for color suggestions for curtains and rugs, and runners, and accessories that can pull the adjacent spaces together
Replace your living room rug with something multi color, use the art work as inspiration. Something like this would work well [https://www.birchlane.com/rugs/pdp/elmsford-oriental-hand-hooked-wool-bluebrown-area-rug-b000339869.html?piid=2077061615](https://www.birchlane.com/rugs/pdp/elmsford-oriental-hand-hooked-wool-bluebrown-area-rug-b000339869.html?piid=2077061615)  
 Once you get the rug, pick a shade from the rug for the curtains,‚Ä¶.or do the curtains in a textured fabric same color as your dining chairs if you don‚Äôt want too much color. The kitchen will blend just fine, once you get other two rooms set you can decide if you need to bring in some brown/wood decor, or maybe a canister in a color or style to tie in with other art. Also, you should replace that black frame on your artwork with a dark wooden one.
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt necessarily mean colors for the walls yet, more as an overall theme like rugs, curtains, and accessories. I need to wait a year to paint per the builder‚Äôs advice. I‚Äôll add an edit to make that clearer
And no overhead lighting!
Even so, fixing the lighting will help. Maybe go to the hardware store and find some color pallette booklets where all the paint chips are. It seems like your space is pretty cool toned, so see which palletes include the colors already in the space and take inspiration from what colors the paint compant suggests, then use that as a guide for buying other furnishings.
Thanks, I‚Äôll go to the hardware store to check that out"

Floor & Decor. They have all kinds of slabs cut already to these dimensions. If you want to cut them you need to rent a power saw from Home Depot (most of which are dented). I‚Äôd say if you can cut out the sawing aspect it makes the table making process much simpler.

you need more height variability, the couch and bed are the same height. i suggest raising the bed, adding a headboard, putting art above the sofa, floor lamp between the two, and maybe even string lights along the ceiling?
Personally I really dislike accent walls where the accent color is dramatically darker than the rest of the walls. It gives that one wall an extreme visual weight, and especially since in your room the green wall isn't the focus, it makes the whole space feel un-unified and uncomfortable. I would paint all the walls the same color, maybe a warm cream tone or a light neutral brown. You can even go bold, just don't single out one wall. I think that will make your big white wall feel less intimidating and it'll make it so that it doesn't have to compete with the green wall for your attention.
Get a tall decorative folding screen to place between your bed and sofa.  THEN worry about paint. And what kind of industrial door is that by the desk? Is this a former supply room??

How deep is it? I would put in cabinetry with drawers at the bottom (a false one at the very bottom) and a cabinet with possibly a pull out hanging rod if it's deep enough and too deep to reach to the back, otherwise shelves.

I‚Äôd build in a bookshelf starting at the top of the angle, boxing in the angle to hide it.
Light. Looks so dark.
Either shelves or drawers inserted with a panel on the bottom.
Bookshelves or storage. Great use of space.
New paint. Then shelves across.
Clorox
The plaster looks kinda cool like lime wash
In Europe they use to call that an apartment
Suit of armor
Built in cupboard (on plinth to box in the stairs) or built in bookcase (hide stair in false cupboards at the bottom).  Both custom jobs but will be worth it.
I‚Äôd start with sage
Reading these responses, I swear I haven‚Äôt laughed this hard in so so long. Thank you for this post and thank you for the responses.  üòÜ
How deep is it? If it were me I would frame out the bottom and sheetrock, texture, paint so it matches the walls. Then you‚Äôd have a rectangular alcove you could install deep shelves on for blanket storage, photos, decor. Make it look intentional. The biggest issue is that awkward exposed corner. Hide it permanently. 

And then the obvious: flooring and new baseboards. Different paint.

It sounds like you're really thinking through the best way to make that corner functional and safe! Maybe adding a small curtain or a foldable door could provide some coverage without blocking access, and installing a rail might help you open up the space when needed. It's great that you're considering both safety and practicality‚Äîgood luck with your project!
Yes this exactly
sounds like a great idea, I‚Äôll look into it thanks!

OP post what the corner looks like post Reno, slap all these mfs calling the place horrible spooky names. I think if you put a box or facade over the angled bit, and then put shelves on top, you could put a door and make it a linen cabinet, or keep open shelving and make it a book stand. Put some strip LED in it and it can look real neat!
Ah right, even a shoe closet could do because of how deep it is so you have space.

i would take that shelf down,patch things and paint it and just pretend that shelf was never there
2nd TV.
Maybe some plants? There are some that don‚Äôt need too much water so you won‚Äôt have to take them down too often
It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that was a TV.
Nothing. Remove the dust-catcher shelf.
[deleted]
Real plants ü™¥
Holiday decorations.
Lego display shrine!
Ignore space until you take shelf down as shelf serves no purpose whatsoever
Honestly, I‚Äôd knock out the shelf and mount the tv higher with a nice frame. I love the led lights too
One large thing.  Just 1.
I'd hang a pendant grow light, and put it on a timer or smart plug. Then find a few plants that will flourish under that lighting -- no herbs or vegetables, not heavy flowerers. Just a nice grouping of foliage plants like pothos or philodendrons or ficus. The plants I mentioned don't require heavy watering. I don't know how accessible the area is for watering, but you can get away with a couple of waterings per month with these.
Lots of greenery. Some tall and some draped over the edge
That would definitely be my holiday shelf if it were mine‚Ä¶
Holiday/seasonal themed decorations‚Ä¶..
Beautiful vintage large Swung vases
Moose head. Or bear head.
Gargoyles
1. Add more identical shelves as needed and use it to display Lego - enclose with anti-glare plexiglass to avoid it being a dust collector. 
2. Fake plants so they don‚Äôt need to be watered. 
3. Remove the shelf. Move the tv up higher. Can decorate the wall with a myriad of Nanoleaf lights.
Cheese. Start putting cheese all over in there
Maybe you could transform that empty shelf space into a mini gallery with framed photos, artwork, or cherished keepsakes‚Äîsomething that adds personality and warmth to the room!
A cat
Piss off the r/tvtoohigh crowd and put a fireplace above your TV.

Genuine question here. Why do people put their TV so low? üò¨ If you‚Äôre open to raising it a bit, I would take that shelf down. It‚Äôs very busy here with not much space in the corner and all.
This is the way
Yep, considering this as well.  The shelf is a bit wonky and leans forwards a bit which makes displaying stuff up there difficult sometimes (as is).
Epic game day setup.
Lol!  Would be funny if that's just some wall art we had.  My hubs was watching My Name is Earl.
Then hang a nice piece of art.
It probably would be a good place for those if we had any.  Lol
Panther
I need a step stool to get up there, but those plants could probably do well with a pretty pendant and grow light bulb.
Ha!  My dogs would go nuts.
Exactly.   That's what makes it tough for me.  Lol
I've considered that too.  It's just how it was when my hubs bought the place and therefore it's just how it is and will always be.  (Unless I change it of course lol)

Getting rid of stuff. Getting rid of stuff. Getting rid of stuff
Warmer toned lighting changed my life
Plants.
Warm LED bulbs 2700-3000 Kelvin. Don't mix them with cool bulbs in the same space. Only warm bulbs, huge difference.

https://preview.redd.it/thuqatjlw0rf1.jpeg?width=1053&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d625e2bf1e0597309474729b1085ee73b9a452f6
I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äúcandle person‚Äù (you know the type). 

And then I discovered unscented tea lights and pillar candles. I should buy stock in these things. I buy tea lights in boxes of 100 and in the fall/winter I go through about 8 a day (all going at the same time, in the evening) PLUS like 5 pillar candles also going simultaneously. I always buy white unscented ones and the tea light holders I have are by Orrefors so they‚Äôre clear glass and reflect the light in pretty patterns depending on the shape of the holder. 

Even my husband has commented that he never would light candles on his own, but he likes how it makes our living room super cozy in the fall/winter.
Throwing out/selling/donating stuff i dont use or need. So that everything in my house have space. Easier to keep floors and surfaces clean and clutterfree.

And packing down summerwardrobe/winter wardrobe when its not in use for half a year.  Makes it less full in my wardrobe.
 Looks neater
Lamps instead of (or an option opposed to) overhead lighting. 

Plants

Colors and textures!
Adding different, multiple levels of lighting is  the biggest one.
Having cats! :)
Large paintings of ships on stormy seas
A nice rug to tie the room together. 

Seriously, one that was properly sized really helped. 

Also hanging all my art
Give stuff a home. Key hook. Tossy tray. Folder. Box. Don't let important things get lost in ambiguous piles.
Lights // unlike a lot of folks, I like cool lights for my recess but warm for lamps we use during different times of the day.  I also like my paint and cabinets better ü§£

Paint‚Ä¶can‚Äôt believe the difference ‚Äî but do the *entire* room, not just the walls.  Hitting trim really makes the room new.

Fixtures. Lights, doorknobs, cabinet hardware all made it feel more ‚Äúours‚Äù
Hanging art/photos that we truly enjoy, rugs, lamps with smart bulbs so I can change the intensity and a cozy blanket. 
One change that guests  commented on but couldn‚Äôt pin point what was different - when I changed up the dog beds to coordinate better with the rooms they were in.
A boring thing, one of these - you can out the iron back hot and and it‚Äôs strong enough to hold the ironing board out of the way, it all fits behind a door and you can barely notice it when you open the door. If you keep your iron or board anywhere even remotely ugly or inconvenient this gets your shit out of your way.

This thread is looking like a stealth-ad from Big Bulb.
Switching out soft white bulbs for standard Reveal LED bulbs. Soft white has a yellowish hue. Reveal bulbs are natural light - not yellow and not blue. It‚Äôs a soft natural light color. Reveal bulbs are a game changer.
Got rid of my large dining table, pushed my love seat into the dining area.  Then arranged the 6 dining chairs around the sofa and love seat to create 2 conversation areas in one large space.  For me it works.
got like 60 yards of fabric and draped it over my bay windows. it's so pretty! got it all for like $35 (rip joannes)
Window treatments.
I‚Äôm was having the hardest time making my home feel warm and cozy. No matter what I did it just wasn‚Äôt happening and I was beginning to hate everything about it. Then I switched all of my light bulbs from cool light to warm light. Instantly warm and cozy. All the things I had done to make it such before the light switch were instantly exactly what I wanted. It changed everything about my home and I love it so much. Changing your light bulbs can be the biggest change
Taking notes üìù
When I remodeled my own home, I went with a light color palet on all the walls and chantilly lace white trim - gone were the multiple colors on the walls.  it is light & bright and better for showing off the more colorful art on the walls
Declutterring and not buying cheap looking decor
Robot litter box. Having a sparkling clean litter box 99% of the time made my place so much better.
Going through all the storage space about once a year and organizing it.
I have a Victorian house. When I moved in the walls were all a cold grey/blue or white.

Painting in dark rich colours immediately made the house feel better

For years my apartment looked like ‚Äútemporary storage with Wi-Fi.‚Äù That saturday morning,I finally throw the overhead light for a warm lamp, bought a woven basket for laundry, stuck a plant in the bathroom. Unique, cozy, almost like an adult space. Then my mom visited and said, ‚ÄúCute! Feels like a nice Airbnb.‚Äù ‚Ä¶Ma‚Äôam, this is literally my home.
Full carpeting
‚Ä¶. And keeping only a handful of items of decor  that are meaningful.
Omg yes.  A house I moved into had hospital white lights everywhere.  They were all smart lights and expensive so I knew I couldn't convince my roomie to switch.
My plants and trees are fake and I am perfectly happy about it.  Much easier since I travel.
I‚Äôve got an open plan kitchen and lounge and need warm based lights in the lounge to relax but I‚Äôve always chosen the brightest cool light available for the kitchen as it‚Äôs a work space. 

Hmm, I wonder if I should change it over or if there‚Äôs a way to successfully blend them in the same space.
I did tea lights one winter and had soot all over my windows and white trim. Had to repaint a lot.  Hope you are buying better candles than I did.
I have some fake candles (have a curious cat with very long fur), and some of those even have timers! So they turn on at the same time every night and then automatically turn off after like 6 hours. They're nice, and much better for the air quality too.

Yeah, and if you‚Äôve already got too much decor and it doesn‚Äôt all go, okay, retire some stuff for a season and swap it out for the next. 

If your core items are neutral and cohesive enough, decor and soft furnishings can make big changes in the vibe of a space.
Hey, I have no problem with that. I'd rather see a green fake plant than a dead real plant. I have 75 healthy live plants in my house, and a tray of fake succulents on my dining room table because I can't keep those fuckers alive.
Any recs? Looking for a tall faux plant for a dark corner of my living room!
You could make it so there's optional cool bright light when you're actually cooking/prepping in the kitchen? Turn that off when you're done and you're back to a cozy living space.
Lighting designers learn early in training to avoid mixing warm & cool bulbs. https://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/s/QzpP7kvT27.  In your own home, do whatever.... but if you're wanting the best result mixing them is just not attractive to the human eye. So up to you, but WARM bulbs are a small change almost anyone can make to bump up the comfort of their home.
I like the battery powered ones (or rechargeable with remotes. Easy to turn on and off, no soot and no chance of a fire.

Really pretty!
What‚Äôs the wall color?
For seasonal decor, i have just a few things for each season. Like for Fall, i have a door wreath, a few blown glass pumpkins, a sofa pillow, a centerpiece for the table and a throw quilt that I made. It‚Äôs nice to change things up but having just one small box of things is really manageable.
That's amazing!  I am chuckling at someone being so successful with 75 plants and a single tray of fake ones.   We have 2 real plants of some variety, they're not mine.  They always look crappy lol.  We forget about them and then she will drown them in the sink and their leaves go all brown at the tips.
Oh gosh, no.  I just found my trees and plants at Goodwill!  Hopefully someone knowledgeable replies.
That also works for cat safety

I don't think you need a gallery wall. It depends on what the rest of the wall looks like but from the picture, just a slightly larger artwork hung a little lower would really complete it. If I may, I suggest getting original art rather than something mass produced. Thrift something if you must, that's what I do!
It's not really too small but is hung too high.  Will it be part of the gallery wall?  It's hard to give much advice from one picture.  Maybe wait till the rest of your stuff comes in and then see what is missing or needs enhanced.
Curtains. Grown-up curtains.
yeah i wasn‚Äôt convinced on the gallery wall! ill go thrift a bigger piece then. thank you so much!
yeah i just a previous nail in the wall and hung it there to see! i think ill try to put it more centered to the couch and then seperate with an endtable and then have the gallery wall on the left?"

My wife and I did this when our kitchen fridge died. We put the new one in the basement to encourage us to use stairs more. The solution is a sturdy basket that brings up cooking ingredients and things. 1-2 trips is enough, usually, and it lets us move everything on the counter into an appliance station where the old fridge was.

Wait what? You have to walk to any fridge to get to it regardless lol that fridge isn‚Äôt even that far? You turn from the island and take like 3 steps and you‚Äôre at the fridge. and also you could prop the door open or even get rid of those doors completely
It‚Äôs such a small kitchen! In my head, this is for a single person or a couple who travel a lot or eat out or order in a lot. In my head, they use the big fridge for chilling drinks or to keep some food fresh for the occasional cooking challenge. They‚Äôre not, like, using that big fridge for 3 meals/7days/31 days a month like the rest of us are

You did a really good job with the space you gave! Lots of counter space. And that floor is gorgeous.
I love the look too! How did you plug in the lights you used under the mirrored cabinets? Do you have a hidden outlet?
Was it pre-finished, or did you do that yourself? Because it's really clean and well done.
does that matter when english is the dominant language on the planet? 

I wouldn't name it S.H.I.T. or F.U.C.K. no matter what it meant in any other language.
Like I don‚Äôt even have a big kitchen and my fridge is just as far from my stove as that fridge is from the island
Oh god ""this might come as a shock to you"" sigh... 

There's no functionality in that kitchen.

Also, it's funny how you fell into your pit. Mine is also a different perspective. I actually want functionality.

full shade! I don't love the wind chimes there. any suggestions welcome 

How about a cozier welcome mat in front do the door? Something fun and sweet or funny?
Love the full shade!  Would you consider swapping out the ‚Äúlots of pots‚Äù area for a ‚Äúconversational seating‚Äù area ?

I can see moving the bench to your wall with the plug, then adding 2 chairs under the window. With a small table between them for a decor moment (like your pumpkin).

You can still put some seasonal decor under the bench. There are ‚Äúbrick hangers‚Äù that can help you put something interesting on the wall above the charger (don‚Äôt drill into your walls).  A light metal star, colorful wood signage, whatever makes you happy.

You can Replace the chimes with a pretty hanging ‚Äúchandelier like‚Äù fixture if you place a coffee table underneath it. Otherwise I‚Äôd just leave it.  You want to be able to walk comfortably into the space. 

These things will make the space say ‚Äúhey- hang out here!‚Äù Which is the vibe you are describing.  

Having all the clutter of plants and pots says ‚Äúno room for you here.‚Äù
It would create a nicer atmosphere if we installed lighting with a warm 2700K glow.

Hanging plants (different heights)above the pots or pics/art on the walls  or sign above the door or any combination of these.
I think you can make this space cozy by adding outdoor furniture (couch, or a couple chairs to lounge on and outdoor pillows) you can put the plants on some nice side tables and hang some macram√© planters
I would get a tall vertical plant stand for up against the wall. It would add more interest. You can put more than plants in it too. They would maybe open the area up so you could add a small rug and bistro table if it is a place / area you would like to sit and have a beverage sometimes. That would be a start for now.
I would put taller native plants like sword ferns and *Aruncus dioicus*. You could also do deer ferns and *Polypodium scouleri*. *Fragaria vesca* would work in a hanging pot. I have some of those in full shade under cover and they don‚Äôt really die back in winter. A vine maple would work there too. 

You could also add a small table or plant stand to create multiple levels.
I'd love some hanging plants but my options are very limited with this space being full shade, and winter is coming here in the pnw so soon the plants will all be empty pots...
Texan here. Sorry for greenery limitations. Artificial seasonal large wreath on left wall - it doesn‚Äôt have to be floral. But anything that sticks out from the wall would create an obstacle to someone approaching the door. On the right side, art that represents local or PNW scenes, myths, or traditions. 

Here, I might hang a lonestar, set of longhorns, metal cowboy cutout, or picture of bluebonnets. Celebrate your region, school affiliation, favorite team, ski slopes or anything else that makes it YOU. 

It‚Äôs fine now for an apartment but it doesn‚Äôt look homey. Make it your own. It just needs your personality to make it shine."

I am just looking for some input/advice.

The first thing to consider is who are the guests that would be staying and what are their needs? Are they older or have mobility issues? Larger people? Young and single? 

Do you want the room to be anything but a guest room when not in use? 

Regardless of what you do, stay in the room for 2 nights as a guest yourself. Next time you go on a weeekend trip keep your suitcase and ‚Äúmove in‚Äù live like one of your guests to get a feeling for what it‚Äôs like and what I may need or no need :)

Excuse the goofy mock-up and brighter colors, but i think you're on the right track and the colors you want would be very peaceful for a guest room. This is what i would do -- Just make sure to measure from the foot of the bed to the wall to ensure you can open the closet. Worse case, you can scoot the bed farther away from the window to allow for the closet door and have a smaller nightstand on the left side.
A mix of people; my parents, college friends, possibly some extended family. So far, no to the mobility issues.

I was leaning towards a full bed, because with a queen being 80‚Äù long; with a headboard, that only provides 12-18 inches of walkway, which I am concerned would feel too narrow.
This mockup is perfect, honesty; thank you!
I really like this!
Have you considered a high quality bed that‚Äôs meant to breakdown? I have one my husband and I use for camping and we love it- both large people with back issues. That could be a good idea if you want options on the space when not a guest room. 

Mobility issues can pop up at any time so being prepared is good. And a full is a great option! 

I really like what the other person did with the mockup. 

Depending on how much work you want, you can also look into turning the closet door into a pocket door, or one of those barn style sliding doors, which would allow for more options so you don‚Äôt have to deal with it opening and closing. Even a hanging curtain would work if done right.
Sorry, to clarify, are you referring to a futon, with your first part?

I considered a couch/bed futon; but I wasn‚Äôt sure if that would be too‚Ä¶college-esque?
Oh no- o agree, very college and no support. My husband and I have a separate frame and mattress that we use for camping (but we go to a campsite for 3 months at a time so it‚Äôs very nice)

It‚Äôs a frame that folds flat [similar to this](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Brookside-14-in-Queen-Folding-Platform-Bed-Frame-BS22QQ14FP/311069156?g_store=&source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&pla&mtc=SHOPPING-BF-HDH-GGL-D59H-059_023_MATTRESSES-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-RDC-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-%7C059_023_002_MATTRESSES%7C_PMAX_phase_2&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-BF-HDH-GGL-D59H-059_023_MATTRESSES-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-RDC-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-%7C059_023_002_MATTRESSES%7C_PMAX_phase_2-20279569591--&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20270379321&gbraid=0AAAAADq61UfWOyk4qIM-SokxRkgPZOJDE)

My personal choice would be a calming light to medium blue. I don't know paint colors like a lot of people do, but something like blustery sky or Whirlpool from Sherwin-Williams, or relaxing blue from behr.

Or if you want to go dark, Tempe Star from Sherwin-Williams looks pretty. 

I love green, but I feel like bringing out the blue in these paintings would look nice.
Don‚Äôt go dark

We have black trim to go on the brown wall and white trim to go around the mural. 

I would nix the floating shelves, and opt for art instead or even leaving the slat wall plain.
I think it's a lovely room to start with. I agree with you about the couch. It really doesn't fit with the rest of the room very well. And takes up too much physical and visual weight. I think you need to move the rug away from the walls. There should be an 18 inch minimum margin around it.  Move your furniture with it so everything comes out of the corner. From the pictures it looks like it should be oriented the other way. Then it wouldn't stick out past your couch so much. Perhaps you won't need a console table on the mural wall then.  I think the mural wall should stand alone as is anyway for more impact.  Move the metal flower thing down a little.  And if you ever decided to change curtains I would move the rods up closer to the ceiling and get longer ones.
Random suggestion, are you able to paint the TV console a brown to match the wall behind it? That may make the TV look less heavy and dark in that space.
I would like to hang pictures. My husband and I went through our photos and picked out a bunch we liked and had them printed on canvas. So are people (we want to have the staircase with all the family pictures. Others we had printed are of places we have visited. We have another room (you walk straight into from the front door. And we thought we would hang the travel photos in there. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What about putting up the floating shelves and then putting a couple pictures on them mixed with our collectibles we gathered on our travels??
This is exactly the type of suggestions I was looking for. I usually find a room on-line or in a magazine and I will copy it. I have ZERO ability to decorate. My son is coming over tomorrow so I am going to use him to help me with the carpet and the sofa. The flower thing on the wall is actually a clock. Thanks for the response. I will update the pictures when I make the changes.  And Thank you for the kind compliment.
It‚Äôs just a  particle board some assembly required $150.00 tv console from Home Depot. Not sure it would paint very well. But I can vision what you are suggesting..I think you might be right about making the wall look less heavy and dark. Thanks!
I‚Äôm just personally not a fan of floating shelves. People rarely place them in a way that looks good visually, and I have yet to hang any myself that have worked well with regards to stability and confidence that they wouldn‚Äôt fall down with any substantial weight load. They always sag and pull away from the wall. I‚Äôll never use floating shelves again."

Everything is super neutral so I think you should choose a piece of art you love and pick a color from that.
What's your favorite color?

The flooring and fixtures skew a little neutral to cool. It's a small space so u would go lighter. So, pick a light shade in a coolish tone that u like
For me, I‚Äôd love to see a medium to pale lavender, I think it would go great with that floor. Leave that cabinet white so it reminds you not to hit your head on it. Then put a mirror with a silver colored frame. If you‚Äôre not renting maybe you could put up a Medicine cabinet with a mirror on it
Any beige color that‚Äôs in the cool (as opposed to warm) tones. Window trim in a cappacino cream color to accent the beige.
What colors do you enjoy
I know I'm supposed to recommend a color and I'll get to that but that cabinet placement gives me anxiety. I know I'd slam my head on it, it would be only a matter of time üòÇ

Since it's a small room I'd go with a lighter pastel color, maybe a few shades of blue lighter than what's there.

Hi! Just bought this cabinet and I feel like there‚Äôs too much white space & wall above it. What would look good up there? Also considering changing the hardware on the cabinet. Any suggestions? 

I‚Äôd leave it
I think the problem would actually be solved if you added curtains to that window. You don't have to take off the roman shades, but add curtains hung well above and outside of the window frame. That will add height and definition to the wall adjacent to the cabinet and make the white space near the ceiling not feel so vacuous.
Fill the cabinet with dining ware with bold patterns or bright colors and you will have your focal point. The space above won't feel so empty.
I would maybe put a plant or a vase or something on top of the hutch, but mostly you should fill the hutch with items so it draws the eye down and not to the wall above.
It really depends on what you are going to put in the cabinet.
I wouldn‚Äôt put anything up that high. Have you considered painting the walls a warmer color? If not how about adding some color with draperies and a bigger rug that coordinates with the drapes.
I‚Äôm currently using the top of my China hutch for vases, could be a nice place for a painting
Love this idea. What color curtains or type would you suggest?
I think a neutral beige would work well. Since you already have the very dark cabinet and white walls, it would be nice to bring in a mid tone to balance things out. It would also echo the rug under the table. If you can afford it, get a nice linen curtain off etsy that has a rod pocket or back tabs (NOT grommets). There are also cheaper amazon versions with synthetic material. Since it's a living space you want it to be light filtering and not blackout. Make sure you measure well so that the curtain comes within about an inch of the floor but doesn't touch it. And again, install the curtain rod well above and beyond the window frame for a nice grand look.
You‚Äôre a lifesaver thank you!!"

I was thinking a full body mirror in the left corner of the first picture. 

It's hard to say without seeing the whole room.  But I'd say, art.
Your bedroom already has a clean and calm base with the neutral walls, which makes it easy to build on. A full body mirror in the corner will open the space and add function, and pairing it with a small gallery wall or a slim console for decor would bring in personality without clutter. Long curtains hung higher and wider than the window will make the room feel taller and softer, and adding a tall plant in the corner will bring in warmth. A large rug under the bed can anchor everything, and layering bedding with a few throws and pillows will make it more inviting. If you want more light, wall sconces or a floor lamp would give you a warm layered glow without taking up much space. Above the bed, you can keep it clean with just the headboard or add something simple like a textile piece or round mirror for texture.

I‚Äôd personally place it on the right-hand side wall area above the counter. If the towel falls off, it‚Äôll land on the counter (not the floor). Alternatively, if you were to have it placed above the toilet area, some people don‚Äôt shut the lid before flushing which would cause icky germs to fly up and hit the towel ü§¢
I hated all the options in my bathroom, so now I just have a small basket of a dozen or so small hand towels and keep a small hamper (repurposed wicker garbage bin) that I throw in every time I wash towels
Above the light switch on the end wall. You wash your hands, dry them and turn the light off!
I have a rectangle basket with thick disposable hand towels sitting next to the sink.

I would put it underneath the mirror to the left.
I don't like any of these, so I just have a fresh hand towel rolled on the vanity. 

I like free standing SS toilet paper holders with multiple rolls.

 In your bathroom I would have installed a SS heated towel rail onto the wall. I really like the reno and would focus on staying minimalist.
4 & 6
Yeah this is prob the best bet. I think the ring design is not my favorite look but makes the towel most secure when drying your hands vs an open on one side design (even though i think it looks better)

Unfortunately the toilet it butted up pretty close to the counter. Turns you into a contortionist to get the tp. The wall opposite the toilet is close enough to reach, but just far enough to have to lean off the toilet for a wall mounted option. I may go with some kind or stand that puts it forward enough to reach comfortably
This! I started doing this during Covid, it feels so much more sanitary to me than a shared towel‚Ä¶. And for some reason my grandkids will always wash their hands without prompting now that they get to use these towels!

I like the idea of the other commenter of having a hand towel on the counter, vs. hanging anything up, too. Or they also make free standing hand towel holders/racks.

Nice space. Nothing jumps out at me. All I can say is just use it and see if something hits you as being needed.
Move the pumpkins to a different corner and put a big old potted bird of paradise plant there, with leaves that‚Äôll stretch out a bit near the chairs.

Sit right outside and enjoy the weather. It looks so cozy and wonderful.
I would pull the chairs forward a couple feet. They look way too close to the doors. And put the table that‚Äôs in between the chairs off to the side of either chair. Add a decent size round coffee table with candles and a nice plant. And a tall plant in either corner by the door.

I would add a brighter colored carpet (if you aren‚Äôt opposed to non-beige), I would add a larger coffee table for in front of the chairs (larger plates, more guests, longer periods outside, etc).  I would add a few large sitting poufs or outdoor bean bags for more conversational seating and I would add art to your wall doors on the right
I would move the chairs away from the door, it looks crowded and would be blocking any views from inside?

Maybe some footstools,it is very nice

Outside fireplace

Your patio already looks so cozy, I love the rug with the pumpkins and lanterns. The string lights are cute too, even if your husband is not a fan of how they are hung. If you want to add a little more atmosphere without cluttering, maybe try layering different types of light.One thing that surprised me on my own patio was using a small galaxy projector. I have one from Pococo that throws slow moving stars and nebula patterns on the ceiling, and it made late evenings outside feel super calm. It does not take up floor space and blends nicely with the warm string lights.Do you want the vibe to lean more toward cozy fall evenings or more of a romantic lounge feel. That might help decide whether to add plants, extra textiles, or more lighting.

Yes, square is fine, yes knobs  for doors should be uniformly sized per room, knobs are small so I prefer the flow of uniformity, and handles on drawers..which are more noticeably sized...should be scaled to the size of the drawer, but only use 2 sizes so you minimize visual distraction."

What color is the floor? The floor determines whether a warm or cool white should be used. 

My entire house has a bright white glossy (to be able to wipe it clean) trim paint. The entire house has a warm, off white ceiling. I like the continuity between rooms. 

For warm whites: SW Shoji White, SW Greek Villa, SW Alabaster, BM Swiss Coffee, BM Chantilly Lace. I recommend searching for articles about which whites professionals choose and why.

A warm white will work (warm floor) even though the couch is cool toned. Try to match the baseboards since they‚Äôre a standard white. See if the ceiling looks okay after you paint the walls. If the ceiling is the same for the whole house, leave it alone.

ETA: The ceiling might need new paint if it doesn‚Äôt vibe well with the walls."

yes it will. keep in mind that is a huge chandelier by all metrics also so it won‚Äôt even look good in that small space with such a low ceiling anyway even if you have a wider table. you should find a chandelier no wider than 36‚Äù for that space id guess.
Yes. That light fixture is much too large for that space.
You need a long chandelier over a long table, not round
A linear chandelier will be better than round for your table.
What is the size of your dining area? I use this formula:  Add the width in feet to the length in feet, change to inches and that's the correct diameter for a chandelier. For example:  Dining area is 10 feet by 14 feet. 10+14=24. A 24"" diameter chandelier is a good size."

It got me wondering‚Äîwhere do you all land? Love it or Hate it?

Both. I really appreciate the whimsy and style, I think it looks neat but you wouldn't find it in my house!
I think there are a few prices that could be very tastefully worked into a maximalist design scheme but collecting every piece and displaying them is so, so tacky.
I have never seen it styled in a way that wasn‚Äôt tacky. You could market gold plated turds and someone would collect them, I guess.
Hate it.
It‚Äôs ghastly. I hate it. 
0/10 stars.
I love it, for that one accent piece in a room. Not a room filled with it.
LOVE!! you just put me on to some decor i never heard of but i‚Äôm in love with one look.
Vera Bradley of home decor. People who no taste glom onto it and acquire more to try and make it look like a cohesive collection. It will always be a no dawg. 

My ex‚Äôs mom kept gifting me pieces and I sold em all when we broke up üôà
A little goes a loooooooooooooooog way.
I love dollhouses, but this collection is not for me.
It‚Äôs cute and whimsical in small amounts. A teapot here, a plate there. BUT, anyone I have known to buy this stuff goes overboard and their whole house (especially the kitchen) looks like a whimsical checkerboard threw up everywhere.
I love it but it doesn‚Äôt work with my current interior. I‚Äôve seen it used beautifully in very small doses in classic Southern interiors to add a hit of humor in otherwise pretty traditional rooms. 

I feel like I understand why her mass produced stuff is so polarizing, but these handmade pieces are incredible works of art that are probably under appreciated because they‚Äôre made by a woman/fall into decor/craft/textile art. I‚Äôd redesign my bedroom around that headboard, it‚Äôs incredible. Are these pieces from the estate you‚Äôre handling?
I hate it! I hated it in the 90s and I hate it now!
I have a holiday piece I love. But overpriced and too much generally
Some pieces are cute but it‚Äôs not for me. The teapots are pretty but everything is a little too whimsical

No thank you

I like the tea kettle, but not enough to buy it.
Depends on the piece for me but I mostly love it
I found a McKenzie Childs tea kettle at goodwill for $12, it‚Äôs proudly displayed on top of my fridge but I would never pay full price for anything else
It's not for me but I don't hate it. Everyone is allowed to have their preferences on decor.
Mostly hate it. It just gives soulless and commercial vibes. It isn‚Äôt art, let‚Äôs put it that way.
Gorgeously 2000s tacky, I kind of love it
I loved it when it was first established as a company and had classic pieces. Now it‚Äôs affiliated with QVC and just seems like a bunch of mass produced junk. It‚Äôs like Beanie Babies for adults. They have so oversaturated the market that any value pieces once carried has greatly diminished.
They‚Äôre interesting art pieces, but not something I want in my house. Probably more appealing to those who like a particularly 80s/90s flavored maximalism.
It‚Äôs giving RUGRATS end credits
I love it!  I would definitely mix it in with my standard functional stuff but so refreshing!!
I don't own any of it, but over the years I have seen some Halloween and Christmas pieces that were appealing.
Never heard of it before‚Ä¶ At a glance, the attention to detail and obvious love of design make this a valuable piece to *somebody*. I personally probably wouldn't buy it? But admire the care and dedication someone put into creating it. Think it should be treated with respect so those who *do* love this style can continue to enjoy these pieces.


Ultimately, no accounting for taste, right? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Absolutely love üíØ them but I have a lot of mc in my house
I can see the appeal for others, I'm just not one of them.
I love Mackenzie-Child pieces.  I'd absolutely have one if I could, but they're so expensive.  That is enough to put me off.

As others are saying, I'd have maybe two or three pieces, but I wouldn't do a whole look with it, that would be way too much.
I think some of it is cute, but it gets tacky when folks just cover their house with it floor to ceiling.
I like it but it feels like the majority of people do it wrong and go overboard
üëéüèª

I‚Äôd be so uncomfortable having to spend time in a room full of this type of stuff. Laura Ashley Home back in the day used to use multiple different patterns for the couch, chairs, curtains, and pillows. Usually in a yellow, blue, and white floral pattern. Thank goodness I never saw one in the wild. I‚Äôd rather jump out the window than spend time there.
I have never been a fan and do not understand.
I have an aunt who was obsessed with Mackenzie Childs and now I simply cannot take it seriously.
I love them!!!
Not my style, but I appreciate the detail
It's not for me but I like looking at it, it reminds me of my grandma
Depends upon the piece and depends upon the room/house it‚Äôs in. I‚Äôve seen it done well a few times‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve seen it look like shit a zillion times. 

I think only certain pieces can be styled well. Like I love the wicker stuff, and I think a random smattering of the dish patterns on a funky breakfast room table set can look cottage-core fun, but it‚Äôs really easy to overdo.

I actually saw someone make one of those fish platters you‚Äôve got listed into a freaking sink on here just a few days back.
Not at all my style but I don't see why people are so loathed of them
Yuck, no.
I‚Äôd say love it‚Äîit‚Äôs bold, whimsical, and definitely a statement piece if styled right.
Hate it
Very hate
That‚Äôs a no for me Dawg
Hit the nail on the head. It's fun and cute and not for me!
Exactly this. I'd admire it in someone else's house, but definitely not for me.¬†
I thought this same thing, like it‚Äôs overly tacky that it could fit in a space as a single piece part of a bigger design.. collecting them as a set to go around a room/house is.. not it
This is the perfect adjective. 10/10

I would agree, the classic and retired older pieces are so much better!
They're not art. One step above Target trash.
The fish sink sounds super cool! I was thinking that one of the furniture pieces in our auction would make for a great vanity.
oh my gosh thank you!! (o:

reddit,HomeDecorating,1nok86l,1758640733,Seeking advice on peel and stick tiles,,"Seeking advice on peel and stick tiles



I have almost those exact same tiles and I also considered peel and stick, but I would recommend against it. Thr surface of your tiles are actually quite textured and have a slight lip to them, so a giant sticker will never adhere properly to it. Plus, the grout is salmon colored, so you'll either have to cover it with the sticker (which will look bad) or it'll show between black and white tiles (which will also look bad). I know its not ideal but you just have to work with what you're given here. Plus, authentic, natural materials (even when they're not your taste) always look better than a half-assed faux-finish.
Thank you for this!
Ofc. Also I'd recommend giving the grout a really good scrub, with bleach if you have to, then possibly resealing it. You'll probably like it a lot more once the grout is restored to its actual color.
Ok I‚Äôll try! I scrubbed with some pinesol mixture but it didn‚Äôt do anything, I‚Äôll try bleach

why do we need four pics of the bar you‚Äôre taking out and none of the rest of the room? it would be helpful to see the rest of the room so we know what that looks like. since. you know. the bar is coming out.
It takes up too much space, but you don't even know what you'd do with the space? You realize thats pretty contradictory, right?

There's already plenty of storage, too... You can store non-bar related things there too.

I would just leave it. Let your kids put up a popcorn machine or whatever if you want it to be their play room. They'll like it even more when they're older and have friends over.
I'd remove the bar but keep the back counter and fridge. Then when kids have movie night or something they have a snack table and whatnot setup.
If you want this to be a second living room for your kids, I would not remove this bar.
Why don‚Äôt you make a small kitchen for your kids to learn those everyday chores (not sure of their age)?
I think it depends a lot on the ages and interests of your kids

Keeping a back wall of cabinets with a counter, wet bar, mini fridge and snacks if they‚Äôre older or using the basement with friends to watch movies and play video games. This is probably best long term since it could be used by anyone and keeps some of the storage you‚Äôre removing 

Or I was a little artist as a kid and having a space with a desk and a basic sink with drying space would have been a dream - it looks like laminate floors so you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about water spills or messes. If you‚Äôve got a little mad scientist kid this would also work well for them
Can you post a pic of the rest of the space?  The use case for the area is almost infinite. 

Are you wanting a music room? A wine nook? A library?  A slot car track? 

You see what I mean?  If you give us some more insight into what you want to get out of it, it‚Äôs way easier to help.
Take out the bar and leave the rest. It‚Äôs nice to have an additional space with a mini fridge, whether for movie nights or when someone sick needs to isolate from everyone else.
My friends used a space like this for crafts storage and working area for the kids. Would that work? Or, it would work for lego too. There‚Äôs a display area, and they can sit at stools, creating.
I think absent seeing the rest of the space. It‚Äôs really hard to know what to do with it. You need to take a wide angle picture of the entire space.
Get rid of the mirrors. They are distracting. Definitely keep the sink & fridge. Personally, I'd keep the cupboards on the back wall. Put a popcorn machine there for movie nights. Actually, put a microwave there too. But go ahead and get rid of the front bar if you want.

I know you hate that it's raised but have you considered there is a reason, like a pipe exposed underneath?
Remove it, but try getting a counter space with a sink at the back so that you can have small fridge for drinks, a sink for hand washing (water).  Just along the back wall.  Don‚Äôt use the whole length of the wall. Try to get cabinets from a ‚Äúrestore‚Äù or maybe ikea.

Forget upper cabinets. Do open shelves for now.

This will also make a great place for craft projects.
Yes. We need the context.
Right? If you don‚Äôt have an alternate use case, save the money. The kids will thank you later. Could be an awesome set up for an ice cream social birthday or all kinds of other pretend games too.
I understand your point and I guess I should have provided more details. The bar is on a lifted floor and the tiles on it are mostly cracked and falling apart. I want the flooring to match the rest of the basement. Also the lighting in the countertops gets incredibly hot to the point it has singed paper left on top of it. Otherwise we did consider leaving the back cabinets alone, but that is not possible with the floor being raised. I talked extensively with our contractor and he said due to the floor, the cabinets would most likely need to go. I wish I could just take out the front part and leave the cabinets, but its just not feasible. This bar was a DIY project by the previous owner and not very well constructed. Plus it looks incredibly out of date compared to the rest of the basement. I'm all for saving what is already there, but I also want something more modern if that makes sense.
THIS\^\^\^.  The counter, storage & sink will be useful for years to come.  Kids crafting?  Wash up in the sink.  Having a movie night?  Plug in the air popper and make some popcorn.  Have your peloton down there?  Keep water bottles in the fridge.
They are 9 and 12, so I am hoping to create some sort of snack nook that does not take up so much space.

I wouldn't change anything, this looks super nice already. The space is so small I'm not sure you can add more (maybe a plant?).
Honestly if you just add a rug/bathmat in front of the shower and maybe in front of the sink it would help ground the space and break up the busy floor pattern so the eye has somewhere to rest. I also would suggest a bolder art choice because the current one blends into the existing vertical lines on the shower and light fixture. You need something bold like vintage advertisement art or something soft like a landscape imho.
That looks great already! I would go light and airy for a paint color. Light blue perhaps? Definitely do not go dark and moody.
You don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs done. If you add more I think it would look like clutter
It‚Äôs nicer (and bigger) than my single bathroom ü§£. It looks great the way it is.
Paint the ceiling the same color as the walls.
i think it looks great. i might change the vanity lights to a cold hue to brighten up the space a bit, or if you like the warm lighting, change the shower light to warm as well. take down the picture over the toilet, it doesn‚Äôt add anything and it just makes the room feel more cluttered. negative space on the wall is good for this room. lastly, i would remove the shutters on the door - maybe just replace with a regular door? the lines don‚Äôt work with the room and again add visual clutter.

maybe also switch out the trash can for something larger but shorter that can go fully under the sink.
It looks great the way it is, but if you want to bump it up a notch, I would do a fun bold wallpaper or hang an amazing print with some color in there.

Canadian artist

, Rebecca Aldernet, has some incredible swimming and water related prints that would be perfect in a pool bath.
It literally looks perfect
I love it like that
Go for moisture-proof finishes, add some built-in niches or shelves, use light colors and reflective tiles to open it up, and throw in a plant or two for spa vibes.
that print with the red is the right one! bring some warmth with accessories. maybe a teak stool in the shower and a teak mat when you exit.
Looks really good to me!
If this is ‚Äúsmall,‚Äù then my bathroom is nonexistent üòÇ
Literally just needs a hand towel same blue as the floor tile. It‚Äôs a nice room, you‚Äôre over thinking it. If you really want to dump money into it, add crown moulding
It‚Äôs already gorgeous, maybe a simple black with tiny gold thread bath mat
It looks very put together
Just needs towels!
If you do add a bath mat, try wood or stone.  Also consider a modern stone or teak shower bench to match. Maybe remove the succulent and add couple of floating shelves with a couple of plants and decorative containers that hold toiletries and decor. Or‚Ä¶you can keep everything exactly how it is and just paint the white ceiling and wall a moody color.
Agree with bathmat suggestion, not sure about art suggestion. Art above toilet is fine if it brings OP joy. Art is so subjective‚Äîfor example, vintage advertisement art doesn‚Äôt do it for me, but I do agree a color contrast like green or bold will make a stronger statement. Also, the reason the art above the toilet works is partly the boldness of the frame. I think the cream frames are what are throwing me off vs the empty space.
And a shaggy white rug."

Lol what weird toilet placement. I would get some kind of little cart, basket, or table to go in between the toilet and the wall to make that space feel less weird. Then wooden open shelves above that are centered on the wall. If you can get the finish of the two things to match that would look really nice and make the space feel more polished and intentional."

I'd go with natural toned wood the same colour as the mirror/table in the picture. A dark green headboard would look great in front of that wallpaper.

Edit: I just saw the close up picture of your wallpaper, you should paint your walls sage green instead of grey, it will tie in better.
Wood tone like the wood of the mirror on the mantle in pic 1

I have never used the bathtub as a tub.  My last house, that I lived in for over a decade, had a master bath with only a walk-in shower.  There was a hall bath that had a tub and I never once used it.

Thank you, my grandma passed away 2 years ago so I have been going over about once a week to help him around the house with meal prep and odd jobs. He let me have a little fun by doing something I enjoy.
We hired out, I didn‚Äôt remodel it my self I just designed/coordinated it with my grandpa. It‚Äôs not hard taking out the existing tub/shower like difficulty wise it just requires strength. After that they put insulation and waterproofing in and then drywall essentially or waterproof drywall? And then tile. The tile was VERY tedious and time consuming. It took one guy almost a week!
Thank you
Thank you!
Yes that‚Äôs what we wanted but no our contractor said it wasn‚Äôt really an option unless we wanted to pull out the flooring and spend a lot of additional money. So we opted for the small lip.
They say if you're going to live there for a long time, you should do what you like, and save money to flip it back if/when you sell. Cause even if you keep your tub, it might not be the style that buyers want years from now anyway.¬†
So it‚Äôs very dependent on where you live imo because we took out my grandpas only remaining bathtub in this remodel/makeover however he lives in a retirement community or ‚Äúactive adult living community‚Äù so IF whoever lives there next needs a bathtub it will most likely be a specific one through insurance and they will install it. PLUSz this is a guest bathroom, again in a retirement community usually the second bedroom is only for guests or maybe a live in caretaker and in all instances a tub isn‚Äôt necessary. We both are happy with the choice of taking out the tub because it‚Äôs beautiful and is more practical imo. In a neighborhood with maybe new parents moving in, I agree not ideal.

I agree but again I was working within his parameters. His entire house is the same color so I wanted to keep it somewhat cohesive. I originally wanted the paneling to be a darker and more neutral beige/taupe shade and the walls to be white but decided against it. The hallway connected to the bathroom entrance is the same terra cotta shade so again I was hoping it would tie in a bit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Thank you! I got it on Amazon
It‚Äôs a guest bathroom that nobody showers in but it‚Äôs also acacia wood and sealed for ‚Äúin shower‚Äù use but I told him we will just take it out if he has guests. That‚Äôs also why I left it halfway blocking the shower entrance, so essentially you are forced to move it in order to use the shower.
It is a lot of work and yes would cost more. That‚Äôs understandable. I think it looks awesome as is. 

We did it for our first floor shower and had to saw cut the entire shower floor down about 6 inches or so to relocate the drain about 3 feet to the correct spot and then built it up again with concrete subfloor, waterproof underlay, and then the tiles.
I kind of plan to live here the rest of my life... unless I decide to move out of California.   Move someplace that doesn't tax retirement income.  The tub needs replacing anyway.  It's got a big rust spot on the bottom.

Like in your picture, I put rows of the colored tile in clear/blue/white around the mirror.  I have purchased enough to do rows like that around the tub enclosure if I ever decide to do it.  Didn't want to end up not being able to get the same glass tile.
Yes, budget is #1.  I‚Äôm actually an interior designer and I specialize in interior finishes & accessibility. You can find a reasonably priced handheld showerhead‚Ä¶ I do hundreds of upgrades for senior citizens every year.   Great work! I‚Äôm sure your grandfather loves it üòÉ"

no. but def paint the walls either blue or white.
Just paint it the same colour the rest of the room will be and it won't be noticeable, you will only focus on the feature wall
Personally, I would wallpaper the jutted out wall. I prefer the symmetry it would provide and would make your room feel wider instead of abruptly cut off. We no longer need to be bound by the ‚Äústatement wall‚Äù concept! Free yourself!
Yes. It looks cut off as it is. It will look wider if it is papered.
Just the bump out as blue, the rest of the room white. Or wallpaper the bump out. Stopping short is making your room look less balanced / more narrow. 

(also that wall paper is stunning)
No, but what about painting it a solid color? Like a little deeper complementing blue color or pull the green from the leave? With some throw pillows and art on the walls it will look beautiful!!
Yes! So it blends in!
That wallpaper looks so pretty! I think wallpapering the bumped out corner could tie the whole look together nicely. Even before moving the side tables back, it might give the room a more cohersive feel.
I think you should paint it a darker complimentary color of whatever you paint the other walls with.
No. Accent wall is fine
I would keep it the same as the rest of the walls. No wallpaper and just a solid colour. No need to highlight it.
No
I would just center the bed to the wallpapered wall. The bed being off center to the wallpaper wall is very unbalanced.
Yes
The asymmetry of the wall and the bed not being centred on the wallpaper. Another approach would be to mimic the bump-out on the left of the bed, with a painted strip by the door (perhaps a shallow panel), to make the wallpaper end before the door and restore some symmetry.
Paint all the walls and ceiling white
No, just move the bed dead center of that wallpaper wall .
I would paint it in blue and white vertical stripes and paint the rest of the room white.
Accent walls are over. Do the whole room!
Yes, then the bed will be in a cozy little flower cove, it looks oddly cut off right now.
I could paint you
I had this issue. I ended up wall papering the whole room and then you don't notice the horrible jutts out. 

Was it worth it? Lol well I learned a lot about myself and patience in those long days of wall papering let's say that lol. But I don't notice the stupid jutts anymore so that's a W

Unfortunately not an option, in another response I was just explaining the picture doesn‚Äôt give full context
Yes just paint the bump out. Since it‚Äôs an odd part of the wall and it‚Äôs not a flat portion I would just lean into it being different and use paint to make it compliment the wallpaper üëçüèª

The frame was kind of hard to rip the original painting out of, but with some D rings and loctite it was cheap and fast! Curtain was from Amazon. 

Is there any way you can flatten it out? I like the idea, but the folds are throwing me off. 

I wonder if you could adhere it to a flat backing to smooth it out? Maybe mod podge or something?
You‚Äôre supposed to staple the shower curtain to the frame, similar to stretching canvas. This will get rid of the wrinkles.
Can you iron it?
I would not iron that. I would try a steamer. I don't know what the material is but I feel like an iron might melt it.
Im sorry, but up close this looks terrible. You need to take the curtain out and hang it in the bathroom. Run the shower on hot and try to steam the wrinkles out. You could possibly iron the curtain on a very very low heat.
Can I ask what color your walls are? That blue is gorgeous.¬†
Cool idea but sloppy execution¬†
Agree with those saying this looks bad. 

It looks like a ‚Äòhack‚Äô, and of all things wall art shouldn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre trying to cheat.
That's wild. A famous painting was printed on a shower curtain and turned into framed artwork again.
I‚Äôd try to steam the lines out then re-mount. If you do use an iron vs a steamer, put the fabric between paper.
Sorry, it looks like shit lol
I would test it first before ironing.  My guess is not to put iron on  direct.  Put a towel on it then iron.   Or even steam it.  Can just leave it hanging in the shower room with hot shower steam....  Or perhaps spray with some water and dry with hot hair drier ....
Put the fabric under a thin cotton cloth and run the steamer or iron over the cotton cloth to flatten out the shower curtain fabric
The curtain needs to be streched to remove the wrinkes. There's a couple different ways to do that. Is it on stretcher strips or a sold backing?
This print is available to buy from Amazon. Would look much better you already have the frame just buy the print for like $15.
r/GTBAE
Throw the curtain in the dryer on low for 5 minutes, check and another 5 if necessary.

I love the idea.
Why instead of just buying a print of the piece?
Heat it with a hair dryer maybe to flatten
If you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters. So many people here are saying you can‚Äôt iron this‚Ä¶just check the label if you still have it (or look up the material composition online since you bought it on Amazon). There are plenty of shower curtains that can be ironed.

If it can be ironed, iron it, then use staples to stretch it like a canvas. If it can‚Äôt be ironed, steam it if it can be steamed, then do the same stretching with staples. Either way, the goal is to get the wrinkles out. It will look infinitely better.

It‚Äôs not going to float everyone‚Äôs boat and that‚Äôs fine. If you and your husband like this and it brings happiness to your room, that‚Äôs all that matters. Finding ‚Äúvintage fabric art‚Äù is easier said than done. You have something here you‚Äôve already put time and money into and like. It just needs to not have the folds in it. You‚Äôve got a good start ‚ù§Ô∏è
So I'm not sure why noone is liking it, but I kinda like it with the folds and wrinkles. It goes well with the painting and it's pretty unique.
I mean‚Ä¶why?
you ripped an actual painting out of this frame to put a cheap shower curtain in it? i don‚Äôt understand this trend at all, it‚Äôs so tacky
Please, please leave the shower curtain in the bathroom. Literally any art has to be better than this. The room is gorgeous. This is methhead diy¬†
You might want to steam it
Wasn‚Äôt this posted recently?
Try using a blow dryer to get the seams and wrinkles to smooth out. Room looks nice good job.
¬øY tho?
I'd try to iron it but it looks great with the blue wall and the golden frame <3
I cannot wait to see this reposted onto DiWHY. I had no idea it was so ugly üò≠üòÇ
I just paid $300 for a frame that looks exactly like that!
Yeah I was thinking spray adhesive maybe to some sturdy cardboard ?
I‚Äôm sure. I didn‚Äôt even think about it! And I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for saying so. But it‚Äôs still a cool idea to try.
Oh no! I glued it and thought I stretched it enough. But I guess not.
I think so! I can try.
Big risk of melting if plastic.
Steamer for sure unless it‚Äôs a type of material where the paint would somehow melt off
Okay. Thank you for your honesty.
Thanks!! It‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeep Water‚Äù by Valspar in an eggshell finish. We are dark cherry wood accents too. It‚Äôs a work in progress.

If it's a fabric shower curtain you may also be able to steam it?? I've never worked with that material, so worth googling / checking to see if it'll survive some heat
Maybe an iron over towels to control the heat?
A hand steamer should work as wrll
 
Can you try to gently remove it from the backing or worst case try again with a new curtain? I‚Äôd recommend cutting a piece of cardboard to the correct size for the frame. Cut the curtain a few inches larger than the cardboard. Then fold the curtain over the back of the cardboard and staple it down. Start with one staple on each side, and then go around adding one more staple per side and stretching as you go. Definitely steam it first before doing this too. Over time it will sag and show ripples if you don‚Äôt stretch it.
Put a towel on top and bottom of the curtain to take some of the heat, and keep it on lowest setting, don't go above polyester at all. You don't want to melt it.
I'd try a hair dryer. If you still have the off cuts it could be worth experimenting.
Not if you get the temp right. Start low, increase slowly.
I think it must be cloth. I don‚Äôt think anyone would frame a piece of plastic.
Perspective*

*intro*spection (int prefix meaning inward) means self-reflection. 

üåàüåü
Personally I just don‚Äôt understand this as decor art. 

Go and find an attractive vintage or antique piece of fabric made by artisans, with a story behind it and frame it. May be a little more expensive, may not be, but that‚Äôs worthwhile art.
There's no shitty fondant so it's already a 10/10 for me. Organic texture tempered by an offset graphic, bright colours, with a clear emphasis on natutalistic design. Would eat.¬†
Hey, you put time and effort into something for someone you love. I give it an A+.
If you can staple into it, start in the center of each opposing side, pull to release the wrinkle and staple it in place. 

If you can‚Äôt staple it, you can do this by sewing the opposing edges as well. Similar to lacing a shoe.
Actually, I'll hop on the train: I think they should be at least fully vertical, they're kinda off, haha. OP, if you really like it, you should just keep it like so, this is very unique and will definitely spark some questions from your guests (if they ever see it).¬†
so true
My bad. It was this post. Same idea. https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeDecorating/s/mfURlFzzoN
Score!!!
Or maybe ‚Ä¶ hang it in the bathroom and turn the shower to hot?
Not a towel unless it‚Äôs microfiber. It needs to be something without nap otherwise it may imprint  on the plastic
There are some fabrics that have elements of plastic in them to make them waterproof.
What a relief. Thank you.
I‚Äôm going to just get a print from Amazon and reframe it at this point.
Fair point. Maybe a low heat setting would be ok.
Stick it in the dryer for 2-3 minutes!"

That tv looks so odd just hovering in the corner. Get a proper, wide tv console that has lots of CLOSED storage, meaning there are doors and drawers, not just open cubbies. Put the tv on that.
could put a corner console under (yes it's a thing). if between door and tv, perhaps floating shelves or tall pier. open shelving top, doors on bottom. dont want it too deep so it doesnt block and cast too much shadows for tv"

It's a really small space so there's not much room to written with. The last 2 photos are of my kitchen to show you the vibe I'm going for. Thank you. 

Put artwork in frames not just stuck on the wall, makes a big difference regardless of the style of art. Display cabinet for the stuffed toys. Is there a focal point in the room?
Respectfully, a lot of the decor is a little bit juvenile (the hanging stars and rainbow, the basket of soft toys).  Try packing away the soft toys and swapping out some of the wall art for bright paintings with a more mature feel (no cartoons).  The pillows and blanket are great - maybe just get a solid coloured couch cover.  Add a plant somewhere.

Basically, the space is too busy.  You need to declutter.  The soft toys are a large part of the problem, I'm sure you realise this.  Personally, I would get one of those vacuum bags and store them away.

The couch looks like it's in a giant bag, what is going on here?  And the crocheted blanket doesn't go with anything else.  A throw blanket needs to be styled along an arm or back of the couch.  If you don't use the couch, consider changing it or moving it to a better location, I would think that you're not likely to use it in that position.
Lose the kiddie pictures on the wall
Put your stuffed animals away
Take your swag stars down
Your rainbow color palette satisfies the ""colorful and fun.""  To make it more adult, I'd pick 2 (max 3) of the rainbow colors and really lean into those.  Add those colors w/ framed artwork, maybe paint the closet doors, solid throw pillows.  Pack away the stuffies and aim for a cleaner, more organized look/feel.  Replace the couch cover w/ a solid color.
I think if you like your stuffies then keep them in the room but get a display case, I have an IKEA one like this for my shot glasses that I get when traveling. Keeping your stuffies in a nice cabinet like this keeps them from getting dusty and upgrades your space to something a little classier as a purposeful display.

https://preview.redd.it/u3jxijgv7vqf1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=250e304dc5b569c5c79e1af658d9d26eefaae69c
Maybe keep everything in a neat order? Like have something where you can sort your plushies to and not gather them up in a singular place
Look at Pinterest. I think a colorful rug and floor length curtains with lots of lighting sources will do the trick.
Put all stuffed animals in a chest of some kind. Get rid of the couch cover. If you want color, pick a colorful or patterned couch. Make sure all art work is framed.
Your kitchen doggies could be made into a stunning collage by cutting them out and pasting them on a large canvas then framing them. Still fun but grownup.[collage](https://youtu.be/nDhqE_gx2Z4?si=CnWe0YOTeadX4DIj)
Any chance you can get a second shelf like the one you‚Äôre using as a room divider, but only half the height? If so, that would work so much in there than your desk. can‚Äôt you use the tv as a monitor? Get a wireless keyboard and do the work from the couch, get rid of desk and desk chair. Get some solid color storage bins for the new shelf, same colors from kitchen. Tuck in your couch cover better, move the blanket to the back of couch, put the two bright pillows on couch, get rid of furry tie dye pillows. Put away all the stuffed animals. Paint the white picture frames like others suggested, I‚Äôd paint them gold to match the dog picture. get Rid of the star garland. Switch the remaining art, move the dog photo to center of wall between couch and cabinet, and move the 3 other pieces behind the couch. I can‚Äôt tell what size that rug is, but it‚Äôs kinda over kill in there. I‚Äôd get rid of it. You want the colorful pieces you have to POP, that means you can‚Äôt overdo it on colorful pieces.
Keep your big pieces neutral and add your pops of color with pillows, rugs and art.  Lose the stuffed animals and stash the clutter.  You want your eyes to flow from one space to another, right now you have way too much visual clutter and aren't seeing the beauty in any one thing because it's too much to process.  Frame a couple of your fav doggy pics and hang them, pick a color scheme to use for your color pops - using every color and pattern feels disjointed.
Start with a neutral couch cover and serious decluttering then add just a few pieces to bring your color and personality into the room.
An adult room doesn't have a bunch of stuffed animals and pictures taped to the walls.  You can bring your personality in with select pieces that represent who you are without having everything out in the room.
I'd re-arrange a bit.

The closet, desk/tv stand, and cube shelf combo is too much for this space. If it were me, I'd get rid of the whole desk area. It isn't big enough to make working there easy, so a laptop on the couch would be just fine. Laptop on the couch would work fine as a tv substitute too.

Then I'd slide the closet cabinet down and rotate the couch to be on that back wall facing the opening.

I love that you're decorating with color!! Add more, large swaths of solid colors so it looks on-purpose.
Look up Cloud Land Home on Insta - great inspiration for what I think you're going for!
Another way to make this look more designed would be to get a bunch of frames from a second hand shop and spray paint them different colors. You can have a gallery wall that is just frames with no inside-guts that brings real color to the bulk of your walls.

It looks like some of this art is framed, but with small, white frames that blend in. Consider spray painting them (esp if the artwork itself is predominately white) or using frames that are more substantial.
Yes, it's definitely giving kindergarten classroom vibes.
Yes -- you can have colorful, but every object doesn't need every color.

Get a couch cover that fits (or an oversized blanket you can tuck in to fit) in one, solid, bright color that you love. Then the colorful blanket will look like it blends. Consider painting the white furniture another solid, bright color, or use colorful pillows as accents. Consider saving up for an appropriately sized colorful rug. 

Because the colorful things are in an otherwise white room, they look messy instead of on-purpose. Large, brightly colored pieces will help ""ground"" the space."

I prefer the green. I'd bring in color through other things like an area rug, bigger art, and furniture.
I just want to know why there is a dog bed on the ceiling? Are you a good witch or a bad witch?
I think the green is fantastic. The red is fine too, but feels like a lateral move, not an improvement.¬†


I mean if you really want a color change, go for it. But it seems like a lot of effort just to make your Christmas tree pop more.¬†


I'd repaint the fireplace and trim first - that may be the transformation you're really looking for.
Your room is great but the first thing I'd try to fix is not the wall color (which is fine) but that ceiling, it looks moldy with that lighting... I know it's not really moldy but it's not a good look. Make it smooth.
I would stick with the green and consider painting your ceiling green as well. You need to go all in with the dark and moody, color drench.
I like the green- but the rug on the ceiling? My allergies just went on over drive- how do you dust that? clean it?
I like both but I like the green better! 
You might want to go with a darker red - that one looks too pink with all the natural sunlight.
Is that a rain cloud in the corner of the ceiling?
I like the green, but would colour-drench the trim. Definitely darken the fireplace, or refinish with rich red brick veneer and beef out the mantle. Maybe plank the ceiling and stain it dark.
I think either color is fine but it‚Äôs the fireplace that‚Äôs throwing it off. I see you plan on painting it a creamier white but it‚Äôll still stick out like a sore thumb in the midst of all the darker wood. I would consider going a different color with that to tie it all together.
I love the green you have chosen but always feel like green houseplants can tick that box. Love the picture you have attached!¬† Keep in mind that the third photo is an example where the floor gives a color-drenched effect with the walls bc they are the same color.¬† I would recommend finding a rug you love first and then selecting a color. You probably would love a lot of different moody colors!
I thought your photos were upside down with a rug on the ceiling. Looks really weird.
Weve used BM Essex green for our moody space and we love it!!!
I‚Äôd stay with green and either color drench as others suggested or at the very least get a good area rug and some drapes in a darker, richer fabric. 

You might be surprised what the right rug and drapery can do here. That red tone will be harder to coordinate with, imo.
What app did you use for this??
Do the REAL bewitched colour! It's FABULOUS and will make your greens that you love really pop. That inspo slide plus a green Christmas tree (rugs and throws and stuff otherwise) is sooooo dreamy.
I like it better now to be honest
I think that the green still looks fine for your living room OP, feels really grandiose
I think that the green still looks fine for your living room OP, feels really grandiose
Green is beautiful
Omg beautiful space. I love that cast iron vase. I love well done moody rooms.

I would do a deeper red or deeper green. Or even black
I think if you want more contrast Bewitched is a good option but the green you have now is also lovely. I think painting the mantle will help a lot to achieve the moodier vibe you‚Äôre going for. 

I think what‚Äôs missing from the space is texture! You need a rug and curtains that aren‚Äôt white.
I like both colors, but like the red a little more.  I would color drench the room ‚Äî regardless of what color I pick and I would get the mantle to black or its original brick.
I like the green-but it‚Äôs a cool green maybe find a warm one

I painted my ceiling and part of my walls Raspberry Blush by Benjamin Moore

You will note that it is neither raspberry or blush.  It‚Äôs more like a chili pepper.  I absolutely adore it.

The remainder of the wall is cream

I highly recommend painting the ceiling and part of the walls to bring in a saturated color without overwhelming the space!

Then you add a gallery wall to further bring in the colors and mood you desire
Whatever gave you the idea of turning your fireplace into white. You have mainly traditional items in the room. the fireplace is splitting your mind into two. Modern and traditional. If you want to make it in between, then go for a darker to medium color on the fireplace like pick a color from the last picture and this would set you going. I think take inspiration from the last picture.
It‚Äôs just, so dark‚Ä¶ being some lighter colors in and take away the gloom.
Yeah I'm trying to feel where OP is coming from but if it's our opinion they're asking for - the green is what works best in this space and *with that chair*, imo.
Its a rain cloud with floating candles like in Harry Potter. Our Harry Potter Christmases tree goes under it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I would love to. Its on the list, its a battle with my Type A husband who thinks that ugly pattern hides imperfections ü§£
I concur
Apparently it's one of those decor things so it looks like there's clouds on the ceiling? There's toy candles hanging from it too. Maybe at night it looks better.
The last picture shows what it looks like on the wall. I agree, the app makes it look pink, but its an oxblood, very dark red
It‚Äôs really cool but I wish it weren‚Äôt a square. If it were more round it might look better
It looks like insulation hanging down....but I think it's meant to be there. Not sure. If that's meant to be there as part of the decor--to be ""witchy""--- it just looks like damage to me.
I think its probably one of those led rain cloud ceilings given the room vibes. They look really cool lit up.

It's a storm cloud with hanging lights like in Harry Potter. We put our Christmas tree under it every year- it's really cool
I love all of this!
Would you still color-drench the trim if your window panels (inside the glass) were white?
My husband got a wild hair and painted one restless night. I'd like to strip the paint back off and bring back the brick

I'll be selling that chair since we are building bookshelves that frame around the fireplace, I plan on staining those a dark brown.
The green looks great. If you want more contrast for the xmas tree maybe you can get a wall tapestry or other wall decoration to hang up behind the tree for holidays so it pops more? Something like a snowy field or big stained glass windows or something?
Are you getting started decorating this early?
Ah, so a bad witch then
This is actually genius, I too have a Harry Potter tree decorated tree with the train!
It does indeed hide the imperfections by turning them into a total disaster.
I would also lose the white paint on your fireplace. Strip it back to brick or paint it a dark color. It's a lovely room, I think you are close to what you are trying to achieve. No white, no cream.
That's a great idea. I'll try to cut around the cords and make it more flowy
Yeah, when I first looked at the picture I thought maybe there was water damage in the corner or something that needed to be cut out.  I think it mostly looks like a ceiling problem because it's a perfect rectangle in the corner of the room. 

Maybe it looks a little better at night, but it definitely has a temporary kid's-birthday-party-decorations vibe during the day. It feels pretty out of place in otherwise really nice room!

>got a wild hair

I love this phrasing- never heard it before!
That would look amazing!
Those are all soo beautiful. Farrow and Ball Brinjal is my second favorite after Bewitched.¬†
Good choice! Update us when you paint. Im excited to see the space
It'll certainly lend to that *academia noir* you want. You probably don't need me to remind you that it will be a lot of dark warm tones on top of each other. 

Let's summarize...

Green is your favorite color but you're over it being all over your wall. I assume you'd still like to add touches of green where it makes sense to you though? 

Red is what you're leaning toward - romantic and even brooding especially with the dark woods. But it could become overwhelming. 

Have you considered how other dark options would look with the dark wood and the colors/styles you'd like to fill the space with? Because I'm thinking that deep blue, mauve, or even a smokey, warm grey could really pop. 

Sorry if I steered you away and you don't want to be.
That's an amazing idea!!!

The whole phrase is 'got a wild hair up his ass'. I'm surprised you haven't heard it!

https://boards.straightdope.com/t/a-wild-hair-or-a-wild-hare/91861/10
You're perfectly fine! The reason I haven't jumped into this new paint is because where it is oxblood colored it can veer brown at times- which I am not a fan of (years of growing up in a home with brown paneled walls lol). The color I have now is gorgeous- it goes from a serene deep green to almost a dark foggy green. Currently its a foggy and rainy out and its gorgeous in this room. I will end up painting it Bewitched at some point, because I won't be able to stop thinking about it. However, before I do I am going to get a red/maroon rug there, sell the green chair (it was given to me and filled an empty space so I took it lol), strip the fireplace back to brick, and color drench with the leftover paint. If I still don't like it, then I will spent the $300 to paint the walls. I love your suggestions, thank you for being kind about it‚ò∫Ô∏è

Hi everyone! What is the best way to attach lattice to my trex deck? Specifically the front left where there is no beam that juts out. My yard is on a slope with highest point furthest from the house and the lowest as you get to the foundation. (So lattice is too high in some spots). Any and all tips would be appreciated! Thanks.

I personally like the thick green coated wire that is in the gardening section. I can bend it to be anchored into the ground and then feed it through the lattice then find a bolt end or something similar to twist it around. Then using pliers you can twist it, cut and, voila!  I‚Äôve done this to protect blueberry bushes in front of my house. Very subtle and secure."

","Help on layout

Pardon the mess is there anything else that we can do to to improve seating layout?




I would add a side table next to the big lamp for the two corners, maybe get rid of the bean bag chair
TV should be where the art is and art should be where the TV is. I‚Äôd move the armchairs to another room. 

I‚Äôd update the rug and cover the couches. The gray is really clashing with the wood floors. 

I‚Äôd also put the monstera plant by the window and get rid of the tall shelving unit.

Get rid of all the stuff in front of the fireplace.
The corner shelving unit is a bit of an eyesore. I‚Äôd remove that. 

Then center the rug and the couch that has its back to the stairs and place a chair in each window corner. 

You could also pull the couch that‚Äôs against the point wall out a little bit so it‚Äôs no right up against the wall and it‚Äôs still snug to the newly centered rug.
This might seem unconventional, and I‚Äôm not sure how well it would work, but I would try the following:

Push together the two main parts of the sectional so that it‚Äôs like a very long sofa facing the fireplace (and maybe push it slightly closer to the fireplace)

Move the tall bookshelf somewhere else

Put the two chaise portions of the sectional under the windows (perhaps remove the back cushion and add different pillows)

Put the armchairs on the left and right sides of the room 

If you do this, it will probably look better to get a larger rug and coffee table‚Ä¶ this would be a nice opportunity to get ones that work better style-wise. Perhaps consider the colors and feel of the painting (which would probably look better framed). New pillows would also help (the yellow ones in particular are struggling to incorporate well into this space)

(People will probably also say the TV is too high, which it might be, but I don‚Äôt have a TV so I don‚Äôt have strong opinions about what is a comfortable viewing height)
You could make everything a little more centered by putting the couches facing each other on either sides of the fireplace and the two chairs facing the fireplace.
r/TVTooHigh
I find it absolutely hilarious that those windows can be opened. I would like to meet the person who came up with this design and ask them wtf were they thinking.
Yeah that‚Äôs the plan
Would the arrangement of the couches stays like that?
This sounds like a good idea.
Thanks for the suggestion. Worth a try.
That makes the most sense, but for whatever reason OP has 2 couches with opposing chaises on them. They would be right up against each other üòÑ. My solution would be to replace at least one of the couches (preferably both), because that is going to hold them back regardless.
Height is not too bad. Plus we have a pull down wall mount. We pull it down when we watch tv.
What do you mean?
Yes
With this configuration, Where do u siggeat I put the two arm chairs?
Yeah this is my dillema. They would be right up against each other
You know what, never mind. For some reason they looked like they could be opened. I have seen things like that before.
On the left and right sides of the room. 

Alternatively, you could arrange the main parts of the sectional as above but put the chaises next to one another so they form a long sofa like area against the wall on the right (with added pillows against the wall so you have back support on the ends of the chaises). Then the armchairs clustered in the corner by the left window
The room is very large though- no need to have them too close together.
Another possibility ‚Äî create the long sofa with the main sectional pieces but push the whole thing all the way to the left. Then put the chaise with the blue throw on it perpendicular to the main sofa so that the end of the chaise abuts the leftmost sofa cushion (put the back pillow against the half wall and add more pillows). This might be enough seating (cluster the armchairs by the right window), and you could use the other chaise elsewhere. Or, you could put the other chaise on that side too, but it would be slightly awkward since the backs of the chaises would divide the two.

You could also flip this to the right side of the room (might look better up against the paneled wall, actually) ‚Äî in this case, you would use the other chaise and move the one w the blue throw on it elsewhere

This would be essentially ‚Äúfaking‚Äù a large sectional using what you have. It might be worth stealing the back cushion from the unused chaise for the chaise you do use, so it looks more convincing
Yeah but if we put the couch on each sde wall then it doesn‚Äôt look cozy though.
I would leave enough for a walkway on each side. Is it ok if both lounger portion of couch come in front of the fireplace a little bit. Center the rug and work from there.
Like both couch parallel to each other with the lounger near the fireplace?
Yes I feel like there is enough room to not have them touching but also have room to walk on both sides.
I think it would look more formal and symmetrical."

I think double rods with a pale blue sheer for the day time. And some deep blue velvet drapes for evening/night. I would go full color drenching in the room. I love the color and the style of your space already.
Ceiling-mounted curtains that go floor-to-ceiling elongate the windows and make the room feel bigger.
Blackout-lined Roman outside mounted above the window - makes your window look taller, doesn‚Äôt have to cover much of the glass when it‚Äôs fully open. 
If you want privacy during the day, add a low profile roller shade in a translucent/privacy fabric. There are super simple materials or more decorative and textural ones. I would go with a light color so as to bring in the max amount of natural light.
I love the wall color, you have a nice room. I vote Roman shades, but I'm biased because I think Venetian blinds are kind of ugly tbh
Venetian blinds
What paint color is that
Something light,maybe the color of the tree flowers in sheers
The room is nicely decorated
The room is clean
Thanks! I wish I could but with radiators under the windows and that window with both a radiator under it and a wall right next to it, making drapes work seems kinda of impossible :[
You think I can make that work even with having radiators under the windows and having one of the windows directly up against an interior wall so the curtain would have nowhere to go on one side (first picture)?

The room just needs cleaning.
You need a new bed frame. It looks like a toddlers bed. Are you super short? Also, you need some nightstands and lamps. It‚Äôs time to go to the thrift store, or IKEA.  I‚Äôd rotate the bed too, and put a nightstand on each side. Move the sofa out from the window. Get a throw rug. Do the metal bars unlock? Major fire hazard if not. I‚Äôd also get a little table to put next to the sofa. The room has great light, so maybe some plants.
I would definitely get a rug to add some color. I feel like green and white color scheme you kinda have with the couch and walls could work if you leaned into it more. Nicer sheets and maybe use some vinyl wallpaper to cover the blue and white drawers under the bed since they look a little like a kid room. Some wall art. Maybe a plane somewhere?"

Im glad you commented on that.  It was one of the main reasons I bought the house.  It is just so interesting and lovely.  The house is a wooden cottage built in the 1950‚Äôs by a builder - for himself and his family.  The bones of the house are fabulous.  The railing is amazing
I love this take and you are correct.  I am quirky but also a well put together human in most aspects. It reflects that.  I feel like with styling people are also scared that something like this would go ‚Äòout of vogue‚Äô after some time.  Truthfully though everything does.  Even the less bold choices age.  And ill only keep it for as long as i love it, so why not!?!
What a lovely thing to read! You made my day

Oh no!! Im so sad you didnt know!! Were you aware thar Ryden released dolls also? I got truly lucky with the art but i believe the actual dolls were the most coveted item.
Yes, I woke up at like, 3am (Australian time) and managed to snag one of each Barbie from the collection! It was my last big purchase before I stopped collecting dolls, so I figured I may as well go cuckoo lol.

What's your style/budget?  It's a great space with pretty floors and trim -  great architectural details Until then, your dining room table should be centered under the light.  You may have room for a buffet or console table between the windows - a couple lamps (thin, tall) would be great there.  In the living room-  that nook is a great spot for a built in bench with storage underneath, or two small chairs with another storage piece behind them or between them (interesting dresser, console table, end table). Maybe a plant.  Consider flipping the tv and sofa walls.  If budget allows, there are better shaped sofas for your space -  think shorter back and more square.   Two small square ottomans can take the place of a coffee table- use a tray for drinks and stuff like that.   They will move easy and convert to extra seating when needed.  Your rug is really too small.  The windows are great-  don't cover them up with curtains.
I think you can get a larger sized dining table - maybe a 6 seater in a different color than the current one since it matches the floor color. Maybe a dark wood with some chairs with fabric. This could also double as a working space and you can remove the working table from the living room and have a nice bay seating there. Consider wall mounting the TV. and just get a coffee table and some decor accessories to start with
For wall space, decide on an art style/color palette you like (that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean ‚Äúall hues of the same color‚Äù or art that‚Äôs in the exact same style/color scheme, it just means ‚Äúpick a theme‚Äù even if that theme is ‚Äúeclectic rainbow,‚Äù if you get my meaning!) and then I agree with another poster: pick a single wall paper design that jives with your theme, and then 1 or 2 paint colors that complement the wallpaper (I‚Äôd say one ‚Äúbolder‚Äù color and one more neutral color). Then, add some art to the painted walls. Try not to hang pieces too high or too low; you want them to draw the eye roughly to the center of the vertical wall space. Have a blast, you‚Äôve got an awesome blank canvas you can bring to life in your own unique way!
Japanese. The wood trim would go really well with that aesthetic.
Budget would be a few hundred bucks a month. It‚Äôs going to be a slow build. Any recommendations for wall space? That‚Äôs what I would like to focus on first since we just got the furniture and would probably upgrade that later on.
Thank you so much! Any suggestions for wall space? That‚Äôs our main priority right now before upgrading the furniture since we just got it all.
I get that! So for now, in your living room, center your sofa on the wall it's on and center the console & tv across from that.  Move the rug back until it tucks just under the sofa.  In front of the windows, turn the rug.  This will define your space.  This room looks long and narrow, so you want to avoid having anything wide over the sofa, but you could do a row of multiples - 2 or 3.  Also, you don't want anything on this wall that's going to dominate the room. You don't really want to fill the space wider than the sofa and you don't want to go higher than the center of the arch.  You have so many options for what to put there.  It doesn't have to be anything expensive, just something you enjoy seeing for now.  Even framed posters could work. I have framed pages from books and pieces of wallpaper before.  And I've also painted canvas solidly to bring in some color. Sometimes, even texture looks nice.  Also, you can get art and prints from thrift stores for SO cheap. I'd also invest in a lamp before anything else though-  maybe a floor lamp in the corner by the little desk and in the corner by the arch, a table and lamp. Ambient light will cozy up your space more than things on the wall. 

In the dining room, between the windows, you do have the option for something larger or a mirror there. You don't need something on every wall- your woodwork is doing a great job of adding visual interest.
A wallpaper in the entire dining space and a painting in between the two windows in that area. Also a console with cupboards can be placed there to store stuff and a painting can be placed above it."

Area rugs
That cat tree... is lacking. Try putting it in front of the window and it wont look as awkward.
Also everything in that room is so low! 

You need something to catch the eye a print or large photo or cluster on the wall more centered as well as the sectional.

I would flip the couch & tv to opposite sides. Then mount the tv. A large area rug with color single or multi. 

Get rid of shoe rack area. Find something that hides them with style. Maybe something that looks like a [shoe cupboard](https://www.wayfair.com/storage-organization/pdp/latitude-run-lismore-shoe-storage-cabinet-up-to-20-pairs-w008722277.html?piid=1281371798LismoreShoeStorageCabinetUpto20Pairs)

Then tighten up those droopy lights.
It‚Äôs a huge room with nothing in the middle. Furniture doesn‚Äôt always need to be pushed against the walls. Consider pulling the couch out and using it in the middle of the room to divide the space into two ‚Äúzones‚Äù.  

Also you need more lights!
https://preview.redd.it/ws48uj3f0oqf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b17612408d776d1a14552889ce31e2871dfa3d9

This!!
What‚Äôs your budget? What‚Äôs your taste? Are you renting or do you own? The biggest issues are the dim lighting and the state of the rug. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any installed lighting. With a high enough budget, i‚Äôd install some light fixtures. Short of that, i‚Äôd dramatically increase the standing lighting to include some high-wattage bulbs with cone-shapes shades that project onto the ceiling to maximize light. For the rug, the high budget solution would be replacement. A lower budget solution would be bright area rugs. Which ones and how many depends on your personal style. If modern, a single large one. If boho, several smaller ones in contrasting bright colors etc. 

I think long curtains over the window would make a dramatic difference vs the shades. High budget would be premade ones and a nice rod. Lower budget would be to get some fabric and make them yourself with a black plastic rod. 

Furniture wise, again it depends on your style and budget. High budget is get new furniture (i can‚Äôt really make suggestions without knowing your style). Medium budget is thrift at like a Habitat for Humanity. Low budget would be slip covers and a bright textured blanket over the back.

Also to design the whole room with some kind of cohesive layout i‚Äôd need to see the whole room. I can‚Äôt really tell what it looks like layout wise.

I would move the couch away from the kitchen and put a little table with chairs there. I think a little glass table would be cute. And then I would like the one comment suggests, get an area rug for under the couch and tv area. If there‚Äôs still space, I would also add a little desk for a computer. Hope this is helpful at all :)
Put the tv on the opposite wall centered to the room or slightly closer to the window. 

Place the couch opposite the tv with the back of the couch lining up with the edge of the kitchen doorway and the front door (the sides of the doors closer to the center of the room). 

This will create  bit of a hallway/pathway behind the couch that connect the doors. I‚Äôd then put a couple stools at the pass through bar. 

You can put a little table next to the front door under the hooks.
Doodled kind of a mock-up, but my recommendations:

1. Move the lamp to the far left, and the fiddle leaf fig tree in front of the window.
2. Move the couch forward from the wall a little bit and add a behind the couch console (this will let you run cables for electronics charging, have a place to set knick knacks or cups, etc).
3. Add more art on the wall above the couch. The current art piece is not quite large enough width-wise, so adding frames on either side can help balance this out!
4. Add an area rug and a low coffee table to create a focal point in the room.
5. Hang a rod and curtains to bring in more color, vertical lines, and texture to the space.

Bonus points:

1. If able, swap to a slimmer console to streamline the entertainment area and wall-mount the TV above it (make sure not to hang it super high, though! Your TV should roughly be at eye level). You could also add totes underneath for additional storage (and a place to put cat toys when not in use)!
2. Try to pick 1 common color to focus around with 2-3 accent colors. (Example: since your couch/walls are white, and the carpet is grey, I'd personally tie in soft pink and pale green accent tones for items like additional throw pillows, the curtains, the wall art, and the rug).
3. If needing another textural contrast, could also add in a cute blanket ladder or basket!

Put the cat tunnel through the bottom of the cat tree. Move the cat tree and toys against the right wall. Neatly hang your string lights by adding more hooks instead of it looking floppy.  Center your couch in that space. Put the black accent table on the left side of the couch and the white light/book case on the right side of the couch. Clean up the other unnecessary items, fluff your pillows fold up blankets. If you have cash get a nice black/white/grey color area rug. Cardboard boxes are great for kitty play but you should get rid of them within a week. Kitty will be even more excited every time a new one comes.
First, I‚Äôd remove as much clutter as possible (most of the shoes, open box of cat toys on the floor, stuff on the counter, boxes)

Then, rearrange some of the awkwardly placed things (move your two small pictures down to be centered with the opening thing, hang the string lights up neater, move the cat tree by the window and the lamp next to the couch on the right, the side table to the left of the couch, move the couch and tv closer to the center of the room along with the art above it)

And if you have the money‚Ä¶
Curtains

Area rug

Accent chair

More art

More lighting

Coffee table

And if you decide to get more furniture, opt for more substantial pieces. You already have a lot of ‚Äúleggy‚Äù furniture

Hanging planter instead of a plant stand to save space?
What do you think about decorating it like this?

https://preview.redd.it/z1465w9wt6rf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c919b023e94671579296f1318e21acb0673309
Put the tv on the opposite wall centered to the room or slightly closer to the window. 

Place the couch opposite the tv with the back of the couch lining up with the edge of the kitchen doorway and the front door (the sides of the doors closer to the center of the room). 

This will create  bit of a hallway/pathway behind the couch that connect the doors. I‚Äôd then put a couple stools at the pass through bar.
I‚Äôd use that whole space by the window and make it a desk/work area.
When in doubt a big mirror and plants! Hanging plants and floor plants can make the world of difference.
Great sofa! Let it be the focal point: Center it on the wall and add a patterned area rug and more art. Add two bar-height stools. Plz tuck the cat stuff in the corner with the big fake plant so it's partially hidden (really nobody but you wants to see all that, honestly)
A tall black display shelf would add dimension and storage. Maybe an accent chair too?
The art is hung way too high and it‚Äôs too small width wise for the wall it‚Äôs on. You need to invest in a piece of furniture that will draw the eye up and fill in some of that big wall‚Ä¶like a bookcase.
An extra comfy chair facing the window, just past the couch, with an area rug, would help create a¬† cozy space within the living room.
Buy a rug to create a zone for the couch, a coffee table, some kind of storage (with doors) to hide clutter if you have the space for it. Maybe a table lamp? Or backlight the tv console. I just feel like a little more light would make it more inviting. Curtains, if possible with the cat(s). I'd also lower the artwork a little. If it were me, I'd also move the sofa over a bit, and keep the artwork centered on it.
How about floating the couch in the middle of the room and putting a small table (maybe with collapsible wings) behind it to turn a big room into two practical spaces. The table behind the couch could be for eating and resting drinks from the sofa so you could move the soft piece away from the sofa away and use it as a coffee table.
Cleaning all the crap off the floor would be a start.
Pull your couch forward; having furniture up against the walls makes spaces less inviting and awkward.¬†
Two stools for the opening between the little window/barstool. 

Shift the couch more center and place the lamp next to the couch, align the center console with the couch. 

Get an area rug for the cat items to corral and separate the cats space for the living room.
You can move the couch closer to the window area and get barstools and area rugs maybe some wall shelves too and a floor lamp could be nice
Cleaning for one.. you‚Äôll feel less stressed when there‚Äôs less clutter and junk on the floor. 

A coffee table would pull a lot of it together, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of rugs on carpet. Swap the cat tree and the lamp. If you‚Äôre never planning on changing the artwork, get a throw blanket that has some of the reds/pinks in it and keep it folded nicely at the end of the couch. Also swap the blinds for actual curtains that are a dark gray or black. Or if you have to keep the blinds, get long curtains and put the rod as close to the ceiling as you can and have the curtains just barely reach the ground.
Here‚Äôs a pretty affordable way to bring some character.

Get more cats and themed cat towers.
i would move the couch to touch the wall that the chaise is on. and then in that empty spot where the cat tree is now, i‚Äôd put maybe a shoe rack/ bench to sit and put your shoes on and/ or an entryway table
Get rid of the string lights, makes houses look like a restaurant.
looks great
honestly i like this. it looks homey. id love to see a console or a credenza under the bar for storage. a couple trinkets. youd probably really benefit from one of those doorway bench coatrack thingies to have a place to put your shoes on, set the mail down etc. a frame around that poster, maybe? and get some more for colour? i looooove thrifting art pieces and just painting the shitty wood frame with gold paint hahahaha. anyways this all feels so nitpicky because i see a welcoming space filled with love. i bet those kitties are SO happy here.
We need this as an automatic reply
do you have any in mind that would look good? i suck at picking things out for decorating lol.
Deff needs to be at a window by default anyway. Kitty needs to be able to see outside

Lighting, lighting, lighting!!
That and ‚Äúplants‚Äù
Haha. I agree
I don‚Äôt have any specific ideas. Maybe tell us what your thoughts are for the specific areas of the space? That might guide how many rugs, shapes, colors, textures‚Ä¶
Most of your furniture it really rectangular so I would go with either a circular or some other irregular shape to bring more shape into the room and big enough to go from the couch to the TV. I would recommend something *mostly* neutral but with some pops of colour in it that would tie in with the painting behind your couch. And then I would also add a coffee table, either rectangular or an oval. 

I think the room could use a nice bookshelf that you could put books, knickknacks, plants etc. on - I would honestly ditch the side table next to the couch in lieu of the coffee table that I mentioned, move the cat tree closer to the couch, and then put the book shelf in between the cat tree and the lamp, or do it the other way around and move the lamp next to the couch and the cat tree into the corner where the lamp is. I‚Äôd also get some nice prints that have some colour to them (not huge, like 8.5x11), frame them and put them up on that side of the room as well - maybe a set of 4 or 6, they don‚Äôt have to be expensive you can find nice canvas prints on Amazon, Temu etc. and frames at the dollar store.
But what does OP do with the rest of the room? The AI image cuts like half the floor space off üòÖ

What a beautiful room. It‚Äôs begging for a mid century modern look

100 percent lean into a mid century modern style for this room. The clean lines of MCM furniture will help make the room feel more modern and sleek and you can mix in some other modern and post-modern pieces. This room has so much potential, but don't ruin it by trying to force the wrong aesthetic on it, it will look bad and forced. This kind of room will never naturally look good if you try and make it farmhouse-y or any other wrong aesthetic
Don‚Äôt modernize, mid century modern is now modern! It warm and cozy and beautiful. Check out Pinterest for inspiration.
If you plan to take down the paneling, please do it carefully and try to find a buyer for it. That said, DON'T TOUCH THE PANELING*! You have a gorgeous midcentury-looking room here with the paneling as is and the flooring. It just needs decor. Look at r/midcenturymodern and r/midcentury for ideas.
*Start with a fresh coat of paint in light, neutral colors to instantly brighten the room. Add a statement piece like a modern rug or wall art, swap old lighting for sleek fixtures, and declutter surfaces. Small touches like plants or updated cushions can make a big difference without a full renovation.*"

If it were me, I'd put them on one long rod across the entire wall.   I can't tell from the picture but the blinds look like fairly nice faux wood ones?  It'll look kind of nicely dramatic and when you've got the drapes pulled out and just sheers across the windows it'll look nice as well.  

I'd also check out some of the DIY sites, they have schematics on how different curtain/drape set ups look at different heights, lengths, and wall types.
A suggestion: you can purchase a parallel curtain rod to have 2 types of curtains. So we you can have sheer curtains on the road nearest the window and blackout curtains furthest form the windows.

A curtain all the way across, aome single art in the center top
Pintrest is your friend here. 

I‚Äôve started hanging a rod from the ceiling. It has a more simplistic, but dramatic effect. It will also elevate the look of earth toned drapes.
Treat this as one window -  one long rod all the way across.  Anything else is going to be a struggle for balance and will look messy.  Hang it at the halfway point between the top of the window and the top of the side wall (the one that isn't peaked).  Txtend it about 4 inches outside of the window.  Because it is so long, you might consider a track curtain for easy of opening/closing, which it seems you'll do often.  Alternatively, ring clips on a rod move easily and also look nice.  Grommets will not be a good look here.  For length, go right to the floor but do not puddle-  puddles are beautiful and dramatic sometimes, but not functional.  Also, you'll have a lot of curtain, which means a lot of puddle and instead of dramatic punch, you'll have ocean of clutter fabric-  messy.   Since you want simple, IKEA is a great place to look for texture and their black out fabrics are excellent.  Sheers are functional and cheap -  decent enough weight to hang nicely.  Don't add anything in the middle wall-  you have enough to look at there."

The second tile sample because the larger size tile creates a sense of calm while your current tile and #1 are similarly busy with so many, smaller pieces. When a counter has lots of movement , or is a composite of many colors like yours, a backsplash with less going on is a nice  counter compliment that supports vs competes. If that makes sense.
Don‚Äôt trust ChatGPT on sizes or colors, it‚Äôs going to get them wrong. It‚Äôs just not that good at it. I personally don‚Äôt love either option. Maybe a cream zellige? 

https://www.flooranddecor.com/porcelain-ceramic-decoratives/zellige-crema-ceramic-tile-101074953.html
2 makes it feel less chaotic and more open with the height of each piece if that makes sense. 

The 1st was way too busy for me. So I say #2.
2 is the only one that isn‚Äôt too cold/blue for your bench top.  You need a warm white and bigger tile the better, with a colour matched grout‚Ä¶ bench top, cupboards and lovely view are enough things to look at‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt need to make a feature out of the backsplash.
2 recommendations: 

1) avoid competing stone patterns. The counter is busy, so you‚Äôll want an patterned mostly solid tile for the backsplash
2) only bring the backsplash out to the edge of the upper cabinet, not all the way to the edge of the counter.
Have you thought about adding color? You could take inspo from this pic and go with blue and then update your hardware to black. the wood is great!

Green backsplash tiles- pull the shade from the counter
Of these, 2!
2 is the better option, but it looks like it's not rectified tile so the grout lines will be uneven. If you go with that tile you need to pick a very similar color grout or it will look like garbage.
Honestly, I would keep looking. They‚Äôre both in the wrong ‚Äúhue‚Äù for the existing counters and cabinets. Try to find something ‚Äòwarmer‚Äô maybe try and pick up that light green in your counters
2
2 looks pretty timeless
Two! :)

Defo not the dark one
Despite what most seem to be saying, do not go for a pale colours. It makes the entire area look cheap.

While the grey is potentially too harsh, I'd definitely be looking something with more depth.
From the photo you posted, I can confidently state that those are not cherry cabinets. The heavy, textured grain means those are oak. Sadly, no matter what you do to the rest of the kitchen, the oak cabinets take it back to the 1970s/80s. If you love them, great. None of those backsplashes work with those cabinets, though. Keep searching. Do not spend a lot of money on this interim project. If you really want to update your kitchen, the oak cabinets need to be dealt with.
I'm not a fan of any of the options, BUT I like the size of the larger white tiles. A larger tile will look less busy. I think a blue/green/grey-ish color for the tile backsplash would be nice to pull some color from the countertop and would compliment the dark grey, and the color of the cabinets too.
Will you be keeping the cabinet color? If so, I say #2 because the cream color pulls in the oak color and it‚Äôs good together. If the cabinet color changes then #1 works. BUT, speaking from experience with lighter colored backsplash, clean the grout and tile weekly. If stains like dark juice or pasta sauce get on there and are left untreated, it‚Äôs impossible to get off
2.  The counter already has a pattern so I think simpler is better
I like 2, it brightens the area a lot
Option 2 is the best!
Honestly, I would get a bigger sink first.
I have 2 as my backsplash. Very nice and clean looking.
Going lighter with the backsplash is definitely going to¬†**open up your kitchen**¬†and keep it from feeling heavy since you‚Äôve got dark floors and warm cherry cabinets. Light tile bounces more light around, so the space feels bigger.

Between your two picks:

* **Ivory ceramic subway tile**¬†‚Üí simple, timeless, and super easy to clean. It won‚Äôt fight with your busy countertop and it‚Äôll give you that contrast you‚Äôre looking for.
* **Marble mosaic backsplash**¬†‚Üí beautiful, adds texture and a high-end look, but since your counters already have a lot of movement, it might start to feel a little busy. Plus marble needs sealing and a bit more maintenance.

So I‚Äôd think of it this way: if you want¬†**low-maintenance and clean contrast**, ceramic is the safer bet. If you want¬†**luxury and don‚Äôt mind sealing/maintenance**, marble can be stunning.

Either way, a lighter backsplash with light grout is the right move ‚Äî it‚Äôll tie the wood, floor, and countertop together and shift your kitchen toward the cooler tones you‚Äôre aiming for.

I like the creamy colored subway tiles. I think the grey looks too busy.
2 but darker grout for some contrast. Pick up the darkest brown in the countertops.
2
Agreed about ChatGPT not being a great visualization tool, it distorts things too much, but based off the other photos I think 2!
Two
I like 2
I kind of like what is there already.
Whatever you choose stay away from the last pic its horrible I would say the dark Grey would look best pretty versatile if you decide to paint it could go with dark or light colors ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Another vote for 2
2!
2 for sure. 1 looks very dated
Im a fan of 2 and 1, 3 is a little out of place
I like it as it is. I dont like either of the cream/white. Its too light and takes away from the counter, which i dont think is at all busy, i like the flecks of color. What is currently there feels warm and has personality.
1
Going against the flow. I like #1
Last one.  You need contrast .
""Pick number 3 my lord!"" ‚úåÔ∏è
Another option is no backsplash. They aren‚Äôt really necessary, just another trend.
1
Definable 1
Definitely 2.
Neither.  They just don't go well with your current cabinets and countertops. 

Question.   What is your countertop made of?
Artisan Oyster from Floor and Decor is pretty timeless
2 installed vertically!
#2
The dark grey style is so 2009
New cabinets.
I like 1; don't think it's too busy and it's not generic like 2, which you see everywhere.
I'd go with #2. Paint the walls some shade of teal blue in the counter and change your hardware to black.
1 is the best but not great imo. I think it‚Äôs all too yellow / too similar in color. Sort of clashes
Yeah the 2nd tile probably would only be like 6 tiles high, looking at the first photo. ChatGPT made it small enough for 10 tiles
Here to say this. No need to round the corner with the backsplash!
We were trying to do this with the current backsplash, but it clashes with our countertop. We think we need a neutral to tone down the orange in the cabinets and the countertop colors.
I agree! I think this color and shape/size of tile would be very nice and complementarity!
100% agree. That counter is awesome and these backsplash choices are bringin' it down!
Yes, the plan is to keep the oak, at least for the next 10 years.
The last pic is the counter
They‚Äôre wood cabinets in good shape. If I was OP I‚Äôd keep them and if they really want to, they always can strip and restain them!
Our previous contractor screwed up and did that.
Ow lol well that makes a lot more sense ü§£
True, but just changing the tile on the backsplash in that kitchen is not going to make a difference with those overbearing cabinets hanging down from above. In all honesty, they should save their money and wait until they can renovate the entire kitchen and take care of all of the problems at once.
Or paint the cabinets. They aren‚Äôt high quality enough to warrant sanding/restaining. Kitchen will be dated regardless until you address the cabinets and painting them will give you the best bang for your buck for the time being
Exactly my reason for saying, save the money and redo the entire kitchen. That backsplash is not going to make a lick of difference in the way you feel about that kitchen."

You can go with some plants, put them in a vase and then on the wall, a few paintings or some wall lights of some sort. I bought mine from here https://esntl.shop/collections/the-art-of-home

 Current living room space moved my chairs around. Looking to put up a wall gallery behind on the right side wall. What improvements would you suggest to make this more moody? 

A deep blue-green like [Knoxville Grey](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-ca/paint-colours/colour/hc-160/knoxville-gray) by Benjamin Moore (don‚Äôt be confused by the name it‚Äôs not actually grey) would be a perfect moody colour and coordinate well with the colour of your couch and chair.
Can you paint? Caponata Benjamin Moore. https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/af-650/caponata it‚Äôs a burgundy brown. Always get a sample.
Your furniture has all very neutral undertones with the exception of the one chair.  That was an orange undertone.  That gives you a pretty blank slate in regards to color - if the one chair clashes, just switch it out.

I wouldn't do a gallery wall.  I think with the plants, etc, the room is fairly busy and a gallery wall will be too much.  Instead I would pick one large horizontal piece for that wall or no more than three smaller pieces.  And I would move the head piece into that group of three or move it out completely.  It feels cramped in that corner.

You have a particular art taste, so I would keep to that.  Pull your wall color from one of the art pieces that you will put up.

To create moody, the most important thing is really to put a color on the walls - beiges, whites, creams, and greys don't create moodiness - they are by design bland and neutral.
1. Remove the plants from in between the chairs and only retain the mini side table between them. The area looks cluttered right now 
2. Place a few pictures / paintings on the wall above the chairs
Large rug like 9x12 to cover the carpet and anchor the furniture. Front feet of couch should be on it at least a few inches. 

Large art on wall right of tv. Remove art from right of TV. Add a credenza to right wall with a framed mirror and the art that‚Äôs sitting on the side table. It could be a whole gallery wall. 

Add more lamps and remove one or both armchairs.

I thought u had a monitor lizard on ur couch lol
Yes i can i will grab sample tomorrow
Actually, your store may have a specific fan book. It‚Äôs called the affinity collection. They have a separate fan book with larger swatches. Many times you can take that home. See it in the room kind of get an idea before you buy a sample. I mean I absolutely love that color. It‚Äôs a gorgeous color. There are some variations of the color, lighter and darker so you can get a better idea because they‚Äôre not the little tiny squares.

Edit: it doesn‚Äôt remove the need to buy samples, but there‚Äôs variations of the colors and if you wanted to go lighter or darker, it would give you more of an idea before buying a sample.
Would this color and a lighter color look good lime wash throughout the living room?
Lighter would be depends on how light you wanna go would it work lime washed yes. Some of this would be depending on how your room alters the color I have adjustable lights. The only reason my living room isn‚Äôt going to be painted. This color is because my walls changed the paint color and I do not want to skim coat the entire house.  

I believe the next lighter is chambourd. https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/af-645/chambourd

https://www.colorxs.com/palette/color/caponata-af-650

Edit And let me give a quick warning iPhones, take horrible picture of paint. You can change the style to dramatic, but there is no way to actually turn off the correction settings that they have set up in the iPhone so what you see is not what you‚Äôre taking a picture of it. It can be frustrating. Just an FYI, you gotta go with what you see and not the photo.

I thought visually if it looked like it‚Äôs the height as the lamp it would be good. I like it where it is, but I am left wondering if it would look better higher. 

I don‚Äôt think a painting is really needed there. If you raise it, itll look awkward
No, I‚Äôd move it elsewhere. The blank wall will look better and gives the eyes a place to rest.
Painting doesn‚Äôt belong over the tv. Move it
I'd move the painting somewhere else, you could try putting a clock above the TV if it looks too bare.
Raise it up and off the wall and put it somewhere else.
Move the painting to another wall. Right now the TV and the painting are competing for attention.
No. You move it off that wall.
You move the paint to another wall
Yes or move it to a different wall
Is there a big gap behind the entertainment unit? I kind of feel like the entire area needs to be redone to fit that odd cut out.
I would not put a vertical piece of art back there. Not the painting, not any vertical piece.
Move it instead of
The obvious answer is to get a credenza that the TV lowers into.
Doesn't matter how high you raise the painting you're still not going to see his willy.
The painting looks odd there. I would say move it and replace it with a different decoration or get rid of it completely üëç
Ditch it
Whatever you do Don‚Äôt put the TV any higher either
The painting technically should be higher because ‚Äòwhere‚Äôs the bottom of the frame?‚Äô But it‚Äôs also too big to go higher and look purposeful. Find a new home for it.
But I‚Äôd shift the light 2 inches over to the left and the tv over 3.5 inches to the left.
The frame being level with the lamp is nice, but you need a shorter piece of art so the TV isn‚Äôt blocking it. I‚Äôd recommend something like a panoramic photo or similar.
I‚Äôd replace the painting by mounting the TV. The two different shapes throw this off. If you want decor on the wall behind the TV I would do something softer ambit the same width as the TV to create balance.
I love the lamp, where is it from please?
No you move the painting. You should have one anchor piece here and it‚Äôs the TV.
What do you want to look at? My guess is it's the TV. Remove the painting. The lamp isn't helping either, IMHO.
Move the painting- it doesn‚Äôt belong there anymore
The painting is good behind the TV but you do have to move it up. Move it up so it's the same height to the bottom of the crown molding and the right hand corner. And then pic plase!
üòÇ
ü§£
There is a switch right behind the tv which prevents me from doing that. And yes, I may have to move the painting from there. Thanks!
Thanks! It‚Äôs a lamp someone had thrown out and I covered it in a fabric from Malawi! Probably an Ikea  piece.

I‚Äôm wanting to start decorating my living room all year round, but I‚Äôm having issues coming up with inspiration. 

I‚Äôm more into gothic/dark decor, but my husband is not into that. I need ideas on ‚Äúnormal‚Äù living decor that adds a touch of darkness. 

Buy pieces that you love.  Don't go looking for a ""gothic"" or ""dark"" item.  Just look at pieces that you are attracted to and that your husband is good with.

My home has all sorts of ""styles"" in it.  Dragon head sconces, antique piano stools, Ikea tv consule, rattan bookcase, mission style table lamp, narwhal tusk, cubist cat statues, chesterfield black sofa and chair - and that's just one room.  It works because it's not trying to be something, it's simply reflecting my tastes.

So incorporate your personalities.  Pay attention to color undertones - a burgundy with a purple undertone will create a darker atmosphere than a burgundy with a pink undertone.  You can combine that burgundy with a purple undertone with lighter woods and fabrics and paints with a purple undertone and it will work.

This is a nice breakdown of the various wood undertones:  [https://1stopfloor.com/shop/accessories/design-tools/the-wood-color-wheel/?srsltid=AfmBOooMwAgUFR5C6y-5AmXgrLyMylZFU3OkFX4tckvYTNFILM4dhVS6](https://1stopfloor.com/shop/accessories/design-tools/the-wood-color-wheel/?srsltid=AfmBOooMwAgUFR5C6y-5AmXgrLyMylZFU3OkFX4tckvYTNFILM4dhVS6)

Thank you!

A long rectangular mirror and a sideboard‚Ä¶
For the dining room, you could consider painting it a different color to better define the space. I would consider a rug under the table and a hutch or credenza against the empty wall. You can use it to store dinnerware and linens; a large statement picture above would really personalize the room.

If it's in your budget I would upsize the tv; the one you have looks too small for the space. Regardless, you need a longer console. A large area rug will make a huge difference - again, it would define the space and add personalization. The coffee table is a bit small to be functional. I would find one that better fills the space. Move the sofa a couple of inches away from the windows. As always, plants help add color.
Warm colors help stimulate the appetite‚Äîstay away from blues, grays, etc. A colorful set of floor to ceiling drapes would be terrific and a large piece of real art would add a lot to the space. Your pulley light is wonderful!
Art or colored vases ?
I like the DR window shade and think it would look cool to have a long curtain on each side if it.
I think you're right, I was thinking of painting it some shade of blue but I'm not sure it'd fit quite in. And yeah, I'm considering adding some plants but I'm so bad with them.

You don't necessarily need to place anything on the ledge; the artwork can be the focal point.
Nothing. Leave it empty and you won‚Äôt have to deal with dust.
‚òùÔ∏èü§£,, traditionally people place useless decorative items up there ,, then let them collect dust to the point they get negative comments from guests. Then they spend an entire Saturday on a wobbly step stools taking them down, dusting them and then putting them back. 

You earn extra credit if you drop and brake something while cleaning it or fall off the step stool. 

It's not important what you put up there,, what is important is that it must be something useless and attracts dust like a magnet. 

Good luck in you new decorations,,, 

You got this üòèüëç
Don't put anything up there.¬†
Leave it empty up there, and find bigger art.
Ditch the wine bottles, unless they are filled with nice ones, the alcohol will eventually attract fruit flies and it just kinda reads as romanticized alcoholism to me. 

Start looking for different statues or vases of all different colors to put up there, possibly fill em with twinkle lights or line underneath them with lights and they will cast pretty color stained glass shadows almost.
You clearly do not have cats üòÇ
Put nothing there. Your eyes will adjust to the new look and your brain will subconsciously appreciate it.
Pothos, all the way.
Yeah, I agree with others that you can just leave it bare.  But as you take the bottles down, line the ledge with newspaper or wax paper to collect the dust and you can just throw it out when it gets nasty.
Once you take the bottles down, consider leaving it undecorated. You may find after a week or two that you like it empty.
Take them off. Clean the top and leave it empty. You don‚Äôt need anything up there.
You should think more vertically. The bottle are nice, but if you lay them flat you can start stacking.
Add a larger canvas or a wood carving on the blank wall, a long one on the next wall and focus lighting on top, along the ledge. Top stays empty.
‚ú®nothing‚ú®
Remove the wall for an open floor plan!  Maybe an island or a peninsula if there is plumbing there.
Please don‚Äôt.  Why do people think every horizontal space must be covered with objects of some kind?  As-is, this oddly shaped bar area looks like a frat house, if frat boys drank wine.  The cheap led lights, the macrame plant holder, the sign telling people how to live, the highly textured stucco - it‚Äôs a vibe, for sure, and not a ‚Äúgrown ups live here‚Äù vibe.  The wall art is cool.  The pass through shelf might look better in the same color as the wood ledge up top.  I suggest you take down the bottles and leave it at that.  Take the hanging plant down, while you‚Äôre up there.  And the LED strip lights.  If you need light in this area, add masculine/neutral looking hard-wired wall sconces.  If you want to add plants, start with a tallish plant (or a medium tall plant in a plant holder with legs - you can buy on Amazon for $15-20).  Place it on the ground in this general area.  If you‚Äôre busy and don‚Äôt have much time to tend plants, a snake plant (also called mother in law‚Äôs tongue) is a good option - very vertical, very low water needs and does okay in less sunny rooms.

Hate to say it, but artificial plants seems like the best option.
Yea a couple... The trail really nicely so a couple bigger ones will grow into the space for sure
No no no.  All terrible and I‚Äôm sure sarcastically suggested.
Very diplomatically put.  Everything about this space is‚Ä¶ugh, IMO.  I try to respect other peoples‚Äô aesthetics, but this is so ugly.  The extremely rough textured stucco, the beige paint color.  It‚Äôs all bad.  The art is not what II would choose, but I feel like at least it shows some personality.  Is it placed well on this odd structure, no.  But that‚Äôs so far down the list.
Thank you for the recommendation, but I just can‚Äôt do artificial plants.
Thank you so much, really appreciate it!
I took it as sarcasm, lol
There're quite a few varieties, too. Golden, Pearls and Jade, Sterling Silver... A couple different types could look nice together with similar care needed, so you're not managing a bunch of different schedules.

Larger lamp on side table. Trailing plant and 8x10 photo on top of black shelf. Move existing art on the side of the tv a little further out (equally) on both sides. Put another small lamp on the table next to the door and declutter that bad boy, especially getting rid of the office paper organizer. . Get rid of the dinky fake vine on the window treatment and get rid of curtains all together. Get a cord hider and put your cords in it on the wall behind the tv. Toss the dinky tall lamp and get a more substantial one and put it next to the black large shelf thing.
I agree with the suugestions of the other commenters. You may not be in a position to change the couch, but currently I think it's way too massive and it's making the living area very difficult to walk into. The back of it is facing the stairs, instantly cutting off the flow of energy. I replace it with a smaller sofa (not a sectional) and chairs or two smaller sofas. While you're at it, make sure the rug is big enough to encapsulate the whole space and make it a medium or light tone, not black, so it doesn't contrast the floor so harshly.
Thank you!! I‚Äôm really trying my best. Decorating is just not something I‚Äôm good at.. at least decorating my own place. That idea is very interesting and I never even thought about that. I think I‚Äôll try it. I‚Äôll also space out the paintings.
Thank you so much for your help. I agree with all of your suggestions. I never liked those curtains there either, something always felt off. What do you think about having smaller curtains inside of the bay window and removing the blinds? Curtains the color of the couch? I‚Äôm going for a dark academia.
üôÉ the couch is brand new‚Ä¶ it is one I can pull apart. As in I can take out some of the sections. What if I removed one or pushed the couch closer to the tv? Rug is also brand new..
Definitely don't go smaller with the curtains, go bigger. The existing rod is good, just get curtains that go all the way to the floor and that have a rod pocket or back tab (no grommets!). If you remove the blinds, make sure you get curtains that will suit your light needs. If you need it dark, get blackout curtains AND sheer curtains so you can choose between filtered light and no light.
Nah on the small curtains. You want a view and the lighting. I‚Äôd go with something heavier with a larger rod. Something that you can open for light if you choose.
Does it split into two straight sections or does it just become a smaller sectional? If it splits maybe try one segment on either side of the tv facing each other. If not, definitely try removing some sections. Overall the space just feels closed off and difficult to penetrate. If you're walking towards it from an adjacent room, the path to a seat should be more or less direct. Right now if I were wanting to sit on the couch after walking downstairs I'd be tempted to just flop over the back of the couch rather than walk around lmao.

As for the rug, I think you can make it work if you follow the other commenter's advice about simplifying the space and decluttering. Stick to the color pallette the rug and couch are establishing as much as possible. Resist the urge to cover imperfections with clutter or random decor, as a sparse but thoughtful room looks better than a full, thrown-togerher room."

What kind of cats do you have? And did you get them specifically to go with your house? üòÜ
Your color palette is lovely. You have such warm, cozy style with an eye for curated items that make this feel like a real home.
You have a wonderful touch and have created a warm, inviting, and relaxing home.
What an accomplishment to make a somewhat outdated kitchen look so cozy and elegant, that tile is gorgeous and I love the border detail!
You have great taste. I especially love the curved floor lamps.
where is your coffee table from?? your home is gorgeous!
I love everything about this place ü•∞
The bathroom in pic 18 is perfect.
Well done. Earthy, modern, elegant, cozy, cohesive and clean. I want to make my own post not hijack yours- any tips for industrial slant but still elevated dining chairs?
This is gorgeous
The cats add to the ambience
Love it!! Where is that beautiful floor lamp in picture 5 from?!
Chefs kiss. I took my time with each photo and scanned it and thoroughly appreciated every little detail because you really made a masterpiece. 

Where is the white shelving from in the livingroom picture?
Nice effort, lovely, big on knickknacks.
Absolutely beautiful! I love everything!  I would like to know about the wall hanging above the bed.  It's so serene!
Nicely done, everything is beautiful! I particularly love the lamp with the twirly skirt! It just seems happy to me :)
Anyone who likes Cezanne has good taste üòÅ. It is lovely.
Your cats are gorgeous, thank you for including them in this lol
Saved this for future inspiration in my own home. Love it!

This is an absolute dream! Would you be willing to share where your curtains are from?
Wow, this looks like something from a magazine or Pinterest. Lucky you and well done!

Wow! Can I ask where the black leather couch is from?
Come do my home next üòÇ it‚Äôs beautiful
I love the blend of modern and cottage. Really lovely
It‚Äôs so harmonious and beautiful! You have a great eye. In 12 & 13 it looks like you‚Äôve mixed different wood types very successfully. Is it white oak for the cabinet, bookcase, and table, and walnut for the chairs?
Absolutely stunning. Beautiful, comfortable, cozy, curated. I love that it took 8 years. It really looks like a home and not a showroom.
I wish I knew how to put a room together like you
Love it. Perfect balance of stuff vs stark. Colors are soothing and beautiful.
I adore that mirror!!
Also where is your favorite place to shop for light fixtures and furniture as I love them all!
Beautiful!

This is a gorgeous space. Well done!
Gorgeous!!!!!!
This is great!! It's nice to know and accept that it does take time.
Beautiful! You have a great eye. Love every little bit. 
In picture 10/20, what's the drape hanging behind the bed? Where did you buy it from? It gives a very cozy and soft look to the bedroom.
You have a beautiful, warm and cozy house! It should be in a magazine. And your cats are the best decorations. Great job!

Gosh this is absolutely lovely! So soft and warm. Where did you get your bedding? I love the blanket/quilt!
Legit went back a few times to admire all of the pics! May I ask where the standing mirror is from?

Great lamps and light fixtures ! Where did you find them ?
Absolutely beautiful! Would you mind sharing the wall-mounted bookshelf?
Wow, the decor is very cozy, warm, and cohesive. You have great taste. I also want to thank you for including how long it takes to decorate a home.¬†
I spy morrow soft goods!! I have been thinking about buying that striped bedspread for AGES I love it sm. How do you like it?
Your color palette is gorgeous. It flows so well room to room. Look at those adorable kitties! Great job making your place a cozy and beautiful home.
It is beautiful, stunning really!
So warm, I also wish my house had a corner like that
Time to schedule a call with AD, this is gorgeous!!!
Kudos to you for slowly evolving the space over an extended period of time. You can see the intentionality and cohesion behind your choices over the years. This is such a beautiful place to call home!

Where did you get your sheepskin rugs in picture 1? Thanks in advance for sharing your space, and also the sources of your selections with us!
beautiful!
Wow I lovvvvve this üòç Such an incredible mix of warmth, soul, and design. Where are the terrazzo side/end tables from? Also I love that little globe lamp on the CB2 shelves!! Where is it from? I have those same shelves in black, have been looking for a little lamp just like that!
Absolutely gorgeous!
Outstanding
So cozy and serene. We bought our house 2 years ago and it doesn‚Äôt even feel close to being ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs comforting to see that it takes time and that‚Äôs just what we are doing. There‚Äôs no rush to make it all prefect and I know one day it will come together. 

Thanks for sharing your beautiful home üíõ
what a beautiful home, it definitely looks like something out of a magazine! üíõ
Absolutely gorgeous
This is so my style. Love it! Wonderful job!!!
Your place looks wonderful! I love the sofa. Where is it from? I want one like that.
I am stealing your idea of using a textile wall hanging behind the bed.  I don‚Äôt have a nice headboard and the wall above my bed is empty and makes the room look unfinished
I love it
Beautiful
This looks straight out of a magazine. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs rude, but I very much so mean it as a compliment. 

I really like that tapestry you have behind your bed. I think I might look for something like that. Currently my bedroom has too many bookshelves and the dresser is blocking the window so I was thinking today about what I could do to make it all look better. Maybe that‚Äôll give me some ideas for later. Thanks! :)
Totally obsessed
It‚Äôs perfect! This is what I want!
Goals
And a matching cat...perfect!
Beautiful! Where is your media console under the frame tv from?
Cute little ottoman ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This is so good omg
Wow. Goals for sure! I love it so much.
Beautiful! I love your lighting choices.
Beautiful home!!! It feels so warm and comfortable
Looks like something you would see in a magazine
This is absolutely beautiful OP! Well done! üñ§
Just beautiful! Where did you find the chair in 5?
This looks so amazing.

Serious question for everyone!

Where do you all keep your everyday stuff?!?! In cabinets?

Do I just have too much stuff?!
Love it. Random question - where did you get the doorknobs with the crystal/glass knobs?
What‚Äôs your technique for line washing your walls in doing it to an accent wall in my house soon, everything looks amazing!!
Perfect dream home¬†
Such a warm space, absolutely lovely. Question, are those Selkirk Rex cats?
I spent my time zooming into the images. Lovely home! 

The mirror form picture 19!! I love it seems like an old one
Beautiful
Lovely, so very lovely‚Ä¶..really nice vision and work.  Source/brand for that gorgeous floor lamp in pic 5, and presuming that‚Äôs an authentic Eames chair to soak up reading light from said lamp?
Such a beautiful home!   It‚Äôs so calming, warm and inviting.  I love it!   Wishing you many years filled with happiness in your lovely home.
Absolutely stunning. Where is the lamp in picture 2 from? I have fallen in love with it
I love your style.  Beautiful home.
Magnificent!!!! The whole home is gorgeous!
Love it ü´∂üëç
Fuck yeah!!!!
gorgeous! your home is like a warm hug to me‚ù§Ô∏è
Absolutely perfect üëå
That's a long time, but it looks very nice and it looks very cozy!
So cozy, I spot a west elm planter üòç
Love the liquor cabinet! Can you share where that is from? Thanks!
I loved this so much! Just woww.
We have the same faucet on our kitchen sink in Nickel.     
We had our Kitchen renovated in 2019, and I have zero complaints with everything (except for the paint on the cabinets) that faucet has been a hoss.
Love love love it! Whole place 10/10
Was limewash hard to use? I really want to try it
Amazing! Where is that indoor planter from? Ive been looking for something like that!
So beautiful and serene. Great job!
wow you did an amazing job with with this. if i walked into this place it would truly feel like home to me. all the colors and little details really work so well.

where are your bed side tables from??
I need to know what‚Äôs hanging behind your bed! Lovely home, great job!! :))
I just saved this post, and took some screenshots for inspo aaand I might just copy everything for my place ü´£ for real, this looks like one of those beautiful apartment therapy apartments that I envy! Wonderful job üòç
I‚Äôm adding this to my Pinterest board üòç
It looks absolutely beautiful. You can tell that every detail was carefully thought out and that you dedicated a lot of time and effort to make it feel like a true home. The wait was worth it; it turned out amazing!
Loving the vibe!!
We‚Äôd be friends IRL. I love your attention to detail, your appreciation for brown tones and the importance you‚Äôve placed on making a house feel more like a home.

Worth the time you‚Äôve put into this. I hope you have many wonderful memories ahead in your space. Cheers to you!!
Your home is gorgeous!! You did a phenomenal job and it is so cozy. If I lived there I wouldn‚Äôt want to leave the house. üòÜ
Nice job!
I love this! Where is the tapestry above the bed from?
Do you have a link for those beige curtains? They are just perfect!!
Everything is muah! Perfect! ü§©

Where is the wallpaper from? Love everything about your space!
Slow and thoughtful beats the quick fix every time! Congrats!
Absolutely stunning! Both the home and the cats ;) with your phenomenal style, do you have the litter boxes hidden in a basement or do you have stylish litter box furniture?? 
I am always looking for sturdy but beautiful furniture to hide litter boxes for two picky cats in a condo!
Is that a record player on the bookshelf? Sears Silvertone? What model is it. Your house is beautiful
Super cozy and absolutely perfect. ü§ç
Your home is beautiful! May I know what kind of plant that is in the living room?

Absolutely lovely ü•∞
I like the way you play with shapes :)
Beautiful home. Love the kitties.
This is amazing OP. You have really captured the peace and liveliness of your space in these photos. Could you please share which camera did you use here?

I love the warmth tone of your house. It feels calm, relaxing and welcoming. Everything goes so well together ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Wow!! Looks amazing!! Good job üëè
Your home is s-t-u-n-n-i-n-g.....but I couldn't let your photography skills go unnoticed! These pictures are so crisp and colorful - are you a professional photographer? If not, please tell me I too can capture such beauty using a humble iphone üòÇ
This is lovely! You can really tell that each item was picked with care. I love this style so you‚Äôre definitely giving me decor inspo!
Can you send me the stripped duvet cover or blanket thing?
LOVE LOVE LOVE

This is what I am trying to do in my 1920s home. I love your warm color palette, and the mixture of vintage pieces and mid century modern furniture.
For me, the lounge and the bedroom are gorgeous
Needs a cat.
Needs a cat.
Yes, they have a cat!!! 
Purrrfection
Absolutely Charming
Beautiful!
üòç Is it the crystal doorknobs throwing rainbows in pic 9? You are both an excellent designer and photographer!
I must ask‚Äî how do you like your morrow blanket?? We have very different styles, but I have the same one on preorder and have been so excited for it to get here. Love how you applied it here!
It looks super cozy!
Lovely and warm and safe.
Where is the bed frame and nightstands from?
Looks very cozy
Those wooden cabinets on your kitchen are absolutely fantastic OP!

I love your cats ü•∞
This is gorgeous ü§óü§ç and I love that your kitties match the vibe so perfectly üòÜ
It‚Äôs beautiful and it needs like six to eight more disgruntled cats that just awoke from naps. Then you‚Äôll be done.
Ps-is the tv hidden behind that painting and if so, do you take it off every time you watch tv? I‚Äôm wondering about ways to disguise a tv and so far I‚Äôm torn between art or mirror.
It looks so comfy and you did an amazing job
Love it. I need to know about those fabulous lamps!!
Sooooo pretty. Calming yet stylish. Neutral but perfect pops of color. Doesn‚Äôt look like every other influencer‚Äôs place
Wow, you did an amazing job - it‚Äôs all so cohesive (but not boring) and cozy.¬†

Can you share more about the textile above the bed? I‚Äôve been looking for something to go above ours for a long time, but don‚Äôt want a heavily patterned or overly ‚Äúboho‚Äù piece.¬†

Well done!¬†
I love it.
Good job I love the dining room
Love all the things,thanks to post the pics.They gave me the inspiration to decorate my home!‚ù§Ô∏è
Where is the coffee table and floor lamp from?!
I adore this. It exactly my style dream. I love that big mirror. So original !!

Can I ask where you got those cute little pillows that look like cookies ?
DROOL - this looks incredible! And also glad to know I'm not alone being 4 years in and far from done.. hahah
This is absolutely beautiful! You did a great job and it looks great and so homey üíïüíïüíï
I‚Äôm so jealous of your ability! I‚Äôve lived in my house for over 10 years and everything is still so weird and mismatched. I know what I like but I can‚Äôt put things together. You‚Äôre really talented. I love every room!
WOW
Lovely done! Beautiful home!
I thought this was an ad. It‚Äôs literally perfect. Your bathroom is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even have words I just love it
Cozy and warm, Such a lovely design.
Gorgeous!
very lovely
What‚Äôs on the wall over the blue couch? Asking because i have a big long wall where our couch is lol. Love your style! It‚Äôs beautiful
How do you keep the dust away from the books?
Your poor birds of paradise needs a much, much larger pot. Otherwise gorgeous !
Do you mind sharing that paint color?
Dying to know where you got that wooden floor mirror!!!
I love everything about this *but* those extra long curtains. Please have them hemmed up (showing my age)
The way they bunch up makes me irrationally annoyed.
The fridge placement triggers my fear of mold. No air circulation.. what does the wall behind it look like?
Love the space and I'm sure  your partner does too üòä 
Also thank you for the reminder that it takes time to make a space feel like a home lol my husband and I have been in our house for two years and we're just now getting artwork that is not just photos from our wedding
Is that a Marushka hanging over your headboard???
Where is the floor lamp from? pic 5
üí∞
Where did you get your bookshelves? They are  lovely!
That lamp in pic 2!!!! Sooooo cute I need details
LOVE EVERYTHING! Where did you get the bedding from? Pillows are so cute!
Complete for now lol
Once that gold shower is gone, it will be complete.üòÇ but jokes aside, really beautiful design!
I‚Äôd love to know more about your photography setup.
Do you own or rent? It looks really good and I LOVE that kitchen table. Do you happen to know where you got it from because I have a smaller place so I need a smaller dining room table, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find a good one.
Where did you get that stunning lamp in the 5th photo? It‚Äôs gorgeous.
Where did you get that table lamp in the second picture? It‚Äôs gorgeous ü§çü§çü§ç
Soo pretty
I ‚ù§Ô∏è the wooden louvered doors - where‚Äôd you get those?
These photos look like AI
Looks like ai
This sub really hates color
The place finally feels like you. So none of your partner in this place now?
Some walls, seem bare
i want to bang my wife on the carpet hahahahaha
Where's the stuff that makes you YOU? No photos? No stuff from travelling? No quirky, curated art? No collections or any nod to special interests? 

I mean, it looks clean and magazine-y, but it seems so sad and soulless living like this. Like an empty mall.
Ha! I think they subconsciously influenced my interior design choices, or maybe I picked them to go with my decor... who's to say! They are Devon Rexes :)
I reminded myself of Lizzie going ‚Äúcows!‚Äù when I saw the cats and went like ‚Äúcats!‚Äù

Thank you so much! You don't know how much that means ‚ù§Ô∏è
AND THE CATS MATCH THE PALETTE!! üòª
Thank you so much!
Thank you! It was my first time tiling a vertical surface and I had no idea what I was doing but with the help of a contractor on youtube and some redo's, and I am happy with the result! The border detail was actually the result of a total fuck up on my part of not measuring the new counter backsplash height correctly and having a gap, but I kinda like how it came out with it haha
Thanks! It is from [Hedgehouse Furniture](https://hedgehousefurniture.com/), as is most of the wood furniture here :)
I was scrolling to see if someone would ask! That table is   beautiful üòç love the rounded legs
Thank you! I hated it for a long time, but once I really leaned into the weird 70's swan vibes I really love it now. It's very unique and just needed a little love!
It's a Caprani lamp reproduction! They sell them at Design Within Reach and Gubi
And what plant ü™¥ is that in the living room also?
Thank you so much, that means a lot! 

It's from cb2!
Thanks! It's from [Blacksaw](https://blacksaw.co/)
Hehe thank you, I love her too :)
How could I not?! Plus the one looking at the camera is always photo bombing anyway hehe
The paint color in the living/dining area is Benjamin Moore 'Edgecomb Gray' and the paint color in the room with the mirror is a lime wash paint from Color Atelier called 'wabi'.
It's 'Edgecomb Gray' from Benjamin Moore historic collection :)
I love the paint colour (Edgecombe Gray), it is highlighting the beautiful timber tones you have. I have searched for ages for a colour that does this. I will be using this paint colour. thank you.
two! üòª
Sure! They are the worn velvet curtains from west elm
It's from Crate & Barrel
It's a real lime wash! Painted with a block brush
The couch is from Design Within Reach, designed by Egg Collective. I recall it's called the Emmy Sofa I think. Full disclosure, this sofa is upwards of $10k but I got it at an outlet store for less than half of that üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Exactly what I was going for :) thank you!
Yep! You're exactly right. I was so nervous about doing it as so many people say it's 'rule' you can't mix woods but I thought it would look better than all oak. I think it turned out nicely!
Thank you kind stranger! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you!! I worked hard to make it feel warm and cozy and to know that comes across is so rewarding.
Ha ha! I am always waiting for someone to ask if we are alcoholics ü§£ My boyfriend is obsessed with Mixology and has bought and ungodly amount of bottles over the years to tinker with. I swear we only have a few drinks a week, but yes, our liquor cabinet is quite excessive!

Thank you so much! It's from Blacksaw
The lamps are from Tala and Notary Ceramics :)
I especially like the trim on the doors
Yes, I am! Thank you :)
They are just sheepskins! They're super cozy. You can get them at lots of places but these specifically are from Overland
I got most of my bedding from Morrow Soft Goods :)
Thank you!! I saw it randomly one day while out window shopping as part of a retail store's small vintage collection. It was pretty expensive so I walked away but thought about it nonstop for 3 days and decided to just get it. I called the store back and they still had it! It's a Thonet mirror from the 1800s and very hard to find apparently so I feel lucky to have it ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks! That is a film photo my boyfriend took I had professionally printed in a darkroom awhile back :)
The white shelves are from CB2 and the wall shelves are elfa track systems with DIY stained lumber from home depot :)
I spend a lot of days not leaving the house! haha
All the rugs are from [Beni](https://www.benirugs.com/) :)
Get it! I love it, it's the perfect lightweight cover for summer. I LOVE everything from Morrow :)
Thank you! That is a big goal of mine in decorating so I'm so happy that it comes across :)

Thank you!! The terrazzo table is from a designer called Pieces Home and the lamp is from Tala!
It's the Emmy Sofa from Design Within Reach. Full price in this leather is close to $10k üò± but I got it at an outlet store for less than half of that. That said, it's an amazing couch!!
do it! It's such a great way to anchor the bed
Not rude at all! Thank you so much
It's a herman miller eames chair :)
It pretty much looks like this most of the time with some laptops, books, mugs, etc scattered about. I hate seeing clutter so I have everything put away in a cabinet !
I got it at a local vintage shop
Devon Rexes :)
It is! It's a vintage thonet mirror from the late 1800s :)
Yep! It's an Eames :) The floor mirror is a Caprani lamp reproduction that they sell at Design Within Reach and Gubi

It's from [Notary Ceramics](https://www.notaryceramics.com/collections/lighting-collections) :) She does mostly one-of-a-kind designs but there are some similar ones that pop up on her site from time to time!

My two favorite rooms as well !
No actually i have a little solar powered rainbow maker in the window :)
I love everything from morrow! Are you referring to the stripes or the floral? They are both from there :) I love both but would say the floral is a little more high-end and thick and the stripes is more of a super lightweight summer coverlet.

Yeah, the AC and window look off in picture 13 so I assume AI too.
AI wishes it looked like this
Why hate neutrals?
Who said that? He took a lot of the photos we had printed as wall art, almost all the books are his, and I always get his input first when I buy a big furniture piece or rug. He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòcare‚Äô as much as me when it comes to interior design but there‚Äôs plenty of him reflected here as well. You really are assuming a lot of things with that comment
Not sure what you mean. There‚Äôs plenty of books, textiles, painted pottery, particular silhouettes, little sculptures, wall art and wallpaper which are very personal choices‚Ä¶ just because it isn‚Äôt overt and they aren‚Äôt everywhere doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt there. Different folks have a different tolerance for what they enjoy in their personal space. For some keeping things more minimal feels more peaceful, and they opt for character to be found in details instead of things. It‚Äôs not better or worse. I say this as someone who does have tons of art and strong evidence of hobbies and active iterations of them throughout my home. Everyone is different. It‚Äôs a personal preference with a different kind of soul, not an absence of one.
Curly hair love them
They are beautiful and your home is too!!
Does your living room rug stay white? I‚Äôm looking at the same kind but scared of a cat puke situation ruining it!
Ha, I specifically came by to say lovely job on accessorising with the matching rexes! Perfect addition of warmth and texture ü•∞
I love this gif of her! She was so excited to see cows.
I love it all so much! It's what I would love to have my place look like, but my place has two little boys with sticky hands, that crash toy cars into everything, and somehow age every piece of furniture by a decade each year. ü´£ Love your style and hope to have something this beautiful in like 18 years! üòÖ

How is the quality and their customer service? Everything looks so lovely but they have no returns/refunds and they outsource/can‚Äôt schedule delivery

You did an incredible job. Everything looks wonderful but I am obsessed with this bathroom.

Ficus Aubrey, I think
Thank you!

Do you have a frame tv? Or is that a print?

Your taste is so cohesive and thoughtful!
Thank you!
Nice! Yes, I love it. It's been on the walls since around when I moved in, as it was one of the first things I did, and I am not sick of it. I love how it changes through the day as well, it's a very dynamic color that sometimes looks very warm and tan, and then looks like a cooler gray at times. It plays so nicely with any other colors!
Ohhh, okay. You did a phenomenal job. :) It's a wonderful touch to the rest of your place!
I think it turned out nicely, too! I‚Äôm picking out furniture right now and struggling with how to mix woods. This gives me courage!
Ah, if you were alcoholics you wouldn‚Äôt have a large collection‚Ä¶ it would be drunk already before you amassed so much.  At least that‚Äôs what I say if someone gets cheeky about mine.

So adorable!
It‚Äôs beautiful OP! Was it something you bought or had? I wonder if I can find one or get one made. 

You really have inspired me to relook at my home decor. 

Since I rent I‚Äôve never done it seriously but today I was thinking I shall replan my house layout as I plan to be here awhile. 

Does your landlord share cost for fixtures or you do it yourself? I don‚Äôt live in USA I‚Äôm on the other side of the planet, I‚Äôm just curious how it works there.
Thank you, and not sure I‚Äôm leaving that chair/spot for a while as I plow through Chernow‚Äôs biography of Twain, with a cup of Green team of courseüëåüèº.   Found that lamp, on the list now.
Thank you!
Sadly it was a rental for a while so everything has been painted. You know‚Ä¶ door knobs, hinges, cabinets, windows, air vents, the exposed brick fireplace‚Ä¶ *facepalm* Well, everything except the original floors in the living room and dining room. So at least there‚Äôs that!

My goal is to reintroduce some character like you have done! Thanks for providing tons of inspiration ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Love those! I have one somewhere that had to be packed away because it gave one of my former cats a complex, poor baby happily chased rainbows for hours but then just sat in the living room screaming when it was cloudy
The stripes!! I appreciate the note‚Äî i‚Äôm in southern california where something a little more lightweight is usually the goal. It looks gorgeous in your photos‚Äî it makes me so excited for it to arrive!
u/lindsey_what‚Ä¶whaaaaa now I‚Äôve heard everything! JK, we‚Äôve been looking at those for a while, just waiting for prices to come down though that‚Äôs likely what we‚Äôll end up getting. We have a 100 year old home so we‚Äôre putting in a period appropriate fireplace surround and it has the original mirror on it, I think I can‚Äôt do another mirror to the side of that but I can do a tv masquerading as art! We still have to refinish ‚Äòer so she‚Äôs a bit rough, and I love her so much!

It's like bread with no fixins
I was basing the question on the ‚Äúit finally feels like  ‚Äòme‚Äô‚Äù comment. 

Relax.
Thank you! Also confused by this persons comment. I totally agree that clutter does not always equal character. I think you can definitely get a sense for our hobbies from all of our books, cookbooks, framed photography we took, wallpaper, etc. There‚Äôs also quite a few things I have around from traveling like pottery, shells, etc!
Haha yes it's been good so far! My cats puke a ton (they both have IBD, gastritis issues) so it's been puked on dozens of times. I get a rag and a bowl of warm water with wool shampoo and every stain has come out no problem thankfully. I love the rug overall!
Yes!
I can't say enough positive things about them, honestly! It's family-run so they are super customer oriented and respond to emails quickly. I have done a lot of custom orders with them that involved a lot of back and forth on design ideas and measurements and it was all seamless. They provide drawings for custom orders and all that too. It's all handmade to order so you have to wait 4-8 weeks, sometimes longer, but I think its worth it. The delivery team they have used in my area is actually great and takes great care with the items and assembly. I have 13+ items from them around my house and I've had zero issues! The wood in person is so gorgeous and clearly leagues above even ""luxury"" big box furniture quality. I can never go back!
yes it is :)
Yes! It's actually just a whole medicine cabinet piece set into the wall - came with that victorian style frame and everything haha
Thank you so much!! We have the frame TV indeed. Admittedly I never have it in art mode except for in this photo but I love how sleek it is and how close it sits on the wall.
What is the other paint color? It looks like your ceilings and maybe even some walls are a contrasting lighter color?¬†
Thanks so much! It's a lot of work but I love the texture it adds
Very true!
Yes my boyfriend is a huge tiki guy haha. Good eye!
They are from [Hedgehouse](https://hedgehousefurniture.com/)
Thanks! I got it at a retail store as part of their small vintage collection and they only had one. I did some research to make sure there was a good price before I purchased it and it didn‚Äôt seem like there was a ton for sale but they do pop up occasionally! It‚Äôs called a Thonet Bentwood mirror. 

As far as my landlord goes, I do not ask them to share costs with me unless it‚Äôs something super permanent like the kitchen countertop which they did pay for. Everything else has been my own investment, which I feel is fair because they give us a great deal on rent and they let me Kind of do what I want with the place. We have been and plan to be here for a long time so I do not mind investing my own money into making it exactly what I want.
Ouch, that hurts my soul ü•≤ at least it sounds like there‚Äôs still something left for you to work with - original floors are sooo cool! And it‚Äôs surprising how much character you can add back. I would describe this place as builder grade when I moved in and just adding molding, ceiling medallions, glass door knobs, wainscoting, and antique looking light fixtures has really gone a long way.
That‚Äôs so cute omggggg but I can see how your kitty‚Äôs mental health should take precedent haha! Have you ever tried the static ones that throw rainbows but don‚Äôt move? I also love using disco balls that are stationary in the window for this purpose ü™©
Thats SO cool, it's my literal dream to buy a 100+ year old home and restore all the original details. I love that you are bringing it back to its original glory!
I didn't even edit these. It's sad to me that we live in a world now that anything beautiful or nicely photographed with intention is labeled as AI. Enjoy your pessimism! :)
yeah, I‚Äôve noticed a trend in advice and feedback on most interior/home decorating subreddits where a lot of people aren‚Äôt quite at a point yet where they know how to remove themselves and their personal design sense from a space to assess it for what it is or in regards to someone else. I‚Äôve noticed it a lot even with simple things like color palettes, let alone with more prominent physical items like furniture, art, and trinkets haha. I can only guess that maybe that‚Äôs part of what happened here. 

I was wondering if the photography was your own, also! I really liked the one with the bee. I thought it was super charming while also adding some nice modern contrast to the space!
Awesome, thank you for the tip! Mine has the same thing ü•≤
It's so cool!
Thank you for taking the time to reply. I‚Äôll look this up, and see if something like this is even possible to get. 

It‚Äôs nice to have decent landlords, mine is very nice too, 2 years in so far and it‚Äôs an old building, bit rusty on edges. 

After seeing your home and how you invest in interiors makes me want to get new curtain rods, and come to think of it, some things in the bathroom done permanently. And coz of you not I don‚Äôt mind investing in these as I do plan to live here for a long while and it doesn‚Äôt cost me much to get there and fix them myself - I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been living the way I have!! I work from home so all my things are scattered everywhere.

Here she is, I primed the railings but still have to re-paint them for the classic black wrought iron. We had her painted, installed a new roof, added the brackets and put in a french drain in the back, fenced the yard, added a second petite patio. I‚Äôll be paying it off for years to come and we love our little gold nugget, aka The Beverly Bungalow.
Ok, cool, maybe your software did some smoothing you are not aware off :p the apartment is nice, pictures too but they are unnaturaly smooth, same as ai surfaces that's why people react like it, that's all. Enjoy your beautiful apartment.
Totally! While I lean more minimalist obviously I can truly appreciate maximalist design if it's done well. I see spaces with dark green walls, gallery picture frames, tons of books, patterns etc. and while I know I wouldn't do that to my own home, I absolutely love it! Good design is good design no matter what the theme is. 

The photography that's framed is my boyfriend's film photos that I had professionally printed in a darkroom awhile back. Thanks for appreciating it, I will tell him it's being admired :)
Oh nooo I'm sorry, it sucks :( I manage it the best I can but barfing is still a weekly occurrence by one or both of them and they always aim perfectly for the rugs lol
Yeah, it's such a shame in my opinion that people think you can only customize or invest in your home if you own. Yes, there is always a ""risk"" that you get kicked out and you wasted your money but people also sell their homes and move and leave those renovations behind too. I live in a city where ownership is very rare and most people rent really long term, so I always encourage people to change their rentals to suite them (within a landlord's parameters and/or can be undone if needed). It's not a ""waste"" of money if you get to enjoy it for many years!
This is SO cute I am so jealous. I always walk by houses like these and say ‚Äúone day‚Ä¶‚Äù You are living my dream!! Such a fun long term project too, and so rewarding  :)
I don't use 'software' to edit my photos - maybe you just aren't used to seeing pictures of a space not taken on an iphone !

I‚Äôve never had a tv above a fireplace/mantle before so I have no idea if it will look good? Or if it‚Äôs tacky or something

Don‚Äôt do it. The tv will be too high
Keep the TV eye level with a person sitting in a chair or sofa in the room.  The mantle is too high for it.
Don‚Äôt.
Nope
No
r/tvtoohigh
i‚Äôd visit r/tvtoohigh before making a decision‚Ä¶
Looks so silly when people do that imo. Artwork looks so much better over a fireplace.
Put it on a smallish stand of some sort NEXT to the fireplace.
I always want a tv above a fireplace but it‚Äôs always too high for me to enjoy.
Its not ideal but how wide is the mantel? I wouldn't put anything wider above it.
Only if you get a pull down wall mount.

Yes, and don‚Äôt listen to the people who will instinctively parrot the internet meme that it will be too high. Purchase a mount ‚Äî there are many, and some are even motorized ‚Äî which will swing down for viewing at comfortable eye level.

For houses of a certain age, the mantel is often the only feasible place for a tv. It will look fine and you shouldn‚Äôt be shamed by memes into not doing it.

Edit: you *will* have to put in an outlet above the mantel or otherwise find a way of artfully hiding the power cord. Up to you if that‚Äôs worth it for your situation.
No one is allowed to put a TV over their fireplace on this sub. There's no point in even asking. **my 65"" TV is over my fireplace and I love it there. I can see it from the kitchen. Reddit be dammed.
Everyone‚Äôs going to tell you not to, because Reddit has a hate boner for TVs above fireplaces. If you have no other feasible spot, and the 55‚Äù isn‚Äôt wider than the hearth, I think it‚Äôs just fine
Ahh yes I see that now. I‚Äôm having the worst time figuring out placement in the living room
Is that a joke sub because it seems too ridiculous for it to be real
Yea is that a real sub? It seems like a bunch of people making fun of people who think tvs are too high. I saw one post that the tv was probably like elbow high and they were all like ‚Äòneed to come down‚Äô. Like I have a big dog where some people want the tv it would get assaulted by my dogs tail üòÖ
It‚Äôs probably about 65‚Äù wide. I don‚Äôt know how to organize the living room and finding a place for the tv is the biggest issue

How dare you have a different opinion on Reddit and not just bandwagon with everyone else?
Post more pics of the room/furniture and we may be help you.
It‚Äôs not a joke sub. You‚Äôre supposed to place a TV at eye level when sitting and viewing. The sub just calls out those people who ignore that rule and who don‚Äôt mind cricking their necks to view TVs mounted in the stratosphere.
I think it would work then. I don't worry about high tvs anymore because we all have tech neck now and need to look up to balance it out lol
Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt. I just recently learned they existed.
But how do you decide who‚Äôs eyeline or what seating option it aligns to
Most base it on eye level when sitting on your sofa. It doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect - most people are generally sitting at nearly the same eye level when sitting on a sofa. You shouldn‚Äôt have to look up or tilt your head up to look at the TV.
The seating that's in the space your TV is in, of course. What else?
Yea but we have different seating, and different height people"

I'm looking at new light fixtures and keep running into just really disliking the new fixtures I'm finding, so I started looking at vintage art deco fixtures. Am I insane to consider getting 3 different art deco lights and placing them in a row, down to the beam you see at the end of the kitchen? I'm looking flush mount glass fixtures.

Alternatively, is there a (relatively affordable) new option that gives that lovely warm and cozy vintage feel, but that would allow me to have matching fixtures?

How about something like this?

I‚Äôd like some advice on what else I can do to make the gate and entrance area more appealing. For example:
	‚Ä¢	What wall color would go well with a grey gate?

Yea, I like the idea of staining the concrete. You could add some up/down sconces for lighting on the walls, or maybe a nice outdoor hanging light. The grey you chose is cool. And it doesn‚Äôt always work with warm colors. To choose other colors carefully. Personally, I would have chosen a black, or warmer gray. It would have given you more options. You could pull in the ceiling more by doing a black stain. That would look dramatic and lovely. Good job on the pain. It looks smooth and professionally done!
Are you open to changing from the gray? It is cool-toned and clashes with the warm wood and concrete.
What do you mean by doing a black stain?
yes
On the wood. You could also just paint it black or very dark grey.
What about the sides
Just power wash the brick. It‚Äôs a nice color and it looks cool and rustic as it is :)
but there a lot of stains from previous work done on the house
Power washing should take care of all that. If you wanted to paint it, stick with neutrals."

Since every thing in this space is rectangular, I think an interesting round mirror would offer some relief.
First impression: It is hung too low. Second impression: It is too busy with the lattice overlay. Third impression: There are a lot of rectangles going on in that small space.
I don‚Äôt think it looks bad, it just looks too busy for the space with all the lattice over the mirror. A simple mirror would work best. A darker frame would tie in with the light fixture and front door. Or maybe pull a color from the rug for the frame.
I like a round mirror but some nice coat/bag hooks instead of a shelf.
I don‚Äôt think it looks bad as-is. I personally think slim shelves are just a way to add more clutter and things to dust. But then again I‚Äôm more about functionality in a living space than others.
You need a longer oval mirror with a frame in a wood tone similar to the door. There won't need to be anything underneath it because it is close to full body.
The mirror is too low. You should absolutely switch it out with something curvy.
It has a few too m as my lines in room I think.  A round or oval would likely help it not feel so square filled.  Cheers!
The problem is the placement. The mirror top should be level with the top of the door trim. Add a shelf or table under it. Then it will feel more like the pics.
I think the mirror needs to be longer if you're going with something like the first pic. The round mirrors with shelves are okay, too.
Would a shelf interfere with opening the door all the way?  What you have there now doesn‚Äôt look bad but I‚Äôm wondering if a darker color that contrasts more with the wall would be an improvement.
It's a nice mirror, but probably lost in the doorway. You might try hanging it on a larger wall, maybe even horizontal rather than vertical. I'd go round, more simple. üå∫
As everyone has said, the mirror is too busy. The mirror and shelf in picture3 is nice, but I don‚Äôt think it would be conducive to the area. Even though you can easily open the door, there‚Äôs always someone who would knock into it. I would hang just a mirror, either round or oval.
Slim oval, no shelf, or a painting rather than a mirror.
Personally I think it looks perfect
To me, the style and color clashes with the rest of the foyer.   Get one that has a dark (like the door) wood frame and traditional design.
Wow I love this! To me, the mirror cleverly repeats the door to the outside and the white inside door. Like when in a poem, a few words in a row start with the same letter; that is considered high art in poetry. I am a poet and an artist so I can‚Äôt help but see that mirror as being both poetic and artistic‚Ä¶I am clearly in the minority on this as I see the other replies, but I also informally design interiors for people. I would most definitely leave that mirror right there. I really love how the whole room rhymes: tiles, door, door decor, rug, window,and light fixture! Even the shape of the space itself. I‚Äôd be proud if I‚Äôd thought of that whole idea.

A little wonky  you get the idea. Kind of repeats  the lines of the light fixture.

Round
I like #1
How about the round mirror above a slim console table, a place to throw your keys.
How about a free floating oval mirror nothing under it nothing on top of it
It‚Äôs a bit busy but I like it personally.
What you have up looks lovely
I think it looks great.  I'm left the round mirror trend
Is it ok to hang round mirror by itself without anything on bottom due to space or would it look odd
I agree
Functionality is why I prefer the slim shelf with hooks underneath.  Great place for visitors to hang purses and jackets.  If this door is used by kids, also a great place for keys.
I have about 3.5 inches for shelf when front door is all the way open so something slim will work.
A round mirror alone would look odd by itself but maybe you can do a long oval mirror."

I‚Äôm partial to the green but the orange is nice too, and plants give you the green
I love the green! The plants are important here and green chairs gives it a more cohesive look. The orange would be my second pick, it's more earthy with the plants.
I have to ask, have you sat in these chairs? I made the mistake of buying one of these from a picture and it‚Äôs beyond uncomfortable. The cushion is too firm and the back is too low. No one ever sits there. I regret buying it. Of course yours could be made different,y but just wanted to give a little warning based on my experience.
Do you have any other accent colors in the dining room or anything? I feel like the orange looks best with the shades you have and blinds but they all work and look nice
Different style preferably.
Green or orange but either will look nicer if you can support the colors with additional textile (curtain, pillow, carpet) or art and decoration. Or  tablecloths, pots in those colors can support. If you buy ottomans buy multicolor with those colors.
I don't think any of them really go with the couch.
green all the way! so cozy
different chairs
Orange. There's so much grey, it needs some warmth and little brightness.
I love the orange! But I might be a little biased, orange and grey are the colors I chose for my kitchen and I love the result. That being said, the green is beautiful too.
Green
I like green the best but I‚Äôm assuming / hoping you‚Äôre not planning to place them directly in front of the couch line that - right?
Orange, matches with your blinds and looks really well

Green as a second choice, matches with your plants
I‚Äôm not a fan of these chairs with that couch. 

I think the green is best, but the rest of the room is still so grey. So the accent colour from the chairs is not really doing that much heavy lifting
I‚Äôm always team green and orange is my least favorite color, but I like orange the most in this room.
None. They‚Äôre too saturated.  Keep looking.
The orange looks nice but those chairs look tiny‚Ä¶like child sized. Hopefully it‚Äôs just a bad AI rendering.
I don‚Äôt like any of them. Look for a patterned fabric and a more comfortable chair.
Green
I think the green one looks very nice.
None of these
None
None? They all look off, you need to seek colour otherwise
Blue
I like the orange slightly more than the green
Orange! Followed by green.
I actually love the gold. And then put green pillows on couch and chairs. Or black/charcoal pillows on the chairs with gold pillows on the couch.
Anything but that blue! Cobalt might work but not that shade for sure. Partial to green‚Ä¶
Green. Goes great with that rug!
Then I would add brass tones in the kitchen hardware
Blue is my favorite color and normally green right behind it but I don‚Äôt like any of these options and I can‚Äôt say why.
Orange. The others blend in too much.
Green. It really brings out your silver decor~
Are there other options? Maybe a lighter blue? The green and orange were very off putting to me. The navy is ok, but it blends into the grey so it‚Äôs not really an accent
Style and scale are off. If it were me, I‚Äôd keep looking for chairs that complement the scale of the couch, then start worrying about the color or pattern. I‚Äôd suggest a tweed-like or flecked pattern for chair fabric so you can pull more tones in to counter the dark of the couch.
Not orange. It clashes with the couch and rug. A cool toned couch and rug means choosing a cool toned chair set.
Of these choices I prefer the green color
Green
Green
I'd pick the camel colored ones.  The green ones with the black couch give off a dude den camouflage vibe
Green! The other two are beautiful colors though!
I prefer gold but green is ok. I like the pop of color from the gold; the color brightens and ‚Äòexcites‚Äô the room. I have similar style chairs in our midmod living room and all our guests gravitate to them!
Green but needs some other things to tie them in.
Green
Not blue. Anything but blue. The other colors are awesome! Personally I'd do green.
With that rug, I‚Äôd go blue. You already have green in the plants. The blue gives it more depth and coziness instead of an overall monochromatic theme.
I like the pop of orange
If those are the only three choices, then I would pick orange. 

Have you checked those chairs?  I bought my daughter one of these and it was barely large enough for her cat.
Green

I know everyone likes the green, but it seems like the rest of your decor is very cool toned. In my opinion, in order for it to look cohesive, you'd need to add more warm shades.

Orange.

Green or orange!
I feel like lavender or a cooler color would look better since your place seems more cool toned

The green. Easy choice:)
Of the three orange would be best.  But if I  were you I'd get chairs that look and feel more cozy.  Red would be a great color too.
I just love blue.
I love the orange but you'll want to introduce other color through textiles and decor, blankets, planters, art etc. Green is nice if you're wanting to lean more serene.

Definitely not the blue imo.
Orange brings out the warmth from the wood floor and blinds.
The Terra cotta color is nice
Orange
Perhaps a pale blue? I‚Äôm just not feeling the dark tones. Or a sage green?
I like the orange and I would get matching cushions for the sofa to tie it together. I would consider different chairs though. Tub chairs aren‚Äôt always that comfortable. Try one out before you buy anything.
Orange and then bring some green into the space with plants and throws. Replace the grey couch eventually though, it darkens the room!
I like the green or the orange!

Love the green although I agree that they look small and may not be comfortable. 

Blessings.

I would go with the blue chairs and get accent pillows, blankets, whatever in orange and/or white for some pops of light/bright something. Especially with how much grey and white you already have, I think blue would look especially lovely.
I like the orange/rust
Green! Since it predominates in nature, it almost reads as a neutral. Especially a muted greyed down green. Works with every color.
I like the green color the best
Orange!!!

What other colors do you use in this room/your house  primarily? Like is there some wall art or decor that would match the 2 chairs‚Äô color? Are you planning on some accent pillows for the couch and/or a throw blanket? I do see greenery in the kitchen so green plus green always goes together.

Orange! Picks up on the warmth of the plants and the blinds without being matchy-matchy.
Uhm none of these match very well, the gray is quite dull and overwhelming, and the chosen seats are also very dark. There‚Äôs nothing fresh here. You need to get some pillows/throw for the couch with white and other light fresh colours in them and pull out one of the colours from that in the seats
The Brown/orange matches the window shades pretty well.
I don‚Äôt like any of those colors with that particular dark gray sofa.

Orange or green, definitely not the blue
Green it's timeless.
If I had to pick a color, I'd go with the blue. The green itself is nice, but in the room it gives a weird vibe. Same with the orange. Personally, I'd explore other options.
All 3 could work. I like the blue, but the green could work too
Green
The navy looks great‚Äîadds a bold pop against the black sofa and white kitchen.
I think the orange looks best but rather than that chair style and color, would you consider cognac leather or faux leather chairs instead? I‚Äôve found that particular color and texture works really well to balance a lot of gray in a room.

[Example 1](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/JAYDEN-CREATION-Celio-30-in-Camel-Faux-Leather-Arm-Chair-with-Solid-Wooden-Legs-Set-of-2-CHWH0598-CAMEL-S2/322502395?)

The green. The blue is not going to work. I love orange but not that orange with the grey.
Green!!
Green, it goes better with the rug IMO
Yellow!! Bright and poppy, tons of leeway to bring in other primary pops of color.

Blue is too dark, not much room to build around in your bright home.

Green is limiting ‚Äì unless you're more charmed by neutral tones like bringing in more browns and beiges... But could be cute if you wanna go overboard with plants.
The green is a great start to livening up the room. Add some other pops of color and interesting moments and it will be such a gorgeous space.
I‚Äôm gonna be the odd ball. I think the orange is a nice contrast that really works with plants without throwing up green all over everything else in your house.
I like the Orange best. It adds some energy and warmth to the room.
Yes! The green makes the plants pop!
I call them purse holding chairs Lol They‚Äôre ok for a waiting room but not comfy at all.
Agree, it's just the shape. I have chairs exactly that style and they are definitely an accent for looking at, not sitting in.¬†
This so much. Unless you legitimately don't care about the comfort of your furniture for some reason, never buy without seeing, even if from a reputable retailer. The number of times I've seen something I like even from West Elm or CB2, only to see it in person and hate it because of the low quality tolerances or materials is too high to count.
I‚Äôd pop the hell out of my back on those chairs
This! I love the look of barrel back chairs, but after sitting in several, realized they‚Äôre not comfy at all.
Agree. I think the scale on the chairs is very small compared to the couch and the style is more MCM while the couch is‚Ä¶comfy uber modern man cave.
this
This! Your place is very very gray, so make sure any art you buy ties in the colors and get some real or fake plants
Yeah. These chairs look like doll furniture, especially compared to the sofa.
Yeah, unless they're planning to buy a different couch, these chairs do not pair well.¬†
Not in the front but on either side
I vote for **blue** too!
This! Either cooler or dusty shades of pinks, lavender, etc. or more warmth needs to be added to the home. None of these feel cohesive
What colors do you suggest?
But I am gonna put some bar stools there so its gonna break the color pattern
Also, the people complaining about comfort of these don‚Äôt know that there are MANY comfortable and cute barrel chairs out there. There are also really cheap ones that feel terrible.
Coat rack.
Yes, if our recent house hunt showed me anything, it's that most people just pick what they like, not taking into account the rest of their room/house. Sometimes it's ok, but there are a lot of misses lol The worst was when they picked floors that didn't match the house. Awful and expensive to replace or repaint the entire house üò¨
I would stay in the same color palette with the actual chairs, and then accentuate with a colorful pillow to make them pop

20x20 is waaay too big for most bathrooms.  Think about how many whole tiles will be visible in one of the smallest rooms in the house.  8x8 is perfect if you want a traditional look and don't want mosaics.  Be aware that terracotta is very porous though.
I like the look in photo 3.
I love 3! With terracotta I don‚Äôt think you can really go wrong with either size but the smaller format looks super cozy! I agree with the other commenter though about just getting a few samples in different sizes and see what feels better in the space.
From years of experience I give this advice: The fewer grout lines the better (within reason)‚Äîespecially in bathrooms and kitchens. Never choose small tile on floors and wet walls.
3 looks warm and inviting
I have never seen saltillo in the size in pic #3. Maybe those are European. I am only familiar with Mexican saltillo tile. I had 8"" and 12"" square in my past home. All 3 bathrooms had it. It's great. Installed it in the family room in current home.
I‚Äôve used Arto Brick Artillo Terra cotta 6‚Äù hexagon in my laundry room.  It‚Äôs beautiful and rustic.   Only thing is, it is 1/2‚Äù thick and needs big grout lines since they are handmade.  Not really ideal for bathroom because I find it hard to clean.  

The fourth picture uses Bedrosians Makato hexagon in a terra cotta color.   It is thinner porcelain and you can use thinner grout lines‚Ä¶ much more ideal for a bathroom while giving you the terra cotta look.
I'm not a fan of a lot of grout lines or wide grout lines, especially in a bathroom.

How big is your bathroom? 14*14 tiles coukd work well

Photo 3
I like the smaller tiles and have a personal preference of the hexagon. If you can just buy a few of each and see what you think works best in your space.
Yes, I was wondering this too. The tile is porcelain with a terracotta finish. I think this would be ok.
Agreed. Larger tile= less grout lines=less interrupted surface which creates more of a sense of continuous space. It makes a room feel larger and airier.
You haven‚Äôt seen that size because it‚Äôs AI
I have never heard of Saltillo tile. Thanks for sharing!
The hexagon is one of the options we're looking at. It's a bit more golden in color then the photo but thinner and made of porcelain. Probably similar to what you're referring to. Thanks for sharing!
Oh yeah a glazed faux terracotta will be much more functional.
My beef is dirty, moldy grout. It is inevitable.
I grew up in a classic Spanish-style house in California with Mexican Saltillo tile. I was not a fan. It was the right choice for the style of house, but it needed sealing, was not even (furniture wobbled), and it was cold. It has a very rustic vibe. Make sure that is the look you are going for."

Thanks!

Don't try to fake limewash. It won't look like real limewash, it'll be very obvious and strange, especially in those colors, since limewash is a natural material. If you want a mix of colors, just pour them both into a five gallon bucket and mix them up thoroughly before painting."

I think just a long straight runner would look the best
As [TotalOk5844](https://www.reddit.com/user/TotalOk5844/) mentioned small rugs are better at entry ways and possibly consider a washable rug if it gets a lot of traffic.
One long runner with entryway rugs in coordinating colors.
Find a carpet that you like and get custom made rugs. We‚Äôve done it multiple times with awkward spaces and each time has turned out perfectly.
Oh my gosh please don‚Äôt cover those floors! They‚Äôre stunning!!
Thanks. That does look good. We‚Äôd then still need something at the end towards the entry door on the right. Worth getting a similar shorter rug, or completely different?
I like the runner idea! Though perhaps something with blue in it to tie in with the painting?
Good points. That door doesn‚Äôt get a heap of use (easier to use a different entrance), but as first entry point, would get dirtier than other sections
This seems to be the consensus, now just have to attempt to coordinate some colours with my limited ability :p
For the entry I would do a small rug.  Something that compliments the runner but doesn't exactly match.  You need a small rug at entry because it's easier to pick up and shake out the dirt.  Depending on where you live, the entry takes lots of abuse.  Dirt, snow, mud gets deposited and needs cleaning or replacing more often.  You could also sub two matching rugs for the hall to break up the distance visually."

My kid wants wall paper, but they have a fish tank and bunk beds pressed to their wall and honestly hard to move.

I think the whole room would look best wall papered but I don‚Äôt think I can move those any time soon. 

Then also raises the question. Is heavy (visually) /a lot of furniture and doors etc bad for patterned wall? I was thinking large print but color to match the bedding 

If you don't want to move the pieces then wallpaper is going to be a no, it's pretty simple
You have to tell yourself you can actually do something rather than you can't do anything. If you can't do anything to help yourself, hire someone.
It‚Äôs hard to say whether or not wallpaper would look good in the room without photos. But as for the heavy furniture, it just depends on how much you want the wallpaper‚Ä¶ people hire cranes to move thousand pound pieces of furniture in through windows, whereas you likely would not have to even hire movers to move the furniture you have.

For example, if you have hardwood floors, you should be able to slip some cardboard under the legs of the bunk bed and the fish tank stand and slide them away from the walls fairly easily. And you could schedule the wallpapering session for the next time you change the water in the fish tank, so that the water won‚Äôt spill out as easily
Heck, you can't even *paint* without moving furniture
I mean I can but debating maybe one wall vs all of them. I reread that and realized I was brainstorming outloud. The biggest concern is whether patterns are obnoxious with so much furniture I guess
It‚Äôs not a matter of helping myself, the bunk bed is queen size & the fish tank is over 100 gallons both pretty rough to move. But the other concern is, with all the bulky furniture, is a patterned wall paper too overwhelming?
Do you think wallpaper looks good big or little pattern with a lot of bulky furniture though?
I can move them, if need be. I reread my statement, obviously wasnt clear. Was wondering on how people felt about wallpaper with heavy furniture
Apparently.
It depends. I‚Äôd have to see photos of the furniture and the room, as well as the wallpaper
I fail to understand what difference heavy furniture would make, when deciding whether or not to wallpaper.
Like heavy visually. Bulky, big furniture
Yes. Still doesn't matter. 

If you like wallpaper, and think the room would look better with some pattern, do it. The furniture and how bulky it is or isn't has no bearing on the matter."

Everything you picked looks like a good starting point however you need some color! Pick one and add it in a few places around the room like a nice painting, pillows and maybe a throw blanket. Then add some plants and lamps. Curtains can go on the side of the window to add warmth and help with sound insulation.

I have a pretty narrow but long living room. The right hand side contains my sofa and living room table, tv etc.

My own idea is to perhaps make this a ""cozy"" reading nook with a loveseat? Any good ideas?

The picture is not very clear about the size of your space, but it looks like your bulkier furniture items are bunched up in one corner. It might be better to spread out what is already there rather than to try to add more stuff to the space.¬†

For eg it looks like your couch is right up to the window. Why not move it away from the window and center the couch more on that wall? If you do that though, I think you should move your shelf as well so that it‚Äôs not hovering over your couch, for safety reasons too.¬†

Not sure if it‚Äôs a choice but I‚Äôd move the couch to the center of the wall, move the chair back right to the corner of the two walls (with the footstool in front of it) and replace the shelf with a lower, horizontal shelf to sit next to the chair and against the length of the white wall. You can then put things like your keyboard on top of that horizontal shelf (it‚Äôd be sitting on the shelf like it‚Äôs ready to be played rather than in a leaning configuration)

It‚Äôs hard to tell from the photo since your screen door is closed and lighting is darker. It just looks like tan florals? Maybe I‚Äôm mistaken. But, if it makes you happy, then it‚Äôs fine. You can put other non-shredding fall decor on the patio to balance it out if you want.
We can‚Äôt see it.
I thought that was a biblically accurate angel and a catfish/croc (shoe) combo behind the door.
You can buy wreath hangers that attach to the outside of a screen door.... that way the wreath is more visible and any shedding stays outside.

Modern farmhouse.
Thank you. Do you think this would fit in an Edwardian house? (UK).
Depends! How many original features are still present? How much light does each room get? 

You might have better luck with a **transitional** vibe, which allows more scope for personal touches, and is much more timeless.
Yes, I do. I think the entire house inside would have to have the modem farmhouse.
Sorry, transitional? All the original features are present (picture rails, big bay windows, taller ceilings, stained glass). It's 1930s, but I'm going to be redoing nearly everything anyways, just don't want to appropriate a style that doesn't fit. She also wants ""panelling"", which is fine, but would want to get it all right.

I just googled transitional style, and it's still not clear to me what the style is. Sounds like a blend of traditional and modern that lacks much character..is this just ""contemporary""? I suppose I'm looking for a framework to do the whole house in, so it feels more complete.
Hey! Sorry - yeah transitional is a modern/traditional hybrid. I wouldn‚Äôt say it lacks character but absolutely it‚Äôs all subjective.

It‚Äôs a style that appeals to modern sensibilities while not fighting against original features in period homes. There is plenty of scope for personalising, accommodating unique pieces, while providing a timeless framework that doesn‚Äôt fall victim to fleeting trends.

I‚Äôll provide a few reference images - Pinterest is your friend!

I love that you‚Äôre embracing color! That said, you have two busy patterns here. Yes, that busy backsplash tile as well as the busy countertop is busy, busy, busy. Busy! Busy granite has long since had its day.¬†

In addition to the busy aspect‚Äîwhich is already A LOT!‚Äîthey also have different undertones which will just make them clash further. What is your flooring going to be? Do you have another pattern on the floors?¬†

Again, tres cool you‚Äôre embracing colour, but those two patterns will boss around the whole kitchen! What won‚Äôt be so bossy is maybe a quartz with a very subtle veining, almost marble-like. It would be timeless.¬†

Save your creativity for styling and the things you can easily change up when you‚Äôre over them, not things that are expensive to rip out like tile and countertops!¬†
Do you have enough granite for the backsplash? Keep it simple. The granite, paint and trim flow nicely, love the granite! The tile reads too busy as another texture and color, it takes away from the granite and all of the glory from the stone.
That backsplash tile is really busy (and too warm toned) with that granite. It will also be a huge hassle to clean with all the little grooves and nicks in it. I‚Äôd find something smoother and more monochromatic.
How about just a plain white square tile?https://www.homedepot.com/p/Daltile-Restore-Bright-White-4-1-4-in-x-4-1-4-in-Ceramic-Wall-Tile-0-125-sq-ft-Each-RE1544HD1P4/302603003 We aren't changing the flooring so I'm just leaving them as is and they do not match but I am ok with that and will just look cabinets up lol.
Not everyone gravitates towards granite, but it is a beautiful stone, so truly depends on how you want to use it, if you are going for transitional you can do a clean cut with thick countertop or use it as your island and a more subtle countertop on the surrounding cabinets. Less is more with violet paint! Try to keep the focus on your focal point, maybe even consider lower cabinets color and upper white. As the weight of the room will shift depending on the size and colors you use.
I think you‚Äôre right! I‚Äôm leaning towards just a plain white square tile 4x4 in size. I think that‚Äôll work. Would it be soooo crazy to do a darker grout?
Even if you‚Äôre not changing the flooring, it should still be taken into consideration, especially when choosing the countertop.¬†

As for the white backsplash tile, that seems way too stark white compared with the countertop. It needs to coordinate with it. Perhaps an off white would be better?¬†

You‚Äôre clearly spending some money on this kitchen remodel and want it all to coordinate and look great. I don‚Äôt at all think that you just choose what you like and it‚Äôll all work out. Everything has to relate to each other.¬†

I would suggest consulting with a designer to fine tune your choices. It doesn‚Äôt have to cost a lot and many do e-design.¬†Rather that than pick random unrelated expensive options and not be happy once they‚Äôre installed. Here‚Äôs one‚Ä¶

https://mariakillam.com/kitchen-edesign-project/
Thank you! I love the granite but not enough to use it on a backsplash. We have butcher block counters and bead board backsplash right now so you can imagine how ruined everything is. I'm thinking just a plain white square tile for backsplash then
Thank you! Appreciate the advice. The floors are a large blue tile. It is not in the budget to redo them nor do we want to do that big of a remodel at the moment.
Consider the undertones of your granite, to me it reads cool, so cool or neutral whites, or even a touch of grey.  If you go into the warm whites it will likely look dirty next to the granite. If you‚Äôre leaning toward traditional that is typically more intricate and detail, transitional/ modern would be minimal clean lines, larger tile pieces and smoother surfaces, your personal decor can lead into more traditional. 
Please share your design results, we‚Äôd love to see!"

Hmm, without seeing the entire wall it‚Äôs hard to know the size of the staples and the location of the trim‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt seem like they are holding anything together, I‚Äôd take them out and fill the holes. The layers of paint are likely acting like glue anyway. If it seems loose after you can get finishing nails and tap a couple in and a dab of filler. Make sure it‚Äôs looking smooth‚Ä¶if you put a higher sheen paint on it will show the holes and filler.

Good luck!

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me or something‚Ä¶ but this looks like a train wreck. I really hope it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs mid project.

Also, don‚Äôt paint the skirting. Sand the living daylights outta that mess and make it the same colour as the rest of your baseboard/trim.
As mentioned in other comments, keep the risers the same colour as the skirting board, but also keep this section white to help tie it together (I'm not sure the technical name sorry!) This should help it come together without either the skirting or the staircase looking out of place xxx

https://preview.redd.it/ct4rns7vghqf1.jpeg?width=764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=399f763aadce9a689807e23f361a5122d666aa51
Ooh, fun project!! I believe you will be ok with either! ‚Ä¶ what color is your wall? Do you have 3 floors? I would guess it‚Äôs starting to feel overwhelming and you might need a break! ;)

Keeping the skirting and trim color/white makes it part of the wall, which is a nice look. It makes it lighter and airy. Making it green makes it stairs, so if you want a heavier staircase presence then green. ‚Ä¶I see why you want to paint it green, as your staircase is nice and thick, and a stand out piece, and character;if your home was a brownstone style I‚Äôd say consider painting the skirting, once you get to the 2nd floor it looks like you have tall baseboard, keep that white. You can paint green up to the door trim as the door is a separate piece, and the ending of the staircase.

For easy, I‚Äôd leave the skirting/ trim along the wall white. I‚Äôd consider painting the risers white (though you did paint green already;) the top floor landing has green under the green railing, I‚Äôd consider painting this white as well. The look becomes more of a wall instead of all stairs.

It seems you have white spindles/ trim possibly going down to the 3rd floor? Will this be green? As I would be concerned with the flow of each set of stairs.

https://preview.redd.it/uicz5svxhdqf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6329f9e4a3ce9bd7b6686bf4387912a7576cd0da
Definitely don‚Äôt paint it the same green as the stairs. However you could choose a colour other than white for the skirting to tie it together. Just a light/faint colour between the white and stair colour could be nice.
I‚Äôd leave the green on the treads and risers but paint the skirting and everything else white.
You should paint the skirting the same green as the stairs.
Very much still mid project so forgive the mess please! thank you for your opinion
You really can‚Äôt tell that this is in the middle of a project?
All projects have a train wreck stage, this looks just like all my projects before it starts to come together. My vote is that the skirting board is trim so it should match the rest of the baseboard and trim throughout the house, not the stair color. I hope you post a finished project, this looks like it will be unique!

Bathroom refresh. Remove the shelves and wall decor. Paint the cabinets a modern color (warm colors are trending), ditch the fake plants. If you have no real sun or light there‚Äôs no reason to pretend anything can grow in there. Switch the faucets to nice swan neck fixtures to give it some interesting focus. Add one medium sized piece of art on back wall and three decorative pieces on the counter.
In terms of finishing touches - avoid fake plants. Have something real by the window. Fake plants are dust collectors and cheapen the space. The mirror could be replaced by a mirror with a frame for a more finished look. Something that would compliment the wall colour and fixture you pick.
You are correct in the light is dark. Can I suggest the new light fitting multiple instead of just one? also framing the existing mirror to match the vanity.¬†


¬†Declutter like your life depends on it,¬†family bathrooms take a LOT of storage, but clear surfaces are beautiful. Invest in in-cupboard storage.
Agree with no fake plants.¬†
Then stand back and see what wall treatments inspire you.
Until you have a blank canvas I wouldn't decide.¬†
Please do post an after picture. I am sure it will be beautiful¬†
¬†
Get rid of all the clutter first of all. The pictures on the wall, the fake flowers, the 2 shelves & all the little objects you have displayed on them. Without all the extra stuff, your bathroom will immediately look much better. And I would replace the lighting fixture above your sink & get new, updated faucets, something sleek & modern.
I would suggest updating not just the light but the hardware throughout the bathroom: cabinets, towel bar, toilet, TP holder and shower hardware possibly. Get some matching accessories for the shower and sink; toothbrush holder, soap dispenser, qtip holders etc. This will level up the space right away. Center the floating shelves over the toilet and use the same shelves or fine a more simplistic floating shelf to put plants/art/decorative storage options.

IMO fake plants are a nice gesture but better off with real plants (snake plants, zz plants and a few others that don‚Äôt need a lot of light or maintenance) or just replace fake plants with art or decorative storage options - easier to clean and maintenance free.

For paint it can be solely on the sink/toilet wall as the focal point and would suggest a soft or pastel-y olive green to go with the earthy vibe - not too dark as darker in small spaces makes it feel smaller. I love the idea of wall paper but I can never decide because there are so many options!!!!

If it‚Äôs not too much of a cost or you can do in future which is a huge level up would be to replace the mirror with two vanity mirrors/medicine cabinets over each sink with lighting over each or in between each - give it a luxurious vibe and tons of light and free up counter space! Then you can get rid of the hanging cabinet on the door which doesn‚Äôt do much for the bathroom. If you need a full body mirror you can always hang a really nice one on the door or possibly in the space that my be available by the window, but I can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs open space or an exit. :)

I would lower the towel bar and put a rectangular mirror‚Ä¶ maybe put a track light on the ceiling a long decorative type bring more light into all the areas.
What is the extension cord purpose over the door into that other area?
A new light with standard bulbs will make a big difference, and beadboard with a soft green or neutral paint could tie in nicely with your natural theme.
Note: real plants are also dust collectors. Make sure you dust your plants, real or otherwise!"

Sectionals are really trendy, but they can be an impediment to arranging awkwardly shaped rooms especially when space is at a premium.

Could you draw a room layout with the dimensions of the room & furniture so we can better help you? The series of pictures is kind of like the story of [the three blind men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) touching different parts of the elephant.

OAN, you need to add another curtain panel.

ETA

Here's a suggestion without the dining table & coffee table. Instead, you'd put a large tray on top of the ottoman and use that as a table. Bear in mind that I am a bit confused; it could be that your pics have different furniture arrangements so the mock-up isn't accurate. Hope this helps.

I think the above set up seems to work best except for the radiator that in the way.  Just a thought, could you add a sofa table behind the sofa over the radiator to allow for better circulation of air?  Something like this...

ETSY will have some places that will make a custom piece and the cost isn't that bad.   Regardless, the table needs to go... it's just too tight for the room.

this is an amazon rug. super thin. it will smooth out over time, you can‚Äôt force it because of the shape it was folded in for quite some time. just wait
You could put a very thin but hard disk under the carpet under each table and chair leg. Kind of like a coaster. The trick would be finding something thin yet sturdy enough that you wouldn‚Äôt see the disks from the top of the carpet.
I can't think of a good solution - pretty sure any textile of that thin-ness will be prone to creasing and folding under the tension of furniture and regular use.

Here is a visualization of your idea.
Sure!  You have neutral decor with potted plants as the main decorative elements, so a nature scene with greenery would look nice.
The picture is beautiful. I would consider the light colors/white clouds in the picture that it may blend too much with the wall color. Maybe painting the wall to get a bit more contrast behind the picture?
QUESTION FOR OTHERS: 
Would you recommend that the photo‚Äôs width be wider than, same size, or narrower than the sofa? 

I‚Äôm a total novice and I have no idea.
Definitely!!! Adding art that is personal to you (your own photo) is absolutely perfect.
Thank you so much, I like it!! How did you do that?
great, thanks!
Thanks! I was having the same reflection, but dont you think that a minimalist frame like black or wooden would help separating the picture from the wall?
I used ChatGPT.
You're welcome!
Yes!  A frame could help. Try with the frame and if it blends you can paint the wall later. Have you consider printing in canvas?
No, would you recommend it?
I think that picture would look great in canvas with a floating frame (I‚Äôm almost sure that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs called). Check it out online and see what you think ;)
Ok, I looked it up and indeed it looks good! thanks for the suggestion :)"

The couch needs to shoved tight against the sliding door wall.  Better that then how close it is to the counter stools.
Move the lamp and put it against the wall. The end.
Just keep rotating it around the room until it works. Try the other wall. The biggest problem is the ‚Äòdeath alley‚Äô created between the counter where you have the stools and the sectional. I feel smothered just looking at it.
Move the lamp and push it up against the wall and put a blanket on the back of the couch
I think when you get a huge sectional it takes some time to adjust to the big change! Everytime something changes in my space I allow a month of disliking it then after that I see that it a. Really does fit the space or b. Needs to be exchanged. Sorry to hear it‚Äôs not returnable that makes the feeling even worse I am sure.

¬†Like another poster said the space between the back and the counter is quite tight. As for breaking up the large back visually I would drape an interesting blanket along the back since there isn‚Äôt much room at all even for a very narrow console¬†
I would love it towards the TV and out of that little cove. Then it could be closer to the wall that the sliding door is on and maybe give a little more room by the counter.
It would help if you could post another picture of the couch from another angle so we can see how it looks from different spots
Move couch so it‚Äôs flush against the wall of sliding door, with back away from windows. Either put standing lamp behind couch or get new one. Low table behind couch for books, drinks, or charging station. Small side table on side of L shape of couch. Remove old coffee table and replace with smaller, round table. Get a large rug to tie the area together.
I would remove that lamp in the corner and push the couch over further. Put up a hanging lamp and maybe a floating shelf and you‚Äôre good.

Edit-should have read the comment section first. We all agree lol
Can you move the chaise location? If so I would put it on the other end of sofa and rotate the entire sofa counterclockwise so it sits in the corner of the room
Idk i like it like this, i would be very comfotable on one of those stools.
Honestly, it may not feel 'perfect' to you, but it's not as bad as you're making it seem. It looks like you could have a great party there. I think you should get a giant rug, hang some art with color, and get a couple plants. It's much better to have too much couch than not enough couch!
Yes, you can always hang a plug in sconce if you need a light there!
The blanket is a great idea, thanks! We did push it flat against the counter with the downside being we lose usable counter space, pros and cons I guess.
This could be the way. Pull it out of the ‚Äúcove‚Äù and to the left (pictures left) so that it fits closer to where that lamp is. This way there will be more space in that peninsula alley on the right. Take that lamp and place it to the back of the room behind the couch in the corner (bonus points if you buy more of a taller arch lamp to sit in the back over hang the couch.  

Swap out the square coffee table to a circle in similar diameter. 

Remove side chair  if possible (it‚Äôs too heavy with the large couch) 

Don‚Äôt want to see the ramp, but I get why you have it
Yeah we thought about this but for some reason I hated seeing the back of the couch as I entered the apartment, maybe that is the answer though lol

We moved into our house 3 years ago and haven‚Äôt touched the kitchen. We‚Äôre definitely tired of the green and need ideas for the bottom cabinets and trim colors! 

The door trim should be a shiny white enamel, like the window. That alone will be an improvement I bet. I would also paint the bead board white, I don't think it accomplishes anything matching the cabinets. For the cabinets, if it was me, I would just lighten the green color to a nice sage. That way  you won't have to prime or worry too much about the current color bleeding through. No offense, but those cabinets are not worth the work it would take to prime and paint! A lighter green and white trim will still be a big change. A valence above the window with a little green in it would be cute too.

I'm kind of overwhelmed. I know it sounds pathetic being a 26 year old but any help would be appreciated. 

Bed. Couch. Kitchen items first. Buy the bed, mattress and couch new. Everything else you can do over time. Try to use Facebook marketplace or if your area has a free or selling page on Facebook. People get rid of a lot of useful stuff. For kitchen items, find a thrift store like a goodwill. Also a good spot for art work.
Take a deep breath and slow down.  Essentials first, like everyone said, and something that is quintessentially YOU.  Could be a hot pink reading chair, a gorgeous turkish rug, an artisan lamp, a piece of modern art or an antique teapot.  HOMES feel curated and you won't get that feeling by placing a big order w/ Ikea, RTG or NFM.  Spend the next couple of months finding YOU.  Go to flea markets, scroll thru marketplace, check out consignment & thrift shops.  The order to buy things is the order that you find them, or they find you.  Congrats on your new life!
Take time - get the basics and then only get things as you find them and they fit who you are.  You may emotionally tie objects to the feeling right now and you may not want to keep that stuff.
Facebook marketplace and other resale apps or stores will be your best friend. The only things I would buy new are things like bed mattress, bed and sofa pillows, bed sheets, towels, blankets, etc because you never know how well second hand ones were actually cleaned. Everything else can be second hand. Take your time though. The right item simply just might not be for sale yet. 

All of our furniture was free or second hand and you seriously wouldn't know. I'm not even exaggerating. We get compliments ALL the time. Like literally over the years we gotten West Elm dining chairs and swivel round cofa chairs. Electric standing office desk. Legit office chair. Litter Robot. Grandfather clock. Heavy wood dining table. Front entry table. China cabinet.  TV stand. Coffee table and end tables. Large deep and long sofa. Accent chairs. Bathroom fixtures like faucets. Full length bedroom mirror. Real and fake plants. Picture frames. Antique rugs. I could go on. Stay patient. Focus on quality and look long enough to get familiar with what's a good vs a crazy price. Check every day. Jump on a good find as soon as you see it. 

As for what makes a home cozy, it's going to be things like personal photos, lamps, blankets, and throw pillows. Generally things that make you want to settle in and relax.
Bed 1st. Then one comfy chair. 

Haunt thrift stores for the kitchen plates, glasses, silverware, utensils etc. Buy other cool art or homey things while there. Sheets and blankets can be found, just take them to a laundromat and wash on hot. 

Buy 2 or 3 good pans and a couple bed pillows at Marshalls or Home Goods.

Then take a breath. You'll have plenty of time to fill in the rest.
I agree with the others.  Go slow.  You can start with just a frame and mattress set for the bed.  Add in a classically styled couch in a neutral color.  Then slowly build from there.

Second hand shops, thrift shops, flea markets, etc.  Spend your days off just wandering around looking around these places.  Note what you like, what you absolutely love, and what you hate.  You'll start to see a theme as to what catches your eye.  Once you know that, you can start bringing pieces home as you'll be able to see how the pieces will fit your tastes.

Also, go visit the local art museum.  Walk around and see what pieces draw you in.  What colors are you attracted to?  Do you like the bright colored artwork or the muted colors?  This can give you a basis for a color scheme by pulling the colors out of a favorite painting.  The artist has already vetted the color scheme for you.

For kitchen ware, bedding, and towels, just buy what you absolutely need to start. White sheet set and a couple blankets, bath and hand towel and washcloth, one place setting of dishes, etc.  This is just so you can then take your time deciding what you really want instead of buying a full set only to hate them in a few months.
My biggest advice is to find something bright and colorful that brings you joy. I moved across the country last year and basically had a bed and papasan chair and used my patio set as my indoor seating. Didn't get a couch until this spring. But I did get a dining set including hot pink dining chairs like 2 months after moving in and even with everything else being a mess, the joy seeing and having those chairs brought me was so immense.
You can start by buying some new beds, dining tables and chairs, mattresses and tableware. These are essentials. As for other furniture such as TVs, sofas, projectors, etc., you can buy them slowly or buy second-hand ones. You can also consider buying some rugs or floor mats to make your living more comfortable.
Focus on what makes you comfortable, not what looks complete. Maybe that's soft lighting, plants, or a specific scent. The physical stuff matters less than creating a space that feels safe and yours.
A plant :)
Estate sales can be a good way to add kitchen items in addition to other household necessities. Most estate sales will mark everything 50% off on the 3rd day. Check out estatesales.net
If you need to economize or you want to be kind to the environment, you can save a ton of money by going to estate sales in wealthy neighborhoods. You can find high quality furniture, kitchenware, linens, & even tools for pennies on the dollar. Older furniture is usually built with hardwood instead of sawdust & glue like new stuff. 
Go on the last few hours of the sale & they will be dealing! 

Here‚Äôs the order in which I would furnish a new home: 
1. Bed/comfy mattress & pillows, sheets, blankets  plus shower curtain & towels & bathmat. A dresser or high chest if you can afford it. 
2.  A sofa or at least a comfortable chair
3. Basic kitchen stuff (an oven safe skillet, a stockpot for pasta, dishes, flatware, utensils, dish towels, dish soap)
A desk & chair & desk lamp 
 4.  A dining table & chairs 
 5. A TV & stand
A good sofa and a dining table I could sit at daily, everything else could wait. I went for a DreamSofa sectional because the cushions are reversible and the slipcovers are also washable. It felt less risky cuz I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have to replace it anytime soon. The dining table was from Vermont Woods studio. It's really good. These two made the whole space feel settled.
It's not easy for anyone tbh. Even when moving between homes and because every home is different in terms of space, angles, paint, number of rooms etc, furnishing will also be different.¬†


Thinking of an Airbnb rental might be helpful as it meets all basic needs to stay incl internet connection
Facebook market place sounds like a good idea. Thank you.
You can also find great deals at estate/yard sales.
Some cities have Freecycle and Buy Nothing Groups so check what's available where you are. I know some friends that have gotten some really nice stuff.  It just takes a bit of patience to find what you want."

Square.

1. There are already so many rectangles.

2. It appears you've already considered end tables for each loveseat. 

3. It's nice to give people options. Not everyone wants their knees that close to the coffee table - we are not all the same size.

An alternative would be a narrow, oval table.

None of these rugs fits the style of the room, imo. All three are too modern to work in there. You need something that speaks the same style laguage as the rug in the lounge area, something in a traditional style from somewhere in the world. The colors need to hamonize with the lounge area colors, but they don't have to 'match' exactly. The cloud shaped rug has a similar color, but stylewise it just looks bonkers in the space.

The last one . But the one before, if it  has same colors as center of living room , I‚Äôd be tempted but I like combo of shapes to make it less conforming like a hotel.

Move the thermostat, floating shelves, can a robot vacuum park in that space at the bottom?
Get rid of the word art?
Idk if you have kids but I would never regret a broom closet. I‚Äôd have 1|2 of it for tall handles and just a few shelves for spray cleaners but a basket that sits on floor opposite to be the basket that get the take upstairs items ppl leave laying around . Quick hide for unexpected guests
I would drywall in and possibly expand the pantry area. If you want to leave it exposed, but not so noticeable, you may want to consider painting that area the same green/blue wall color as the other wall.

I agree with the other comment that painting it blue would definitely help. And the snake plant is a great idea, too. I‚Äôm not usually a fan of word art, but that one cracked me up (I loved the Sinclair Ross novel). This seems like a fairly easy and inexpensive fix, and definitely doesn‚Äôt require costly changes.
A thin tree. And at Christmas either a skinny tree or decorate the tree that normally lives there.
Move the thermostat and just wall it in
Paint the green/blue color, it‚Äôs more fluid w the staircase than the other room, maybe add a small table and plant, which will hide most of the two types of flooring. I think shelves would make it too busy and cluttered as there is already enough going on for the eye;)
The place where a roomba lives or any other vacuum of your choice.
A rail for the steps is the fist step. For the nook, a picture is the only alternative. The space is too small for plants. Or maybe a skinny table like this

Potted plant or plant on the table. Also some of those corner shells with photos or small plants
If your not gonna move the wall the answer is always a plant
Is it where you plug in your vacuum cleaner?  If so I would not put anything there.  If not a fairly large pot plant
Nothing, it‚Äôs a great book for the thermostat. But paint those two small walls and the bottom of the opening green! It will help it be less noticeable.

That's a perfect little area to set up like a desk and shelves as a little catch-and-organize-later station. Basically a little area that will catch items that you use on a daily basis but too lazy to put away  as you're coming and going. So if you ever lose something you know where the first place to look.
Install, about halfway up, a rough-hewn wood shelf above it, 2-3 decorative hooks. Below it, cubbies in the same wood tone. Put a plant and a cool bowl on the shelf. Now you have a catch all for keys and coats and shoes!

Get some sloppy toppy while wall squatting
Since there's an outlet, it's the perfect place for a charging station.
Nothing coming out dull. You want people to go ‚ÄúOH‚Äù when they turn the corner and see it.
How about a tall narrow accent cabinet?
A built in style corner shelf. Keep the thermostat in one of the shelf levels
Paint that area and the bottom of the beam green like the wall.
Large bookcase (entire wall) with open back so you can still access the thermostat/outlet?
move the thermostat and outlet and make the closet bigger
Large snake plant. Done.
You have an outlet. That would become a wine fridge for me

I'd put a skinny tall bookshelf and decorate.
I would add shelving of some sort. Whatever suits your household
Books, wine storage, plants
Plants
The only thing you can do is put floating wooden shelves there with knick knacks on them. It looks like there's HVAC and all other kinds of stuff running behind that wall. Floating shelves it is and that's it. If not floating shelves, measure the space, then go to Home Goods and find a small square end table and put a cute lamp on it. I see the outlet down there. So definitely a lamp on a small table if not shelving.
Shelves
I think if I didn‚Äôt have the budget yet for expanding the closet, I would paint the nook the same color as you accent wall on the stairs and add some floating shelves to set family photos or artwork on.
If near a kitchen a snack pantry? Custom built drinks cabinet?
My mind does not work the same way as others apparently, because my brain immediately was creating a map of middle earth with a corresponding mural
The only solution is to make that closet wider by bringing the wall out to meet the stairs. The outlet and thermostat is easy to relocate by an electrician.
I think an artificial, skinny evergreen in a pot would go really good here! You can decorate it however you like, change it up for the seasons/holidays. It would fit in the floor space, and fill the wall space as well! All without blocking access to the thermostat and outlet, but hiding them enough that they don‚Äôt stick out like that
Corner shelf for fun tchotchkes
Open storage shelves with baskets for things used less frequently!
I would put a laundry basket there, tbh. You could get one of those little hidden trash can cabinets and use it for laundry instead. That said, I have teens who can't seem to put their socks, hoodies, etc away, so having a laundry basket right in the door would be golden. 

Short of that, it would be a perfect robot vac station, pet feeding spot, something for a low-light plant, boot drying station (if you're in snow country), or a backpack nook (if you have school-age kids).
Lil table with a lil lamp?
Play hide and seek?
Christmas tree and every other holiday decor
A recharging station! Set up a multi USB stripe. A homemade table would be awesome. Pens, paper, a hanging board for keys.

Option 1: I'm guessing that's an interior door with a cat entrance for potty time? If you have a cat, consider placing a cat scratch system in that corner.  

Option 2: Is that a pantry door?  If a pantry door,  consider a narrow cabinet to match your kitchen cabinets to house sheet pans on the bottom and house tumblers in the above cabinet.  

Option 3: Consider expanding your pantry's width if it's a pantry door. Hang your thermostat towards the stairwell. You may also consider placing a shelf inside your pantry with electricity to run your loud Vitamix blender (or other appliances).
Wine shelves with open side on same side as that door.

Broom closet

The thermostat is a nest thermostat which means you can control it via your cell phone

Specialized closet with motion activated Roomba door.

It's 5 projects deep on my to do list, but it's what I want the most.

I'd put in a Murphy door bookshelf, that opens to a secret closet, the baseboard opens up so the Roomba can do its thing.  It won't close the door until the Roomba is charging again. I plan on using a sensor to trigger based on electrical usage of the docking station.

Or they could just put a small stand over the Roomba and a plant.
this is the best one
I was going to say vacuum station.
Came here to say this!
I‚Äôll edit the post to add that that‚Äôs not a closet, it‚Äôs the stairs to the basement, and there is duct work behind that wall, so I can‚Äôt expand the space.
I like this, especially since OP said this area is off the living room so makes sense to me for entertaining or movies or whatever. A little bit more cash vs just putting a plant there, but a better option than putting up drywall and losing any real potential functionality!
Very nice..
This is the answer üôåüèΩ
Awesome!!!
Where is the thermostat?
Too much dust being kicked around that close to open stairs.
ü§£
I came here to say coat rack lol!
Love this idea, paint it the green/blue, this would be cheapest route.
I was thinking coat hooks and a shoe rack. Can also be used for hoodies and slippers if there‚Äôs already a mudroom.
Most useful idea!
I need more plants in my house. Great idea!
The answer is always, plants.
Right now Costco has some indoor plants and planters that would look great in that spot (not being paid to say that!)
Exactly what I was thinking! üíØ
This is the best idea. Or even a small tree, could be a fake one like [this guy](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Nearly-Natural-7-ft-Artificial-Olive-Tree-with-Natural-Trunk-and-Handmade-Jute-Basket-T3154/329445445?g_store=&source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&pla&mtc=SHOPPING-BF-HDH-GGL-D59H-059_006_HOME_DECOR-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-RDC-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-All_In_Subclass_PMAX&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-BF-HDH-GGL-D59H-059_006_HOME_DECOR-NA-NA-NA-PMAX-NA-RDC-NA-NA-NBR-NA-NA-NA-All_In_Subclass_PMAX-21267086625--&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21267087969&gbraid=0AAAAADq61UcGCHIqSZI-2fjsx6vwMUv8E&gclid=CjwKCAjwobnGBhBNEiwAu2mpFIl6PDg45WHM01YDzrY5osjgSfX6vDPPb8Z4xUR0NuuQuGmwZS49FBoCmewQAvD_BwE)
Yes, the front door is to my back at the other side of the living room
Ha! Love it. But I'll see your phone booth and raise you a TARDIS!
Seriously though, tall, floor-standing potted plant.
It‚Äôs actually the stairs to the basement, but I absolutely need a cleaning supply closet
I was going to say this as well. You could wall mount a vacuum cleaner!
I see nothing wrong with the word art, tacos are awesome.
Ha I Iike that one actually.
I should have put in the original post (and somehow I can‚Äôt edit it?), but that‚Äôs not a pantry, it‚Äôs the stairs to the basement, and there is duct work behind that wall, so I can‚Äôt expand the space. 

And I did think about painting it the same color as the wall, but since it‚Äôs technically ‚Äúin‚Äù the kitchen (since it had the same floor as the kitchen), I painted it the kitchen color. But I think I will paint it the living room color to make it stand out less. Thanks!
Always the answer
Ooh this is a good one! I definitely need a catch-all space
And/or little shelves on wall
Make sure to share your plans once executed to perfection ü©∑
Then add a narrow closet or built in shelving in that space so you can‚Äôt fall off the stairs
I would just get a tall plant for that spot.
In stead of just adding a wall, can the wall with door be taken down to give you a 'landing' in the basement. The thermostat could be added to new wall. Brooms an stuff would be on basement landing. It would smooth out the area.
Coffee/hot chocolate bar. Or a super fun candy bar!
I'd go with a large plant standing on the floor.
Pothos. Best plant ever.
Disregard my suggestion. The plant idea is way better!
If possible, try to add a flower themed wallpaper just on that section. It will really tie the place together with the plant and make it look like a feature wall.
This is the way: side table with the roomba charger below, a basket for stuff that needs to go upstairs and a plant on top.
Bonus points for a standing hydroponic garden, since it‚Äôs the kitchen:

https://www.lettucegrow.com/products/nook-bundle
that would add so much space!
even better if this is a nook that is in the basement please make this a tiny, but cute supply closet! There is wall mounts that you can attach without using screws that will hold multiple brooms or vacuum or a swifter or a duster. There‚Äôs definitely tiny janitorial caddies on Amazon of all shapes and sizes on wheels that you can wheel in and out of that little nook that will hold all your cleaning supplies and chemicals.

Just make sure you measure your space and know how wide and deep and tall you want your caddies after you install something to hold your brooms, dustpans, vacuum, etc.

It‚Äôs worth it to get the ones that you can roll the handle into the holder so that you can place the holder really really high and still have a lot of space below to put the wheel in caddy .

Just remove the picture, of course lol .
If you make it a broom/mop/cleaning supply closet, you could also add a roomba station at the bottom
Drywall and make a small storage closet there, even if you just do a wall along the stairs and nice shelves across it.
Why can‚Äôt you drywall in the nook though?
I agree. Make a tiny closet or ""nook"".
Dracaena fragrans are nice if you want some height. And who wouldn‚Äôt want a treelike member of the asparagus family right next to their kitchen?
Yeah an Areca palm would be happy
My pothos is unkillable. It's been with me for decades, even when I was young and did a terrible job of remembering to water it (I'm much better now).
Yes! Add a trellis (pothos likes to climb) and you'll end up with a living wall!"

I HAVE YOUR ANSWER.

Room and Board Metro Sectional.

We had purchased a Crate and Barrel Axis sectional a couple years ago for our family/theater room. We thought it would eventually break in and develop sink-in perfection.

It never did.

Meanwhile, my sister purchased the Metro from R&B. After watching a few movies at her house, we realized we were never going to be satisfied by our CB couch.

We relocated the CB and replaced it with the Metro. We've had it for a month now. BEST DECISION EVER.

Sink-in perfection! Tatum boucle fabric in terracotta. Go with the deep option. Ours comfortably fits our family of four, and could squeeze six if we needed to. Lots of configs available. And it didn't take forever to get. 2 months from order to delivery.
I have no input on owning a couch similar, but this one looks amazing. Since it‚Äôs firmer you can get some large down pillows to add for more comfort.
Benchmade Modern OG Couch potato with luxe filling and sunbrella fabric!! This is our setup and we absolutely love it. It‚Äôs incredibly comfy and resists stains. Our cats claw on it all of the time and there‚Äôs no loose strings at all.
Lovesac sectional with deep seating and soft/cloud fill (can‚Äôt remember the exact name). Covers are durable and washable, and you can easily purchase replacement covers if they were ruined somehow.
With that budget I‚Äôd visit an Ethan Allen design center. We had a sectional from them we loved.¬†I‚Äôd never spend 8k on a sofa I hadn‚Äôt sat on first.

Ordering replacement covers is pretty easy from them, as well. As far as sturdiness goes they‚Äôre one of the best. I‚Äôve had dressers, nightstands, a canopy bed and other pieces from them built to survive a nuclear winter.
I'll be honest I found ID to be too firm and not comfortable at all. It def wasn't a sink in couch and actually hurts sitting on for too long. My favorite sink in couch that literally felt like an amazing mattress, I purchased from the furniture store Hayden. 

I'd rec going to a big furniture store and just sitting on everything.
Check out buyitforliife sub
Take a look at one of the sofas at Crate and Barrel, Macy‚Äôs, Room and Board, or Ballard Designs. Many of them are made by a company called McCreary Modern. I have one very similar to the one pictured. I forget the item number, but mine has held up for 15 years. And, you can buy it slipcovered or upholstered. American made and jokingly called the ‚Äúcoma sofa.‚Äù Mine has seen 5 dogs, kids and everything else. Cleans beautifully. I don‚Äôt work for this company, I‚Äôve just never had one like this and will get another.
Try Room & Board.
IKEA Jattebo
Costco serene couch 100%. All cushions come off and can be washed. I have dogs and kids. Most
Comfortable couch ever
Lovesac.¬†
We recently spent 2 hours at a Chicago area furniture store whose motto is, ""You dream it, we build it"".

We couldn't believe all the many options of getting a sofa that's right for us.

You have to try different depths, the feel and style of the cushions (both for seating and the backs), different styles of arms, different styles of piping.

The only way you'll be 100% satisfied is spending that $8K and having a custom made one.
Ikea kivik is this
I was coming here to recommend the Metro as I lie deeply sunken in to my Metro lol
Off topic, where did you get the end table? I‚Äôve been looking for narrow ones like yours!
Right!? I love this couch!
Amazing!!! Thank you so much!
I second Ethan and Allen. We got a sectional and it‚Äôs the best thing ever. We went during a sale and got 30% off.  They have fabric that‚Äôs more per and kids friendly.

Edit- from the reasearch I‚Äôve done for lovesac is that the couch comes in individual boxes that you have to put together."

I think I would do a runner that stops at the entry and then a matching or complementary rug in the open space. A circle or square maybe.
Straight through the bathroom window. Gonna need to knock out the glass really well so you don‚Äôt get cut, but also it‚Äôs important to think about what‚Äôs on the other side. How do you have time to take such well framed photos? Is it the cat that‚Äôs got you cornered?
Measure the wall where the barn door is and do the runner within that length.
That‚Äôs a great idea! So the complementary rug shouldn‚Äôt be the same design, but instead a different style rug that looks good with it?"

I would do wall to wall curtains, mounted at the ceiling. Either tie back or hem them around the door, depending how often you use it. I would do 2 layers at least for where the window is, so you can open light blocking ones during the day.

I see what you mean. The wainscoting is much nicer than the wall paper but the door is a completely different style. 

Taller door or different door would work.
I think the part that threw me off at first look was how long the horizontal moldings are
The molding on the wall is very traditional and the door is a mid century modern style, so they clash. What is the style of your home?
The new walls look beautiful, you just need to decorate! That front door, however, does not look good at all. It‚Äôs a completely different vibe and they‚Äôre clashing.
I think it should have more panels, but it‚Äôs definitely a grand improvement

https://preview.redd.it/5dcy71f6ebqf1.jpeg?width=477&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dfda989b91388a32af0d3f976e95d1fe22ac15b
The wainscoting section is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too wide. That is partly why it looks off. Now it's majorly unbalanced. The width pulls you down the hallway towards the door and creates the feeling that you're falling. Maybe you'll be able to break it up with some artwork or mirrors. But it should.have been more sections.
I‚Äôm going to disagree with everyone on this thread, but maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm European and We mix up a lot of modern with traditional because a lot of our buildings are older. I have zero problems with the door and the wainscoting‚Ä¶. just throw some art on that wall add a lighting fixture etc

You could even paint the ceiling and it would be kind of cool

Love the new look. Instead of a long piece of art could you do several photos, perhaps in nice frames or even canvas? That‚Äôd break up the long wall and provide a bit of color/visually appealing look.
They‚Äôre both pretty boring without art or color.
Honestly I think it looks great. The difference in style doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôd probably choose modern art to tie the vibe from the door
The style of the molding and front door need some harmony. One is busy, one is stream-lined.
I'd leave the top half flat.
I think the wainscoting looks fantastic! A few suggestions that may make the door clash less:

1. Paint the door a bright and cheery color like light blue. This will give it less brutalist jail vibes. If you really want to play into the classical look, add stained glass to the little door windows (there are some very realistic stick on ones). 
2. Add large artwork along the wall. I would choose colorful art with this space but I think large is the most important part. 
3. Add an entryway table and top it with something soft and inviting, like flowers. This will also soften the harsh lines of everything.
The door does not go with all that molding at all. And to be honest, everyone is doing this molding now and I feel like it‚Äôs already on the way out. Like, the trend is over unless it fits with your home, and it looks best in an older home.

I personally would have broken up the wainscotting into smaller sections. Door definitely doesn‚Äôt match the style!
Honestly I like the juxtaposition of the wainscoting and the modern door, it gives me Parisian apartment vibes!
I like the doors and I like the walls but they're just from two different places. The doors are modern very cool. I also love walls, but that's very traditional. You're in a tough spot pal. Maybe somebody will give you a better suggestion on how to bridge the two design styles. Good luck!
Seems to me the easiest fix here is to ditch the panels above the chair rail height completely leaving that space smooth. That gives you a lot more freedom to choose and display art rather than trying to find art to ‚Äúmatch‚Äù the boxes. It also tones down the heavy traditional look a bit. The doors are as heavily modern as the wainscoting is traditional. I‚Äôd select something in the more transitional styling space. More glass to flood natural light with simple lines. I‚Äôm not sure what Modern Hamptons means exactly but your hallway is stiff traditional with all those panels.
You need a new front door
It's a mismatch in styles
I like the update but the style clashes with the style of the door. The other rooms (from what I can see) are more in line with your foyer wall so I would keep it and get a new door. I think you can go with the same size door but in a more traditional style.
I like the doors - assume the house is mid century modern - the wainscoting doesn‚Äôt fit that esthetic. Celebrate the original style with color and with art.
I think take down the upper molding and then add art. It will look great.
I would place pictures and photos that stretched within the framed border to give it colour.
That wallpaper had to go anyway.
It‚Äôs the long proportion, it‚Äôs working against the traditional intent of molding. You could remove it and come up with a proportion that feels more human scale.
It needs more vertical panels. The horizontals panels are excessively long.
What you've done is certainly prettier than that wallpaper.
For what it‚Äôs worth‚Ä¶ the new walls look amazing!! Fill the void with art. A long skinny piece is nice but it will have to be enormous to fill the space. Just do like 4 large frames spaced evenly‚Ä¶ do that before you change the door. And the if you feel the door need to be changed do so!
Looks so much better, but yes ‚Äî I would probably replace the door.
It's two different styles throwing you off. Classic and modern. The door doesn't fit the hallway esthetic. 

A simple fix to make the door look bigger is to put matching molding above the door. Honestly though, I'm not sure how that will look.

But question here - I assumed this was a basement door because of that wallpaper. Is this your actual front door?  And if it is, does the door match the outside look of the house? 

Regardless, you could put in a lot of work to make it match and you might, in the end, spend the same amount of money that you would've spent replacing the door.
You‚Äôll have to decide about the door but in the meantime, you need a runner on the floor and honestly I would remove the top wainscoting and put art up there. See if those things help the door not be the focal point when you look down the hall. 
Also, how about a different color on the door?
I agree with comments about changing the door. You don't need an overtly traditional door to match the wainscoting, but something taller, more transitional, and a different color would be nice

I would consider artwork along the wall with the library lighting above it. Or even just lighting in a few of the boxes.

https://preview.redd.it/7otkpjh7ibqf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c54f26d987c55e420373296fb13338a3fa779e76
It gives me the illusion of having cabinet doors on your hallways. I personally don‚Äôt like it, but I see the appeal.
Some art might help soften up the juxtaposition.
I think there‚Äôs too much wainscoting IMO. Remove the top half and paint it with color. My daughter and her BF recently redid their dining room with white wainscoting on the bottom half, sage green on the top, and white trim on the windows. I‚Äôd show a picture but it‚Äôs not my house to share online.
Just no! It looks crazy
I wish you had divided the big rectangle into 3 or more.
I‚Äôm not a fan of the before or after, sorry. It looks like cabinets that were replaced with panels.
As others have said there‚Äôs a mismatch in style with the door and the trim. Also it needs something on the door wall to continue the top line of the trim. If you keep that door height you could possibly add a trim rectangle above the door to provide continuity. If you change the door height then be careful about how that change plays out on the exterior.
A) the wainscoting should have more panels instead of one short one and one lonnnnnnnnnnnng one

B) the wainscoting and the front door are two very different styles. To align, either change the wainscoting for maybe some modern slat-wall details, or change the front door to a more traditional design
You could try a gorgeous deep paint colour on the doors if you don‚Äôt want to change them out (stained wood will look gorgeous though), they look too plain with the beautiful walls. Also change the handle to a much more robust one, it looks puny.

Edit: sticking close to your colour scheme, this is what ChatGpt offers, ignore the windows it got wrong,

https://preview.redd.it/qvj0qrq6jcqf1.jpeg?width=1402&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44013b218ef9c4a5fbadff9e226362015e962b6c
Yeah. The problem is the long horizontal framing. It should have been done all the same like the panels to the left - long and vertical ln top and smaller squares on bottom. Alternatively, could have had rectangles on bottom that are as wide as two vertical panels. Anyway, just bad, lazy design here. You need to lay out in paper the length of wall and figure out how to divide top vertical panels into equal frames/spaces/frames so that it fills space properly.
The floor and door are contemporary and the wainscoting is very traditional so they clash. A traditional runner on the floor might help.
The door clashes.
I love this
I love this, simply beautiful!
I‚Äôm a fan of eclectic interior design, so a modern door juxtaposed with more classical box molding is choice to me. If that‚Äôs not to your taste, I would suggest looking into neoclassical door designs.

As for bareness: I wouldn‚Äôt do anything drastic to the walls or doors. Add a pop of color/contrast with a runner rug. Accent the opposite wall with an art piece or framed mirror. Frame that extra wide threshold into the other room with a nice, tall botanical.
Door throws it off
Major improvement. Looks so much more inviting. 


Sometimes people paint the inside of the squares a different color for visual interest. You could paint the whole wall it a darker color to make it more visually interesting.

I would replace the door with one that is taller and in a similar style as the one you're going for. 




Edit: I failed to see the last picture and the caption. Forgive me for my ignorance
You just need to switch to warmer lighting, maybe add some wallpaper inside the panels and add sconces
Too busy for a hallway. If you had just left the chair rail it would‚Äôve looked much better, less busy and fit with the door.
Door change, add some framed pictures or art work, and possibly a change of color.
It‚Äôs nice I think.
Maybe a couple of 20x30 black and white pictures with some warm light sconces, art lights over the top of the pictures. It would elevate the hall and tie into the door. I love what you did.
Well, it‚Äôs an improvement over the wallpaper at least..
They‚Äôre way too long.
Modern front door with tradition moulding might be sort of fighting with each other.
The proportions are wrong - molding width should be split throughout that long wall ie each width is about 36‚Äù or whatever
It‚Äôs the contrast between an ultra-modern door and wainscoting. And no offense, the door is not projecting the same taste level as the hallway. Or in other words, it‚Äôs tacky and ugly.
The framing is to fancy, it‚Äôs not the modern style of your door.  I think the wallpaper looked nicer.
Did you just get tired of cutting miters?
I believe it is an improvement
I don‚Äôt think the door is the problem, I think the proportions of the rectangles are a little odd‚Äîsuuuuper long horizontally. But I think that can be balanced by what you hang on the wall. Definitely do not hang a long thin horizontal painting bc that will only exaggerate the proportions. Balance it out with vertically oriented pieces (they can hang over the trim they don‚Äôt need to be framed by the trim)
The door and light wood floors read modern. The trim is very traditional. All are lovely. But they aren‚Äôt necessarily vibing. You seem committed to white. I‚Äôd consider painting the whole entryway, including wainscoting a deep jewel tone. It will make it look more modern, IMO.
Color drench it.
I made some panels in my bathroom and stenciled inside the panels instead of hanging pictures.

https://preview.redd.it/0hi54qwgkoqf1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd1f45af69c2c699a6da9d174b3bfd5607ab9d95
I love those doors but not with those walls. The walls are great too! They just don't work together.
Switch out the door. It clashes with the walls.
Flat, Shaker style wainscoting, with evenly spaced panels would have worked much better. The molding style you did is fighting with the door because it‚Äôs traditional. Because Shaker is simple it can play nice with MCM. If you redo it I would even suggest just doing the bottom and then you can have a gallery wall for photos or art on top. Changing out the door you will find to be an expensive project.
I like the contrast of styles, I just think it needs a little balancing. The visual weight of the two is out of proportion. Right now, while the space is empty, the wall looks light, high, and delicate looking, and wall with the door looks ""too heavy"" by comparison. HOWEVER, I think that's just because you don't have anything on either wall, so the only features your eye has to work with here are architectural.   
  
Once you add art to the long wall, it will likely bring the visual weight of that wall back in line with the door. I'd make your decision about the inner frames based on the art you want to feature on the wall. If it looks great with the inner frames, leave them. If they make it feel cramped, take them out.   
  
If after adding art the door still looks ""too short"", you might try using color to balance it out. By painting the door a different color and adding a coordinating piece of art (or a small grouping) to hang above it, you expand the area that visually reads as the door. If the door wall looks too ""heavy,"" choose a color that's light and airy; if it's just too ""short,"" reach for a punchier or more grounded/earthy choice. Also when I say ""color"" it doesn't have to be at all overt -- a subtle neutral is also a color. What you're going for is grouping nearby elements (in this case the door and its surrounding wall) into the shape you want to create. By pulling the color from the door upward, you trick your eye into seeing the door as taller and more in keeping with the top line of the rest of the room.   
  
Both your new wall molding and the existing door are high quality workmanship and they both serve a practical purpose, so I don't think you should rip out the door just because it doesn't ""match"" your new molding. Many exquisite homes mix architectural styles with abandon and still look cohesive. You have a beautiful home that is changing over time -- as all well-loved homes do.
I think you need more ‚Äúplain‚Äù doors and bring them higher up if possible. I think the walls look AMAZINg! You just need to embrace it. I think a photo gallery would look really good on this wall as well
Gonna go hottake here. That's a mix of styles and per these pictures, you pulled it off. I really like it. Admittedly, I don't know your personality, nor the house's, but I'm feeling this for the right decor.
Its absolutely gorgeous. one change I could offer is to make smaller squares in the wainscoating as opposed to one long square.
Could you put framed pictures on the wall to break up the white?
Add symetrical art, long, narrow.  A very linear look.  Maybe floating shelves w art
Weren‚Äôt you supposed to break up the framing into smaller vertical rectangles? The long-ass horizontal rectangle looks so strange.
Some art might help soften up the juxtaposition.
You could have a transom window above the door, remove the upper new trim, or add other items like a colorful rug runner and framed art inside the upper trim.
I see what yur talking about but it looks beautiful! A new door a more traditional less modern door would be best.
Remove the inner wainscoting, it is too busy.  It will then jive better with the modern door.  If you keep tue door, some non- traditional colors for the wainscoting wouldn‚Äôt‚Äùde-traditionalize‚Äù it.  Or you can replace the door with a more traditional  one.
I would do half glass doors to make it more welcoming.  Those strips of frosted glass are a bit too ""commited to an institution"".
*
I do think you‚Äôd be best off with taller doors.  I understand what you‚Äôre saying about the wainscotting, but I think if you make the long open into a picture/art gallery style display, it will look cool. Also, if you don‚Äôt want to change the style of the door, using modern art statement pieces would tie the two looks together.  You can also play with wallpaper inside the large rectangle as a statement piece, but I think you‚Äôll still need some art there to make the wainscotting make ‚Äúsense‚Äù.
There is definitely room above the door, and the door is all wrong now! A large classic style door that blends well with the wainescoting, French doors with more glass would ""open"" up the hallway. Also, there is a LOT of white. I love the wall, but it could use a complimentary color, such as a navy, or dark green, with some wood tone, such as the frames of a couple of classy pictures.
I would try making your current door darker, or putting a window above the door. I think a rug runner (like a red color with classic design) would brighten the space. Maybe add some smaller paintings with gallery lights
Agree with the door being the issue but I like those doors. I would do something to fix them up. Are they quality wood? Strip and stain. Definitely need to update the trim and hardware as well and I think you could tie them in or make them as stunning as the wainscoting so they hold their own.
It‚Äôs too white
A few lights pointing downward into the blank space would brake it up visually.
Im just an internet stranger, but since you asked i think it looks great overall, but I agree the door's style could match a little more with the classic style of the walls. My links below are just style recommendations, not necessarily the color or stain.

I think doors with similar types of trim would look great and compliment the walls. Doors with the same style of trim as the walls, [like this](https://share.google/f3xg2mC6CLfh6Mnl8). Don't worry if the scale of the panels are different, it's fine.They work well with each other. 

Or you could get a door that is natural wood stained to the color you prefer with panels and maybe some small windows in a grid at the top to let in some natural light [like this](https://share.google/WTPGMMuo1jh98L9vF) [or this](https://share.google/Dw1zIrXJyYy8o6O0t). Or, depending on your budget, you can do what some others have said and replace the doors with something taller and match the grid of the wainscoting, but things don't need to be ""matchy-matchy"" to look beautiful. 

I think a natural wood craftsman style door [like this](https://share.google/B6uqr7FS0FIvnpztn), [or this](https://share.google/G0daOczbdHnADrbSX) would really complement the walls, too. Sometimes the extra character elevates the space.

Also artwork hung on the walls would look great. You can also add paint and or wallpaper to the walls for more visual interest, [like this](https://share.google/images/FKMl2CQ5MHW0lHUp3). I would hang a large mirror with a large gold or brass frame along with artwork. I personally wouldn't do one long skinny piece of art. I would hang several large pieces. 

Also, as a personal preference, it's too much white. I think you might like it better with some neutral color the you find calming and inviting when you come and go through this entryway. It's just a little stark right now and that might be why you are not enjoying it as much as you expected.

Also, I think it would look *fabulous* with wallpaper in the trim and a coordinating paint on the was around it.

Anyway, your home is beautiful. Don't stress about it. It's not ""bad"" as is, but it probably look a little more harmonious with the wall trim.
I like it a lot
Great ‚Äúphoto frames‚Äù there. You‚Äôve just got to use them to add some colour to your home.
The panneling needs some verticals because it looks really odd. Have all of the panels the same width.
I think it looks so much better
Crazy idea, but maybe you could put a new wall paper inside the panels of the wainscoting. Something modern that would match the energy of the doorsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
U should paint the molding
I liked the brick
You need a colorful rug runner and maybe scones or a chandelier light depending on how high the ceilings are. Add some art to the walls and color and it will look much better
Is your house mid century?  That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd put it, based solely on the door style.  If so, then the trim was an odd choice.  I also think the long panels are an odd configuration.  Why didn‚Äôt you break them up more?
3 big pieces of artwork in funky colours within the top section will modernise the wainscoting as it becomes a picture frame and will tie in the door.
I think you need to finish the area before you worry about it too much. The front door is a different style, but I don't think it's that out of place here.
Add some pictures
I think if you broke up the wainscoting into sections you would like it more. Make it 3 -4 smaller sections and I bet it will draw your eye in the right way.
I like it. Needs some artwork though?
Why in the hell did you make two foot section panels followed by 9000 foot panel sections? Were you going for the ""sideways exclamation"" point feel?
It seems like the top comments are giving you very expensive 'fixes'. Let me suggest something less cumbersome. 

I don't worry so much about the picture moldings being too traditional - mixing styles can be very attractive when you mix styles throughout your space.

If you do decide to change the picture molding, you will have to repaint, whether you remove it entirely or change the arrangement to match the part nearest the thermostat. Alternatively, you could add a landscape wallpaper to the long upper rectangle, or hang matching art frames down the length to break up the space visually.

If you prefer the more modern vibe of your front door, I'd suggest avoiding ornate frames in favor of something with cleaner, architectural lines.

Whether you leave it as is, remove the upper molding, or add a uniformly sized line of artwork, any choice is better than that original brick wallpaper.
I like the walls and hate the doors
Not my favourite, tbh, but better than before. Maybe, as other suggest, they‚Äôre missing some pictures.
I like the wainscoting but agree the door need replacing
I think the framing is too much - it‚Äôs throwing me off that it‚Äôs down a long hallway .. I also don‚Äôt understand the point of having the small one and then the long run?
First look tells me you could be the relative of a suspect in a SUV case and Olivia will be back with a warrant if you don't agree to a search without it, which your lawyer who's conveniently having a meeting with you at your house at the moment disagrees to.
Would only have done the lower part of the wall in wainscoting and have painted the upper part in a single colour.
I definitely think that the door is throwing off the vibe. I think getting some artwork up will help. Maybe like an eclectic mix of different shaped/sized frames? A patterned hallway rug would warm the space up as well. With the light walls, light flooring, and modern door it is giving a cold feeling that I don‚Äôt think matches the vibes of your new walls.
Agree with everyone,  the doors are the problem, both in style and diminsion.  I would think they are a standard height, so replacing them with a single door in the same height seems like it would be the better way to go. If it's possible to put in a window of some description above it, that could be a great addition. 

The wainscotting does look busy and confusing to me. I would prefer less layers of molding and maybe balanced squares instead of the extremely long shapes, but, I'm far from an expert. A big change like this, even just paint color, always is a little shocking at first. I would change the door, add a runner, maybe lighting, and then see how it feels before you change the molding or add major art.
It‚Äôs beautiful!!! You will love it once you decorate
I think you need some accent color and to swap out the door
Looks very plain now
You don‚Äôt like it.
You could put two little letterbox windows above the door, to match the pattern of the door, thereby making the whole thing feel intentional.
It's a lot of edges to dust.
The wainscotting is beautiful but I would change the door.
Think it looks so much better.
A thousand times better. Nice job!
Paint it black
If you‚Äôre not married to the wainscoting you could go for a more modern trimmed out look, or even like an acoustic paneled feature on that wall. It‚Äôs like the wall is really traditional, but the door is modern.
Try painting it a funky color.
It‚Äôs nice be happy yep
I think when you hang art or photos it will look awesome. Right now it‚Äôs so very very white.
Maybe if the wall panels were to match the door somehow it would visually look better?
All I can come up with to try is maybe keep the waist level wainscoting, but remove the upper portion to better facilitate hanging art? Filling the walls might make the space feel more furnished. And if you go with more modern art and maybe hallway runners, it might be less incongruous with the modern style door.
Maybe some modern paintings to try to tie the two together. The wall looks great though.
Yea, you need a new door and doorframe.
If you hang up some art it will be fine!
Just change the door style. Otherwise amazing!
I like it!
Yeah, that wainscoting doesn‚Äôt really look that great with that modern door. It doesn‚Äôt really go in terms of style and it doesn‚Äôt really create a contrast either.
I actually don't like the door. It was fine until that pic and I couldn't figure out why I didn't like it from that angle until another comment pointed out the modern doors.
Love the framing.
I‚Äôm not a fan of wainscoting in a modern house. It‚Äôs an old fashioned look. I‚Äôd just paint and add art. Maybe a credenza
I'd fill that hallway with art. Gallery walls are beautiful.
I like both,  but the wallpaper is more my vibe.
I LOOOOVE IT! but I love traditional style wainscoting. I would change out the door.
It's way better, maybe just paint it a better color?
The inner wainscoting is a little weird. It makes it look like it‚Äôs from a sci fi movie. The front door does not match the wainscoting, if the rest of your house is more modern I would scrap the wainscoting all together. ¬†Get like 3 larger colorful paintings, or paint your hallway a different accent color. Get a runner for the floor and some furniture and some jacket hangers for the entryway. Plants just something, it is very plain looking brought now, you need to fill the space correctly and add some color.
Your horizontal wainscoting is not lining up with your door lines.  Here‚Äôs what I would do:
First, I‚Äôd add two horizontal wainscoting strips above your door at the same level as the two top wainscoting lines. Now you‚Äôve created a datum - two sort of continuous lines over the door that match up with your upper wainscoting.  Live with it for 14-21 days and see if it‚Äôs better.

If not, buy a new 4 or 6 panel door, whichever you like best.  Either way the new datum you‚Äôve created will tie things together, and you will have removed the incongruent open lines on your door

As for your art, you don‚Äôt need one skinny long artwork, you can hang three pieces grouped together like a triptych.  Or you could make it a cool black and white photo gallery with black frames.  Etc.  Unlimited amount of art work you could install over time.
Pffft.  I come from the past‚Ä¶.. and I opt for floor to ceiling mirrors instead on  that wall. Then the door on the end‚Ä¶ same thing.  Who has an ai image thing that can make this happen to prove how awesome it would be.  Plus mirrors cost soooo much money  way more than that molding of yours‚Ä¶. So it would greatly bring the value up on your home.  Js
All I can see is extra horizontal surfaces to gather dust
i feel like one wide door like you see on the new show homes lately would work perfectly here. but probably need to add a bit of wall back in either side to make it blend nicer. if that‚Äôs even possible i‚Äôm not sure.
I think the new walls look great, a new door to match the traditional look would pull everything together
Makes me think of garage door
why is it so long and then two little ones
Plain white wall with some cool mirror and some art, a little side table or bench with some greenery would have done the trick...
The wainscoting is timeless. I like it better. The only way I would choose the wallpaper, is if it were actually real brick painted white. üß± ü§ç
I didn't like it in my home office and was considering removing it but painted lower different color and now really like it. That might be an option?

https://preview.redd.it/wxhk8xnl8iqf1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a55ef302461701eb54591fa21eeef3e62f59204
not an artist or a designer bit i would try large black and white photos of my family and pets and paint the door black with the rug that people have been showing.
Definitely looks better, but you need a contrasting darker colour below the central dado, it'll lift the ceiling and make the lower half less sterile.
Looks great. That wallpaper was awful!
I like the contrast, especially if your items are eclectic!!! Get a big wide modern art piece to tie it together. Making one could be fun! I‚Äôd contrast a traditional or plain MCM accent table or cabinet with the modern art, but I‚Äôm weird like that.
That‚Äôs awful
OMG.That is gorgeous!
looks so much better
It‚Äôs definitely better than the wallpaper‚Ä¶ but I would‚Äôve divided it up into like 3. I think that‚Äôs why it looks off
Looks better than the wallpaper!
The walls look wonderful, but as others said it is the front door with them- 2 different styles. The walls are traditional, the door MCM.
Wow this is beautiful. I always wanted something like that in my house. I love it.
Better than the wallpaper but a disconnect with the front door
Love wainscoting. It‚Äôs timeless. Huge improvement over that wallpaper.

That said, that‚Äôs a very long stretch of unbroken horizontal lines. I wonder if you can break the wainscoting up into multiple, shorter rectangles? That‚Äôs usually what I see

Either way I would turn it into a gallery with multiple pictures. Having one long picture would only emphasize the problem.

https://preview.redd.it/9y5szrnoqlqf1.jpeg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bde088c55072ba34a819ed86e795033b9de8295a
Honestly,a different door style would probably help a lot
I like the improvement. 

Door needs an upper transoms and dark paint. You will run into a header, which is part of all construction. 

Fine large abstract art, and no it doesn‚Äôt have to fit within the panels. Go beyond the panels. Doing anything horizontal or elongated will only add to your problem. We need vertical. 

I‚Äôd find 3 very large pieces of art. Abstract. 

Front door is too short for perspective.  Often it is done for the front facade, and the interior is not taken into account. 

Tell your partner that I‚Äôm an Interior Designer. Been doing this for 36 years in DFW, TX.
I would get three pictures on the wall‚Ä¶.put the picture lights on them‚Ä¶.the lights are short oblong, they will tie in the design of the door.
It‚Äôs the length on the middle square of wainscoting, it needs to be broken up the proportion from small squares to large is awkward to me. Looks way better than that cold brick wallpaper though!
Both are beautiful examples of their type.  They are however chalk and cheese.  One a ‚Äúgritty‚Äù, ‚Äúex-industrial‚Äù vibe, the other a ‚Äústately‚Äù, ‚Äúgrand‚Äù vibe.  So, before worrying about the door consider the whole room, the furniture, art work, ornaments, soft furnishings and rugs.

Once you have the overall design bottomed out the door will be an easy fix, and it needs fixing because it takes its design cues from the ex-industrial palette.  The door needs to be either a continuation of the wood panel theme or, if your furniture is of uber modern design you could get away with a very modern door (but make sure you are picking on design cues from your statement furniture pieces.

I love what you have done with the wall and I am sure the whole room will look amazing once you have finished.
I agree you are not sure
I dig the brick look ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If you could commission an artist to knock up a mural the same length as the bordered space, it would look elegant AF. Even just enough singular pieces would look real cool. 

It does look weird empty tho.
You could paint the insides of the inner frames another shade of white.¬† Also, you could add a series of framed pictures inside of that framing.
Love it
It‚Äôs beautiful and luxurious. Wait til you get the decor in!
The wainscoting needs to be in smaller sections. The scale is off.
Hang framed art on the wall in the wide upper parts! That would do it!
Why not paint either the upper or lower half a different color to break it up?
add a wooden panel with matching painted wood molding above the double door, align the woodwork height with your new molding height.
Hang 4 or 5 symmetrical portrait orientation pictures in the top panel.
I love it
I love this so much also reminds me of Star Wars for some reason
I think It shrinks the room
This is how my sims mobile houses end up looking.
I love it
Hey, fellow Aussie here! I‚Äôd replace the front doors with something like these 100%! 

https://www.bunnings.com.au/corinthian-2040-x-820-x-40mm-entrance-door-primed-classic-clear-glass-pcl4g_p1965227

Would look great painted black or even a nice reed green depending on what would help it flow with the rest of your homes styling (Haymes gum leaf green is quite nice)

I‚Äôd get some battery powered wall lights to put in that larger rectangle section on either side of a painting - this will help with those long proportions a lot too! 
(Something like these https://amzn.asia/d/4EKlExk) 

Also a pop of colour in the form of an interior front door mat or hallway runner would really elevate this so much üëè
Would have looked better on the bottom only. Maybe remove the top.
I love it, and i love it with the door too, I think it can definitely work together with a few more modern pieces.
I love it.
If it makes you feel better, I dont think the brick wallpaper worked well with the door either.
Nah, it‚Äôs gorgeous.
Love love love
Huge improvement for the walls!! They look beautiful. Some artwork will fill up the large panel nicely. The door doesn‚Äôt match but if its too expensive to get a new one I‚Äôd suggest painting it like others have said :)
I like it. Kinda gives a cleaner, luxe feel.
Love the walls, the passageway would look amazing with a full colour drench. A rich, deep colour like wine or chocolate brown or even ochre. And then a series of framed art prints or photos in the long panel (white frames, black and white art)
replace the door with a door that has bigger windows. this hallway will be beautiful with more natural light

edit: also get you a nice runner and a long painting to put on the middle panel
I like it! Paint the inside of the door a Robins egg blue and lots of modern colourful artwork. I like the mix of styles
I love it!
I like it! It opens up the decor possibilities
It‚Äôs elegant and timeless. Love it
I'm like omg its brilliant then I swiped right :(
Sorry
Looks much better
It looks kind of like a hospital
Ok love the new walls but the door needs to go and needs to be taller I think!
Aside from the door, you could do the chair rail and lower wainscoting and remove the top one. Then there's more room for visually interesting stuff up there 

Also agree with wainscoting typically being in ""blocks"" and not going the length of the room
Hate the door. Love everything else. Once pictures and decor are out, this wall will be magical ‚ú®
I love the walla but the door doesn't fit in.
You could add a long mirror with sconces on the sides
Your hallway is fabulous!! Good job.
Paint the bottom half and I think it would look fantastic
Just add some good art on that long wall.
Maybe panel that section above the door?
I love it. Paint your door maybe.
Could make the wainscoting shorter
I personally love it. Great job!
Big improvement
If you‚Äôre looking for artwork, Monet has many pieces that are long that would look great in that space (yes, he‚Äôs my favorite artist).
It‚Äôs gorgeous.
Gives me ‚Äòsecret hidden door‚Äô vibes üòÅ
I think it looks better but maybe consider a really nice textured wallpaper? There are some really high-end wallpapers that could make the long part pop.
Maybe add some art / framed photos to draw attention.
Love the walls, I do think once u start ur decorating the doors wont stand out as much. If u wanted to upgrade the style of those doors here‚Äôs a thought‚Ä¶ small tension rods top & bottom of door with a sheer panel curtain.
I‚Äôm not sure what the rest of your place looks like but I‚Äôd do a funky gallery wall and possibly paint the door a color that‚Äôs in some of the art. Or have the carpenter who did the wainscoting break up the panels.
I love it..
I don‚Äôt think the door is a problem, but I think you should tie in the rectangular parts of the door by using long rectangular artwork.
Looks great!
Walls are gorgeous, door is shit, partner is wrong.
Should have made it tall not long. Tall visually heightens the walls. Long visually lengthens the walls.
The new is gorgeous!
I liked the fake brick wallpaper
I like it
It looks nice.
add furniture and mirrors and done
Looks great to me
The wainscoting is better but the door is the wrong style now. Budget would dictate what I do. If you have the budget, you‚Äôre right, more of a statement door would look good. I do like glass though because otherwise that‚Äôs a long dark hallway.

To could go with double doors of a different style or a single with sidelights.
That looks very nice
I loved the moulding until the pic with the door.  Maybe some art or rugs merging the two styles will help.
Yes! Gorgeous!
That is absolutely beautiful!!
Love this
I love it, it looks great! Huge improvement!
Nice!
The doors are of a different style but if you paint the doors black!! You will not be sorry!!!!
IMO it‚Äôs the hideous flooring that throws it off
I like the wallpaper.
Why wainscotting higher than waist level?
It WAS brick underneath?üòçüòçüòç
Agreed, door is modern, wainscoting is traditional. Interesting to see how you tie it all together. Wall paper definitely had to go, not a fan of brick print wall paper.
Thank you. I can show this to him and say its not in my head!
Clasho of styles for sure
Exactly. I didn‚Äôt see what was wrong at all then I flipped to the door picture and I was like ‚Äúoh, okay, I get it.‚Äù
Agreed. I‚Äôd swap the door for something more traditional if you can. Your door is very modern. My preferences would be for more boxes in the picture frame molding so it doesn‚Äôt elongate the hallway so much, but it‚Äôs not so bad that I‚Äôd redo it.
I don‚Äôt mean to be unkind.  My first impression was that these doors give me Fort Leavenworth vibes.  They feel very‚Ä¶.unwelcoming.  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs some light, but not much.  And you can‚Äôt see anything if you try to look out.  Enjoy your 23 hours of solitary every day‚Ä¶‚Äù

I would not like to have a front door that I can‚Äôt see through ‚Äî regardless of my Ring camera.

I think that having *any* panels on the upper walls really limits what choices, sizes, and ways to display any artwork you may want to consider, too.

Re: the double front doors.  I have a friend whose house was broken into ‚Äî the thieves broke through the double doors like they were balsa wood by kicking the center post.  And these were heavy, solid oak doors.  The police told her that homes with double doors are targeted for that very reason.  The thieves broke through her front doors, pushed them closed after they got inside, to avoid suspicion, did a sweep through her house grabbing anything that looked valuable, then simply unlocked the backdoor and climbed the backyard fence.  5 minutes.

Because your two doors take up the entire entrance, it makes it feel smaller and narrower, confining.  If you had a single door with a tall side window on the left side, maybe that would provide more light while also give the sensation of more width to the entire hallway.  Can you try different versions of this with AI?
True! The wainscoting does look way nicer than the wallpaper. And yeah, the door kind of stands out going taller or switching up the style would make it look way more cohesive.
Floor clashes w walls, too
Also the walls are just so‚Ä¶.white. Maybe a beige color to match the floors more? The white is competing with the floor color.
Exactly.
And I would argue that a bit contrast wouldn‚Äôt hurt when choosing a color or texture for the door. Maybe plain darker tone of wood would be nice.
Is it also just the no space between door and this wall
Same, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen it done as just one gigantic long rectangle like that
This. It feels lazy on the woodworking. Should‚Äôve probably been three to four equal sections down this hall.
I don‚Äôt understand the single row of smaller moulding and then the super long ones.
same as well as the short section and long section. the long section would make sense with the long painting there but without it it seems bare.
It's giving wooooooooooooooow
Some long art placed in there would make it feel intentional. 

Maybe OP could find art that would help bridge the style of the door.
This!!! My husband is a carpenter and does work like this for a living. I‚Äôve never seen him do a crazy long stretch like that along a whole wall when it‚Äôs a box shape. Those should have been way smaller / more boxes to fill the wall.
Modern hamptons :)
Yup, once OP gets art/pics up, it will look really nice
As a designer, THIS COMMENT!
I agree. Is white the most cohesive color? I‚Äôd have to see the rest of the house but when I think of wainscoting I usually imagine some warmth or a minimal hued color. White is good too. Just depends on the rest of the house.
This! The hallway is already very long, by adding more panels, you'd break the horizontal lines a bit so the space looks less narrow.
More panels is the answer. That middle panel is too long. It looks comical.
I agree. The long panel looks way too long to me.
Yes, I wish I requested more panels :/ the designer suggested 3 panels to save money but now I regret it. Best thing is probably a really long skinny art piece
Agreed. Love the door, love the wainscoting, and blending old and contemporary is a classic move of professional interior designers. The doors aren't the problem, the room just needs to be finished with paint, art, lighting and rugs.
Yup, this is soo much cheaper than changing doors or getting a long painting- honestly even without rug or lighting, painting door and adding a row of art work will make it work so much better
This doesnt have enough upvotes.

The mixture of styles reminds me of the last room in 2001. OP has to learn how to decorate with color to avoid starkness.
This is fantastic.
This is definitely better.
Agreed but also paint the wall area surrounding doors‚Ä¶full colour blocking to distract from the short doors
I could do that too, and probably much cheaper. Long skinny canvas frames start at 1k on etsy
I agree.
I was thinking the same for the door, either a robins egg blue or a bright clear royal blue
I‚Äôll clarify what I meant, when you put it in just any home, a Home that would have not originally had it, a Home, whose style doesn‚Äôt really fit with it, it is a trend and it will go out. If it‚Äôs placed in a home that‚Äôs older or more stately, it‚Äôs an enhancement, beautifies the room, and in a home like that, it would not be trendy and it would never go out.
Moulding like that has been done for hundreds of years, it doesn‚Äôt go ‚Äòout‚Äô. But yes, it should fit the rest of the home.
Just needs colour.

Door isnt a great fit, but the number 1 problem is that it's bland.
Picture of door as it wasn't added...
I feel the same. Plus in the before pic, the light is on. The after pics, it's off. I'd like to see the after with lights on to have a like for like comparison.
I agree with this.
I totally get what you mean about the panels feeling heavy. Removing them could definitely modernize the space and give you more flexibility with art. You could also consider some lighter decor or maybe a mirror to reflect more light and make it feel less bare!
I get that! It's definitely a unique look. If you're not into the cabinet vibe, maybe try some art or a mirror to break up the lines and add some personality? A tall, slim piece could help draw the eye up and balance the doorway.

If you don‚Äôt want to add an upper transom, then just paint the same color of the door above the door.
*I love this so much*

*Also reminds me of Star*

Brick wallpaper
Although it does give a spaceship vibe, if you want to run with that.
Honestly I would say the elongated wainscoting throws me off, it basically creates a singular panel without any patterns which makes it feel empty. Haven‚Äôt really seen this approach before
If you can‚Äôt switch out the doors, can you add a transom above them? It would definitely add more light into the hallway and grant a sense of spaciousness. It would also offer you some more aesthetic options to explore (frosted glass, faux or real stained glass, etc). 

As for the artwork, if you already feel like the hallway looks too elongated due to the new molding designs, I‚Äôm not sure adding a single panorama style canvas is the way to go; it may wind up reinforcing that stretched vibe. 

Perhaps a triptych of 3 vertical canvases would help break it up visually instead? You can also explore adding a couple wall scones (I suggest uplighting, and skip hardwiring) for more visual breaks and increased ambiance.
It looks fine. Just start putting pictures/paintings and see how it looks. It‚Äôs more pronounced now because there is nothing on it.¬†
I think different door and thin painting above the door to fill the empty space could work well too
Have the door painted almost black?  Maybe figure out how to edit a photo with the door black, ask chatgpt.
It‚Äôs not just the door and the wainscoting, it‚Äôs the wainscoting and the floor as well.  I always find wainscoting to be very traditional and those floors give a modern feel
These kind of doors are super common in Australia (judging by OP‚Äôs light switches). I‚Äôm not a fan of them too tbh. But these are your standard builder doors
I used to go to a large doctors' office that had basically these same exact doors going from the waiting room to the back. They just look very sterile and business-like and don't have really any character on their own. In an ultra modern building, they're fine, but waistcoating is a very traditional look and it just doesn't match at all.

Something more like this would be much better suited

https://preview.redd.it/agu7chgl4eqf1.jpeg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb90096d87488b34bdd848af45093f7039ca95be
No no the wall and floor work
Or a lot of matching smaller art, as long as they are evenly placed along the wall. But yes, something needs to go there for sure
Not sure what Modern Hamptons is but pick a style and be consistent throughout the house.
I like the idea of a mid century mixed with that.  do what you like. Not what others like or approve of. they can have an opinion but do you.
Modern Hamptons and wainscotting don't usually go together in my opinion. It would've probably been better as a plain wall with artwork, plants and furniture to go with the style of the rest of the house.

EDIT: if you are set on the wainscotting, then 3 or 4 panels on the bottom and leaving the top plain would be less overwhelming.
Haha, why are people downvoting this?! I think the wall looks MUCH better, but I do agree that the door clashes. Everything looks better with decor, though.
What about an all-glass door?
I think multiple portrait-oriented art pieces would look much better than one long skinny one. I think long skinny would accentuate
A designer thought of this  ?
Redo it now, or you‚Äôll be chasing after workarounds forever.
I actually don't think it's hard to adjust yourself, if you're a little handy
It could be just the photos but *generally* the chair rail should be on the bottom third of the wall (with two thirds above).  Did your designer do the drawings for this because frankly, they should have known better.
I'm a bit avant garde, but what I would probably do is paint the insides of the smallest panels a quirky/ interesting color. That would give the wainscoting a more modern vibe
I think that long stretch looks *great*, OP! It's a modern take on traditional wainscoting. I think too many panels in that fairly narrow space would look busy/crowded and stuffy. I also think it would create a kind of visual/design dissonance with the rest of your house which from what I can make out is modern, open plan and airy 

Fix the doors, and yes a single long skinny art piece or a tryptych or a series of b&w framed photos would look good, but keep the artwork/photos simple, light and airy.
I would definitely pick smaller pictures instead of long ones. You already have the elongated effect with the panels so you should try to balance it out. a series of square images with darker or wooden frames would give you good contrast.
Oh dang! Yeah that‚Äôs expensive! I definitely like this better than the brick wallpaper. Certainly more visually appealing but some decor would help give it that extra dimension
Hmm you could buy a blank canvas or even make one with stretcher bars, and then glue/staple fabric to it.
The door does not go with all that molding at all. And to be honest, everyone is doing this molding now and I feel like it‚Äôs already on the way out. Like, the trend is over unless it fits with your home, and it looks best in an older home.
One thing that I‚Äôm surprised no one‚Äôs mentioning is that the chair rail is WAY too high up on the wall. This has the effect of making the ceiling feel lower, and in turn it tricks your eye into thinking that the door must be very short. Vertical proportions are incredibly important with traditional moulding, and should be based on one of the classical orders of architecture. 
As an added bonus, if you were to lower the chair rail and vertically stretch the upper panels, it would also open up the possibility of larger artwork on the wall.
But it is also hard to judge based off of photos, but as others have said the style clash with the door might be the largest problem
Great frame for a museum lobby-sized mural.
First thought was, it needs to be broken up into multiple squares. Big fan of wainscoting.
Same thought here
It kind of looks like a garage door.
Agree with window. Also don‚Äôt think art is needed. A rustic rug and lighting.
This is the right move
Huh.  Good eye.   The doors my friend had were super popular choices by builders in homes in the US in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs.  I think they contributed to the Spanish Colonial style that was also popular, back then.  Even if the rest of home itself didn‚Äôt have much else in that style, because of size limitations, that element made the home more attractive to buyers for curb appeal.
Yup. When I saw these doors, I immediately said they HAVE to go.
I love the color of this. It's the exact color I'd love the doors to be.
I would not recommend an all glass door, for safety and mental health.

It is very easy for someone to smash your front door to get into your house if they‚Äôre trying to rob you. It‚Äôs also very annoying when you just want to ignore someone who‚Äôs knocking, and they can see straight in that you‚Äôre there.
Yeah, maybe even lean into the long section and have multiple portrait-orientation images showing progressions of the same image? Like, frames from a stop-motion animation of a walking figure sort of thing, IRL zoetrope! Or similar images with different colours arranged to make a gradient/rainbow.
Everyone was doing doors like this in Australia from like‚Ä¶ 2010. Imo they‚Äôre ‚Äúout.‚Äù Point is there‚Äôs always going to be elements of a home that are considered ‚Äúout.‚Äù
That was my initial impression. 

  
Classically, the most important element in a particular space (like a front door or fireplace) is going to have the most dominant (largest, most ornate) moldings in a room and the trim/baseboard/crown becomes less ornate in descending order of priority. This also generally follows from room to room in a house as well. So the modern style door with a pretty minimalist casing feels out of place and minimized compared to the more ornate wall ornaments. 

If you prefer to keep the wall the way it is, replacing the front door with a similar style or even adding additional ornamentation around the door to make it look bigger would be something to consider.
Yes, since that would be hard to find, I'd recommend going with panoramic wallpaper (great example in Lone Fox's video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtnBOAtQh5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtnBOAtQh5k) )
Art is ALWAYS needed!!!!
If someone wants to get into your home through your front door, they're going to get in unless you have some serious reinforcement around the frame. Doesn't matter if it's glass, wood, or even steel.

That said, I agree about avoiding them for other reasons.
I'd try painting the doors a darker color before replacing them.
If a robber is standing in the street going, ""hmm..  which one?""  He might avoid the more difficult door.
This is such a terrible argument. Most victims of robberies aren't specifically targeted and most criminals are opportunists that are looking for an easy weakness to exploit. Glass is an easier weakness to exploit and creates a more favorable opportunity for ease of forced entry. There's not really an argument there.

 Obviously if someone was extremely determined to get into a particular home even a steel core door couldn't stop them, but it's pretty unlikely that a regular joe with that kind of security is going to be specifically targeted. And even then it definitely would make the job harder - unlike glass.
good idea. The contrast should add some additional visual weight.
Sure, but even then they're probably going to pick the one that's going to make the least amount of noise... so probably not the one with the giant pane of glass. Also worth considering that a decent quality glass front door is going to be laminated glass (not to be confused with tempered), which requires a significant amount of force to break.

The best deterrent against a burglar is an alarm system, and funnily enough, the sticker saying your home is protected does most of the heavy lifting.
Yeah, it's all too matchy-matchy. I'd paint the doors a really dark color then wallpaper the ceiling with a floral design on a dark background."

Wondering if anyone can share a link for solar ones that work well? Bonus if they can suction cup to the window so they don't have to sit on the ledge! Thanks! 

You can use solar ones but they come with a panel that might look ugly in the windows by day.  I don't know because I've never used them.  I love solar though- so give them a try.  Amazon sells them.
Solar lights just never look right. They are never bright enough. How many windows are we talking about here? I have lots of battery-powered candles on a timer at night for ambience. I use rechargeable batteries. I am a big fan of Luminara candles. They cost a lot (you can often find them discounted), but they are the only ones I have found that really do look like real candles. People who come to my house freak out if we go out while the candles are on. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to put out the candles? You could start a fire by accident!‚Äù ü§£

Buy some Luminara candles and a big box of rechargeable batteries and it will look like you are really burning candles in your windows!"

Do you have a piece of art or a throw pillow that inspires you? Or represents colors that you like? This would help pull a vision together. Your walls and floors are neutral, any colors go but you need to pick something that guides your color decisions ( painting, phot, pillow) and decide on a style.

Here‚Äôs an example of a sofa and decor selected from the artwork.

Can we see the rest of the room? What‚Äôs your vibe? Modern? Traditional? Boho? Eclectic? With these neutral colors you can do anything, so we need more information.
Maybe take a look at Pottery Barn or Restoration Hardware. It seems like they fit the style you want of cozy minimalist.
Go onto a design website and save pics of rooms you like.  You could also collect a few print design magazines and furniture catalogues.  Identify everything you like, then review to find common elements you identify over and over.
I think you should choose a  piece of art or a textile to jump off from, though I also see a beautiful camel color in there.
I have a sectional from Ashley furniture that has the perfect fabric for this. It has flecks of gray and beige, so it can pick up whatever colors you have in the room. It's a very light color, but the cushions are machine-washable, which is a huge perk.

Similar floor but white walls. This is our color scheme (couch is the beige, green is the chair, patterned is rug, blue is pillows)

I love me a pink sofa! Lol.i just ordered one from Anthropologie in the color ""blossom"". So excited to get it.
No, I don‚Äôt really have any inspiration. We have some pottery in neutral tones. We are very simple and like neutrals.
The rest of the room is empty right now - We literally just moved this weekend and are pretty minimal. I would say maybe ‚Äúcozy minimalist‚Äù - not the harsh, cold minimalist aesthetic, but very simple.
I‚Äôm just trying to know what color to go for - can‚Äôt tell if a grey or a beige would look better since the floors are kind of in-between the 2.¬†
Right now I‚Äôm just needing to know the absolute basics of color scheme bc I really need some furniture lol! Not sure if we should go grey or beige with the couch or what color wood to get for the table.¬†
That would be perfect!
Thank you!! So helpful and those look great together
No Grey.  It's been out of style for awhile, and it clashes with beige and browns.  If you must, go with a dark brown.  Or caramel, green, blue, orange.  Find a rug or a piece of art with beige and browns and a few other colors or at least shades, and add pillows, chairs and other pieces to pick up the colors."

This kind of aesthetic usually works with an overcrowded gallery wall
Pretty chairs! I would start with a rug and artwork.
Put the table with the lamp in the corner between the two chairs. Remove the wall lamp on the left.
Put a fluffy, long-haired cat or dog on it.  Bonus points for twin fur babies on each chair.

Edit: Buy a box of lint remover rolls if you do.
This is giving me Victorian Glam Barbie energy. The chairs are so OTT that you need to go for it in a big way. The fringed lampshade is perfect. You need to get the wall lamp on board with the theme! Add lace curtains and gilt-framed art for full effect.

P.S. I feel a s√©ance coming on. üòú
A rug, replace the sconce with a floor lamp and put the other one on a slightly higher table. I would also get a shorter coffee table. Definitely needs a plant. I can invisible a big fluffy fern hanging from the ceiling
The usual.  Area rug, art, plants, lighting. You've got the color part of it nailed though.

If it were me, I'd move the chairs apart and put the table and lamp between them.  In fact, if possible, I'd space them so that the round table with the lamp is in the corner and the chairs are evenly on either side, but still facing angled in as you have them now.

Then I'd put a tall pretty plant under the sconce to fill in the space.  As other commenters have said, this is begging for a gallery wall. 

I'm not too sure about the table in the foreground.  It's placed kinda oddly and doesn't appear to belong.  Can it go somewhere else?
I would turn that into a little nook/reading corner. Put the* table with the lamp in the corner and then the chairs in either side of it and a cute little round rug to define the space and yes to a little gallery wall!
Put the round table between the chairs with the gorgeous fringed lamp. Take the other table out. Funky gallery wall around a deco mirror. Like gold/ornate gilded age style. Coolest conversation nook ever. A round ottoman would be cool. A mirror with an arched top would be great. Small rug. Peel and stick wallpaper could make it super moody/cozy. Move the plant, take down the lamp. Think Barbie/Wednesday Adams glam. Side table with tea tray/tea pot. Old portraits. A second hand electric fireplace would be perfect. I find stuff on Marketplace pretty often.

Tons of gold and antique framed art and mirrors. 

Add a rug, maybe red Persian style
OMG! Those chairs are Gorgeous!!! I'd totally go a Victorian Gothic library! Pinned bugs in frames, skulls & vintage taxidermy... If you get rid of those chairs, please hit me up!!

I'd find a small skinny side table to put between them and space them out a little more, maybe loose the square table in front of them.

https://preview.redd.it/iuop6h6lz8qf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b58081f5113a1870bb78108ff9742ad589235c72
The corner is too dark. I‚Äôd situate a smaller table to put between the chairs and keep the purple lamp between them. As for the sconce either put a metal cover (to the floor) over the cord or lose the light. You could replace it with those rechargeable scones that stick on the wall or lose the purple lamp and put in something taller and brighter.
Is the paint Benjamin Moore Shadow?
Get a lower table. Otherwise, I love it!
What part of the house is this area in?
Pull the chairs apart and put the table between them.
Love the colors of everything. Maybe add a rug if you can find one you like. I can‚Äôt think of anything else.
Add a mirror or picture on one of the walls.
Chairs are too close together - if two people sit in them they‚Äôll practically (if not actually) be touching knees  ! Move them a little farther apart.  

Then I think small table between them, nothing in front but maybe a small rug. 


I do see this is next to your TV though so wondering if a diff layout in the room as a whole makes more sense
Get a cat? A lot of ceramic Hummell figurines?

J/k‚Ä¶ but this could swing a few different directions, so what are you aiming for?
What color is that wall?
I think i would put chaits to left and right of corner with lamp between,get round 4 or 5 ft rug in those colors,round table on top,moce that cabinet just a bit further away down the wall,interesting look
definitely new chairs, a less dated lamp and a table that is less high than the one there right now. an area rug would be great.
 Switch up the total Victorian vibe with some bright colored modern art.
Any recommendations on where to find art? I'm pretty good at thrifting frames or finding them cheap.
Do you think an oriental rug would look nice? Anything colors to avoid?
I would love to harness that energy. A bold space would make me very happy.
That table can absolutely go somewhere else haha. I'm glad the colors are coming together well because I was worried about it. Do you think there is something that could ruin it that I should avoid?
I was working on a mockup last night and came up with this. The photos used are all too similar. I would like some variance and dull/muted colors added but the point is made well with the frames. I like your perspective and am curious what you think of this/what additions or changes you would make.

I think you are onto something haha
By smaller do you mean slimmer or shorter?
It is Behr's paint. Color ""Vinter""
It is in my dining room but the room is massive. I already have a table in the room with seating for 7 and a 155 gallon tank set up for my pets. I treat it more like a hobby room than anything else. I do a lot of reading, studying, crafts, games, and drinking tea in there. The maximum number of people in my house is only 2 people so I like keeping things enclosed and intimate.
I am renovating my house so there are some random things laying around that cannot be in other rooms like the tv. I agree about them being too close together. Until yesterday, I had a different set of chairs there so I placed them where the other chairs were without thinking. I appreciate you pointing it out! Do you have input on rugs? I was leaning towards a maroon oriental rug.
It is Behr's paint. Color ""Vinter""
Ebay, etsy, fb marketplace, antique stores, thrift stores
There is plenty of printable art for sale online.  I‚Äôd put down a round run to
Define the area and distract from the modern floor vs the traditional club chairs
I have a wall full of mirrors in my dining room. Most of them are from thrift stores. I painted all the frames gold. Interspersed with the real mirrors are some I made. You can buy mirror spray paint. I had some photo frames, painted the frames gold, and spray painted the glass using mirror spray. They don't turn out like a real mirror, but they look like an old, sort of antique mirror. Also, I used three different shades of gold on all the frames.

I'd put the round table between the chairs. And, I'd get an older type of lamp shade for the wall lamp. That one is too contemporary.  Have fun!
For small frames you can just print high-resolution pictures you like with a color printer.
Absolutely, they‚Äôre the only kind i personally use. üíïI would probably look for one on the darker side to match the tone of the walls, maybe navy with pink accents? Ik when you shop on some sites (if i remember correctly, rugs.com has antique rugs that i have purchased in the past) they have a really cool feature where you can see the rug in the space using a photo. Then you can see which colors work best.
Pull from the colors of the chairs and lamp, cream background.

Paint the ceiling in the same color as the walls.
I love the colors!  That's where I'm heading with my bedroom and I have two pretty frilly chairs that I'm hoping will take me all the way.  Just haven't really had a chance to work on it too much over the last 5 years or so.  It's plain, and not the maximalist look I'm hoping to achieve some day... but the chairs will really make it...someday.  

All of this is thrifted, including the little piggy bank.  Why yes, I like pink, wines, sage, and gold.. why do you ask?  :D Those pillows didn't stay there... I didn't like them with the chairs.  

Check out the little teapot lamp.  That was a score.

That sounds cool. Do you happen to have a picture of that?
That is such a neat lamp to go with the style you are already establishing. Do you have inspiration you look at?
I don't. I have since redecorated.
Thanks!  That was definitely a find.  It was only 8 bucks at Value Village.  Of course, that was years ago, before they got all extra greedy and proud of their stuff.  

I love to pore over inspo pictures on Pinterest and other sites.  But my main inspo is usually one statement piece or concept and then build from there.  For my bedroom, it was those dusty pink window pane plaid curtains.  I just sort of built from there with the pink and wine theme, with accents of gold and sage.  I'm still looking for ***THE*** bedspread and haven't found one that just speaks to the room.  I'll probably end up having to make one.  I know what I've got in mind, it's just not available for purchase anywhere that I've seen.  
  
You wouldn't know it from my bedroom, but I'm a huge fan of ocean colors.  Teals, greens, blues, purples, etc.  And I love a boho feel.  I'm also a fan of MCM and have a few pieces (repro or original, I'm not sure. ).  

Sorry for the info dump, I get all giddy when I talk home decor or fashion.  I probably missed my calling.  Funny thing, I started out going that direction and then ended up going a totally different (and decidedly NON-girlie) direction in my career.  :D  It's not too unusual in my home state though.  Alaskan girls tend to be rough and tumble when it comes to the wilderness and such, and girlie when they want.  Xtra-tuffs during the work week, ball gown on the weekend for the opera.  Hahahahaha"

Not that mirror. It‚Äôs a little small.
Yes a mirror is great to check yourself before leaving the house, but that mirror looks like a bedroom closer mirror imo.
A mirror would definitely work there, but I‚Äôd put a round or oval one to break up the rectangular shapes.
Where‚Äôs the gorgeous rug from?

Art would be better. You need some color! That mirror is too long and narrow for the space. It is too close to the shape of the doors.

Absolutely.

I‚Äôd look for a wider one, but not super long. Like the height of that one, but at least 1.5x wider.

Squared lower part but with a curved/arched at the top to add interest.

Look at the door heights when you are hanging. Keep it high.
Maybe, if it had an entryway style to it."

Ah, and I don't know how you feel about rugs on carpeting, but they do help delineate 'zones' in a multi-use space.  Your reading lounge/nook area could benefit from an oval or irregular shape rug. The curves of the rug shape might also balance out the angular shapes all over the room (square frames, furniture, bed, etc.).  Careful application of color through rug choice might also elevate everything further.

I think a rug would look nice
Other ideas: 

I'd hate to say this in case that artwork is your original creation, but the scale of it seems a bit overpowering for the size of your room.

A sculpture or classic stone/plaster bust as a center piece on that console could be nice. You don't have a bedroom TV so you need something that draws the eyes to a focal point, which is usually opposite from the bed.

Or you could get a large, clear, faceted cut-crystal glass vase filled with your favorite artificial/real flowers to give the room a boost of color and organic charm.
Plants, a little color on the bedding, that is all.
The bedding feels off because it‚Äôs longer than it is wide. Is it supposed to be rotated 90 degrees? Otherwise try pulling it up towards the pillows and fold over the edge by the pillows for a more finished look. Also put the matching pillows on top, not underneath.
I kind of feel like a rug would bring this room together
I agree with the rug idea. Also maybe some high hung curtains, maybe some cool sconce lighting instead of the lamps.. I feel like everything is really low and top half of the wall on the bed wall is empty. And the lamps seem cluttered on the table. Also agree the dresser may be too small.

It‚Äôs a reallllllyyy nice room.
Nice curtains, rug, plants and I think your dresser is too small? Maybe it‚Äôs the proportions.
A rug! Stat!
The painting is great but the roomneeda balance if you keep it. That could be achieved with very big rug pulling from colors in the painting. Also, please hang the painting where it is.
Either a coloured rug or colourful duvet cover
More plants. ü™¥  Otherwise it's quite soothing and nice.
It‚Äôs nice, maybe a smaller painting in the corner?
a throw or some sort of blanket with an contrasting color folded at the foot of the bed along with some accent pillows. Perhaps a green that matches the colors of your plants.
I think it looks great! If you‚Äôre trying to fill some space I‚Äôd suggest one or two more pillows, an area rug, some wall decor like a few baskets on the wall with the window, or a chest at the foot of the bed
Do another color rug under bed to add dimension
The headboard is just not a good look.  I don't mind a tall bed and bold headboard but this just looks like a board with velvet.  The bed makes the room.  It's the main focus.  Headboards and frames are inexpensive.  Buy something tufted for the room.  Then make the bed with some really beautiful linens. Add a nice bench at the end of the bed.

You should wallpaper behind your bed
I don't normally think of an accent wall, but I feel like this room is BEGGING for the wall behind the bed to become a statement in a bold color, or maybe even wood paneling or wallpaper.


I love the positioning of the art on the other walls. One wall with a single colorful piece, another with a gallery collection, and both having such strong personalities, it seems like the third wall needs to match their energy without making the room ""busy.""¬†


That's why I like the idea of a bold color or textural element to balance it out. I really think this one change would make the room a perfect 10.¬†
I love everything in the corner with the window.  The huge painting and the blue chairs are perfect.  

If your coverlet were similar in color to circle pillows with a circle design, that would carry the corner vibe over to the bed.  

And I like the height of the big painting.  Could you put something above the bed that is at the same height as the top of the painting?
It just doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúpulled together‚Äù.
The problem isn't the bedding, it's everything else. There's no sense of cohesion with the furniture - everything's a different style. It shouldn't all match like a set, but it should coordinate, i.e. same type of wood, same period, etc. Also, the proportions are all off. The headboard is way too big, the desk chair is too large for the desk, the table between the chairs is perhaps a bit too low, and that whole seating area is too close to the dresser, which is too small to anchor the painting. The way things are set up makes this big space seem oddly cramped. Also, the salon-style hang of the other artwork isn't working because some of the pieces are too big for that sort of arrangement, and the frames are too disparate, as well. I'd spread them throughout the room and let them breathe a bit and shine on their own. You may have find new spots in your home for some of them to avoid overhanging in this particular room.
A cat?
 I love the wall art, but feel like it‚Äôs all 2‚Äù too low? If you could shift everything up a bit it might help!
Husband with remote and a beer.
Coloring somewhere the walls or floor
The bedspread is killing the look. It is too long and too narrow.
Nothing
Plants. The answer is always plants.
Handcuffs, definitely handcuffs
Gut feeling was headboard is too tall. Now if it's just because the duvet hits the floor...I don't know. Maybe more/higher pillows. Not a white duvet for optimum interest, imo.

Also, the shelves in the corner are really throwing off the weight of the room...maybe take it down and add a smaller bookcase on each side of the window and throw up a nice coordinating curtain or roman shade. I could go on but I think not enough pattern. Add some and you are good to go.
Walls need color
A rug and s couple of throw pillows on the bed.
 I don‚Äôt like how the painting almost looks like it‚Äôs sitting on top of the console. I would move the chairs under the painting sitting at an angle at each corner and move the console under the window. And definitely get a rug under the bed.
I've always found that adding curtains to a bedroom makes a huge difference and really increases its coziness! It would really fill out that wall there.
A dog
The room needs a dog
Add colour to the bed linens. Some colours that pull from the beautiful art work. And then match the drapes too.
A rug and curtains would ground the space, especially a rug
A book case. And a much more dramatic bedding set.
Box spring. Your mattress is too low for the headboard.
Change paint, rug, curtains, bedding with color, pictures too low above desk.

Oval rug is a verrry interesting idea‚Ä¶this might be It
This actually looks really good. I also love the insane found objects the ai puts on tables.

The painting is just something my kids and I made in the garage‚Äî I‚Äôm not married to it. It is kind of big lol. I have a weird thing about TVs in bedrooms.
OP:

I have a very simple idea. üí° 

You see that small rectangular picture frame directly above the center of your desk?

Switch it out with an oval + gold mirror frame of similar dimensions.

That will add some geometric balance to all the sharp angles on the wall - and in a pinch, your desk can also be used as a vanity. ü™û
You might also consider a 2nd mirror to hang above your center console. Large mirrors give the illusion of a bigger room, and wall hung mirrors take up less space than a floor mirror.

If you have a stud finder, you could even use it to securely mount that floor mirror to the wall in a horizontal orientation.

But I actually recommend a large oval mirror to (again) soften the angularity of the other objects in your bedroom. ü™û 

There are no rules of course, but this is what I would experiment with if I were you.
My reply to this didn't post earlier.  

You might consider mounting the large floor mirror above your center console. It takes up less space in modest spaces, and having a large wall mirror will give the illusion of increased space.

Or better yet, use multiple mirrors. ü™û A tall oval one above that console might further soften the angulairty of all your other bedroom items, and ot would go nicely with some of the items I suggested above. Consider adding an oversized (1kg/2lb+) candle poured in a matte white or textured ceramic vessel to play with textures as well. üïØ 

I figured all this is important since this will be a feminine space.
I agree unless it was hung up and the dresser moved over to the left to be under it
I think 2-3 throw pillows would look nice on the bed to break up the white
Yes to all of this. First things I noticed.

I‚Äôd also say for the large painting, a general rule of thumb is to have them hung ~6 inches over the surface they‚Äôre hanging above. You may have to google check me on that but I think hanging it higher would make it make more sense¬†
I just figured the comforter was on wrong and needed to be turned once clockwise.
You might be right‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve learned nothing from movies.
I agree, i think it's the curtains that are missing.  Everything is down low with nothing really to draw your eye up so it feels a bit unbalanced to me
Yeah the proportions are an issue. This room is bigger than the one we had when we bought the furniture, and the vaulted ceilings make everything look even smaller.
I‚Äôve gone back and forth over curtains + plantation shutters.
I mean a few inches higher
There dresser should be bigger as well

I understand the notion of TVs destroying the restorative ambiance of a bedroom sanctuary. But imo it depends on what you use it for.

We installed a 55 inch Samsung 'The Frame', and ran the cables behind the drywall. Added a Samsung proprietary slim beveled gold picture frame to it for a more polished look that doesn't scream ""I'M A TV, SCREW YOU"". We have a nice Impressionist art screensaver, and it looks really quaint and refined.

And when it's not in Art Mode, we like to have some chill lo-fi, jazz, black screen/rain sounds, or ""sound bath"" playlists playing on YouTube. It's pretty heavenly for us.

I love that painting! The size is fine for the size of the room. Keep it, it's fantastic! And the fact that you did it with your kids? Even better!

I was going to ask you where you got the painting because I love it so much! 

I agree that it's a little overpowering in this room, though. I would just find a bigger space for it.
What a great painting! You must hang it! if not on top of the dresser, maybe to the side of the dresser if you have room on the wall.¬†
Wait, it did post. Apologies lol

Looking for ideas on how to make this nook seem bigger and warmer.

Turn the desk to face the direction of the door.
Can you turn the desk and chair around so that they face forward? That would keep them contained to the area you‚Äôre planning to paint and open up all of that space in front of the fireplace
A rich pumpkin or deep forest green - both will elongate and widen the space while it warms!
What do you do for work? I would first pick a color that affects me in a way that my work benefits. So if a creative,  warm pink, or yellow. But if you need calm I would use a green or a blue. 

You said warm, but what color makes you feel cozy? Do not get too cozy if you need to be highly productive or energetic during your day.

Change the color of the mirror frame to bruched gold or a wood, natural or stained. This will add warmth.

I am totally loving these dark botanical or forestry type wallpapers...they really are so pleasing to my eyes.
Painting it separately, especially a dark colour, will probably make the space feel even more cramped.
Does the chair always block the fireplace like that?
Paint it black, dark green or midnight blue
I wouldn‚Äôt paint it if you want to make it feel roomier. Paint will make it feel more closed in and it will look odd to just have that area painted. I would keep it all one color and reposition the desk.
An autumnal orange or dusty rose
Absolutely, 45¬∞ turn to the left will make a huge difference.
I like that direction. My zoom background will always be gorgeous despite the living room clutter. Another added benefit would be that I will always face the yard outside. Will try this next and share results. Thank you!
Rich pumpkin is very much on my radar. That‚Äôs the color of the couch in the room (not pictured here). Thinking rich pumpkin and light green to bring some outdoors in!
The desk is pulled away from the wall, causing the chair to be in front of the fireplace.
I think she‚Äôs pulled furniture away to ready the walls for paint.
This will look great. Add some brass details, some pics on the side wall and a rug to make it seem like it's its own space. Pls be sure to show us what you do!
Love that! With your sofa it will carry your eye through the room perfectly.
Yes, the table is usually right against the wall. I pulled it forward for prep and cleanup.
Will be back- not so soon though- i have a toddler! can you expand on brass details? I‚Äôm thinking of some shelving and corner light on the right.
The lamp would be pretty in brass. Maybe a pen holder or something on your desk. Even shelf brackets. They don't need to be super ornamental or anything. I just think it would add some shine without being gaudy. Put an interesting box, a plant, and some books(maybe with brass bookends!?!). I like aged brass so it isn't super shiny.
I like this, it‚Äôs a nice warm accent metal, especially the lamp and planter idea!
Thank you!"

My previous apartment had a similar layout, and I had this set up on the wall just past the front door. I would highly recommend using a shoe cabinet
unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any tips, but your little goblin is adorable
I‚Äôd place a coat rack at the end of the rug to mark where the entry ends. Then between the door and the coat rack, I‚Äôd put hooks on the wall for handbags/hats/helmets/backpacks and fill the whole area. Or instead of a coat rack you could put a cat climb-y thing.
I‚Äôm shook that this is considered ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù. My entryway is a hallway just under 3 feet wide.
Some art next to the door on the left above the light switch. A small table or shelf under it for keys.

The long wall has a lot of potential.  Depending on how much space/where it leads, you could do like a super long shelf.

https://preview.redd.it/oi9rxwd6u6qf1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0991b28e6c82685ab91504f503275b8a07a1f428
What about a narrow table to run lengthwise along the rug to help separate your entry and kitchen space? It‚Äôs hard to tell how much space you have but maybe one with a lower shelf thick enough to keep your shoes or a basket for them. Here‚Äôs a real basic example but there are many to meet personal preferences

https://preview.redd.it/qqivs8evw6qf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71fafd7556c71ee1ccdadf54c6cd9ad7ef93e532
Get rid of one bar stool and put something- shelf, cabinet- next to the door. This can be short with art over it or tall. 

On the long wall, leave a 4-5 foot gap and put another piece of furniture- short bookshelf, cabinet or entryway table- with art or a mirror over it. Closer to the door, add hooks for jackets and hats.
https://preview.redd.it/sqtbtlov07qf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ade373fa77c61ab21d7b6a01717d6bbe48cc2fd5

This is my front entrance plant wall. The table is 6‚Äù deep. Plants may not be your thing, but a narrow table would be a good anchor for a piece of art, and you could use it for your keys and mail.
A mirror on the wall to check your hair, and a row of hooks below for bags, coats etc., maybe a narrow floating shelf between the mirror and the hooks. Set it up about 10‚Äù past where the door opens up on the wall.

Edit: to add, I would also stagger some short blocks up the wall like a staircase for that glorious tuxedo
All good suggestions from my fellow redditors. Upvote for kitty.
https://preview.redd.it/o52p0yc1sbqf1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=884065fe3f2d841fc90ed755b3a799dd004d6456

Maybe add something like this in the space between the entrance and the kitchen, to create a seperated ‚Äúhallway‚Äù. Or buy privacy screen/wood slats that use tension to create seperation of space with a shoe cabinet?
[deleted]
I‚Äôm really digging the trend of surprise pet pics lately lol. 
Anyway, do you want it to look ‚Äúhallway‚Äù-ish or just jazzed up a little?       

If the former, may I suggest one of those shoe credenzas? They‚Äôre narrow and the cabinets pull down and you just pop the shoes in! Opposite of said credenza, you could put a narrow bench-coat hanger combo. Add seasonal details to the area and bam! Entrance.     

If the latter, I would opt for a shoe bench against the wall and a nice plant just to the left of the door. 

And, as always, hang some art of your choice :)
There is not much that you can do with that based on the way it is laid out. You need an accent wall opposite of the kitchen and you need artwork. Pop a wreath on the door and you‚Äôre done. There ain‚Äôt much more that you can do.
Thank you for paying the furry tax, that deserves a contribution from me.

I would definitely look for a framed mirror, and a small, extra skinny console table that you can place your car keys (and whatever small items you need to grab) before heading out. Make sure that the console table and mirror are well out of reach or the door and its swing radius.
https://i.imgur.com/3mIZh3q.jpeg
I wouldn't put anything by that wall since the doorway is so close to it, it will clash no matter what. At most it can handle a row of hooks but anything on these hooks will be crossing the path to the door anyway.
  I'd personally get a relatively narrow shelf (up to 40 cm), maybe 1.5 m long in total. Maybe even all the way up to the ceiling so it could work as a proper wardrobe? and place it between the entry area and bar stool area, dividing the dirty (outside) and clean (food) zones better. There seems to be enough space left for the stools to move.
i am learning about all new types of cabinets. thank you!
milo is the love of my life and also the bane of my existence¬†
i like the cat climby think idea just because i don‚Äôt think the area is big enough for a full fledged coat rack. also when you say fill the area with hooks to you mean like not in a straight line? sorry im just trying to visualize it üò≠
narrows probably the wrong word but the fact that the side it swings up on has no extra space before its wall is what really pisses me off like who designed this‚Ä¶

oh you ATE¬†
i‚Äôm so sorry i‚Äôm having a brain not working moment do you mean a shoe credenza and the bench coat combo together? and if so would the credenza be against the wall to the left of the door and the bench coat combo on the right against the wall?¬†
Yea, I‚Äôd probably stagger them on the wall.
You could build one for WAY cheaper than they are sold. Just make sure it‚Äôs well supported against the wall. If you do decide to go that route, DM me and I can help with a building plan
I did. Oh well, you‚Äôve received some good suggestions. Maybe a hanging non poisonous to cats plant üòÖ.

Good idea removing the black table so you‚Äôll be able to center your light fixture properly. I also believe that you should remove two of the chairs so the table will not be so congested in the center. You can bring the extra chairs out when you need them, but there‚Äôs no need for eight chairs at the table unless eight of you sit there daily.
If you like traditional aesthetics, I would add trim all the way around your wall-window things. It looks unfinished otherwise (and maybe go for a slightly elevated look. The trim that's installed is a bit builder-grade.

Okay, here is my idea. Add a rug that matches the color pallet of this room . Add multiple floating shelves with plants( use clear wire to hang) . Add an mini bar along the hall way.
How do you feel about adding placemats on the table? and a candle, certain little changes really make a difference!
Its a beautiful room, yes move light and make it more of a statement right now its too small.  Add aflowers in a vase on table, add color.  Use the colors to add a rug so it gives the room an elegant look.  Remove candle holders by picture put something more unique and smaller.

What a view! Your windows and the view are the wall coverings. You barely have any wall space left. You do not need to junk up the room with ‚Äústuff.‚Äù Let nature do the talking. Not a fan of the paint color. Green is a difficult color to get right. I‚Äôd go for a light beige and let the color come through the landscaping outside the windows. 

The black leather sofas are too bulky and heavy. The eye goes to them when it should go to that massive window. The rug is too gray and dreary. Maybe this is where you add a bit of color. You need a coffee table and end tables where you can put things down. I also don‚Äôt see any table or floor lamps. Overhead lights are the worst. They are simply utilitarian. They do not create any sort of ambience. 

How can you enjoy the view and fireplace when the dining table is there? Have you tried to swap the furniture so the sofas and chairs are on the fireplace/large window end and the dining table is closer to the kitchen? You should also put a rug under the dining table (assuming your children don‚Äôt drop food all over the floor üòú).
YOUR VIEWS! Definitely warm it with rugs! Your space is huge, large carpets will tie all up. And warm throws and pillows on the couch. Large couch by the against the window- or chuck them. Organize the storage unit, preferably move it to another room  replace with a nice console.
So the wall hanging need is we feel we need some coziness? We‚Äôve always been bad at decor and making it feel more homey and were hoping that could help. 

The idea of beige walls hurts‚Ä¶.colored walls make me happy so I am hoping to find a color but it might just be too much of one color to make work. 

We actually started things with the ‚Äúrooms‚Äù swapped. It was really awkward and plus that picture window is scorching in the morning and totally uncomfortable to sit near. That being said we weren‚Äôt able to use the fireplace last year so this will be a this year hurdle as it‚Äôs finally used. The living room end of the room is the pathway from the front door and it also felt awkward walking through the dining room to sit in living room.

I have a similarly sized bathroom (maybe a bit smaller than yours) that also has a shower stall with a glass door. Just this morning I was thinking of removing the shower door and replacing it with a shower curtain. I like how clean and shiny your shower stall looks. You said you re-glazed it and I wonder if you could tell me what that entailed? My shower stall looks exactly like yours and is fiberglass (which is not shiny and is hard to keep clean (hard water). When I hear ""re-glazing"", I think of tile. Is yours fiberglass?
The best decorative feature tuxedo kitty cat. Cuute.
Very nice! I especially like that black and white furry beastie above the toilet. But the wallpaper and color choices are great, too!
The upper wall and ceiling tend to get very humid and have a lot of condensation gather during showers, so bringing the wallpaper down a bit and having heavy-duty waterproof mildew-resistant paint up top was the solution. For the same reason, I didn‚Äôt want too many exposed seams in the wallpaper.  So, that strip of wallpaper is just exactly the width of the roll and I applied it sideways so there are no seams to get moisture inside of. Then, I can protect the edges from moisture with the molding and caulking.
Oh we love pink and green! The bedroom is pink with green accents
I think maybe ‚Äúglaze‚Äù is the wrong term - maybe ‚Äúrefinishing‚Äù? I purchased a kit from Bathworks that you essentially paint on but it ends up having a sort of rubbery epoxy vibe as it dries. I left the remaining ‚Äúpaint‚Äù puddle in the tray overnight to see how it hardened and it got SOLID solid.  Wouldn‚Äôt bend, wouldn‚Äôt crack, wouldn‚Äôt flake. 

I let it the shower cure for about 3 days before running any water, but it says you only need 24 hours really. So far so good, and it realllllllly helped the shower enclosure because it was permanently stained, had some pockmarks, and was that sort of cream/beige color. 

Beware - it smells SO STRONG while painting and curing.

ETA: our stall is also fiberglass, but its original finish was shiny which sounds different than yours. 

Also, the original plan was to take down the shower door, clean the hell out of it, and then get the metal parts powder coated matte black. But, the company that did the powder coating kind of fucked up a couple of the pieces in a way that prevented me from reinstalling it. So, the curtain was more of a ‚Äúhave to‚Äù than ‚Äúwant to‚Äù, but I actually like how it looks!
The beasties are integral to the decor choices
Thanks very much for the information! 

I just took a closer look at mine, and it appears that the fiberglass shower stall was originally shiny, but has been scrubbed to death with cleanser, etc. over the years. I can see the original shine on the part of the fiberglass outside the shower door.

I know removing the shower door is going to leave holes from the screws attaching it -- I'm going to have to put some caulk in those.  I will do further research.

I really like how having the shower curtain makes the room appear more open, especially when you pull it to the side to reveal that sparkling white shower stall.

I think I searched ‚Äúsmall rubber plug for screw holes‚Äù lol which didn‚Äôt give me as many NSFW results as you might think. These were 3/16 size and fit the holes perfectly. I just put a little bit of caulking in and around the hole, stuck those guys in it, and wiped the excess caulking off.
Awesome! Thanks so much!"

Call a professional. They really do know what they are doing. They might not get it perfect but they can really help. 

Good luck
As soon as I started reading this I thought I could never get a nice rug like that because we have cats. Then I got to your cat part. üò¢ Sorry.
Cats seem to always choose the worst places to toss their cookies.
For future reference you dont need an enzyme cleaner for cat puke, trust me I know. I had a puking ninja for 19 years who made it a point of principle to make to my beautiful wool rug every time to regurgitate his kibble. I used to pick up the puke with ordinary cleaning wipes, then use a carpet cleaning spray. Here in UK we have Dr Beckmann, available from any supermarket. Does the job brilliantly, no stains

Contact professional rug cleaners, explain the problem and get some quotes. Odds are they can can help
I have cats that love throwing up on rugs. The best way I've found to deal with it is invest in a quality washer vac.
Rotate the rug so the problem is under the coffee table.
I‚Äôve spent so much money on rugs - but one after another ruined by my pets! I eventually just went with a decent enough indoor/outdoor rug for my dining room (the main area my pets wanted to be gross in lol) and now I can take it outside and hose it off if things go wrong! So sorry about your rug! Could strategically placed furniture help hide the discoloration?!
Next rug: Scotchguard
I‚Äôm so sorry.  If your cat is a frequent barfer, I would recommend having a carpet cleaning machine on hand, like a Bissel Little Green. It is still worth trying to use one.  It helps because it extracts the dirty water, so maybe there‚Äôs still a chance? But hey, you could always rotate it or get some furniture to put over top, right? :)
My life with two cats: only hardwood forever.
My cat peed on our new mattress just after we unboxed it.  I stopped furnishing until pets were done.  My doggie just passed on.  I'm thinking of finally getting a rug.
For future reference- wool rugs are fairly water resistant. Next time just use water and a mild detergent (or no detergent) to clean up. Wool can handle it. Also, you might want to use a stain guard on it for protection as well (just test it in an inconspicuous place first!). I‚Äôve had wool rugs in my home for over 20 years. They are lovely and actually pretty easy to care for. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Maybe a long shot, but try the cleaning sub. Do you have home contents insurance? Idk how it would work in your country but could try that.
Have a friend who has a carpet cleaning business.  He told me kids and cats keep him in business!  Cats will always go for a rug if one is available.
I‚Äôm so sorry. But know that professional rug cleaners can often work miracles. Good luck to you!¬†
I‚Äôm so sorry. I can imagine feeling disappointed and sad! Here‚Äôs hoping for a fix.
Did you happen to buy the rug with a credit card that offers purchase protection (for example, American Express)? If so, you might be able to file a claim for accidental damage. It‚Äôs not a guaranteed win, but it‚Äôs worth a try.
Oh honey. My heart goes out to you. What a disappointing thing to happen. I agree with the others, call a professional on the chance they can save it.
I have pukey cats and wool rugs and use Folex for clean ups.
I‚Äôve gotten up cat puke on mine‚Ä¶ granted those areas are now whiter than the rest of the rug.¬†

Dog puke is def an unsightly mark. I put a jute ottoman poof thing over that spot üòÇ get creative, friend!
I just scrape it up with a metal spatula and then blot for about 10 minutes with fresh towels and then use a wet towel on cat vomit. Other fluids I will use enzyme cleaner, never on wool, but not vomit. 

If it makes you feel any better I have an antique wool rug that I spent $1000 on cleaning it and within the first 4 weeks my elderly cat peed on it. That was/is a nightmare and I‚Äôm going to have to have it removed for professional cleaning again at some point soon when the 20 year old cat is ready to go.
I have a wool rug and 3 cats. I wait for the vomit to dry, scoop up what I can, vacuum over it to get the pieces, and then I use my Little Green machine to spot clean with the pet solution. After I blot with paper towels to dry it as much as I can.
We had this happen, and we fixed it with hydrogen peroxide! If you feel like it's already ruined, it might be worth trying¬†
Op for real it is not worth it to keep trying to fix it yourself! You will make it worse! I did the same thing as you when I was house sitting for someone else and ultimately took it to a professional rug expert. He (very kindly) told me
I should have quit while I was ahead because everything I did made it worse.
He also said most cleaners are just too harsh for wool dyes. 
Good news is the pros were able to get the rug almost good as new for me.
You sure its the cleaner that left the stain and not the cat vomit?¬†


I use shampoo and a brush to clean wool rugs. Also dont have white rugs with cats.
I used Pooph laundry additive to some sheets my cat peed on, with the goal of completely removing any odor that she might smell and encourage her to per on it again, and it BADLY faded and yellowed grey sheets. 

Yes, I followed all the directions.
My cat uses my beautiful wool rigs as scratching pads. I can't stop him. He is taking longer to ruin them than yours, but he is most assuredly ruining them. 

I was so excited to purchase my first wool rugs. Never again. 

I'm sorry for your loss.
Try rubbing alcohol, Dawn dish soap and warm water. Scrub with a toothbrush. Let dry. Then repeat several times.
if it‚Äôs wool then it can be repaired like wool. i‚Äôd find roving in like colors and start needle felting over it.
Get Folex! It's magic! It gets blood out of carpet. It's gets oily eyeliner out of carpet. 

Spray it on liberally and let it sit then dab it with a towel. I'd say do a test area first but if it's already ruined then no loss. 

I'd say contact a dry cleaner but I've had 0 luck with those.
Try oxiclean carpet and rug stain remover! Recommended to me by the person who sold me my wool rug! Has saved my rug through a cat and a toddler!
Not much help for you, but some advice for others. ... I know they are not every one's choice, but if you have pets, true, wool oriental carpets, in actual colors (not the faded, distressed looking ones) are fabulous if you have pets. They are fairly easy to clean, and get smells out of, and if there are stains you cannot get out, they can usually stay hidden, and unnoticed in the patterns.
Honestly? Area rugs and cats are a poor combo.
I‚Äôm sorry about your rug! It‚Äôs not helpful but this reminds me of this episode‚Ä¶

https://share.google/NTY667XhjFyAmWIHK
This is why I don‚Äôt have rugs in the house. With an old dog, a kid and myself it‚Äôs 100% going to get stained
In the future try using Folex. It‚Äôs a clear pink liquid that gets EVERYTHING out. I‚Äôve never had it fail.
It‚Äôs probably not ruined. Enzyme sprays break down the stain but sometimes it will spread out part of the stain - sort of like a water stain can. The spray will get sucked up by the dry part of the carpet and take some residue with it. I‚Äôd recommend you take it to a professional- but honestly if it were my rug I‚Äôd use more spray on the larger area and blot up as much of the colour as you can.
Spot shot removes cat vomit on carpet like none other, I don‚Äôt know about your current situs though.
Hopefully you can hide the stain under a piece of furniture.
My recently purchased living room rug is a pattern and color that blends perfectly with dog puke. On purpose. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but a couple of badly placed barfs can ruin your day for sure. Good luck.
The cat üíØ did that on purpose ü§≠
Take it to the pros and get it cleaned. They can work miracles. 

We raised multiple dogs and cats with our antique Persian wool carpets. Hairballs, pee, poop, vomit, the rugs survived it all. For future reference, you can get a lot of things up with club soda and paper towels. Scoop up the mess, put a towel or two under the rug to protect the floor, then pour a little club soda on the spot. Wait until it stops bubbling, then blot it all up. Keep blotting until it‚Äôs nearly dry. Repeat as needed until the mess is gone.

This was before the advent of enzyme cleaners they sell in pet supply stores. Haven‚Äôt tried the latter.
Please call a professional, get quotes and reviews. I have a wool rug that's about 100 years old. It's sad that this happened, but it's worth investing in professional cleaning.
Do your green machine again with resolve for wool. The key is to use the machine on the back of the carpet too. To get it all out you have to extract from both sides.
The same thing happened to my with a comforter and my cat once. Both are now gone, I wish the cat was still here.
I would be on the phone to the shop saying ‚Äú I‚Äôm so annoyed, just unpacked the rug and there is a big stain on it!‚Äù
That‚Äôs probably the smart thing to do, instead of trying to fix it myself.
This is the way to go, just keep in mind that professional cleaning can be costly. I have a 14x16 hand knotted rug that I paid 2k for about 15 years ago. 10;years in my old dog had an accident in her advanced age and while I‚Äôd did my best to clean it (with water) there was still a pee stain.

5 years after the pee stain I paid 900 for a professional cleaning where they took my rug to another facility. They said they‚Äôd probably be unable to remove the stain - but they did!  The colors in my rug also became more vibrant from removing the accumulated dust. Totally worth  as I did not want to buy another rug and knew I couldn‚Äôt get a rug of that quality for that price again (plus it went with all my decor).

They also told me to only use water on that rug due to the natural vegetable dyes. I use a Woolite carpet cleaner on my tufted wool rug with no issues. It‚Äôs a momeni rug and wears like iron. So depending upon the dyes used you may or may not be able to use carpet cleaner.

Wool is actually one of the most durable indoor rug options you can buy with polypropylene/olefin coming in a close 2nd. Stay away from silk, rayon, or synthetic silk options or blends as they wear faster.
A couple of times a year my dog vomits on the carpet. Which is why I don‚Äôt buy an expensive carpet for the living room. But she does scratch the wood floor and I don‚Äôt know what to do about that, her nails are normal length so we can‚Äôt cut them further‚Ä¶ rip my floor, I guess‚Ä¶
I have kids too but they‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs the cat that stops me from being able to have nice things.
I specifically bought a wool rug that I thought would be okay if a cat vomited on it and I couldn't get the stain out. My plan worked out a little too well because not only do I not see the stains I also don't notice the vomit before I step in it with bare feet.

I feel like my cats specifically choose my carpets. They will be on the hard floor, and then walk over to my carpet to puke üò¢ They also like my bed.
climbed on top of cable box (older ones that were large enough for a cat to sit on) and bleh, cable went out.
She only vomited on the previous rug 3 times in the last 6 years so I thought I‚Äôd get a little longer before she did.
I have tile floors and area rugs. My Chihuahua would actually walk over to the rug when he needed to throw up. ü§¶
Agree the enzyme is mainly for pee odor removal. I had a pukey cat and a wool rug, and Resolve carpet cleaner worked well.
I‚Äôm so scared to try anything on it now
Best I can do is rotate it so it‚Äôs under the shadow from the coffee table when a particular light is on
It‚Äôs just a little off center so rotating it will just make it off center on the other side. She really picked the worst place to do that.
Unfortunately rotating it or putting furniture over it aren‚Äôt options just because of where it is. I have the Bissel Little green and I did use it but it wasn‚Äôt enough.
Lol that would make life easier for sure
I‚Äôm sorry about your doggie.
I highly recommend waterproof mattress covers! I'm so sorry about your dog. My little guy passed away last year, towards the end he was incontinent, the mattress pad was really helpful because he slept on my bed.
I got a big thick wool rug second hand and actually washed it. 

I put it outside on a sheet on a hot day for this. First I tried the spray-and-suck machine thing I rented (also for other rugs) and the rug was very unimpressed. I was frustrated and just dumped a bucket of water on it - which simply vanished. I think it took about 5 10l-buckets of water until it was noticeably wet. We scrubbed it and used the machine to suck a fraction of the water back out, then just left it in the sun draped over the outdoor furniture for a few days until it was dry.

Since then I am much less scared about any dropped glasses of water.
I‚Äôll look into that. I‚Äôm also looking into credit card insurance based on another comment. I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing.
It‚Äôs true! Like, the hard floor was a few feet away, why did she have to pick the rug?!
That‚Äôs an interesting thought. I doubt it but it‚Äôs worth looking into.
Folex is amazing for any stains!
Oh shoot. My cat is also elderly (18) but hasn‚Äôt had any peeing incidents. I hope that doesn‚Äôt start happening for her too. I think I‚Äôd rather deal with cat vomit than cat pee.
This is the way! Most of it comes up if you just let it dry first.
I‚Äôve seen the mentioned in a few places and am tempted to try it but also worried about making it worse!
I think it‚Äôs the cleaner (or possibly the water) because the stain is much larger than where the vomit was. I regret not just leaving tbe vomit stain because it was a lot smaller.
It‚Äôs a woven rug so I am expecting my cat to scratch it at some point but so far she hasn‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs a woven wool rug so I can‚Äôt scrub it at all :(
Interesting‚Ä¶
Wish I could watch but I‚Äôm in Canada and it won‚Äôt let me.
But also don‚Äôt trust internet strangers :)
Unfortunately I tried this last night thinking maybe I just didn‚Äôt get it all out and I made it worse. Time for a professional I think.
I second calling a professional! I spilled a 14oz bright red drink on my white wool rug, and it‚Äôs fine now! I blotted gently to lift what I could, then blotted with cool water and a couple drops of dish soap, rolled it up and brought it directly to the rug shop. They professionally cleaned it and now I‚Äôm not sure where I spilled.
Get Folex carpet cleaner! Got coke out of my mother's pristine white carpets!
You can find Folex at Target!
It‚Äôs annoying that you‚Äôll have to pay someone to clean it in addition to the 1200 but it‚Äôll be worth it!!!!
Confirmed this myself. You could call a reputable service and explain it to them and see about costs
If you do bring it in, consider asking if they can treat it with stain protection while it‚Äôs there. It‚Äôs usually not very expensive, definitely less than a replacement rug.
I actually paid for my wool 8x10 area rug to be professionally cleaned recently, they picked it up, & returned it 3 weeks later for ~$200. It looks brand new! I'd look up local reviews, and get a couple quotes.
That‚Äôs what maintenance of a quality piece or rug looks like. It‚Äôs never just the initial investment, you have to factor upkeep.
I have had many, many cats and a fair few dogs. The approach here is to 100%, get a rug (protect your wood floors! refinishing is a PITA), but make it an interesting blotchy abstract print. Then if your pets vomit and cleaning it stains further... it's part of the design now. Could even use a little matching rit dye like paint if it's super obvious, like a tattoo coverup.

Happy accidents. Less stress.
The cat doesn't stop me from having nice things.... the cat IS my nice thing üòº
I hate when that happens. BTW, I ruined my wool rug - I overwatered some plants and now I have dirt stains that a professional cleaner couldn't remove so I feel your pain : (
I have a cat that loves to snarf and barf, and he never hits the hardwood. Only my beautiful rug. I feel your pain so much. 

I recommend Jackson Galaxy‚Äôs stain remover. It has done wonders for my carpets and furniture.
That‚Äôs a very pretty rug and I can see how it would hide stains. Maybe I should have gone with something with more pattern.
I have a bunch of vintage Karastan because they hide spots well, hold up forever, and I can scrub them with water if I need to. I only have a couple of modern rugs and I have to treat them so much more gently than my beloved vintage orientals!
my dog jumps onto the couch to puke. its just what animals do, we will never understand it.¬†
Yorkies seem to think any spot they want is their toilet and their vomitorium but they seem to favor carpets.

This will sound like a weird suggestion, but are you able to touch up the pattern with the right mix of Prismacolor markers or Jacquard fabric paints? If you‚Äôre artistically inclined, it does work well with busy patterns.

Call a pro shop that does wool rugs and next time: woolite, like for clothes. Also, for new cleaning products on high end products: actually do test inconspicuous areas first.
He has always peed somewhere inappropriate if I got lazy and was a day behind on the daily litter box cleaning or if he was mad about something. He always peed on hardwoods or tile though so I thought I was safe with the rug! 

He was an outdoor tom for years so I consider him a special case. I‚Äôve had lots of geriatric cats and none of the other ones peed outside the box so I wouldn‚Äôt worry.
there are wool felt motifs available as well that could be needle felted over it.  once done the felting is as robust as the base wool. without seeing the rug it‚Äôs hard to suggest more specific
Wouldn‚Äôt that blend in pretty easily?
Be careful with files too! It can be very harsh.
Or Home Depot . They have a spray bottle and gallon .  I know it seems impossible but I used spray n wash on a carpet and it left yellow spots . Later  I used the folex (sprayed it on and use your fingers to work it into the fibers and used a rented spot cleaner machine . It did come out.  Using folex as a first step won‚Äôt hurt it any more . Worth a shot. Then call a professional . If not satisfied . Whether it‚Äôs urine or vomit , I also learned to spray folex on urine , I‚Äôd soray area and use white paper towels and step on them after working folex in and a final spray and I put heavy weight (a large piece of old granite counter top , a piece of wood with heavy metal hand weights on wood . Left it for 24 hours . The spot was drenched in folex and it literally pulled all the urine up into the paper towels. The towels showed more yellow all over them after I did this .
Depends on where you live, I‚Äôm in a relatively HCOL area.

Probably not. It‚Äôs a light colored woven neutral rug.

Folex  I called a friend with wool carpet and they said just call a professional. 
Most ppl opt out of wool if they have pets . So she said call a professional . Do it as quickly as possible . If left weeks it get harder to fix.

Good news is it‚Äôs not attached to the floor so if they need to take it to shop it rolls up

Available in the States from Amazon. There's a pet version too
They‚Äôve got every shade of pale tan you can imagine. And wool takes dye fairly easily. May not be perfect but maybe less noticeable than the current state of affairs.
That's what we use in our home, too. For our carpets at least, we've had no problems.

I don't know much about decorating or style, so is not having the handles or pulls a thing, or was it just a cheap house I bought that they just didn't bother to add them and if I should drill holes in the doors to add them myself?

Home Depot / Lowe‚Äôs has a jig to drill the holes so they are accurate. Worth it if you decide to do it. Easy kitchen upgrade
Cabinet hardware is an excellent way to personalize spaces like kitchens and bathrooms. I agree with u/Seeking_Balance101 \- if the cabinets are painted you might have some problems with the paint chipping.
It has nothing to do with the style or cheapness of the house. It's just builder grade. Pulls are often an upgrade. Mine was built in 2015 and we don't have any, either. This isn't a long term home for us so we've just done without them.
My kitchen cabinets didn't have pulls on them.  After years I added them.  They look great.

I still open the drawers and cabinets by the corners - 15+ years later...
Our 80s kitchen didn‚Äôt have cabinet knobs or handles.  Adding handles (also a paint job) made them feel so much fresher and less dated.
Our complex was built in the mid-90s. Pickled oak cabinets. No handles.   We remodeled and upgraded several years ago and added brushed nickel to the doors and drawers.  We're happy with it.  Keeps fingerprints off the wood for sure.  Best of luck.
Glass ones come in all kinds of fabulous colors!   Check Amazon
It‚Äôs one of the easiest things to do.
We added cabinet handles and knobs YEARS ago. There are plenty of choices.
It became a big thing to have cabinets without handles.  It saved Tracy home buiilders money.  Fast forward 10 years and those cabinets look terrible because the finish in the area you touch is ruined.  We have added handles to cabinets and well worth it.  You will enjoy the look and the function.
It‚Äôs not necessarily a cheapness thing. My parents had fully custom cabinets built in the mid-2000s, and notched doors for use without pulls were more expensive than flat-back doors by a considerable margin, much more than pulls would have cost. 

It‚Äôs a style and function choice. My mom wanted it that way so there was nothing sticking out to bang into.
You can get finger pulls.
I just can't decide if it would look better with handles or not. I'm so used to just pulling them open from the corner the funcitonality I guess doesn't matter really. From a style point of view does it look weird if you saw a cabinet with no handles?
That makes sense. A lot of what was in this house was builder grade, nothing is square, that sort of thing. I guess I'll just have to decide if it's worth it or not to go to the trouble of adding them.  Thanks!
It looks cheap, imho.  Also, if the cabinets are painted, I would worry about the paint chipping.
It depends on the style. A lot of flat front modern cabinets do not have pulls.  It gives it a sleek, uncluttered look. Don‚Äôt put them on just because they are common with other styles. I‚Äôd look on HOUZZ for inspiration photos to decide what style and look you want to go with.
we can‚Äôt tell you whether they‚Äôll look good or not without a picture‚Ä¶you need to post a picture.
Ok, That's what I was looking for. I guess I have to figure out if it's worth the trouble then.  Thanks!"

Absolutely worth it if you can afford it. I have 3 hand-knotted Himalayan wool and silk rugs. I bought them about 25 years ago. They were thousands of $ each (they are large rugs), but they look as good today as the day I bought them. The knotting is super fine and the silk design shimmers in the sun. So beautiful. They were thousands of $ each, but they look as good today as the day I bought them.

I always think handmade art is worth it in these days of factory fast-everything. 

However, what I can contribute is that you should not buy it with the thought that it will hold its value. We had a couple of handmade Persian rugs originally worth upwards of 18 thousand euros in perfect condition and when we inquired about what they would sell for we learned that they lose their value faster than a car. They only regain that value when they‚Äôre super old and still in great condition.
Depends on the rug and your budget availability. My best friend has an amazing oriental red rug in her living room that was her grandmothers . It‚Äôs 100 years old, looks perfect and has stood the test for 3 generations of growing families and pets. Therefore, that rug is 100 percent worth it, but you have to find an authentic wool handmade rug and love it (and afford it).
I‚Äôm a lover of vintage wool rugs and I buy them on Etsy. I only buy hand knotted wool carpets. They wear like iron and they‚Äôre easy to clean (important, since we have a dog). I‚Äôve never spent $5k on a carpet (yet!) but I could probably justify it if I felt the rug was perfect for my room. Having said that, my most recent purchase is an 8x10 that was on sale for $1800, which I feel is a really good price. Some of my friends looked at me like I had two heads when I said that. So yes, a hand knotted wool rug is going to look better, feel better, and wear better than a cheap polyester rug from Wayfair. Only you can decide if $5k is too much for you to spend.
You always get what you pay for. Being in this business has taught me some important lessons. But first, answering your question.

Are they worth it? Yes they are, because

1. Hand knotted, 100% wool rugs will look same as it is today even after 10 years

2. They are easy to clean by certified cleaners and they love working with them

3. These rugs can be repaired and will look same as a new one

4. They do not damage due to water spillage or pet/children accidents. Clean them and as good as new

5. Wool, hand knotted rugs last. To me they are heirloom pieces. Some of my clients have rugs from the last 100 years in the family. 

Why they may sound too much to invest in? 

1. We tend to get bored of stuff and want a new look every now and then. Hence the money may not feel worth while. 

2. Good quality handmade Rugs ask for care. You can't just leave spillages on them. 

So, it is a choice that you have to make. Do you get bored of the look of your home, then don't go for an expensive one. Then you have a choice of going for a tufted rug that will almost look as good but will not last as long. Also, caring for them is difficult and they may get damaged in process. 

But if you like the experience of something wonderful under your feet when experiencing the rug, then hand knotted wool rugs are your go to. You may split your investments accordingly. 

The only suggestion I have is not to buy Polyester or other man made material rugs. They are horrendous and will not work well for even a couple of months, leave aside years.
Many generations of dogs and cats have wiped their lips, scooted their asses, barfed, and had the occasional accident on the wool hand-knotted rugs we got from my mom and dad. They look impeccable. There's only one stain that ever did not come out or blend, and my heart sinks just looking at it right now, but it is fading into the patina. These things wear like iron.

I have a cheap Costco rug under the dining room table where the creatures all go when they come in the house, where most hairballs get coughed up, and where the cat goes to pop his claws. I throw that out every few years and get another one. I know when a battle is lost.

https://preview.redd.it/na0cl65ef6qf1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e510a6c7ec33bdfd0e2154486d4ca8f404486979
I'm not an expert. Just somebody who has a couple of nice handmade rugs that are about 50 years old.

Will a good rug last longer than a cheapy synthetic rug? Yes, not least because it will always look good regardless of how old and worn out it gets. A cheapy rug looks cheap from day 1, and that look doesn't improve with age.

(There are other arguable benefits to a good rug: they just look good, they don't have (as many) toxic chemicals, their manufacturing process pollutes less (might depend on the ecological damage the sheep cause, etc.), they contribute to artisanal production and ways of life, and so on.)

But really, when you are paying for quality, it's often not primarily about durability. It's about beauty and appreciation of fine things and artisanal/small-scale/workshop production. There can be a snobbery and social signalling to this, and there can even be a moral self-righteousness to it, and I find those things off-putting. But those things don't need to be motivating reasons.

There are ethical concerns: should one spend one's money on fine things or use it to benefit others? There's no objectively correct answer to this question, and it's a similar question to whether one should dedicate one's life to making art rather than being a social worker or whatever. 

If you love the rug and will take pleasure from it over the course of your life and can afford it and feel comfortable spending the money on it and you're not snobby or self-righteous or show-offy about it, do it. If you do buy it, you are contributing to the beauty of the world in a small way.
1. Get 100% wool Karastan 717 from Facebook Marketplace  
2. Rent a steam cleaner from a hardware store  
3. Thank me later
I have a bunch of 100% wool rugs. Two were gifts and are 2 decades old. One I bought from Turkey - it was a used rug and was restored/redyed but incredible quality. All of them are holding up very well. In contrast every single other rug I‚Äôve ever bought has been tossed every time I move. 

My only complaint about wool (except cost - although my restored rug was quite affordable around $700 I believe and it‚Äôs HUGE) is the color fades. I think that‚Äôs inevitable with natural fabrics.
I love all of mine.
Yes. I have been collecting tribal rugs for a few years now and I love them so much. They bring warmth and color to all of my rooms. I see some excellent, well priced rugs on marketplace so you might start there? Not a big investment to get your feet wet.
I absolutely love my persian carpets So my answer would be yes, spoil yourself. The oldest one I have is a good 30 years old and worn where it has been walked across, but that makes it even better in my book.
There is a middle ground. I have two 100% factory-made wool rugs: one is 30 years old and the other is about 15, and both are in great condition. They each cost around $1,000 at time of purchase; you can find similar quality for about $2k now.
Not if you own cats...
Not worth it for me because I have dogs. If I didn't have dogs I would %100 buy that rug.
 I spend in the $500 range and they last years. 

1. Cost doesn‚Äôt always mean better quality. Check your reviews and manufacturer

2. Some wool sheds.
Which one are you more willing to toss away if it gets a stain? 
Quality keeps for longer.
Yes. We think so.
There is machine made wool rugs as well which are cheaper than handmade but the same benefits of wool. What you describe of your experience with polyester rugs is very accurate IMO. I got a machine made 80% wool rug made by Oriental weavers and every time I look at it I thank myself. It needs little maintenance and still looks brand new. The $400 I spent on polyester rugs before was probably the worst mistake of my home decor. The machine wool rug was $800 for an 8x10 size.
With a handmade wool rug you are also paying for the ‚Äúart‚Äù aspect of the rug and TBH I am not quite there yet.
I would LOVE a great quality hand knotted wool rug.  But we will invariably spill coffee on it walking across the living room with a full cup.
I bought a braided wool rug from a local manufacturer 6 years ago and it still looks good. I expect to have it for years, even with cats. Thorndike Mills facility was located in my town and closed down in 2019. I bought the large braided rug from their closeout sale for about $600. My husband and I live modestly so that‚Äôs a big purchase for me. I know braided rugs are considered old fashioned but I like mine.
Make sure they‚Äôre not the product of child labor.
Not if you have aging pets
Sounds like very few people regret buying an expensive AF rug... :p
Honestly no. I bought a more expensive rug that‚Äôs a machine washable rug. That‚Äôs what I recommend spending money on instead of one that requires any fancy cleaning or maintenance or anything. I got mine from ruggable.
If you have the discretionary income to afford it and it makes you happy, then why not? I'd give pause if you have young children, or pets as it may be harder to maintain it looking its best.
Yes; I won‚Äôt buy anything but wool.

$5k is pretty steep.
Yes, unless you have dogs.
If you have pets, no.¬†
We have three hand-knotted rugs from Turkey, one of which is a large, intricate piece in the center of our living room. We have a dog and a toddler scrambling on it constantly and it still looks as good as the day we bought it years ago. It‚Äôs the heart of our home and my favorite possession. I always joke with my wife that it‚Äôs the only physical item I‚Äôd save in the event of a fire. We will own it forever.
Reverse image search it? Also check Etsy! I have a few different rugs from Etsy, all hand knotted wool! I have an Etsy knockoff of a 6k rug for 1k (custom size 10x10). It gets a million compliments for everyone that comes to my house!
Yes. It‚Äôs a piece of art and taken care of will last your whole life and then some. I have 5 Persian rugs and they are stunning.
yes they are worth it BUT factor in your family, do you have children, pets? then you might want to reconsider because area rugs like this need to be professionally cleaned and that is expensive
Absolutely worth it depending on your environment. If you have pets and high traffic areas with kids I wouldn't sink the money into it
One thing to consider is that i heard wool rugs can attract bugs (moths and carpet beetles?) and I‚Äôm a coward who can‚Äôt deal with that lol
Carpet stores also carry remnants of carpet. The remnants are leftover from installing at someone else‚Äôs home.   The carpet store can bind the edges for you.  

I bought a super high quality remnant by poking my finger into the pile of each remnant.   I bought the one where there were so many dense fibers that my finger could not reach the backing.
I‚Äôd say depends on your lifestyle. I have 3 pets and a young child so I wouldn‚Äôt personally go for the pricey rug at this time in my life bc I know it‚Äôs going to get trashed
It is if you pay to have it professionally cleaned.  That means sending it out to a professional.
Yes!

as long as u dont have cats
If I spent time hand knotting a rug, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd charge
I love my 2 expensive wool pile rugs but the budget is totally up to your income. So I wouldn't spend $5k but I've spent about $2k before. 

I personally like to sit and lay on the one in my living room so I get a lot of value out of a nicer feel to the touch. Quality ones (with the exception of incredibly antique ones that are falling apart) don't shed horribly like cheap rugs. And they don't curl up or develop random wrinkles in the middle because they're much heavier than cheap rugs. I also find the pattern being made of actual different colored stands much more beautiful than cheap rugs where the design is printed on top. And no gross plastic off gasing smells.
After 5 or 6 years of buying cheap rug after cheap rug, I'm definitely going to say yes it's worth it to buy an expensive rug. The cheap ones just start curling at the edges, they start pilling, they look worn and raggedy. Not a fan
My take as a 58 year old woman who has almost exclusively lived in old homes with hardwood: If you have the money and find the right rug you will never regret it, and probably have it for a very long time. You have to figure some things out, like ensuring it‚Äôs the correct size for the area, and that the  color, weave and material will withstand the traffic that particular area will receive. But then it can be lovely. In this house I have a very expensive rug that I bought on a bit of a whim (not I do not take my own advice) and it has held up beautifully! It is a nice thick wool in medium colors, practically at the front door so it gets its share of wet and dirty shoes. But it is still as beautiful as the day I got it pre-pandemic. My front room rug is a short woven cotton loop from HomeGoods (did I even explain that right?) it‚Äôs maybe 10‚Äù x 12‚Äù, paid about $250, originally sold for $500. It‚Äôs pretty, matches the house great, but is also already worn. You can tell that THIS is the rug that won‚Äôt last our lifetimes. If you‚Äôve got it, I say go for it.
Yes go for it! I have three 100% wool rugs, vegetable dyed, made in Turkey. Mine are two 8x10 feet and a runner, all classic predominately burgundy patterns, so quite dark and busy. They have lasted more than 12 years now and are still vibrant and beautiful despite being repeatedly puked and pooped on by dogs, professionally cleaned and carpet shampooed with a Bissell. You would never know to look at them, they're still vibrant, thick, flat and comfortable. They cost $2500 total from a Persian carpet store, which was very expensive for us at the time, but we needed rugs for our dog, he couldn't walk on bare floors. I assured my husband they were an investment and we'd have them forever and I've been right so far. We've used them in every home we've had. On another note, I also have a thinner woven 6x8 foot Persian rug, also wool and vegetable dyed, more of a block Navajo looking pattern, pinks and browns. I bought it 26 years ago in Tokyo for my mom for $500 and I still have it to this day in my guest room.
It's always worth it to have nice things that we fall in love with AND can afford.
I inherited two rugs from my parents. One is a wool Karastan rug my parents bought new and must be about 60 years old. The other was purchased by my parents at an estate sale. A rug seller and told me it was made in China to a French art deco pattern,  so maybe in the 1930's or even earlier. It is getting warn in a few spots on the edges. We have other rugs we have purchased new, some of which are on the walls.

Value depends on quality of material and workmanship, size, and how much  you love it. It can be an investment for years of future use and enjoyment,  for generations.  But as art, values always rise and fall, so I would not think of it as an investment in terms of resale 

Wether it's worth
Yes! Absolutely. I so appreciate artistic work and quality items. I‚Äôm currently rug shopping but have decided against this due to having 4 dogs in the house at this time in my life. Maybe later for me. Good luck to you! üòÄ
My current living room rug was literally 50 times the price of my previous Wayfair one. I love them both. I doubt anyone would be able to identify them as wildly different in price and quality. I don‚Äôt know if one is more durable than the other‚Äînever had an issue with either. But one is a work of art and wholly unique.
If you don‚Äôt have pets or children go for it. I have a strict nothing over 200 dollar policy due to having 2 dogs. I have a senior dog who loves to eat mushrooms outside üòÖ
We go through about 2 rugs a year.
Yes!
With proper care, handmade rugs can last a lifetime. When I got married over 55 years ago, an elderly friend of the family gave me a 10"" by 13"" Iranian Herat that had belonged to her mother. I have had in on the floor of every place I have lived.  It hasn't worn appreciably since I have had it, and by now it is probably over 100 years old.
I bought a 9x15 wool rug from someone's vacation home so vacation it was like new for 380 bucks. Best rug everrrrrr
What everyone else said about wearing, durability, craftsmanship.  . . .and my philosophy when it comes to home purchases is ""buy once, cry once."" Spend the money now on something you love, and that will last, and you should never again have to question what to buy to put on the living room floor.
Don‚Äôt do it if you own cats who like to pick! My cats can pick on polyester rugs and it doesn‚Äôt show. I‚Äôve had some for over ten years. The little pills show all over wool rugs and i have to get rid of them. I also don‚Äôt wear shoes inside so my rugs last a long time even if they aren‚Äôt handmade/wool.
Yes yes yes always yes! If 5k seems like too much to spend, shop around. You could find a high quality wool rug for closer to 3 and could get lucky and find one for less, if someone is trying to get rid of it. They‚Äôre heavy to move so sometimes if people are moving, they don‚Äôt even care about making their money back when selling.
Absolutely yes.
Yes. I have had dogs and cats with our antique wool Persian rugs and with our 40-year-old wool rug. The pets have contributed poop, hairballs, pee, and vomit (but not clawing, thankfully); the humans have contributed decades, even centuries worth of wear. 

If they‚Äôre well made and you take care of them, they will outlast you and look great doing it.

That said, our Home Depot polyester oriental rug had also survived pet abuse for more than 20 years and still looks great, too. Busy patterns help. 

If you have a pet that likes to chew or claw carpet, there are sprays you can use for furniture and rugs that will repel them. We used it on our upholstered furniture regularly, and the cats learned quite quickly to leave it alone.
Did you know that if you found carpet you liked, you can have the edges bound and have a big rug for a fraction of the price?
High-quality wool rugs really do last decades if cared for‚Äîway more durable than poly‚Äîbut it depends if you see it as an investment piece or just decor.
Unless you have lots of extra money there is no way you need a rug that expensive. I‚Äôm not saying the time or materials aren‚Äôt luxurious and wor the money but no you do not need a rug that expensive. There are plenty of beautiful second hand rugs on Facebook marketplace around $500  or less that are huge and unique.
Because I can only post one photo per comment, here is a photo of the back showing how fine the knotting is.

stunning
It‚Äôs gorgeous! A work of art! I bet you have a beautiful home!
How do you clean them?
Gorgeous!
Jellyyyyyyyy, silk rug is goals!
we had a rug vendor come in with their custom rugs, and I made the mistake of touching their custom-design silk rug. So smooooth. They told me how much one goes for ($$$$) and then showed me the commercial but still high-end wool version and it felt so rough after that silky, shiny, glossy piece.
See, I totally agree with you. Our house is full of a ton of art, why not make the living room floor part of the exhibit!
This is also great news if you want the rugs but don't want to pay that much- they are cheap on the used market!¬†
This is exactly it. I've bought cheap rugs but they wear out in 2-3 years and then you have to find another one that ties the room together.
When you consider that a cheaply made rug that size is going to be in the ballpark of $500 anyway and going to wear out in a handful of years, it makes the $1800 look damn pretty reasonable on the economics alone - nevermind the environmental impact of the cheaper option.
I agree, $1800 is a fantastic price for a handmade wool rug! Where did you find yours?
Any sellers you recommend on Etsy? A lot of it looks like mass-produced printed crap.
I love this, thanks for your perspective.
How do you get them to barf on only one rug? My husband's little shitten does a barf tour of the rugs before ending up on a bed.¬†
I hear that. Definitely not trying to show off anything more than a beautiful design.
One of my dogs likes to flip the rugs around to hide his toys, so I strictly buy cheap rugs üòÇ Would LOVE a beautiful expensive rug but not as much as I love my psychos!!
This is where I‚Äôm at as well. When it‚Äôs raining, one of our dogs will NOT go outside to pee ‚Ä¶ so if we don‚Äôt catch her in time, there‚Äôs a chance she‚Äôs going inside. Washable rugs have been our go to
Adds to the patina. Get dark ones.
Or young pets or young kids
I'm f-ed.
Oooooo, maybe Etsy would be a great spot to look, I've seen some slightly-less-expensive options there in my scavenger hunt. I have reversed image searched all the gorgeous, expensive, rugs I covet, but haven't found many dupes close enough to convince me to buy.
...............I need to do more research on this!!!
Yep. I live in an area with moths and I had to eventually give up on wool furnishings because it‚Äôs a losing battle.
I unfortunately get carpet beetles when seasons dramatically change but Nyguard spray works really well and it's pet and people safe after it dries. I just apply once or twice a year and only catch a couple beetles per year with no damage that i can see.
I guess I'll have to download FB again for marketplace access!
Gorgeous!! üòç
Thank you
Thank you. I am always trying to improve.
I have never cleaned them. ü•¥ I just vacuum weekly. They don‚Äôt look dirty at all‚Äîand 2 are in heavy traffic areas. We don‚Äôt wear shoes in the house. The only pet we have is a macaw and he knows not to poop on the rugs. He‚Äôs pretty much toilet trained. üòú  My husband is trained not to drink red wine or eat chocolate on the rugs. ü§£The day they start to look dirty I will take them to a professional rug cleaner.
Is this your rug??

Totally! And from a design perspective, I‚Äôd much rather have a vintage carpet that is essentially one of a kind, rather than a mass produced carpet, even if it is a high quality one. As I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve really developed a love for incorporating vintage pieces in my home. They add tremendous character and interest
Check Facebook marketplace!! I have two insanely beautiful rugs I got off fb marketplace for fractions of their price from independent rug stores.

This was $400, I still message the women who sold it for her grandmother who has memories of it at Christmas time from her childhood (:
I just filter by vintage wool, because I have zero interest in mass produced, faux vintage polyester carpets! I linked a new seller I like in one of my other posts here.
I have that same problem so my dogs are trained to use a washable pee pad near the door if the weather is bad.
Or old people
What kind of rug is it? Just imagine how cushy, it will be under your feet, ha!

Had a similar experience lately,  picked up a rug second hand, on a whim. Got it home, and realized it was hand knotted, wool, gorgeous, and felt amazing under feet.

Now our bedroom rug, feels very thin in comparison but the cost to find something similar is like $2K I think.....
Some Etsy sellers will do custom rugs if you show them your inspo!!
Thanks!üôè
I‚Äôve found if you train both pets and husbands things tend to stay cleaner much longer lol
I absolutely LOVE the way you live!!
Absolutely!!! ü§£ It is a lovely rug.
It's a mamluk rug, they are spectacular I just found out.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh no way!!! I'll see what I can find.
Good luck!!!"

I would leave the cabinets, especially if they are in good shape. Add hardware, new counters and backsplash.
Save up for new counters and backsplash. A new sink and faucet would help too. 

I wouldn‚Äôt paint the cabinets.
The cabinets aren't that bad. But that brown speckled countertop and backsplash needs to be changed! 

Do you want to keep the same configuration? No changing or adding appliances? 

 I would say get some counter top samples and lay them out to see how the sunlight changes throughout the day. 

Enjoy your new home!
Get rid of the backsplash and counters
The cabinets are good quality and they'll look like crap in a couple years if you paint them. I would get rid of the 4"" splash and the full splash at the sink and stove. Find a tile that pulls from the peachy tones of the counter, install vertically for MCM look. MCM Pulls. And you need much better lighting.

I don't get people hating on the countertops. like its not the best but its GRANITE!! I do worry that a backsplash might make it bit busy but honestly a bit of paint on the walls (maybe a darkish brown?) and some new hardware on those cabinets and the right decor I could see it really coming together! Godspeed!
Update counters, add under cabinet lighting, and update hardware. Add a pendant lamp over sink.
I think it's a waste to replace perfectly good stone countertop. I would recommend going with a nice new backsplash and hardware. 

https://cdn.homedit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Baltic-Brown-Granite.jpg

This is my favorite look with brown granite. Wouldn't build it from nothing but I would be happy enough with this.
Everyone says paint the cabinets, but older wooden cabinets like that are üíã. I‚Äôd never paint wooden cabinets.
I have no issue with the counters, but you need a backsplash instead of bare wall. Choose wisely. If the cabinets are not beat up (hard to tell from your photos), I would add hardware to the doors. If they are beat up, I would have them professionally refinished or painted. You can also buy new door fronts if you are happy with the boxes.
If possible, lightly sand the cabinets and do a matte finish. The shine is dating them more than the actual cabinets. Matte black handles. The counters and backsplash are terrible (sorry).  I‚Äôd put the budget there. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be a ton of countertop, so you might be able to get away with remnants at a stone shop. I‚Äôd go creamy white with the counters. Then you can do a sage green  or slate blue backsplash. Backslashes can be pretty diy friendly if you are a little handy.
I agree with the other posters, please do not paint those cabinets! I think updating the countertop and sink could be huge. Then add some more modern hardware, a major update. Once you paint those cabinets, there's no going back so I would not risk it. We are seeing a return to wood as an accent and as built-ins so I expect to see wood kitchens have a huge comeback. I have the same golden oak cabinets and we are going to stain them darker. After seeing the quality of ready-made cabinets and the cost to replace them with real wood, we realized our 1989 kitchen is solid and could go another 20 years with a fresh stain.

We are twins! üëØ
Cheapest : add lighting under cabinets and replace the backsplash only. 

More cost : replace the countertops.
Add some hardware, paint and replace the backsplash.
I second replacing counters, with an off white/white stone or quartz. Big box store may sell these for less cost, installed, than you think. At least check before you decide against it. New counters would entirely update your kitchen. The cabinets aren‚Äôt bad at all.
Try bright under cabinet lighting and some nice hardware. To brighten up the area. But live in it for a couple years before you change anything permanent because you don‚Äôt know the space well enough.
I‚Äôm assuming you won‚Äôt be replacing the counters and cabinets right now. So I would focus on leaning into the brown in the way you style this. Warm, earthy vibes. Paint the walls a color that blends with the backsplash so that their contrast with the stove and sink areas doesn‚Äôt look so stark. Update hardware with oil-rubbed bronze, going with straight lines for a more contemporary feel. Rustic pottery and baskets for decor, natural fibers like cotton and linen for tea towels and table settings, add texture where you can.
I have essentially the same kitchen. It's a major job but we are presently painting them in BM Creamy. And tearing out everything above the stove to put a vent hood in. Use Stix primer (degrease and sand first) and use BM Advance paint. It's a pain to use because you have to keep going after drips for 30 minutes, they keep happening. But dries to an amazingly hard finish.

It's a huge amount of work, 2 coats primer and two coats of paint. But the transformation is worth it. Your granite will look fine with Creamy or Swiss Coffee or cafe frappe, just not white. We did our walls in SW Steamed Milk because our home has a lot of 90's oak and it was the only off white that complimented it. With blue ceilings, and I know, you're going ""what!?"" But it's a color by BM called Patriotic White. In dim light it's a really pale blue and in bright light it looks white. It makes the rooms feel amazing.

Edit We are leaving the interior of the cupboards natural wood and we routed all of the upper doors out to put in glass for a lighter look. We did this in our last house with reeded glass and it looked great but that was a mid century modern and this house is 90's faux craftsmen so we haven't chosen glass yet. We did the bottom cupboards first for less mess. We are remodeling a lower cabinet to put in a drawer microwave. I burned myself badly on that above stove mw. It's a poor vent hood and a bad mw design.
I second replacing counters, with an off white/white stone or quartz. Big box store may sell these for less cost, installed, than you think. At least check before you decide against it. New counters would entirely update your kitchen. The cabinets aren‚Äôt bad at all.
I agree with keeping the cabinetry.  Give it a good cleaning and it will be gorgeous.  Changing out the countertops doesn't have to cost a fortune, either.  Some of the new laminates are virtually indestructible,  maintenance-free, resemble granite or quartz very closely,  and come in a stunning array of colors and styles.  I researched my countertops endlessly and finally decided that laminate was absolutely the way to go.  My kitchen is very hard-working, and there have been times when I've had to set pots on the counter right off the stove, and I've caught others *chopping directly on the laminate (!!).* Not a mark on it, these 20 years later.
I'd be more concerned with why you need four cans of Raid.
What other colors are you using in the home?  What does your flooring look like?
So I moved into a place that had this exact kitchen about two years ago. Everyone said don't paint the cabinets but I did it anyways to enjoy my kitchen while I save up to reno it properly. The wood is competing with the countertop. I painted my cabinets jet black, and the kitchen always looks so much better just not having so much brown everywhere.
You're missing critical lighting under the cabinets
I would prioritize based on budget:

\-Replace counter, I would go for a neutral white corian

\-Add subway tile backsplash, maybe a light jade green color [https://www.homedepot.com/p/MOLOVO-Kezma-Jade-Green-2-95-in-X-11-81-in-Polished-Ceramic-Subway-Wall-Tile-6-35-sq-ft-Case-KE-JAS/326170479](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MOLOVO-Kezma-Jade-Green-2-95-in-X-11-81-in-Polished-Ceramic-Subway-Wall-Tile-6-35-sq-ft-Case-KE-JAS/326170479)

\-Paint the room a creamy neutral white

\-Add new hardware to cabinets

\-Refinish the cabinets to a less orange shade of wood, more a light oak shade.
Paint cabinets, put modern hardware on the doors. Cover the counters with contact paper.
Are those real granite counters? Either way I‚Äôd take those out and replace with something lighter. I‚Äôd sand and re-stain the cabinets to a lighter color (it‚Äôs a lot of work but hey you save a lot of money). THEN, I‚Äôd change the backsplash to match the counter and cabinets. Okay actually, sand and restain the cabinets FIRST and then change the counters to match the cabinets, and then the backsplash. My pet peeve is when people choose the backsplash (because it‚Äôs the quickest part) and then it doesn‚Äôt truly go with anything.
Cram or white counter and backsplash would lighten it up and make it look fresh without having to paint the cabinets.

Keep the backsplash and the countertop the same material and pattern so it looks easy on the eyes and cohesive.

I have chocolate cabinets and a creamy white colored quartz counter and backsplash and it makes a huge difference. Bright and fresh.

It's the counters that are making the space dark. Focus your efforts there first.
How inexpensive? Are you looking to replace things, or perhaps adjust them?

You could try peel and stick tiles to see how you feel about a tiled back splash, and contact paper to try out different textures/colors on the countertop before you decide to go full renovation

Also some paint, and some new hardware and well placed under cabinet lighting can go a long way!
Paint those cabinets and replace the counters.
As others have said, replacing the countertop to something lighter will really improve the space. Also, are microwaves over gas stoves up to code where you live? They're not where I am because they do not do an adequate job of venting. I would also look into switching that out for a proper vent.
[deleted]
Countertop & hardware has been mentioned above. Not sure how feasible it is, but a more matte finish on the wood cabinetry would make a big difference.
So everyone is saying redo the counters but that‚Äôs not really budget or diy friendly. One option is to paint the cabinets. If you like mcm you could do a fun color like light or teal blue or rust, or you could do a more traditional black or white. Then you could do butcher block countertops, which are pretty affordable and very diy friendly to install if you‚Äôre ok with cutting wood (I also like butcher block because they can be refinished super easily so if they get scratched or scuffed you can fix that in like an hour). These changes plus maybe a fun wallpaper? I think a white with lemons could be a fun retro vibe. All of that is diy-able and shouldn‚Äôt break the bank. And if you wanna go with new countertops in a few years, you can easily swap it out then.
Paint and hardware pulls. And if you have extra money new countertops with a stone backsplash
Under cabinet lighting. Also add a small ambient lamp in the corner. Soft light will erase a lot of outdated kitchen woes! Give yourself a year to decide what you want, what works and doesn‚Äôt, etc.
Depending on your budget, you could replace the countertops, install a pretty backsplash, and look into getting the upper cabinet doors replaced with a different trim profile (the curved detail at the top is what is dating them, but I actually think the wood is pretty and wouldn‚Äôt paint them). New countertops alone would do a world of good though!
Is that real granite?  If so, there's much you can do with paint on cabinets and walls.  It looks a bit like Formica.  For a mid century look, that can be replaced cheaply and look cool!  I include a link to a fun laminate countertop.  Which can be done inexpensively, relatively.
At least remove those backsplash. I think it'll make everything a lot better. I'd say stain the cabinet darker would be good so the kitchen will look a lot less yellow.¬†
I had cabinets like this in my condo. My realtor recommended painting them which we did.

If you wanna paint them, paint them, but do the prep and clean them and lightly sand first. Change the knobs and you're good to go.
Paint the cabinets white and add new hardware
Remove the bench top, install a stone bench top and tiled splashback. The timber cabinets can be sanded back and stained to something less orange and more blonde. New hardware, fresh coat of paint to surrounding walls.
From someone who had an entire kitchen  remodeled: first invest in interior organization for cupboards and drawers. Next, undercabinate and overhead lighting because you will never love a kitchen that's hard to work in.
You can totally make that kitchen feel fresh again without a full gut job: paint your cabinets and walls a light tone (lighter shades like white, cream, soft pastel), swap in brighter lighting , and replace or update the backsplash with something reflective. Even just changing hardware and decluttering makes a big difference.
Move the Raid cans, they can leave rings on stone.
Check out this amazing kitchen Reno for $700. Lots of great ideas. https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/s/uMMRLYsy7Z
It's not that bad.  Can you put in a backsplash that coordinates closely with the granite?  That expanse of wall makes it look unfinished.
I'd put in a backsplash.   Otherwise, I think it's fine -- I see nothing wrong with this kitchen and don't see it as ""outdated.""  It's natural wood and stone, which don't go ""out of style.""  I'm fairly certain I could go to any kitchen store and buy those cabinets and that countertop today.   

I get that it's not to your taste or what you'd pick, but it's certainly livable.
Wild for you to paint one wall black. Amber accents with the black.
Those are nice, granite counters and I would keep them.   I would remove the backsplash, and tile the area with a color from the counter, then and lightly sand and stain the wood a less orange tone.  New pulls,sink and faucet.
I think these cabinets look solid and in good shape from here! And never get rid of stone if you don‚Äôt have too! The all white kitchen is OUT. 
Earth tones and wood is in!
Get one of those ‚Äúlive love laugh‚Äù wall art things!
Hello, I think that painting the cabinets is a very good idea, in fact you can only paint the lower ones with a lead gray or petrol blue and sand the upper ones so that they are lighter and put a matte varnish on them, I have seen that the countertop is put a good quality adhesive and they look very good, one that imitates quartz seems to me that would look very good
Get copper tiles (real or stick on)  for the white area below top cabinets

Definitely this! Wood cabinets are back around now, but the granite should be replaced.¬†
This is the correct answer! The counter top is what makes it look bad
Painted cabinets can look great and last for many more years if prepped and painted properly. All it takes is reading up on the topic to determine the best approach, then a lot of manual work. I have these exact cabinets and painted them. Ten years later and they're holding strong. I also replaced the countertop and added a backsplash. Doing it myself saved me a ton of money and significantly  updated my kitchen.
It's laminate,  not granite. I'd replace it.
This is a great Inspo pic OP!
That is ‚ÄúBaltic brown‚Äù granite with absolute certainty.
Counters are expensive! Definitely not budget friendly.
https://www.designshop.com/sample/300075381-100053776/formica-bottle-glass-quartz-solid-surface-countertop?brand=Formica
Pretty sure that‚Äôs not real granite
They‚Äôre also very easy to improve cosmetically with stain/paint on a budget, if you don‚Äôt mind doing a ton of sanding.  Counters are not so easily cosmetically altered, unless you like the resin coating kits.
I don't care for the counters, either, but I think anything you could do to them would make them worse.    If OP is going to eventually change the kitchen anyway, I'd just live with them until that can be done.
Sure, if you do everything right. But most people don‚Äôt do the prep and get the right materials and it all starts to peel and chip after a couple years. In which case it‚Äôs better to just upgrade the backsplash and pulls.
Exactly. I painted the cabinets in my old house black (they had been off-white, so big difference), and they held up beautifully the entire nine years we lived there. When we sold that house, I didn‚Äôt have to touch the kitchen at all. Yes, it took a lot of time and effort, but it was worth it.
No, that's granite, specifically Baltic Brown.
I mean replacing it is gonna be $$$ and as someone who just moved from an apartment where the countertop was CORK (**horrible** idea. Believe it or not cork does not do great wet lol) I think the laminate is workable for the time being! 

But also if its just laminate and they're planning on replacing the whole thing eventually then perhaps . . .  contact paper?
how can you tell its granite and not laminate?
Whatever it is, rust happens.
True."

Personally I think red brick is peak fireplace colour, and you can have so much fun making it a cozy space. But it depends on your personal taste. Pick a vibe for the room and then pick a colour
As someone who has a painted fireplace‚Ä¶don‚Äôt paint it.
My suggestion is to pick a color scheme and furnish the room first. Then you will know what color scheme you are working with and what you want the focal point to be.
No matter the color, use a matte or eggshell finish on the brick ‚Äî high gloss tends to make brick look plastic. A washable matte is usually best.
I would leave it and paint the walls anything other than this weird grey
Paint the walls instead!
Paint it black ü§òüèª
Muted pastel or earthy greens. Sage green especially is big lately, warms up a space without being too loud. Orrr you can go for matte black or charcoal gray, gives drama, anchors the fireplace!
Don‚Äôt
Maybe wallpaper the fireplace wall, and paint the others?
Paint the wall, not the fireplace.
It‚Äôs not that hard to remove the surround and replace.  My partner did ours himself - we had a massive pink and brown granite fireplace which completely dominated the room, and we replaced it with a wood and Carrara Marble surround that he made himself.

That‚Äôs really a nice room to start‚Äîgreat wood floors, fireplace center and all that. And I love White Dove.

Honestly, the fireplace color would depend on the rest of your decor, but white (or White Dove) never seems to be a bad choice.¬†
Don't. Please.
Leave the fireplace alone. Paint the entire wall around the fireplace a red brick.
White
Never paint the fireplace, we‚Äôve established this as law üò≠it‚Äôs a war crime, much like carpeting over beautiful wood floors
I‚Äôd go with a nice neutral dark brown that has hints of gray in it. It‚Äôll go with everything
Sounds like a must to you.  This color from DeVol kitchen would do well, plus not show soot terribly, or soot wouldn't look bad on it,  if that's a real wood burner.
Nothing
Can you show up a close-up of the brick? Because nothing about this looks ""Stop sign red"" or ""glossy"" or ""possibly grey brick""? You have grey *mortar....* 

Are you sure the brick isn't just clear coated....?

I would do a super dark grey matte.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs not natural brick red - the photos are deceiving - it‚Äôs painted brick red but shiny like a stop sign.  Hard to tell in a photo
Unfortunately, somebody already painted it red. But in person, it looks like a stop sign.
I think that‚Äôs the case because the paint is glossy up close that looks like a stop sign

Then I would still go red but with better paint, less shiny and bright, more subdued
For the times, yes, it‚Äôs outdated.
This looks nice and is a big improvement, but it looks like you started with natural brick so there is variation in color. OP is starting with painted red bricks that have no variation in color. I wonder if it would work if she first painted the bricks slightly different colors and then whitewashed it. ü§î This is an art project of sorts.
It was natural brick, I tried 3 different colour combinations with the white wash, think I did 1 white a cream and a light grey and painted all the bricks a different colour with that combo. But yes I see what you mean, it might be a bit harder with it already painted red"

At this point the normal LLMs do this pretty well. (ChatGPT, Gemini)

1. Upload the pic and tell it that this is the baseline for a renovation, tell it you will give instructions 
2. Tell it what to keep 
3. Tell it the style
They cap how many you can do to 4-5-6 in a 24 hour period, so was curious if any existed that didn‚Äôt cap you. Even if you pay the $20/month fee for the ones you mentioned, they still cap you to 4-6 a day.
Well I had no idea but I looked it up for you. 

It would appear that InteriorAI can do what you need, and it looks like their Pro plan ($200/year, AKA $17/month) lets you do up to 1,000 interior designs. If that‚Äôs still insufficient for you, their Premium plan ($500/year, AKA $42/month) cap is much higher, up to 5,000 interiors.

What exactly is your personal minimum threshold for decor generation, OP, and what are you willing to pay for it?

ETA: There is always a cap. If an option doesn‚Äôt cap by number of generations, it‚Äôs capped by speed and/or quality.
I pay for subscription and I do way more than 4-6 per day!
Thanks. Appreciate it. I used ChatGPT for our main bedroom and loved it. Went to try our guest room and said they couldn‚Äôt due to capping so I‚Äôll try what you‚Äôve listed here. Appreciate it.
Through who? ChatGPT?
Gotcha. JSYK, ChatGPT-4o does better than past models at recognizing spatial elements from photos, but it does *not* guarantee architectural fidelity. If you loved the ChatGPT-designed bedroom, it probably looked great, but it may not be implementable since the LLM can still hallucinate architecture. 

For accurate room redecoration that honors furniture and space constraints, tools like InteriorAI or Planner 5D still vastly outperform ChatGPT, because they work with actual depth-mapped, layout-locked data.

So if you‚Äôre messing around with paint colors and bedding textures ChatGPT offers fun inspiration, but if you‚Äôre trying to virtually simulate a redecoration before you actually pay for new furniture, you‚Äôd want accuracy preserved.
ChatGPT changed the game for me. I upgraded last night and sadly, it said it still caps me to 4-6 images each day to be generated.

The creative home decor subreddit might be a better place to get ideas more in line with your vision. 

Right off the bat, I think the speakers would ruin the vibe unless somehow disguised. If you don‚Äôt need fantastic speakers, there are lightbulbs that can also play music. 

I‚Äôd recommend looking into faux stained glass for the windows and go with some really heavy dark green blackout curtains. 

I‚Äôd also personally get some electronic candles instead of lanterns and scatter them throughout the room at various levels. You could go crazy and get an old metal chandelier. 

If I‚Äôm being completely honest, the wooden accents are slightly giving Olive Garden to me for some reason. What if you instead had a wall with dark wooden bookshelves? You could fill it with old books, board games, dice, etc. Then if you ever got sick of the room, you could pivot more easily. You could also do something like your mockup on one wall and bookshelves on the other."

Have you tried Wayfair yet? Or look at the Better Homes and Gardens brand through Walmart - our TV stands are that brand and we like them a lot.

Or Target online has random brands too, we have a tall metal and 'wood' bookshelf from there.
Omg, look at you, thank you!! This is so, so close. If it was a standalone unit (i.e. not a wall mounted) it would be perfect.
Yep a lot of close matches, but frustratingly, nothing with all the matching items. Seems like a gap in the market.
or maybe try using Google Image w/that pic.
Why on Earth are you being downvoted?!
What are you looking for that those products in the screenshots do not have? Is it specifically the shallow drawer + deep drawer + cabinet?
I mean, yeah? OP was pretty clear that‚Äôs what they were looking for. Bulleted list, bolded ALL in post. OP stated they had searched and found similar options (like those screenshots) but none with all three required items (again what you posted).

reddit,HomeDecorating,1nl3vl4,1758289210,apartment decor help,What should we put on these two walls? ,"apartment decor help

What should we put on these two walls? 

Nothing
These walls are behind doors. You probably don‚Äôt want to put something there that could get broken or damaged by opening the door. Why not put something on the door like a wreath? You can definitely put them on the inside of the door. 

On the other wall, maybe put a piece of art that doesn‚Äôt protrude too much. I would stay away from obviously breakable things like a mirror in these spots.
Nothing, they are small and are perfect just like they are.
I dont love those white circles. Maybe try taking them down¬†
ok.
The door behind the plant (we are throwing that plant out) doesn‚Äôt open at all, only maintenance has access to it. I was thinking putting two big pictures on the wall closest to the entrance door but not sure. This area just looks so plainüò≠

I personally stopped being dissatisfied when I stopped consuming social media and influencers who‚Äôs whole income depends on you feeling that exact way about your home.  I still enjoy the occasional inspiration particularly on reddit because you get to have a conversation with the individual to hear about their challenges and resolutions.
I think lots of people see this as an outlet to express creativity in their daily lives?
I think it is a side-effect of seeing so much via social media and the internet in general. Comparison is the thief of joy. People did not do this to this degree when I was growing up.
For most people decorating is a function of time and money.  I have the time and money to do one room a year.  Once I get through the entire house, then I can come back through.  I‚Äôm nine years in on a 17 year plan.  This will be the first house I keep when done.  

Many of the things I use are from previous houses.  I find something I love and decorate around it.  So no,  I don‚Äôt feel the need to change frequently.  I have made bad purchases that had to go, uncomfortable couch, poor paint choice.
Yes. Because we cannot let the internet tell us what‚Äôs popular. We need to choose what we like and update it when we feel compelled, not when society says it‚Äôs out of style.¬†
I decorated with the intention of still liking it when I‚Äôm 96. I‚Äôm 49 rn. That means earthy sunny tones and natural wood furniture. Minimal but intentional wall decoration. Nothing fad-like, nothing too prominent, no primary colours or strong contrasts
I collect and resell antiques, there's never a day where I'm satisfied with my home. One day I'm in my Wabi Sabi era, the next back to French Country and it becomes a loophole lol
I mean I don't really worry about the ""many years to come"", nor do I have the money or time to really perfect every single detail to my taste anyways. But I mean, I do regularly look around and think ""hell yeah, nice place"" (especially when it's clean any tidy lol). 

Since I do like to switch it up from time to time, I'm a fan of seasonal dec√≥r. I think that's an easy way to change it up once in a while without having to devote a lot of thoughts or money. And it's not as consumerist since you can use the same stuff every year, but it still feels new and fresh if you haven't seen that stuff for a long time.
Unless you have endless money - I don't think you are permanently satisfied.  But  I do think its  important  to find your own  voice. I  was lucky in a way when I bought  this  house I hated most of what was popular and   what my friends were doing and went a different  direction. 

If you are patient in finding those investment pieces and finding your own voice and  doing what you like regardless of trends -- you will be happy for years to come and it will then be tweaks and updates years on. That's the strategy I mostly took.   

The regrets I do have are  the few things that were  ""trendy"" that I now dislike.  Where I was true to myself and went  more classic and timeless and waited for the ""wow"" feeling in my soul - I am perfectly happy.
Every few months?  I'm not _permanently_ satisfied, but I like to percolate on what I have.  Meaning, my bedroom is not where I want it, but I keep collecting Pinterest images and eventually I'll figure out what I really want. I've been in my current house for almost 5 years and I'm in no rush. I can't imagine wanting to change in a few months.
I‚Äôm a thrifter so it‚Äôs taken me a long time to get things to where they are and it will evolve over time.
I still live in a state of satisfaction though. It‚Äôs always a work in progress but I can still relax and enjoy it.
You enjoy the journey more than the destination.

This is true in all facets of life. It's very normal, and not inherently a problem! But if it's leading to over-consumption and over-spending, then you should certainly find at least some peace in the destination.
A good home is never finished, it evolves. Satisfy yourself, what makes you happy?
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get to that stage anytime soon! I bought my home when I was single and I‚Äôve been through many stages of life since then that have forced changes regularly. My now husband moved in so our bedroom changed quite a bit; COVID hit so we both needed office space; now we have two kids so both of those rooms got redecorated; my daughter is a toddler now so she‚Äôll need a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù‚Äòroom soon. Not to mention we‚Äôre just out of space and drowning in toys so I have ongoing projects to optimize our space, etc. I genuinely have no idea what phase I‚Äôll be able to say ‚ÄúThis is what our house looks like for the rest of my life!‚Äù 

Typing all of this out I kind of love that I can look back and see how my house has grown along with me.
Redecorating every few years is not in my opinion a problem unless it is a constant cycle of dissatisfaction. For me, when I started investing in really high-quality furniture pieces and decor from local artists or from travels, I do not feel the compulsion to replace things nearly as often because almost everything in my home now is special to me. I made the switch to buying all solid hardwood oak furniture from a woodworker in the Midwest a few years ago and now a lot of the pieces in my home are custom from them and I still love them just as much as the day I got them. I do like to move my decor around and add decor pieces here and there, but as far as a full top to bottom redesign of my home, I no longer feel the need to do that. If you are primarily getting your decor from big box stores, or buying cheap furniture, that might be part of the cycle too.
My carpet is 33 years old, and my kitchen cabinets are a horrible red/orange oak. It's hard to be satisfied.
I'm too busy living in my house to spend so much time looking at it and thinking about changing how it looks.

Decorate for your values and your lifestyle.  Those things change very slowly so your design will ""match"" for a long long time.
I‚Äôm like you and I try to lean into seasonal changes so I get the refresh but I don‚Äôt keep spending more money. I have my fall florals and I have my spring florals. I have some blue toned pillows for summer and then swap to burgundy for winter. Stuff like that. Also I always move my current decor around to different places just to get a change of pace.
Don't decorate for a style or fad.  Decorate for what you love.  That right there will minimize your need to redo everything.  Stop worrying ""what style is this"" and ""will this be dated"" - if you love it get it; if you don't love it leave it.  Create your own style.  Let your space reflect you.

Look in your closet for your color choices - we tend to wear colors we love.  If you have no pink in your closet, it's safe to say you won't like that pink couch for long.

If you want a change, rearrange the furniture.  It gives you a fresh look at everything.  Just sitting facing a different wall can make the room feel fresh.

Buy your anchor pieces in classic neutrals.  You can afford to swap out smaller pieces and repaint more often than replacing couches and counters and cabinets and floors, etc.

Don't buy something just to fill up an empty hole.  It's OK for your room to have empty spaces.  Wait until you find something you love that will fill the space.

Get a couple (or more) comforters/quilts/bedspreads that emphasize different colors of your bedroom.  So if you have a blue, yellow and white bedroom, get a comforter in a white and blue stripe and a quilt in a yellow and white print and change them out seasonally.  Or get a solid yellow bedspread and a blue and white print bedspread and switch them out whenever you remake the bed.  Get sheet sets in the different colors will add more versatility.

Print your favorite vacation photos big (8\*10 and larger) and frame them instead of bought artwork.  Print more than you need and stack them in the frames (eg, put three photos one on top of the other in a single frame).  When you want a change, move one of the back photos to the front.

Stop asking social media what color to paint, what furniture to buy, how to rearrange your room, etc.  Just go out and start looking at furniture and colors.  Arrange your furniture, live with it for a while and rearrange if it doesn't work.  Look at artwork or fabrics that you love for color inspirations.  Stay away from paint colors that everyone recommends - those are the colors that will look dated in a short time.
My upgrades happen so slowly that they‚Äôre extremely thought out. I focus more on the vibe and functionality than anything else. We‚Äôre just starting furniture and decor upgrades to the stuff that I‚Äôve owned for 20 years. Area rugs have always served as my way to change the vibe, which I did every few years when I moved based on the new place, not based on the internet. Every landlord has been shocked at my ability to decorate with very little.
I‚Äôm wondering what do you do with all the floor, carpets, furniture and decor? Do you throw them away? I don‚Äôt understand how someone can tear down a perfectly fine looking room, all that waste is bothering me.
I‚Äôm not permanently satisfied, but I‚Äôm at a point where the stuff that needs to change is the BIG stuff, like a kitchen reno. I absolutely love the rooms we‚Äôve been able to update and make our own, but I do get the itch to change some stuff here and there. When that happens I usually just rearrange the stuff we already have. Maybe I‚Äôll grab a new trinket or something, too, if I find THE thing.
NOOOOOO I don't want to be! I can always paint and get new things second hand to change things up. I am also very fam with hammer and drill because if I want something it will happen.
My taste has not changed in many years, and the only time I‚Äôm willing to spend on changes is when something is worn out or I see a better option to replace it.  As a result, my home changes gradually, for the better IMO, as I have the funds and opportunity to add or subtract things.  Now that we are retired, I did spend on a new sofa and reupholstered a couple of chairs, and some window treatments for the new house, but I mostly shop second hand and thrift for decor.  
We do, however, spend plenty on improvements to the house that will have a return on resale.  

Because I don‚Äôt follow trends and my taste is fairly set, wholesale redecorating has never been necessary to make me feel satisfied with my home.
Nah. Just bought a rug two days ago and already looking forward to replacing it üòÇ
I personally love my vintage French cottage stuff and never want to change it. I have an antique Victorian sofa that I bought just the frame and painted and recovered myself. I bought my dream Marie Antoinette chaise from Eloquence in 2018 and I found my dream coffee table and painted it white and silver. I think I am not really influenced by modern stuff because as a designer I get clients that all want the same style and I find it boring. You can look at my photos and see my little white cottage looks totally vintage... and my bedroom is very OTT.¬†
Lemme see‚Ä¶‚Ä¶oh I got it, maybe, just maybe, folks are wired different and a bit of grace extended to all for their differences might help to understand that a home, sometimes is just shelter from the storm, storage for food, and eventually‚Ä¶..where we launch into the next.
Open a high interest savings account. Every time you want to buy something related to redecorating, transfer from your main account into the savings account.
Pick artwork that means something to you- something that makes you think or feel or laugh or remember.  You probably won't find it at Homegoods.
Yes. There are things that are literally missing from the home because we haven‚Äôt found the right pieces but everything we‚Äôve chosen, we love. We don‚Äôt follow trends though, and I don‚Äôt mean that in any pretentious way. We just choose styles that we truly love and feel are timeless that fit our aesthetic, which includes well made furniture. Anything that would be considered trendy is through the coincidence of time.
There‚Äôs still some things I‚Äôd like to do like - I need a large piece of artwork for the living room, a new floor length mirror, blackout shades and a king size bed for the primary. Otherwise it‚Äôs all projects that are too expensive unless we decide this is our forever home (new wood floors, expensive wallpaper). I‚Äôm extremely happy with my house and feel like I‚Äôve gotten to that point where I don‚Äôt need to do anything for years to come!
No, but to me that‚Äôs half the fun. Constantly tweaking, rearranging, painting, using art and small pieces from travel. I never keep a room exactly the same for more than a few months. But the changes I make are free/relatively inexpensive.
I am. I‚Äôll add little things every now and then, but I love it here.
I‚Äôm happy to stay in my ‚Äústarter home‚Äù until I die. Of course there will be occasional upkeep (such as roof and window replacement) that will need to occur but I‚Äôm happy with keeping the basics of my home as they are.
I have some seasonal decor I put out. I change my paint colors every few years.
There are people, such as your parents, and that's perfectly fine.  As you move through life, things change, you change, tastes change, your feelings change, and it's perfectly normal that your space changes with that.  In fact, I highly encourage it.  Growth and evolution are what you're seeking, and you should always pursue that.  High five, more power to you.
My personality has changed over the years and I‚Äôve noticed the look of the living room has changed with me. The rest, no. I still have contractor primer in my closets.
I swap out bits of decor in my home and emphasize different splashes of color seasonally. I get bored with certain aspects and doing that keeps my style fresh and appealing for me.
I feel this way, and I definitely think social media has made it worse (comparison is the thief of joy, plus endless access to ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù), but even before social media I‚Äôve always liked change. When I was a kid (90‚Äôs) I would rearrange my room like once every couple months.

BUT I don‚Äôt have the money to redo my home as often as my whims change, and I satisfy myself by rearranging my living room occasionally (much to hubby‚Äôs chagrin) and ‚Äúshopping‚Äù my home for things I already have. I also rearrange my art sometimes, which makes things feel ‚Äúnew‚Äù.
Kind of? I live in a very ultra suburban, cookie-cutter neighborhood and every time fall comes around I feel the desire to ‚Äúmake the house feel more like us‚Äù. For some reason during the warmer months I really don‚Äôt care about the interior decor, but fall and winter give me the itch to start scoping out Facebook marketplace for unique/vintage stuff.
My father's motto is ""house done - life over""...but he is an architect, so take that with a grain of salt.
No but I would love to get to that point. Always trying to think of the next thing
After 15 years, I‚Äôm finally happy with everything but the primary bed and bath. 
I‚Äôve figured out furniture that fits the space and updated the kitchen. I have really calming, cohesive colors and textures. I love being home
Maybe do a values exercise to identify your top five life values. It might be that one of them is novelty or creativity and right now your home is the primary way you are expressing it ‚Äî and their may be smaller, less expensive ways to express it. One of my values is environmental stewardship, so once I clarified that and named it, I started making different choices around consumption. Now when I redecorate, my goal is to keep anything from going to a landfill and I hunt thrift stores or antiques for as much as possible.
I personally feel more satisfied now that I truly embrace my own style and not what‚Äôs trending. I prefer moody, dark, cozy, earthy, and cottage-whimsy vibes. Do I change things sometimes? Of course. But my big pieces I tend not to. Did someone say green is out? Oh well idc I‚Äôve loved green my whole life! Just got a beautiful dark green couch. Did another person say cute little mushrooms, fairy lights or some whimsical elements are tacky? Again, I don‚Äôt care anymore lmao‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt have tons of stuff like that, but now that I‚Äôve added little elements of stuff I truly find magical or things I like, it feels so homey and fun. I‚Äôve also thrifted so much of my stuff and it feels way more collected and like me. I‚Äôve made it a mission to thrift real quality wood when looking for night stands, tables etc. I look for ‚Äútimeless‚Äù pieces to balance out my little bit of whimsy lol. Not saying I don‚Äôt ever hit up tj maxx for a good time either though üòú‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just much more intentional. I think you just have to lean into your own style. When you want to change things maybe just try and make it accent pieces, like pillow covers, blankets, artwork etc. ‚Äúshop your home!!!‚Äù Move things around. Spray paint is also your friend in my own opinion.
Yes, if by ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù you mean until the next impulse buy or until you see something prettier. üòÑ The circle of life!
Same . I feel the same way.
If this is your base mindset, you are stuck in the same mindless consumerist hamster wheel as a man or woman that has to have the latest car or designer fashion trend every single season. 

Everything is geared to part you from your paycheck, month after month after year after year.

Save the planet (use less resources), find a better hobby. And redecorate your home maybe once a decade, at most.
I love that you had that realization and i absolutely agree with you! I
üíØ
Definitely!
I love the bones of my house and I‚Äôm lucky to live in a mid-century masterpiece that honestly dictates the what styles we can incorporate. Whatever social media trend is popular, it most likely won‚Äôt jive with our house. I ignore most of it. I find decor that makes ME happy, and call it done. 

But you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs time and money. I have the funds to restore and fix up about one room a year. And that room usually comes down to necessity. Is it leaking? Bathroom renovation time. Are we having another kid? Time to replace the 50year carpet in the guest room and get painting.
How fun! There‚Äôs soooo many fun styles!
On top of seasonal decor - there‚Äôs also smaller things you can switch out that give rooms a fresh look without changing the base (just make sure you like your bigger pieces like couches, dining tables, etc!).¬†

Linens are an easy one, and are also relatively inexpensive and store well, so I like a to have a few pillow cushions and table cloths / place mats that I rotate. My bedroom is feeling a little flat so I‚Äôve also been thinking about getting another duvet cover in a pattern that I can also switch out.
It seemed like following your gut was the right way to go! üëçüèº I think the things that connect with my soul are out of my budget üòÇ
I like that concept! I think the problem is that I‚Äôm bipolar + borderline with a lovely side of ADHD so when I‚Äôm in a dark phase, I want gloomy and witchy.. then when I‚Äôm up again, I feel like all the dark consumes me and I must go light again üòÖ Some days I want to live out my 80s penthouse coke dealer dream and other days I want to live out my 1800‚Äôs Victorian vampire castle dream, ya know?

Usually my DIYS end up pretty shitty because they‚Äôre done spontaneously. I recognize this pattern now though, so I usually sit on the idea for some days/weeks before I commit to doing it.
I love this so much for you! You're lucky to have been a homeowner for so long.
We're in the middle of painting our downstairs. We rehabbed the upstairs last year. It was the first major update to our house since we moved in 2013.

I've actually enjoyed my phone showing me old pictures of my house. I forget what it was like a decade ago, how much it changed, when we could afford curtains, etc. It reminds me how much I've done to our space and made a home and a cacophony of things happening at once. This is also the longest I've ever lived anywhere so it's still fascinating to me that I'm still here.
It sounds like you‚Äôve got a knack for interior design!! I‚Äôm jealous! ü•∞
Usually the changes are only in my head and never come to fruition in real life ü•≤ it‚Äôs rare I ever throw out any home decor/rugs/furniture! I uust use the garage to store it until I‚Äôm ready for another swap! üòä
It‚Äôs tough loving so many different styles and having so many different moods üòÇ
What a joyless answer, good grief. OP never said they were constantly buying new things.
I never spent  a lot of money (dining table excepted). I searched and waited for the right thing to turn up (on sale or sometimes vintage) that I could afford. You do eventually find it. Just takes time.
Yes and being poor so you can‚Äôt really change anything , unless you buy a pillow or a throw and do a minor change lol!
That was stated after the fact in an EDIT.

I am relieved for OP. 

We all have wants and fantasies - believe it or not, I look at gorgeous interiors all the time. But I'm working on a master plan and will not blow a huge chunk of my resources on decorating. Not yet, anyway.
Nah, they literally never mentioned buying lots of things, the EDIT wasn‚Äôt necessary. That was your assumption, and you chose to wax poetic with a lecture about someone‚Äôs ‚Äúbase mindset‚Äù. 
It‚Äôs a choice to do that, and maybe it‚Äôs time to look inward.

This screams Trading Places circa the 90's to me.
I can‚Äôt imagine the dust that will collect
The vines look so thin and fake, it just looks so obvious that they're not real. Is the ceiling that offensive that fake greenery is better? I would say go hard on the greenery, make it look lush, full, and then the lights will hide and just peak out. Seeing the back and forth stripe of the lights I think is what makes it look childish.
The person has got these wee fire hazards from amazon/temu. You can see some string lights too in there. I suspect this is on top of a sheer tulle type material and plenty of pins.
Starts dusting Monday, and you finish by Sunday; only to need to start dusting again Monday.
The amount of dust this will collect....
It‚Äôs a little hard to tell but it looks like they put up crown moulding with a flat surface on top, possibly like [this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Alexandria-Moulding-1-1-4-in-D-x-2-3-4-in-W-x-96-in-L-MDF-Primed-White-Crown-Moulding-Pack-4-Pack-CR001-96096PK/331519238?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&srsltid=AfmBOoqcHpazk-5tiSmwUYN1S748EDy8YyxWsA--MaJniTZ6e45zBfmA5t8), and then put nails/hooks in the top of the moulding to hang the string lights. Though I think I would try to find the moulding in pine or poplar rather than MDF, since the MDF doesn‚Äôt hold nails as well.
My parents did a chili pepper light display like this for the holidays on their entrance way ceiling when I was growing up. Basically you get heavy gauge fishing line and hooks. You would create a grid a few inches down from the ceiling and then weave the lights/vines in there to make it look as natural as possible. You won‚Äôt see the fishing line and then it looks like the lights/vines are floating.
Use small hooks screwed into the walls near the ceiling and string the vines and lights to and from. I will leave my personal opinions out of this but you will have an extension cord running from a wall outlet up to the corner of the ceiling which adds to  the tackiness here. Oops.
Ask a 16 year old.
Here is my idea for executing a look like what you describe (better than what is pictured):

-you can buy panels covered in fake ivy or other vines. They end up on the walls and outdoors of cafes, patios, or some instagrammy spot. They are more dense than what is pictured above.
-you could weave in your fairy lights, for a more organic, less linear result. 
-hang the panels on hooks from the ceiling, so they are easy to pop down and blow out the dust a couple times a year. (How much dust accrues is highly individual.) blowing out things like this is pretty effective. You might even be able to engineer a way to vacuum them while on the ceiling.
Would be easier to hang a tapestry on the ceiling.
I think you may have a couple of options to achieve what you would like. First if you are prepared to lose some height in the room, or would like the vines/plants to drape down a bit, you could make a wooden or light bamboo type of structure that would be similar to or mimic a pergola, this would look more natural, so you wouldn't have to worry about hiding much work, then you could secure your vines and lights sporadically using fishing wire or clear zip ties, I have seen this done with Wisteria and it was stunning. My second suggestion would be for if you want to keep the vines flush with the ceiling, I would purchase plant slabs if you would like plants included with the vines or clear plastic trellis panels if you would rather vines only, they are modular so you can cover the whole ceiling or just the middle of the ceiling, normally they are used for walls, but can definitely be used for ceilings. Lastly, and I'm not sure if this idea is way off from what you would like, but I could see just having a rustic industrial long wooden statement pendant light with the ivy trailing from above the pendants, I think this could be very elegant and eye catching.
Don‚Äôt do it!
I helped a friend do something similar on her daughter's wall. We attached the vines to white netting and screwed small hooks into the wall to hold the netting at various points to prevent sagging. For the lights, we attached them to the wall first so that the netting could be put up/taken down without disturbing the lights.
Dust. Feh.
I don‚Äôt have any tips for you but I just wanted to say it really looks great
well like I said, the rest of the room looks nothing like this, and this isn't the aesthetic he's going for. Just the clearest picture of the general installation style. It's not going to look like Trading Places lol. You can reverse image search this and shit on the Pinterest poster whose room this is if you really feel the need though
Unfortunately, just so. Cute as it is, it‚Äôs not a practical setup for long in a room that‚Äôs occupied consistently.

I did something similar with garlands of faux ivy and fairy lights in my bedroom back in the mid 2000s, but it got gross so fast, and was really tricky to properly clean - just a magnet for dust and cobwebs üò¢.

I suppose if it was engineered to be easy to take down, taken outside and scrubbed regularly it might work better?

It‚Äôs cute and whimsical, but probably best suited to an event or holiday decorations rather than day to day life.
Life hack: Be nearsighted and you won‚Äôt see it. /s
And spiders. So so many spiders.
I came here to say that!
This.
Less dust than everything else in the room since dust falls more than it rises.
Fun fact, literally everything in your house collects dust. Doesn't feel like a compelling reason to leave all surfaces bare lol
üëè READING COMPREHENSION, PEOPLE! Jesus. We are not buying this exact shit lololol do you know what a fucking example is?? 

Sorry I'm sure you're a lovely person but this thread is such a stupid joke I can't üòπüòπüòπ
We will definitely not be going the Temu route lol. I don't think LEDs are a fire hazard, though - that was the old school string lights we grew up with that had heat-producing bulbs
wow thanks you're the first person to mention that
We've got a lil mid century house with no crown molding - might make the ceiling look lower if we added? thinking of finding obtrusive ways to anchor to the ceiling in regular intervals so we don't get sagging in the middle
Interesting! I think someone else suggested chicken wire but this sounds a lot less visible. Plus I have built garden structures out of chicken wire and I'm not trying to get stabbed in the hands a million times doing this lol.  I see it for a really thick or heavy installation though.
Thanks for the tip. I don't think people are actually reading the post text - his room looks nothing like this lol. It's just a clear, non-AI version of the general installation idea
He got the idea from the decor he saw in a lot of Paris street cafes but ok I guess they're all hiring 16 year olds for that üòπ
could be worth looking into. I don't think he wants TOTAL full coverage, but then again he didn't really know those panels existed until this morning so the wheels might be turning and giving him new ideas by now
Possibly, but that is not what he wants to do, and hence that is not what this question was about. Thanks I guess?
I will suggest the long pendant light to him. Decorating is definitely not a great love of his, and he is very burnt out on looking at lighting options, but I kind of know what he's been looking at and I don't think he thought of this. Thanks!
This isn't my room lololol IT'S üëè AN üëèEXAMPLE üëè FROM üëè PINTEREST üëè

Edit: original commenter, you fully did not deserve that üôè
I don't but thanks for explaining this.  I lost 5 seconds of my morning.
thanks for giving a real answer based on personal experience ‚ù§Ô∏è appreciate it! cleaning is definitely a factor he's taking into account - it's always a factor with any kind of maximalist decor. But like anything else, if that's your aesthetic you're fine with the upkeep
But my sinuses will still know
I wished my asthma was nearsighted üíÄ
You say it sarcastically, but it's my reality lol
Spiders are lucky and keep your house pest free. Being afraid of something the size of a thumb is weird. And these are too delicate for an Australian spider‚Äî they would not support the weight.
This is a pain in the ass to clean though you'd have to get on a ladder and wipe off all individual leafs. Good luck with that.
I mean with one example it is hard to interpret what you actually mean. In this one example, the vines look thin and cheap. 

But also do what you want! Planter hanger hooks could help with installation. Best of luck!
You need a hot shower and a cuppa op. Vines look good just not like this. There's plenty of other examples out there. Go take a walk and come back with fresh eyes
Why did you even come to reddit for opinions if you just want people kissing up to you? You wanted peoples thoughts and they gave them, you didn't like them, get over it
If we are sure of something is that you probably aren‚Äôt a lovely person‚Ä¶ why being so agressive?
It's exactly the same quality as amazon. They are all ethical back holes.

Having this on the ceiling absolutely is a fire hazard. In the event of a fire, this would ensure your ceiling also catches fire. All that plastic is the equivalent of dousing the ceiling in petrol. It's all a huge fire accelerant.
Have you tried posting in r/teenagers lol
You seem mature /s
Yeah it looks like they put the crown moulding a foot or so down from the ceiling, sort of like a chair rail, which gives the cool shadowy effect on the ceiling. But it would lower the room height. As for hanging on the ceiling, look for screw-in zinc ceiling hooks, and screw them into a ceiling joist or drywall anchor.
It‚Äôs not that people aren‚Äôt reading the post text. Most people just think it‚Äôs a bad idea and shouldn‚Äôt be done at all.
Hiring? Lol That thing is held up by thumbtacks. Sorry but it‚Äôs tacky and juvenile. Good luck!
Cmon op someone's actually nice and you still bite their head off. Maybe it's not this sub that's the problem.
Why are you so aggressive dude?
‚Ä¶are you ok?
This person was trying to be nice, no need to be so rudeüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
You are so over the edge that you won't even let someone compliment your inspo pic. Drink some water & take a nap.
Lol I hope the rest of it is lovely üôè
That totally makes sense, as long as you go in eyes open and a with plan (a lot of people don‚Äôt really think ahead for moving or removing with this sort of decor - I know younger me didn‚Äôt), go for it. 

If you wanted to take it in a slightly more sophisticated direction (if not, please totally ignore me üòÇ), some real trailing indoor plants in ceiling hangers or on high floating shelves with some wall hooks high on the walls to hang trailing leaves on as they grow, could look cute (some similar cleaning concerns, but slightly easier to move and access), with a bit more flexibility to add or change things over time. Some fairy lights or even remote controlled electronic candles to get the vibe? 

If he doesn‚Äôt love any of the ceiling light fixtures around, try Facebook marketplace, also make sure to check for lamps. I have 3 in my home office and they are so practical and flexible, I almost never use the overhead light.

Also, warm light bulbs or leds rather than cool can transform less than ideal lighting fixtures.

Life is short, let it bring joy, I hope you guys have fun with it üòä
Lol true true
Ikr!! The nerve of it
Oh, same. I just put the /s because, like the other commenter said, the air quality still knows. üòÑ
Thumbs doubt typically have the ability to poison you.
Oh great, drop-spiders
why's everyone got to be cute about it? This isn't a cleaning sub lol. I didn't ask about dust, I asked about installation/design tips. we are grown ass people who understand that dust exists
Pssst your walls are just as flammable as your ceiling but you still put stuff on those...

A great many of the things in your house will catch fire if your house does. Idk about you but I'm not trying to furnish my home with nothing but stainless steel and concrete on the off chance the whole thing goes up in flames. if that happens, I don't think a bare ceiling is going to be the thing that saves the whole structure
Mmmm no I'm pretty sure at least some folks are taking the example photo literally and very helpfully shitting on how ugly it is. 

i'm just gonna say it, this thread sucks and y'all have shit reading comprehension. I bet all your houses are ugly AF too ! üòπüòπüòπ
just to be clear, this is not a picture of a Paris street cafe lolol
You got me there. it was my moment of peak annoyance with this thread going off the rails... I was expecting maybe three comments max and instead I found myself at the circus very quickly and unexpectedly lol. I am definitely not new here so I have no idea why I didn't know better
Why are you getting downvoted? Lmfao
He can't really do real plants in there, the light is truly terrible. We're in a big city, and the buildings are really really close together, so sometimes you just end up with that room where you're looking at a brick wall a few feet away and there's no hope for liveplants at all. 

And he probably will circle back to the light fixture eventually. The house was a flip and all the ceiling fixtures are those weird LED fixtures where you can't replace the bulb, you just have to take it out and replace with a whole new fixture when it eventually dies. It's not a setup he has any familiarity with from the past and he is way too overcommitted to continue down the DIY rabbit hole of how to change it at this time. There'd also likely be some drywall repair, he'd have to go up in the attic, our attic is tiny and hot and it sucks, etc. We just got back from Paris and all the caf√©s and brasseries have a ton of cool looking lush fake plants everywhere and he thought this seemed easier to do in small steps that aren't super disruptive
Between my cats and the dust I can't see, you right üòÇ
I wasn‚Äôt trying to be critical or rude in my tone‚Ä¶ FWIW. Just wanted to point out that might be a challenge. I didn‚Äôt say it looked bad or was a bad idea. I respect your design decisions. Just have been to restaurants that did this and it gets a little gross over time due to dust build up. And while dust is everywhere, to your point, this would be incredibly hard to remove the dust.
I can explain it for you, but I can't understand it for you.
I love how you ask for insight / advice and crash out with emojis and all caps to most replies.  Maybe it‚Äôs time to log out
Lol you're so triggered. Don't ask an advice sub and expect to hear exactly what you want. Your idea is a bit impractical and looks a tacky and when you post on a public forum, you invite comments.
Your post text literally says ‚Äúsomething like this‚Äù and then you‚Äôre pooping your pants throughout the comments shouting NO WE ARENT DOING ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING WERE NOT DOINNNNGGGG üëè üí© üëè¬†
It‚Äôs the attitude that makes it ugly
Yeah and you‚Äôre the main attraction babe!
The internet is a strange and magical place üòÜ I did get a lot of really good tips and ideas in between the dogpilers so all's well that ends well!
Absolutely fair, but don‚Äôt discount real plants entirely, there are some great options that thrive low light. Golden pothos, peace lilies, philodendrons, ferns etc. (Though some are toxic to animals if you have any cats).

Those led oysters are the worst (usually cool leds, so the light is gross too), but depending on what was there before the actual hole might be smaller than you think. Worth just temporarily unscrewing it to check what you‚Äôre working with before making any assumptions. Could be a simple as puttying the screw holes, some spot sanding and small paint touch ups. But it also could be they chose those lights to cover some sins, but either way, better to know.
The feeling is mutual ü´° have a nice day
And the tacky vines
yeah for sure, on the LED ceiling light. I think part of it is, he just can't find anything he likes better to replace it with, and he's been looking for a while and is now fully burnt out on endlessly searching for light fixtures. I know the feeling lol"

SW Foggy Day.  I have it in my own house. It is not too dark at all.
BM Britannia blue 1623
SW labradorite
Oh, that's pretty, but I definitely need a more mid-toned color since this room is so dark.
SW includes a range when you look up the color. So if you go one lighter you get Foggy Day then Cadet. etc. I use Samovar Silver (2nd to lightest) and Grays Harbor in my house. There are other color groups too that have more blue or more gray. It's fun t look through them."

How about these guys?
If the area receives good lighting, you can add a few plants
There is only one choice

I wouldn‚Äôt put anything there, but if you really want to add something, a tall, slim sculpture or a modern decorative piece could fill the corner nicely. 

A floor lamp or even a wall sconce could also make the space feel cosy and light up the staircase. Another option could be a vertical picture with a thin frame.  Maybe some abstract art, a black and white photo, or a minimalist line drawing
Large wall art, since there‚Äôs visibility.
I think people have already mentioned my first two ideas (plants and cat beds). But I think the best suggestion I can give you is to use a home decorating app to try out different options and see if you like them before committing to anything. There are some interior design apps that use augmented reality, such as Planner 5D, which I've used to test the placement of some plants in my home. Honestly, after testing it, I decided that the plant looked terrible and didn't put it there, haha.¬†
Fish tank would look so
Cool!  But it‚Äôs a lot of work and would probably need to be custom made. Still, it would be awesome .

This is your opportunity to get all of your old GI Joe's or Barbies or Legos and make an epic scene that people can look at as they walk up the stairs

Plants.
It‚Äôs hardly an area. Just leave it.
Just put a picture on the wall there
Nothing¬†
The correct answer is always ‚Äúplants‚Äù.
A jail cell. For your architect.
Put some beautifully patterned ceramic vases.
Cardboard standee of Stewie from Family Guy
Depending on the width, maybe a slim bookcase with books/plants/decor/art?
Plants with big leaves!
Nothing. Just pretend it‚Äôs not there.
A cat
A rectangular, long planter with either faux plants or real ones, depending what the light situation is.
Nothing. Why make it harder to dust?
Pla√†aaants
A gallery of wall art
I would do a series of plants to fill in the space. If it doesn‚Äôt get light you can find some really good fake plants
I would hang a large piece of art.  Hang it low.
Plants
creepy dolls.
Ant farm
I might consider a nice railing height bookcase on castors. So you can see what books or other items are in it through the glass like a display case. Then you can easily roll it out to access the items as needed. 

You could also have a few sturdy items that won‚Äôt slide or topple over on movement on top of it, or perhaps something framed on the wall above. I‚Äôd stay daily minimal given the style, unless you are a maximalist.
nothing
A cat. The answer is always a cat.

Plants or art are definitely an option. But I always like the idea of doing something funny and/or whimsical when you have a weird space to fill. Like this statue...

Maybe add a green wall? It could also cover more of the wall. These can be found on Amazon.
Box in the glass and make it a fish tank üòú

Call it a loft and rent it out.
the answer is always plants
If you have fancy suitcases stick them there. That‚Äôs what I would do. But I am all about practicality and functionality. 

Or you can use it as some sort of wine/liquor storage I guess. Maybe some thin rolling cart or something? I wouldn‚Äôt use it for cats though. Imagine having to clean this regularly and clean this you will have to
Terrarium or Aquarium. Although, I prefer the former.
I need context. Please post a photo of the entire area. The photo is too close up.

Put another railing there. I have no idea why the first one is there, so it makes no less sense to me for there to be two. It'll be your own one of a kind piece of absurdist art.¬†
A) 3D art. It‚Äôs protected.
B) if you want something functional you can put a vinil in the glass and behind it a wood box with shelve and wheels. On top, at the layer of the handrail some wood board or the metallic one with plants on it, books or decorative things at your taste.

It looks like it‚Äôs made for plants (real or fake) but you could also use the space for a large piece of art or hang a picture there with lights spotlighting it.
Nothing.   If you decide to add plants, maybe hang them off the rail in a box.   Like a window box.

I would consider plants on the floor if that‚Äôs your thing but you could also do an arrangement of framed art spanning floor to ceiling with simple spot lighting over it. Bring some color and texture into the space.
Walk in shower
1. Art is an easy solution
2. rectangular planter with some vertical plants that do well in low light (Dracaena trifasciata) 
3. Something more complicated but cool would be a fish tank that you‚Äôd see through the railing, as you going up and down the stairs.

I would push the wall out to the edge and make the room behind bigger, if that's not possible for some reason, remove the glass and build in a cupboard. If that's not possible I'd just remove the glass as it seems pointless and makes the awkward space more obvious

I concur.
Omg.  I might need to put a space up in my home just to have them looking down on me.  I love this idea.
Only answer
This. This is the correct answer.
üòÇ
Definitely needs plants in my opinion , some grow lights may help if the area is not so well lit naturally. I‚Äôd get a shelving unit on wheels and grow lights attached somewhere. Slide the shelving unit in and out for watering etc. it could look awesome especially looking through that glass front
The answer is always add plants
Unfortunately, this is an indoor area. Otherwise, I wouldn't be so torn about it, haha
I have one of Hatsune Miku
I agree. Not every space needs to be filled with stuff. This seems like a good place for some unique lighting and at most a simple, sculpture or relief with good lighting.
Agree, I‚Äôd like a few framed pieces against the wall and treat it like an art ledge, to be viewed coming up the stairs.
Bigass scarface poster. No frame.
I feel like that's what the space was intentionally made for. Anything else would look weird.

Omg, this is amazing! So beautiful and dynamic!¬†

Under it, maybe a narrow shelving unit with some plants?¬†
Think how satisfying it would be to pull the plants out on a rolling cart shelf when it‚Äôs watering time.
Sansevieria, ZZ plant, Chinese evergreen, dragon tree, peace lily, pothos and philodendron are classic low-light houseplants that may do well here even without a nearby window. Especially if you can swap out the nearest lightbulb for full-spectrum. There are other low-light plants out there, but these are the ones I‚Äôve personally had good luck with.
Windows my dude. Windows let light indoors.
Faux plant
It looks like it gets a lot of light. I imagine tall tropicals filling the space.
Is there a nearby outlet? You could get grow lights and spotlight plants and space. 

But I support the cat space! It would give them their own little space.
Just get some fakes. Bonus is you get to move em wherever you want if you change scenery
Aquarium PLEASE
What if I put a few cat trees here? Then he could observe the entire staircase
I understand. I think anything there would be clutter that collects dust. 

Maaaaaybe a narrow and tall plant but that‚Äôs if you absolutely must. 

I‚Äôm far from a minimalist but do believe, as my Mother used to say, the eyes need a little ‚Äòempty‚Äô to relax
Ah, then consider weights in the bottom to prevent them from being knocked over. Could still work.
Especially a statue of someone peering down with emotion on those coming up the steps. To keep people on their toes, get several different statues, each to fit your moods, and rotate them out. Children will either hate or love to visit you ‚Äî but they‚Äôll remember you long after you‚Äôre gone.
Either that or a fish tank with fish and plants üòç

I can totally see a cat hammock here!
Be careful if it goes over the railing - cats can fall asleep and roll out of some beds, and that could be a pretty large drop.
I agree with your Mom!
Definitely a possibility with weights!
I totally miserad that as ""peeing"" at first. That would definitely keep people on their toes.  LOL.

I highly recommend you rethink those curtains altogether. Rod pocket curtains look cheap.
Yes I would
No, because you have a corner moulding at the top and it would look silly. Could you invest in a higher quality rail and fit it just below the moulding?

I‚Äôm very much into the sages/ darker greens. Or burnt orange as we have pretty neutral furniture and bedding.

What would you do to spruce this up? 

The furniture setup looks pretty solid, but the lighting is the first thing I‚Äôd work on. Maybe a combo of desk or floor lamps to start?
I‚Äôd remove the overhead light and use more lamps. One for each side of the bed and possibly a floor lamp near the corner with the dresser. Also, consider a rug under the bed. Is there another wall without windows you could put the bed on? It may open up more natural light without blocking that window with the bed. So much potential in this room!
The light was probably a hanging pendant light over a table. That could be moved and probably wouldn‚Äôt be too high of a cost. 

Your bed is massive. The frame is eating up precious floor space. I‚Äôd get a [storage platform bed](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/latitude-run-modern-wingback-upholstered-platform-bed-frame-with-4-plastic-storage-drawers-soft-corduroy-fabric-sturdy-wood-metal-construction-no-box-spring-needed-easy-assembly-w112988403.html). 

It‚Äôs a tiny small space with a lot of furniture. Paring down will make a big difference.
Well first what kind of vibe? That‚Äôll give us direction. The limited lighting can be used to turn your room into a more moody romantic vibe üòç Or if you don‚Äôt want moody and instead was light and bright, it‚Äôll totally change the advice.
A sage or deep green accent wall with warm bedside sconces would add depth. Burnt orange throw pillows or a blanket would tie it all together nicely.
Texture! An area rug under the bed and curtains will anchor the space and give it depth. Lighting! Area lighting- lamps and maybe something hanging in a shadowy corner - will add mood and nuance.
Ceiling to floor curtains instead of the blinds would make it feel cosy in your room, on top of the other recommendations here
So we could maybe put the bed on the interior wall (the wall to the left of the doorway I‚Äôm taking pictures from) but my dresser is there now with a mirror attachment so that would end up blocking light or looking awkward I feel like.

I think if we took off the mirror it could go under the right window but would still be in the way next summer when we want to put an AC in I think we are kind of stuck with this unfortunately
Ooh I love that! Do you think it would work with the dressers and nightstands we have??
Do you think an area rug big enough to go under the whole bed?? Or just the end of it?
If you can afford an area rug big enough to go under the whole bed, (for example, an 8 x 10) I think that always looks best. However, there is a strong case to be made for a 5 x 7 that just goes under the bottom part of the bed, Horizontally. 
And curtains don‚Äôt have to be these huge all encompassing thing, but even having some fabric and color anchoring the sides of the windows is going to lend the room a lot more depth and color and texture. Just make sure to hang them from just under the ceiling to the floor, it‚Äôll make the room look gigantic!

Couple questions: does your tv HAVE to go there? It‚Äôs making it feel crowded bc it‚Äôs too close to your mantle and ceiling. If your tv HAS to go there, I‚Äôd definitely suggest bringing the stone all the way to the ceiling and adding curtains that are full floor length‚Ä¶.and then go from there
I would  def be looking for another place to put the TV, even if it ends up in front of a window
Just don't get why everyone hates tvs over the mantle so much. Doesn't bother me one bit this was the standard for so long once flat screens came to be now everyone wants it down on the ground I hate having a TV console.
How long have you been in this space? I usually suggest living with a space for awhile and see how you actually use it before making any large changes. But, I also understand if you have a specific time frame that you're working with.  If you haven't spent a winter there with the wood stove I'd recommend trying it out before ripping it out.  We h ad a wood stove and loved it but it's not for everyone.  Please keep us updated on how it goes.
Only way it can go somewhere else is a corner in the living room but the way the room flows this wall over the fireplace makes the most sense. Full curtains are also part of the equation for the remodel as well."

Can we get pictures from all corners of the room to better understand the space? What is your goal with this room? You have a work out area and a bunch of box and groceries on the floor.  Assuming we want to keep the work out area I would put some kind of room divider where the kallax is to make it a more defined space. That would be the larger size of kallax to create a ton of storage or maybe a slat wall.

Is it hopeless? It‚Äôs a split level home so that door in the far left is the entry way.

First thing is you need to declutter. A lot of things seem like they don't belong in this space at all. So ask yourself why they are there, how they got there and will then end up back here. Design should be pretty but functional. It seems like you need more storage for the mud room. I would look into putting up shelves or buy a [larger rack](https://www.target.com/p/freemont-shoe-storage-prepac/-/A-52431976?preselect=52391553#lnk=sametab) where the current shoe rack is to fit all the shoes you have there. I would put the kallax vertical next to the blue mud room piece and use baskets in that to store whatever is in the white toy chest, clear draws near the door and wire basket near the door. Obviously if you can build or paint all the storage on that wall the same color so it matches and looks built in that would be ideal. I would paint the back of the blue pieces no matter what so it looks built in and not floating.  Then I would put a rug and chairs in front of the fire place so it is a place to sit and have a cup of coffee or put your shoes on instead of just seeing the gym.  You could so a [curtain from the ceiling](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vidga-single-track-rail-included-ceiling-fittings-white-20492916/) or a [wooden divider](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/naemmaroe-privacy-screen-light-brown-stained-indoor-outdoor-20532743/) if needed.  But that could end up making it feel smaller. I suggest utilizing the vertical space for storage as well. Things like the skate board can be [mounted](https://www.apolloinnovate.com/products/longboard-skateboard-wall-storage-single-board-display?variant=44547060957371&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21481181021&gbraid=0AAAAAoj4SZOXafjvAupu8QLtuAqz5sfT-&gclid=Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9ccTPas6rTlvKo6DReNRizgNWS77WBnt8nIVaABs59ybAlqpiI0F0ugaAv-GEALw_wcB) if it needs to stay there. Hope some of those ideas help a little.

Dark olive for sure
Have you checked out Evergreen Fog by Sherwin Williams?  It is very popular for a reason.   Any paint company can mix the color if you don't use SW.

See if you can find any rooms online painted in the colors you're interested in.  Try to find several rooms in various lighting.  Your room won't be exactly like any of those rooms, but you'll still have a good idea for the ""feel"" of the color.
What about the ceiling??? Will you also paint that? I think it looks great when both the walls and the ceiling are done - pic added just to addle your brain a little more

https://preview.redd.it/jtmzfdai41qf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4cf85dffc824de9eabf096848e87c56bd5a68d6
I personally would want to add a hint of blue like the two on the far right if I‚Äôm going for moody, the top center would give lovely dark academia vibes. I would also paint the ceiling & add more lighting if needed.
Your rug is very red. Be careful that you don‚Äôt end up with a Christmas themed room. I‚Äôd choose a bluer green if you‚Äôre going dark and a yellower one if you go light.
My suggestion is get a sample sizes of a dark, medium, and lighter green and put them on the walls. (I got mine at Sherman Williams.) You can also check out how each looks in different lighting, i.e. daytime and night. Another thing I‚Äôve learned about using greens is some are warm greens with kind of a yellow tinge and some greens have a blue tinge. Each make for a very different look in a room.
None of those are ‚Äòdark green‚Äô except maybe the top left.   Try sherwin cast iron.
Silver sage would be great in here.
I went with behr avocado to avoid blue tones and I love it.
None if you want dark green, try something with more brown rather than blue in it 
Something more earthy in my opinion
Are you changing any of the furniture or decorations? They feel pretty dark or heavy, so I think I would go for a lighter shade on the walls. 

You could do something similar to what you did before with a darker shade on the bottom and a lighter shade on top. You can look at the numbers, and you want them to be in a similar range for an easy match.

Also, it looks like this is Behr. They have a room visualizer tool where you can choose the colors you like and then upload a picture of your room to play around with it.
Personally, I like the shades on the yellow side rather than on the blue side of green.  They work with more colors than those bluer shades.  To me, the two chips on the top and the one on the bottom right are no longer green but teals and are much more difficult to use on walls - they are difficult to coordinate and too many other colors just look off.  

Truer greens and yellow/olive greens are very neutral - they reflect greens in nature which provide a wonderful backdrop for flowers of all colors.

With colors in the dark shades, lighting will drastically change the color on the wall.  I have Behr Butternut Wood in my living room, hallways and stairway.  It can go from being a true olive green to looking like mud depending on the lighting.  Personally I love that variation but for some people it would drive them crazy.  And you have to be sure you love all the variations.  So be sure to test your colors on all the walls to see how the light affects them.
I‚Äôve been considering vine leaf for my dining room. Interested to see what you end up picking! (Sorry I can‚Äôt give my input, I‚Äôve gone colour blind myself from looking at green paints recently)
I like 4 and 5, my favorite on the bottom row.
4th choice front row. Your furniture is too dark to go with a very dark green.

We did SW Jasper
Laurel Garland
I think the two on the left (the yellow-greens) go best with your rug. Have you looked at 'Bancha' by Farrow and Ball? That's an absolutely beautiful colour.
The rug is telling you some shade of blue. Color picking, I get:

Though I wouldn't go as dark as any of these.
I would pick up a blue that matches the colors of your rug.
Cushing Green by Benjamin Moore

It looks like it would pair with anything

I would not go for green unless there is a plan in the works to bring green into the room in other ways. Right now I see 10 colors in the space and none of them are green.

If you want to go dark, reference your existing room colors:

[SW Salty Dog](https://www.sherwin-williams.com/en-us/color/color-family/blue-paint-colors/sw9177-salty-dog)
Look at Everglades Deck by Valspar. It‚Äôs a beautiful blue green. I painted my fireplace and living walls in this color and it‚Äôs beautiful. Very rich and moody¬†
I don't like any of those. I would go with Sherwin Williams Succulent.
I would go with the lighter green that has a yellowish hue. I think this will go best with the reds in your rug. The other greens and blue greens give a Christmas vibe when paired with the rug.
A dark olive
We did Benjamin Moore Essex green and it‚Äôs been perfect for us
A soft grayish terra cotta
The one in the back left, my son used in a room and it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous.
Sage green is always a winner for me
I like laurel garden. And also north woods, but much darker of course.
Sorry, but I‚Äôm so over the dark green trend.
I have Rainy Afternoon by BM in my living room and it's gorgeous! Its a deep, serene green that can shift to a smokey green in certain light.¬†
Well, I can't read the names on the paint chips you have but I see that they're Behr. Home Depot's website has a feature where you can upload a pic of your room and try different colors.

I have to build up to the ceiling. Will give it a few months after the walls to decide.
Painting the ceiling would definitely make it more dramatic. I want do the walls first and then decide. Yes lighting is a big part in making the dark painted room inviting.
Yes that's next step.
Most things stay and I am going for a darker moody paint. With pop of light pictures, canvases etc. I am going to try the visualizer.
Great inputs. Thanks.
Lol, I can relate. I have been looking at them for almost a month now.

Dried thyme is another popular color and a little greener.

Ok well‚Ä¶in that case choose one of your lighter options - the middle two
If I was choosing, I would choose the dark academia of the top center green & do the ceiling. I would leave the moldings white, they add brightness, and I would rehang all 3 paintings in the office area on the same wall. And I would probably add a plant or two in the shelf, even if I need to add some lighting on it. Or something else decorative to balance the room.

The curtain and curtain rod is one of the biggest things you see in the bathroom; I‚Äôd recommend finding a curtain that goes with the vibe you want and going from there. 

Oh, and don‚Äôt forget the curtain hooks- the ones that have doodads on them can be a bit tacky, but the hooks in general are a good way to add detail without being overwhelming.
In our small guest bathroom, the shower curtain itself seemed to closeoff and visually minimize the room. We later bought and installed a fancy glass shower door (in closeout section) and fancier rainfall showerhead and wall mounted soap/shampoo / conditioner dispenser , and it really did make a difference, room visually felt bigger and more open.
In addition to the other comments.... COLOR!

This is beige hell.
Take down the word art and the bookshelf (?!) and put a framed picture there. Maybe a candle or oil diffuser on the back of the toilet (on a little tray could be nice). Can you paint? That would help. If not, a more richly colored shower curtain, complementing the picture you‚Äôll hang
What about a dark jewel tone color and a bold pattern curtain that matches?
There are less conspicuous exhaust fans out there:

Take down the word art but get a ‚Äúget naked‚Äù shower mat, much cuter and still has the vibe you‚Äôre going for. Maybe a nice piece of art above the toilet instead
Wallpaper. Wall cabinet above toilet.

The room is def getting some color! It‚Äôs so beige. Haha
The entire bathroom is 100% getting painted. Already picked out a color. It‚Äôs the exhaust fan lighting I‚Äôm really struggling with. It‚Äôs the only light source. :/
And books?

Why the fuck are there books?
Replace it with a classic ""no dumping"" sign.
Ha, can agree. :)
Silver rod might be softer.
The room is getting painted in Chatura gray by SW. most fixtures like toilet paper holder and hand towel are going to be black along with the shower rod. Adding in some fun brass/gold hardware like towel/robe hooks and shower hooks to add some small details without being over the top. I appreciate your suggestions!

Put wall scones on either side of the mirror. Add led strip lights to bathroom cabinets (look up under cabinet lighting). Add pinhole lights to the ceiling.

Why did I think of the baked good and gloss over toilet. Must need coffee this morning. I like the idea of scones as supplemental lighting!
Honestly, I dunno. But it‚Äôs a little funny. Lol.

There were a lot of those in the 1970's/1980's. People put decorative junk up there. (Plants, baskets, whatever).  Yours, in particular, looks extremely odd.  Like the closet was an afterthought, and they just moved a tiny closet in a cramped, wasted space between two doors. Really odd planning.

For the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out why these spaces even exist! Like what are the builders thinking?
But don‚Äôt drywall it until you hide a fake skeleton in there!
Yes!
Either that or demolish it completely and build something better against a longer wall if available.
Then maybe bust out the top of the closet and install a shelf for extra storage?
Exactly.  Nothing. Why draw the eye to some weird space above a closet? Leave it alone and focus your energy on fixing the chipped, dingy drywall around the brown door (and repainting the door -hopefully a color other than this dull, flat brown)
If I can find a very flat, wide gargoyle, I‚Äôll make this happen
Grotesque I think you mean.
This. Make a ladder out of carpet or sisal behind the open door, and they will have the perfect perch from which to lord over everyone.
I have two kitties and definitely thought this would be amazing, just wasn‚Äôt sure how to get them up there! I think one of my cats would possibly be able to climb a vertical carpet thing like the other commenter suggested, but my other one is not much of a climber (or into really any physical activity).
Yes. Cat den so they can pop out periodically and frighten you when you least expect it. Fun is had by all.
My original thought tbh
I think this is the best answers
That‚Äôs why you have to keep a Roomba up there.
Why does this not have more upvotes?! It‚Äôs an absolutely perfect suggestion!
Aw screw you lol I literally thought of the same thing and sent the same picture / words. I was so proud of myself like aw man I am so funny.
Oh, I‚Äôm glad someone else said Lego!
I have actually always badly wanted this: https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/imperial-star-destroyer-75252. It would indeed look great up there, and I‚Äôm sure my wife will agree!
This is the only correct answer. It looks unfinished and as it is, it's essentially a box attached to the wall. If it's framed all the way up, it could even have another door added for off-season storage. Capped off like that it just looks silly.
Honestly just looking at this photo made me start thinking about doing that. The closet has actually been really useful though, and is currently full of jackets and games and things, so I‚Äôd probably want some equivalent functionality either right in the same spot or elsewhere nearby. Could put a big coat rack there I suppose, but plenty of other things in there currently I‚Äôd have to ponder what to do with‚Ä¶hmm
?? It‚Äôs the entryway closet
Yeah it‚Äôs horrible lol

What is the cheapest way to do it.
Designers/architects for the mass produced homes: cheapest

Actual builders doing drywall: whatever the plan says and if unclear, what's the quickest and easiest
Builders need to be putting a placeholder card there explaining that they left it that way so you can put your gargoyle there. Everyone always forgets their gargoyle unless they're reminded.
They Hate painters, clearly.
Laziness.
Or make it a bit of a cabinet for stashing seasonal items.¬†
I can help with that!

Just fyi- the ones I know of come in fluffy and smooth, and they may require some kind of small shelving or ladder type item to help get them up there. 

They flatten well but can also puff up to a pretty large size when needed.

They're great for guarding things and occasionally for hunting, too.

I found all mine at the ASPCA. üòÅüòÅüòâ
Several smaller gargoyles
A toad gargoyle. ‚Ä¶actually you might find ‚Äúdecorative stepping stones‚Äù that are animal (like toad or frog or even stingray) or insect (like ladybug or butterfly) shaped at some garden stores. Some are just thick enough to see their mouth and toes at the edge and you could put a mirror on the dial ceiling over it to see the rest of the body. They are usually concrete and you can paint them. 
Interesting option.
A tension rod cat tower would work well here too. They take up a lot less floor space.
Put a cat bridge across the top of one of those doors then a climbing gym structure down the wall from there so they can jump left right left right like a zig zag
Little floating shelves act as stairs for cats.
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
You could tear it out and put a vintage or antique armoire, since you do use it. Or a hall tree.
Someone else will know better, but it can‚Äôt be too expensive to lay down some framing and then drywall and paint
Is it though? The amount of wood and drywall used to cap the top isn't far off if they just took it to the ceiling.
i have a clown puppet that i place peeking around corners. thats what i would do with this space
Exactly where I went
I hope the animal you are referring to is a cat, because not many other types of animals would be getting up and down from there safely. Good place for a cat bed or cat igloo though. (I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre called, but cat igloo is what my parents called it) I guess a sugar glider might like it or maybe a prehensile tailed skink, but neither of those usually end up at a humane society shelter. (Though a sugar glider did once get adopted from a humane society shelter near me)
Probably not, but cheaper is what the builders were definitely thinking.
Less materials and quicker to drywall when it's like this. You can do the ceiling in one straight piece, rather than having to figure cut outs and such.
If they‚Äôre a mass building making 100 of these houses in a subdevelopment costs like this would add up quickly.
They probably had just enough to do this and didn‚Äôt feel like running back to Home Depot.
Also quite acceptable!
It is!!!
Hate when they cut corners...literally lol

I suggest a dark pattern, a botanical brocade or tapestry. Something that is the opposite of the rug, like the negative of a photo. Perhaps something medieval, maybe with animals.

Hey there Furniture fans! I‚Äôm a concrete finisher who has been exploring a more artistic direction. Just thought I‚Äôd post something unusual I made and get your feedback. It‚Äôs faux bois (fake wood) Hand sculpted concrete over a welded steel armature. Hoping to create pieces like this professionally. Currently just building up a portfolio. 

very nice. Good luck
Very nice. This would be great for people who want to ‚Äúset it and forget it.‚Äù This can sit in the sun, rain, wind and snow forever. It is probably so heavy that once you place it somewhere you are never moving it.
Thanks!
Two strong guys can move it, but it‚Äôs not fun haha"

Get a rug, that‚Äôs it, the rest already looks good.
i would kill to have a house like that
Get a rug, preferably a natural coloured one
Something like a burnt orange or a green would all ready elevate the space
Everything looks gorgeous, it‚Äôs a really lovely house. First thing I would do is get rid of the ugly 90s couches and replace them with something simpler, lighter in colour and more mid century. The heavy black leather does not work in this lovely mid century space.
What a beautiful problem to have! Amazing.
Center your couch on the windows
My dream space. You are so blessed to have this, enjoy! I agree with adding a rug. I‚Äôm a plant person and would probably add some that are more visible on the second level as well. Probably more plants in general actually, you‚Äôve got such great lighting‚Ä¶ possibly a better matching table too, it‚Äôs a bit dark compared to the TV stand.
Please don't ruin any of your beautiful wood.
I‚Äôd get a rug and just lay on it in this house empty except for the plant jungle for awhile and just take in the awesomeness for awhile
I would love japandi styled furniture in this space
I think Japandi styling would work perfectly  here! Light woods to work with the trim you have, light neutral rug and upholstery, plants to bring that gorgeous view inside.

Get inspiration online. Sometimes it helps to do screenshots and combine them into an inspiration board.

I originally thought the 1st pic was an inspiration pic. It looks really good to me! Only thing I‚Äôd add is a rug
It looks perfect. The way is.
Get all those windows professionally cleaned; inside and out.  You will be amazed!     Then find a colorful rug that works with your leather sofas.
A round, cream colored, textured rug would look nice.
This gives ‚Äúam I balding‚Äù *photo of guy with long luscious locks* energy
Start with Pinterest and figure out the style you like!
RUG
Love your home! My contemporary home dreams were dashed. So, happy to help make your come true.  One of the first things I would do is make plant groupings. Group them in odd numbers and vary the height. Use can lights under the floor plants for ambient lighting at night.  It looks like you have 3 competing focal points: the view, the fireplace and the TV. That‚Äôs a challenging situation. 

I think if you dropped your mantle down you could mount your tv. Then move your sofa to where the TV.

Really, a sketch of the floor plan would be a great addition to the pictures.
Keep the plants and the dog.

ETA: I think (depending on your comfort) some lovely lower couches, in the japandi style, [like so](https://share.google/images/cl3BmoHFhzOYB0j0i) would really set off that incredible verticality.

I agree with others re: rug, if dog is amenable.

Repainting will definitely make it your own; I recommend a neutral (or a natural colour like terra cotta, stone, sage green) with a relatively high LRV, or light reflectivity, to keep it bright. Even a different shade of white may surprise you by how different it makes the space feel.

Don't forget too the power of scent in creating our space. (That's a secondary reason repainting is *so* effective!) I strongly recommend cleaning the whole house with cleaners you prefer, different than what your family used, after taking out the biggest old furniture.

You are fortunate to have such a lovely home; thankfully it doesn't require much in the way of decoration, simply that you allow it to shine on its own. Polish it up and put in pieces that set it off and you will find you can't go wrong. üíñ
I‚Äôd move the couches forward to create a walkway behind the sofa. 

Get a large rug as others stated 9x12 probably with nature tones. Maybe light blue and greens with cream and browns. 

I‚Äôd also add floor length light blue or light green or white floor length curtains to the lower set of windows.
Damn that's a beautiful space üòØ all you need is a rug
I'm another for whom this is a dream space! I saved a photo from a Reddit post a few years ago that might lean into a bit of the Japandi style you like in a way that I think really goes with the style of the home itself. The black/dark gray circle on the wall also gets you a bit of dark moodiness while maintaining the airiness of the white through most of the space.

Those windows <3
A very large rug.
That's an amazing space. There are so many different levels you could take this. I look and see new railings, new doors, different wall finishes in a few places, a bunch of really cool lighting, etc.

But as others have said, you could just get a rug because it's a great space already.
I am not a fan of furniture with cup holders. Cup holders are for vehicles. I‚Äôd buy a couple of nice fabric couches to elevate the space. Especially if this is the most visible space in your home (versus a family room or movie room.) You‚Äôd be amazed how child and spill proof modern fabrics can be and not expensive at all.  And a good sized rug.
I‚Äôm wondering what you need? But yeah, a rug would help. Maybe a light off white to bring more balance to the floor?
It‚Äôs a great space! What is your budget? How much are you wanting to decorate? Are you looking to refurnish or just decorate?
You're doing great. Love the monstera. 

You need a slightly bigger coffee table (round or oval, maybe?). And a rug. Maybe something that pulls in greys and warm browns with some brighter colors.

Are you committed to the couch and loveseat? I'd like to see something less large and dark. But if they're staying, coordinating throw pillows and blankets might soften the look a little. 

My aussies say hello to yours!
Rug, new thicker more rustic mantle, you can sometimes remove the gold trim around the fireplace. Mine popped off. If not, you can spray paint it with a black, high heat paint. As on poster suggested, center the one sofa and then pull the other forward a little. Add a sofa table/cabinet behind the one acting as a room divider. The rest looks good!
Maybe some mounted plants? If you look up Hilton Carter he has a really cool guide on how to make really cute wall mounted plants
Wow! Your place is gorgeous. You really only need a rug. If the windows are old and drafty, you might want to stockpile your cash for replacements. Energy efficient windows with UV filtration would be a sound investment.
Get a rug all  the rest already looks great
Well, depends on your brief, budget and location. What is it that you need to change?
You have big space , but it is being drowned out by all the green, brown and wood.

Depending on budget  start with thinking about changing the couches to a lighter colour maybe a sectional maybe a two piece . 

An area rug would centre the space for sure and make it quieter and calmer.

Change the colour of the entertainment unit  a lighter colour similar to the couch.

actually get a low rise unit for the tv only .

‚Ä¶The shelving on the side of the tv is dated‚Ä¶ get rid of it, if you  are not attached to it. 

Create  focused plant area/zone.

And a side chair or lounge chair to the sectional or sofa .

Smaller lighter coffee table.


Your furniture is solid and appears to be good quality but it‚Äôs too dark and  big it‚Äôs drowning  the room.
I‚Äôm new to Reddit and guess didn‚Äôt post my explanation properly lol 
I‚Äôm moving into my childhood home and want to make it feel like my own. All furniture will be removed and we are willing to paint, change flooring etc.

I am really struggling to pick a style that best suits this house, I really love a dark Japandi look but I think the paneled ceiling throws it off. Looking for any suggestions on what would looks best. Thank you in advance !
Personally I feel like a slight dark academia look could be amazing! But I also feel it would be beautiful keeping it neutral and soft light colors. Both would really allow the scenery from outside to stand out. Do you have a color palette in mind?
Uhhhh it is such a gorgeous house!
Replace the black leather furniture imo. Overall this space is amazing!!!
At first, I thought it was a table, but no, it's the couch for me. I would change it with some airy and lighter version on legs.
I thought it was already done. Chill out. It‚Äôs fine.
Warm tone rug and new couches. 

Super cozy place! I love it.
rug it.
Fucking beautiful
All I saw was beautiful nature!!! My first suggestion would be to get rid of the entertainment station if possible. It‚Äôs very overbearing (and I read you‚Äôre getting new stuff eventually). The tv hung on the wall would be great, or a built in situation to create a similar yet more evolved look.
Hey I kinda love it ,get an 8x10 or 11x14 rug in your favorite colors plus some black and tan,maybe the green of your plants. It will all work.
A rug and a new wall color. I would keep the rest.

I know you've commented that you are getting rid of the couches but just consider: they fit in the room well, they look hella comfy, and nothing now is built to be as sturdy as it was 20+ years ago.
Absolutely stunning space! I feel like bringing in your own furniture will make a huge difference and adding a rug like others have said. I would maybe consider adding some sheer linen curtains.

https://preview.redd.it/bfpo9qo380qf1.jpeg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d33250d5906c0f3db17f03d953290935dcd4b0d
Gorgeous!! 

If you want some oomph, paint the wall behind the TV your favorite color. I did one wall in my living room red, and I absolutely love it. 

Others have recommended a rug. Good idea, unless you don‚Äôt like them, or feel they are a tripping hazard.
This video is very helpful when you're feeling indecisive about home decor ... https://youtu.be/8QQoy4X-VnQ?si=I4f2xj1Pps03cmjE
Looks good from here.¬†
Leave this perfect place alone! Just add a rug.
Get a rug in colors you love and take your cues from that.
Fun Rugs!! The rest Looks Fabulous ‚ô•Ô∏èüôèüíêüá∫üá∏
Take everything out.  Bones are beautiful.  Wait until it speaks to you.
New couches and get rid of the entertainment system.
Rug for sure and if you can, swap out the couches with a large sectional.
i would change the couches to a more earthy tone
I would get rid of the TV stand and mount the TV with a console underneath as well. I would get different couches too..if possible and add a rug. You have a beautiful house though.
Oh and whatever you do, don‚Äôt paint the woodwork!
Is it just me or does this look like the house for the movie Creep 2?
Love the setup! Also, where can I get that center table? Lol
IKEA has a really good natural fibre rug called LOHALS that wears really well and looks gorgeous and it‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs made of Jute. If you have cats they‚Äôll love it too for scratching and it doesn‚Äôt show
start with being grateful. lol this is my dream house!!! 

i suggest checking chatgpt for recommendations and generate an image. it‚Äôs very helpful
This looks amazing as it is
the overall layout/floorplan gives what remains of edith finch
This is very nice. but yeah maybe a rug
I‚Äôm so jealous
You have the dog and a comfortable bed for the dog.  Everything is fine!  :)
What an interesting house! So much wood. Do not dare paint any of it! The upstairs accordion doors are very cool. You need to do this house justice. Please spend the money and hire a professional decorator.
Firstly, WOW this place is amazing!

I think a good place to start is getting rid of the black (couches, maybe even the tiles too) and getting something that is more earth-toned/lighter, it would fit in better with the space.

I also think a big, colorful persian rug would look really nice and bring the space together.

Last thing is just a personal preference, I would get rid of some of the smaller knick knacks (to me it looks messy) and maybe replace with books or more plants.
Wow. Amazing house. The only thing I don't like is the paint color and the furniture.
This is a lovely space! I think the plants would have more impact if you grouped them into two or three areas instead of spreading them throughout. That way, the room will feel larger and more organized. Adding a large rug would also help pull everything together.
I would set that tv freeee. The console fits the house well but it also seems really tight. You have so much soace. Open it up by replacing the whole thing with shelving. Put the tv on the wall
A big colourful rug. Persian would look amazing
beautiful home, just changing a few small details will make a big difference. try just focusing on one or two things at a time but really lovely here
I‚Äôm so jealous of that view! Beautiful!
I really think it just needs a rug. everything else is excellent
You've already got an amazing foundation with those windows and floors
Girl you did it already
This isn't a low cost idea - but goddamn, would this high-volume space look handsome with glass railings in the loft above.
Oh no, let me grab a leaf from that luscious inside/oustide greenery and wipe a tear.

The second couch is in the way of your wow factor. A Textile or leather beige couch would work better.  
round, low, basking, light, swivel textile armchairs to move form the telly to the woooow view.

The wooden rocking horse would look good in one of the window corders.  
I'd paint the kitchen cabinets a lighter color so it doesn't look so far and deep from the rest.

It's a stunning home don't change too much about it.
Oh I love this room. It has a very specific energy
The couches
What?
What gets me about builders is look how freaking tall that wall is its like a ski chalet in the Alps big and all the way at the bottom is this tiny hobbit of a fireplace . . Your swiss cheese plant is fan freaking tactic! Super jelly. If u were ever into rock climbing or repelling that wall would be a free climbers dream with the right footings and finger grips. Your house is stunning.  U might feel overwhelmed because of the grand scale of the walls. If they were 8 foot ceilings with all ur furniture i suspect u would feel anxious all the time and feel trapped. Your house could eat mine for a light snack.
Great space for sure.   Living room - I'd refresh paint colour but keep neutral tone.  I wouldn't paint the wood or stone.  It suits the natural beauty of the space.  Dining room and kitchen is where I'd look at introducing a bit of colour ... painted cabinets like a moss green, classic backsplash, maybe a bit of wallpaper in dining area.   Your pics are the living room but I agree with others, it's a pretty room already.   Fresh paint would do it for me.
Rug.
First of all, live the house. I would live to have your problem. The first thing that strikes me is the upstairs railing. I get the rustic feel but it‚Äôs either a bit too thick, not the right color or it‚Äôs the little extensions on to the wall. I do agree that a large rug with darker colors would help to draw the eye down to make the space feel a bit more cozy. Have fun figuring it out.
I came here to offer...more but have to agree with everyone. Just a rug! Haha 

Also a nice sectional or different couches would really change the space too.
i dont think ive ever been so jealous
A rug and a White Russian.
Go follow renovation husbands on Instagram. They are fixing up a cabin in a similar style and as someone with a similar house I‚Äôve found the choices they are making are super helpful as inspiration.
Looks fantastic! Love the green
Damn. Keep those windows clean and no one will ever notice anything but the view! The architecture and view is doing 90% of your work for you.

You're done, unless you want a rug. If that beautiful dog isn't fully house-trained you can wait on the rug.

If anything, I'd upgrade the tv cabinet and get plant stands. But really, it's a lovely, comfortable room.
I would paint the railings black and leave the rest as is. 
The wood is beautiful but the railings add too much.
I hate indoor plants with a passion but I love being surrounded by them outside like being in the middle of a forest
Agreed on large rug. You could update your couches too. It‚Äôs all very beautiful üíó
You need a rug, and to move the sofa over 5 inches
I think you could add a newer couch with another fabric and as another comment suggested, a rug would do very well.
a proper rug and proper couches. Those couches probably comfy but so ugly bro.
With those large windows and gorgeous view, you don‚Äôt need much.
The couches look really dated.
A cozy rug would be great for that space. Maybe lose plants on top of tv? And add some artwork to the walls near tv
Kill a moose
You need a massive mobile hanging from the ceiling. 

I‚Äôm picturing something six or so feet wide, made of driftwood, old metal cogs ‚öôÔ∏è and some stained glass.
Came here to say the same thing, just a rug, everything else is good.
And a joint, man
A big rug.
Agree‚Äîa large vintage one would make the space feel very cozy and pull it all together. Don‚Äôt skimp on a small one.
I‚Äôd trim that floor plant a little, get a rug and call it done.
I thought that and then I realized that it would take away from the inside/outside factor.
Same, mad cozy
And they are ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù
I‚Äôm moving into my childhood home and want to make it feel like my own. All furniture will gone so I‚Äôm starting from scratch. 
I am really struggling to pick a style that best suits this house, I really love a Japandi look but I think the paneled ceiling throws it off.
would oriental do the trick?

All the furniture will be gone, I am starting from scratch. I have tons of plants I‚Äôll be bringing with me lol
I really love a dark Japandi, I guess I could go a lighter version of it and avoid painting
Those couches are horrible
Amen!

Thanks- this is actually my childhood home So  all furniture will be replaced, I am willing to paint and change out flooring etc
Thanks- i am really struggling to narrow in on a paint i like, i think a limewash would look amazing in the Japandi style i want to go for but i want something more timeless. We will definitely be doing a big clean before we move in
Oh neat idea, the space really does all the work but just want some sort of refresh to make it feel like my own. I‚Äôll look into something like this, thanks!
I‚Äôd love to totally revamp the space, it‚Äôs my child hood home so I want it to feel like my own !
Agreed not my furniture, all will be gone. I‚Äôm bringing an off white couch with me !
The couches are going to be gone along with the tv stand, I‚Äôm basically starting from scratch ! bringing with me an off white couch!
About $20,000 for renovations. And no set budget yet on furniture, we will be bringing over a cream white couch with us when we move over. Just want to make the house feel like ours
Getting rid of all the furniture it‚Äôs my childhood home so starting from scratch and want it to feel like my own!! 

Say hi to your Aussies for me üíï
Great thanks!
Its my childhood home so i want to make it feel like my own. All furniture will be removed and we are willing to paint, change flooring etc, budget somewhat unlimted as we will take our time updating as we are doing most ourselves.
Thanks for all your notes, this is actually my childhood home that I am buying and want to make it feel like my own. All furniture will gone so I‚Äôm starting from scratch. 
I am really struggling to pick a style that best suits this house, I really love a Japandi look but I think the paneled ceiling throws it off.

Oh, and that TV stand with all the items on it. Too massive for my taste.
None of the furniture is staying, starting from scratch when I move in!
All the furniture is getting replaced üëçüèª I‚Äôm thinking a long and low height tv console
Any suggestions on wall color? 

My parents are actually taking the couch with them and I‚Äôm bringing my off-white sectional with me to this house
I have a cream coloured sectional I‚Äôm bringing with me any suggestions on area rug color

Thank you, any suggestions on rug colour, I am bringing over a off white sectional
It was a Costco find probably about 10 years ago- it actually folds out into a larger table!

The next time I‚Äôm at the house I can see if there is brand markings on it!
I‚Äôll check this out thanks!
Seems to be the consensus! I‚Äôll have to post a picture once I find out
I think your right- just small refreshes will do the trick.
We love living in the country!!!
*I really think it*

*Just needs a rug. everything*

*Else is excellent*

That‚Äôs a great idea!! I‚Äôll look into that
Thanks so much! The furniture will be gone and we are starting decorating from scratch, i have an off white sectional that im bringing with me.
Really ties the room together.
So much natural light for plants!
Japanese would be my first choice with that kind of view and windows.
Japandi would look amazing in this space! I don't think the ceiling would throw it off at all. Are you choosing to get rid of all of the furniture? If you have the option to keep it, I would suggest doing that and waiting a bit to get a feel for what you want. But if you gotta replace it, lean into Japandi. It'll be beautiful. 

It's a gorgeous house! I'm jealous of those big beautiful windows and the space and the lovely craftsmanship.
I had to Google Japandi, and one of the images looks very similar to your room. [https://westernliving.ca/homes-and-design/homes/dwk-interiors-calgary-japandi-design-home/](https://westernliving.ca/homes-and-design/homes/dwk-interiors-calgary-japandi-design-home/)
Yes!
Oh I see! I honestly don‚Äôt think you need to do too much because the architecture speaks for itself. I would just keep the furniture simple, make sure there‚Äôs a beautiful rug in the middle of the room, put some meaningful art on the walls for some colour, and keep all the beautiful plants. The internal design of the house is so gorgeous, you don‚Äôt want to overwhelm that with too much home decor.
I make no judgements about the furniture but am happy to hear you‚Äôre going to replace it.

You could reduce the opening for the kitchen and erect either a wall or shelving unit to hold/mount the TV. That would reduce the glare from the windows on the TV. It also frees up your long wall for a sofa or, perhaps haps a low-backed sectional. 

When you think about the space remember that the late century modern is all about blurring the lines of inside and outside. There‚Äôs already a lot of wood so no need to bring in a ton more. Think chrome, glass, textured textiles, ceramics, and, of course, plants.
If you're looking for a place to start, I think the railing and the bifold doors upstairs are good candidates.
Ah, okay! Neutral couches will be wonderful, as you can use pillows and throws to add the color you want. And to the regard, a complimentary colored rug will help, something also off white or earthy. Are all the plants staying?
It's a gorgeous house. You're going to love it.
That would work. You could  paint  the wood trim around the windows to a darker trim and some of the wood surfaces, like the upstairs rails to a lighter trim if you want to keep the wood rails for now. if you want to start the project with just the furniture and restructure and paint around the furniture that you select.

The upper panels are not what attracts the eye, it‚Äôs the wooden rails . They  are like a skirt around the ceiling. Paint a lighter colour or re-due completely would be an alternative option.

But you have a good structure and base to work from . 

Good luck.
Don‚Äôt paint the wood!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pleeeeeaaseeee nooooo lol I know it‚Äôs been popular to do it, but all of the white and white washing of warm tones can be institutional, and I promise it will be out sooner than later. It will be the next millennial gray. The house is gorgeous and mid century in architecture, and bringing ‚Äúoutside nature in‚Äù is what mid century architecture and style is all about. I think mixing Japandi and mid century would be absolutely gorgeous. You‚Äôre keeping true to the house‚Äôs soul while bringing in the calming, clean aesthetic of Japandi üëåüèº the wood tones are beautiful and warm, and really gives the nature-y vibe. It‚Äôs so beautiful
While you won't run up against the usual issue- making that room look smaller would definitely be a challenge!- I do think you'd have to be quite mindful not to have it be overwhelmingly dark. I strongly recommend against making the flooring dark as it will only increase the sense of verticality and if you like Japandi you like a sense of balance. Have you considered adding dark frames to the windows, maybe? Or adding dark art, or a mural, to the large wall (after you've chosen and placed your furniture?)
It‚Äôs my childhood home and want to make it feel like my own. All furniture will gone so I‚Äôm starting from scratch. 
I am really struggling to pick a style that best suits this house, I really love a Japandi look but I think the paneled ceiling throws it off.
That would be beautiful, it would help the focus remain on the windows. Plants stay! Lol coffee table is nice and could work if you don‚Äôt want to buy so much at once. A large sectional would be beautiful as well. Some other items to add might be a beautiful statement light/ chandelier from the ceiling. And if you eventually wanted to upgrade the railing from the wood to a nice iron or something in your style could look really nice. The wood looks nice, but something else would take it *next level
The room has so much light, you could do a dark color, like olive green. That would look good with an off-white couch, too.
https://preview.redd.it/3njmuc0mg1qf1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a71820cbadc7f6a1525e7f4778ca8cbc89d5eaff

I feel like something with earth tones like this would look really nice against the cream colored sectional. Could go even a little lighter with the earth tones if this is too dark for your liking. But it would tie the whole room together because of the wood beams/windowsills, stone fireplace and plants lining the windows.
Oh damn lol nice center table nonetheless! But yeah if you find a brand let me know if it‚Äôs not too much trouble
:)) thats so cute thanks bot!
And can you imagine Christmas/winter? Clark Griswold approved.
Add some scandi for that japandi feel.
Its a work of art for sure- i am going to lean into Japandi, all the furniture will be replaced, loooking forward to refreshing the space
gorgeous inspiration i love it all-thanks for sharing
The house is very beautiful and cozy on its own, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should paint the walls or change the window sill to kind of update it
This is very helpful thank you- I never thought about breaking up the kitchen, that would work really well with the couch we are bringing over.
Agreed- any suggestions on colour for railing?
I‚Äôm bringing all my own plants and I actually have more than my mom does lol be there will be lots of greenery in the home
I wont be doing anything with the ceiling wood i love it- the railings really need an update though.
I think if we were to paint the walls dark we would change out the flooring to a more natural cool oak. I really don‚Äôt know what direction to go wether to keep it light or go dark. It‚Äôs my childhood home that I‚Äôm
Buying so really want it to feel like my own
I don't think the ceiling throws it off at all, I think you're okay there. Lots of Japanese & Scandinavian houses have wood ceilings. 

Start with the basics then see how you feel. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
This is beautiful, I thought about getting a single terracotta leather chair and this would tie in amazingly
winter time is the best here- we get lot of snow winter wonderland
If I were you, I‚Äôd give it a fresh coat of paint to make it feel like yours, but hold off on the windowsills until you have your own furniture in place. The sills might not bother you after all and would be harder to undo if you already messed with them. 

I could see that tv wall being a great contender for a gallery wall with a Frame tv hidden in it. In a gorgeous room like that, I would try to put the focus on the nature, light, and tall ceilings rather than the tv cabinet.
I would keep them as is, but I‚Äôm not you! :)
I'd probably have to put the whole space into software so I could see a few options. But I think a whole new railing, probably a mix of metal and wood. I don't think just changing the color will do it. But you could give that a try as a first step if the cost of a new railing is outside of the budget. I think the color would depend on the whole overall color palette. I feel like a black railing could look good.
I recommend against switching out the flooring for cooler unless you really have to- because then to make it look right you'll need to restain allll that wood and you're getting into big money for maybe meh results there. (and potentially damaging the wood too!)

Don't get me wrong. Restain the wood if that's what you feel. But let the wood speak first, since it's the dominant tone in the room. Then arrange flooring and walls around that. Don't let the wood be a knock-on effect.

New railings aren‚Äôt out of the budget just depending on when we do it lol I was thinking of changing the wall colour to a darker tone, I think black metal would really complement it"

I‚Äôm in a beautiful rental and would prefer not to paint but I feel like the dark wood isn‚Äôt leaving me with much choice. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to lean into the pink and do big floral, can‚Äôt figure out the style name, but please help me figure out what I can do to make this bathroom beautiful for cheap! 

Have you thought of rental-friendly wallpaper? If thats an option you could do any style you wanted. 

But the pink is nice and definitely something you can work with if you embrace it. I‚Äôd say get a new mirror and lighting fixture either in gold or match the dark wood vanity. Go for a pink, white, and gold or pink, white, and walnut color scheme. 

-Find a medium sized art print that has those colors and hang it in a walnut or gold frame, get hand towels that have pink and white floral prints. Art is your best friend in this scenario! 
- replace the hardware on the vanity with gold knobs 
- find a more stylish soap dispenser/soap dish for counter
- get some rugs for in front of the toilet and sink
- who says you cant put a curtain in front of the shower door? 
- there‚Äôs a lot of open space in there, maybe find a slim bathroom shelf you can put somewhere and keep a vase of flowers on top 
-
Also, if you‚Äôre doing this on a tight budget, you can try painting the mirror and light fixture gold yourself or use Rub & Buff. 

And Homegoods will definitely have some beatiful rugs, curtains, shelves, and countertop trinkets for a decent price!


I agree with the peel and stick wallpaper approach if you get something a bit darker on the bottom it will make the cabinets feel more intentional.

Replied with some actual peel and stick wallpapers I found
Rug(s), Artwork, wallpaper below that incorporates the dark wood feel (moody floral). A valance over the shower will soften things too.
You said it is a rental? If you take down the mirror and put up a frameless oval, everything should brighten up. New knobs on the vanity and softer light bulbs for the lights would help, too. I like whoever had the curtain idea over the bathtub nook. That would hid a lot of clutter and curtains are cheaper and have more pattern options than shower curtains. I‚Äôd hang them from the ceiling and have tie backs for bath days.
I would lean in to [Barbiecore.](https://www.bhg.com/bathroom/color-schemes/colors/pink-bathroom-ideas/)
It‚Äôs really bubble gum pink!! How about a rug to neutralize the floor and lots of prints on the wall.  It‚Äôs hard to capture in a photo- but if you paint a less saturated color will go a long way.
I love all these recommendations! I do want to lean into it and was considering rental friendly wallpaper but I'm not sure what design to go with, I just know I want it to be louder floral. I also don't know if I should put it on the top or bottom of the trim, I feel like both would be too much.   
  
Would you love your thoughts and suggestions if you have additional time to reply though!
This is so helpful, thank you!!

Thank you for taking the time to do that. I like that floral pattern, where did you find it?
Yes, it's a rental. The mirror is actually a medicine cabinet, which is nice to have so I think I kind of have to leave it up. All the fixtures are so dark and permanent!
That's exactly what I was looking for and didn't know what to call it! This gives me good direction! Thank you!
I was thinking the same but I really don't want to have to paint the whole thing, it just seems like too much work and I've had decent success leaning into the paint in previous rentals. Just have to find the right theme, which u/rachelpoosheisty gave great advice on how to do that!
I think just wallpapering the top or bottom of the trim would turn out great if executed well! I know there‚Äôs tons of pink and white wallpaper patterns out there, just make sure whatever tone of pink you get doesn‚Äôt clash with the bubblegum color of the walls. 

I‚Äôm not sure which would look better- top or bottom, but I bet Pinterest has a ton of inspo pictures with half wallpapered bathrooms! I can look on there and give you some pics of what I personally am imagining

They are too low.  The room will feel bigger if you hang them higher and wider. It brings the eye up so the full hight of the room is now on display.

Yes.  They should be as high on the wall as possible and reach the floors. Also you might want to double up on them, one panel at each end is a bit skimpy on a window of this size."

I like it! I guess the question becomes who is the family that objects? Someone you live with and didn‚Äôt consult about color? Maybe not the best idea. But someone who doesn‚Äôt live there? None of their business.
That‚Äôs a great couch! My couch is pink tho so I‚Äôm biased. üòÇ
I used to own a red sofa, and I absolutely loved it. It looked amazing in photos, too. Enjoy!
It's SO nice to see something in someone's home that actually contains color. I love it. I'd have a very blase attitude about snarky remarks though. The punchline being something along the lines of, ""Well, I'm sorry you don't like it. It's a good thing you aren't going to be taking it home with you."" Or ""Well, it's a good thing it isn't in your house then, ay?""

I bought a red sofa at IKEA years ago because it was $100 cheaper than the gray one. ¬†If I‚Äôm honest, it‚Äôs not my favorite looking piece of furniture, but the dog doesn‚Äôt seem to mind so it stays.
I love it! We have coral velvet sofas in our family room :)
It‚Äôs fantastic!! 

Life is too short to be boring. Choose what you love. Learn not to care about the opinions of others. 

If your family had ANY manners what so over they would say things like ‚Äúwow! That looks so comfortable‚Äù or ‚Äúyour space is really coming together‚Äù. 

This trend where people say unkind or unsupportive things is bizarre. 

But you can help by not soliciting their opinions to begin with.
I think it looks good in that space.
Fuck em‚Äô

Looks great!
[removed]
You love it? Perfect. That‚Äôs all that matters. :) Warm tones and accent pieces show off your character as well. Also 1 - furniture doesn‚Äôt last forever, you can mix it up when you grow tired of it. Also 2 - you probably don‚Äôt consult others about what type of bread you buy. Live your life, be happy.
I love my cranberry red sofas! It was that vs a deep green üíñ too be honest I stole the idea from my mum who had red couches ü§ì
Loved my red sectional! We had it for many comfy years before it was passed to one of the kids when they moved out. Now she is loving it!
I have a navy blue couch.  I just think lighter colored couches get dirty so easily.
I had a red couch for 15 years and I freaking loved it.  It wore out and had to be replaced and we ended up with something ""neutral"" and I miss my big, happy red couch.

  
If you love it now, it is very unlikely you are going to regret it or get tired of it.
They can suck it. It looks great!!
I have a navy blue sofa in my basement and a blue and white striped sofa in my living room. I think buying a colorful sofa is so much more classic and timeless than buying whatever boring neutral is trending. Your red sofa is beautiful! Enjoy it! Anyone who complains can sit on the floor.
The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. Family will fuxk you up more than and more often than most.
I think if you see it having longevity in your home, it can't be wrong! A red sofa is something I admire whenever someone goes for one because I feel like it's the hardest color of sofa to style, but from just this one corner of your room, it already looks good! Do what makes sense for your life and makes you happy.
It looks good! And you were smart to pair it with neutral color pillows, that way it‚Äôs not an overkill of colors.
I love it. It looks great in your space and definitely cozy. Maybe even feels slightly retro?? Idk but I‚Äôm a fan.¬†
Loved my red couches for years!!
I have a very similarly colored sofa, plus huge chair and ottoman. All that color. I have had them for over 20 years! (Good quality leather thankfully) I still love them. I‚Äôve moved several times since then, and they have been great through style shifts, and color changes (once they were in a largely brick and wood room). Don‚Äôt let anybody take away your joy because of their taste. Your opinion is the only one that matters. But also it‚Äôs a great color üòÅ
I don‚Äôt understand why people buy white or beige couches. I‚Äôm in the market for a loveseat and I‚Äôm only looking at red.
I have a couch in that same color. I love it.
Looks great to me! If you for some reason decide you want to change your other colors and the red no longer works, it's also quite easy to get covers for it in many shades! 

I think a lot of older people get worried about not having things that will fit with different styles as they change... But then everything they get winds up being greige and it feels ... Well, not great to me :P
The dog makes the space instantly cozy ü•∞
We had a red couch for years and everyone loved it and I still miss it
I'm currently sitting on my red sectional while upvoting this.  Let the haters hate!
I also had a red sofa set 3x. Neutrals are for boring people.
It looks cozy and inviting, I think your circle is just used to algorithm based content and the beige-ification that even HGTV pushed a decade ago. As a teen I wanted all white furniture instead of my nice wood furniture because every YouTuber I saw had white ikea stuff and adorable decor- anyways maybe their surprise and astonishment will turn to acceptance, I mean they seem to be social people, surely your sofa can't be talk of every party forever. Besides, even if it was hot pink or neon green, it's your money-- your home- and you aren't hurting anyone. The dog also likes it, and again it looks cozy as hell. The arm is flat enough to rest a plate while eating and watching tv or a drink, and the cushions are deep so you can actually curl up and get comfortable. I'm stuck with a pretty crappy sofa at the moment but it's a pull-out so it will likely stay in my life as a guest piece even when I replace it with a new living room sofa.
Red is very cozy.   I got a red love seat and ottoman that I love.
Neutral is for walls and floors.

So you can do *this*, with furniture.
What are the other colors in the room? If the other colors in the room will work well with the red sofa then it‚Äôs OK but if some of the colors will clash with the red sofa‚Ä¶
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the red sectional, but now you have to change that table the green curtains, the color of the room and the rug and you‚Äôre fine
Nice red. I don't see it tying into anything else in the room. 

My own planned living room color scheme is greyscale + red accents. For me, that's meant collecting movie posters and other artwork in that color scheme, and keeping a photo album of rugs that would work. Once one gets a rug that really determines the rest of the room's colors.

And there's the issue. Everything else in this room is faded earth tone beiges and greens. The red sofa doesn't seem supported in any way.
It‚Äôs a vibe! I have a purple sofa and I love it
It‚Äôs a really nice red and a nice sofa!

I‚Äôm in process of painting my kitchen cabinets red and I think they match your sofa. Lol. Entire rest of my home is very neutral though. I think that‚Äôs the key‚Ä¶let the sofa shine, pull back on all else.

It‚Äôs lovely, don‚Äôt invite them to sit on it.
IT LOOKS AWESOME
Great sofa! Where did you get it from - absolutely love the possibilities with this one!
I like it and it goes great with the room


Also: if they want an opinion they can pay rent
I‚Äôm so curious what is happening to people. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. Why do people want everything to be grey and colorless? What kind of brain disease is that? I‚Äôm being completely serious it‚Äôs legitimately upsetting to me. It obviously looks amazing, if anything it‚Äôs a bit washed out. I have a strong red couch and it looks amazing and warm. It‚Äôs up to us to fight against a colorless refinement culture world. Please keep standing up for color and bold choices.
I love your sofa - go ahead OP!

Now, I don't think the wall color does it justice. It's a little dingy.
I bought a pink rug for my living room, lol.
Not crazy
Looks good to me, I‚Äôd find a fun red book for the coffee table too
Recently I got a white, corduroy sofa the same design as your sofa.  I am so sick of people making comments wondering if white was a wise choice.
Literally needs MORE red in the room, some accessories or a coffee table book with red cover. I love it.
It's absolutely STUNNING!!!!     Love it!   Disregard their opinions! It's YOUR HOME!
I think it's great!  They will find they like it in the end.  It adds color in a really tan room.  It's perfect.
Ours is emerald green velvet and both sets of parents find it pretty but weird, because it isn't floral or brown leather.
I love it!! It's definitely a focal point, but chances are if you're spending time in there it's likely spent on that sofa. Good thing for your family that it's yours and you paid for it, huh?!!
That looks so good
I think it's great.
I love it! Had a deep red living room many years ago and I still long for that intense color back in my life.
No, it‚Äôs sick
Who cares what anyone not living with you thinks??? If you and partner love it that‚Äôs literally the only thing that matters.
I feel like it goes well with your space. It‚Äôs red but not bright in your face red.
Color is the devil to the delusional.
My sectional is light blue. Screw em lmfaooo
It‚Äôs great. Sooo much easier than a neutral to decorate with. Good job.
‚ÄúOh, go on! You‚Äôre just jealous of my exceptional choice!‚Äù
I like it! If you like it, that is the important things.
I think it's pretty. Also, do what makes you happy - live by that.
I really like it! I feel like you should accessorize a little more to compliment it
Nope, it looks nice.
Love it!
How *dare* you choose a gorgeous sofa that you enjoy??

P.S.  It looks great and I love the color.  Plus, it complements your dog.
Years ago my sister bought a red sofa. Everyone loved it so much that the whole entire family bought red sofas, and then my sister bought a second red sofa to match the OG.  üòÇüòÇ  So many red sofas and all 6 households still have them.

Edit: clarity
No, I love it!
Its warm and it goes with your decor very well, and it‚Äôs much more immune to spills showing than a neutral couch would be
It‚Äôs gorgeous! It‚Äôs gonna look even more beautiful when the trees outside the door change color!
The most important member of the family clearly approves, no one else matters
LOVE it.   Color is good.  Boring ""colors"" are boring.

(Take that with a grain of salt...I'm a maximalist üòÉ).
Honestly, I never thought I‚Äôd be drawn to a red couch until I went to the store and this velvet rust/red couch oh it MOVED something within me, lol. Now it‚Äôs in my living room and I love it so much. You picked the couch, it‚Äôs your home, they can keep their opinions to themselves!
Im going crazy that the dog is using that brand new chaise lounge part as his bed to wallow on. I'd be losing my mind. But red couches are absolutely beautiful. Well done. More people should be buying red furniture. The accessories are endless. Christmas pillow covers will be lots of fun. And you can always bring in the neutral accessories. The tans, whites, browns etc. I like bold for the furniture and neutral for accessories. Some people usually do the opposite. Many are afraid of a red bold couch so they go neutral on the big furniture and try to add in ""pops of color"" lol with the pillows, rugs and curtains. But ""pops of color"" is no fun. My mom does it all the time. She's obsessed with just adding a pop of color to something.
It really goes well with everything else
Only the people who pay for it get a vote.
I think I have the same couch! I love it! Currently in storage though as I got married shortly after buying it and my husband prefers his. But we're moving soon and I'm so excited to get it out!! I had some family question it but I didn't understand their questioning because I loved it so much. I had burnt orange before the red and knew I wanted a similar color when shopping for it. It wasn't the ideal fit for my rental but the color was more important to me
I absolutely love it.
As a fellow red couch owner I think it looks great!
If you love it, then perfect it is. PS I think it‚Äôs lovely.
It's perfect cause you wanted it.  I think it looks amazing in that room.  I bought a deep purple couch once that I used until I wore it out.   It too was perfect.  

Enjoy your sectional and tell the haters to MYOB, they don't like it they can sit elsewhere. It's your home, not theirs.
Tell ‚Äòem all to hush. It‚Äôs awesome
I love it!
I love it. But I‚Äôm more than a little unconventional. So, no surprise.

I like it a lot and Im someone who tends to go neutral on things. it is cozy- youre right and it fits the room well. A red couch is hard to pull off but you totally did make it work beautifully. I don't see the issue?¬†
Do they live with you? Ignore them it‚Äôs nice AF. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love it! You're basically living our dream. üòÇ We're impatiently hanging on to our plain/neutral (super boring) couch until our kid is a little older and then we're replacing it with something colourful.
Love that red!
How can you be wrong? Do you like it? Is it comfy? I love it- but mine is teal velvet - so take that as you will .
No you are not crazy. That sofa is gorgeous. On a cold winter day when the snow, sleet, and blizzard are occurring, that sofa will be cozy and add warmth and brightness to a dull dreary day. Besides that, Doggo in the picture clearly approves of your purchase.
My living room has  a red sofa. In fact, I've replaced it with another  red sofa.
I like it a lot but it does limit colors to decorate with.
What you like is what matters most, red is good.
I bought a purple sectional so you get a thumbs up from me
I also have a red sofa.
We just bought a sage green sectional. Beige is boring!
Team Red Sectional here - tell them they can go sit somewhere else lol - my current struggle is finding an area rug that doesn't overpower the sofa it but brings the room together.
It is really nice!!
Gonna be great for Christmas!

I had a red sofa for years and I LOVED it. I‚Äôd still have it but we were severely downsizing.
My favorite sofa set i had for over 25 years was a deep raspberry. I didn't even think to care what anyone else thought.  Loving the red
Love it!
If the dog likes it, all is good.  Plus it is a very nice pop of color in fairly neutral room.
Great sofa love the color but replace those throw pillows. The contrast between the red and off-white is too jarring. Find a pattern you like that has a bit of red.
Canine approved, you're good to go!
I have an olive green couch. It‚Äôs very divisive but I love it!
I love it. So versatile! You can pair it with greens, yellows, blues, anything really!
My mom went nuts when I painted our living room that same shade of red. But it really worked! We had very high ceilings and long windows with shutters. Very New Orleans! I love your sofa! Enjoy it!!
Where did you get this and is it comfy?? This is exactly what I've been looking for!

Bring back bright colored couches!
Your home, your choice of decor.
My faith in humanity is restored every time somebody chooses something with some fucking COLOR amidst the bleakness of the all-white/grey/beige hellscape that is interior design these days. This is an excellent choice and it looks splendid.
It‚Äôs beautiful.  I‚Äôve been wanting a red sofa for a long time.
Love the sofa. Don‚Äôt love that there‚Äôs a millimeter between the coffee table and the sofa‚Ä¶
Love love love it. I want one now
I love red, and I always have red seating. I absolutely love that sectional.
No! It‚Äôs fab! I had a similar one for years and loved it! Enjoy your new sofa! Cosy vibes!
Color is better IMO.
It‚Äôs a nice red and the fabric choice gives the color dimension so it could easily work with many colors. Also there are things called couch covers of all sorts these days you can get if you get sick of the red.
It's a nice looking sofa.. as far as it being red I don't see any issue at all.
I find it to be rude behavior for anyone to make negative remarks about a home where they are a guest.  As the saying goes, ""if you don't like it, keep it to yourself.""  Guests should always look for something nice to say instead of what they don't like.   

By the way, I like the red sofa & the story of you & your partner chosing it ‚ù§.   What a lovely warm home.

It suits the space and overall aesthetic.
It‚Äôs so cool!!!!
The first piece of furniture my husband and I ever bought was a bright red sectional couch. It was cheap and nasty, and so uncomfortable that we eventually threw it out when we moved, but it looked great.
It's your sofa, if you like it, that's the important thing.  If your family doesn't like it, they can plunk their ass on the floor.
My Dream Couch!!!  LOVE your couch and the sweet puppers looking so regal on the end or it. I have always wanted a read couch since I worked in a PX that sold furniture. The put a red couch out on the floor once and I was totally in love. When it came time for me to get new furniture, years later, unfortunately I had to pick something that went with my SO lift chair so while I didn't get red, I did get TEAL! Enjoy your wonderful red couch and know that there are those of us who so envy it. (and your puppy, too!) Blessings.

P.S. I am a 76 year old Nana!
Red isn‚Äôt easy but that‚Äôs why it stands out. If you love it, don‚Äôt change it just to appease others, paint swatches look different through your eyes every time you sit down or flip a light on/off anyway. Red can be stunning if you let it anchor the room!
Red is awesome. I have a vibrant yellow sofa. How you style it matters more than the color, anything can work in the right setting!
We've had three red sofas but a little more on the darker side, one of them being leather. We preferred them because it added color and wore better against dirt. We finally broke and bought gray last time. Lol
Beautiful!  Very cozy!
It's gorgeous. I absolutely love mine!
I love it.  Doesn‚Äôt matter what your family likes or disliked.  Its your place.
Love it! Anything but grey.
After my divorce, and the splitting of the assets I got the beige couch and he got the ‚Äúleather‚Äù couch.

After I saved enough money I bought a red couch and nothing has ever made me and continues to make me happy.
it‚Äôs a matter of style. your style is a red sofa, and their style is a sofa of a different color (i REALLY like the red sofa tho)
I looove it!! Absolutely fabulous! 

I have a lot of red in my house, so many colors can be used with red.
I love it, it‚Äôs happy
It is GORGEOUS
I have a dark teal sofa in my family room.  My adult daughters are deciding who gets it when I die.  I don‚Äôt even feel bad.  No one has ever been rude enough to say they don‚Äôt like it. Too bad if they don‚Äôt.  And dog hair from a dog who sheds so much comes off.  I love your red.  Good choice. Your home looks comfortable.
NO plain and neutral is already all around. Great choice. It's not like you didn't know what you were doing. Look how good it looks on the dog's complexion.
I love it!!
Be bold and just chuckle at their silliness. Enjoy your lovely space ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lol tell them they are boring. I love it
My couch is fire üî• engine red. I love it üòª. Tell them to f&$k off.
I love it.   Why are people afraid of color?
It's fantastic. Let other people like boring colours. You are an original! 

I bought a bright teal sectional in 2021. I only got rid of it after two years because it was just too big for my living room. Now I have a green sofa!
What an odd thing for them to care about
I like it
We loved ours for about 6 years. Too limited trying to move or rearrange its awkward. The lounge section was over used. Everyone loved the lounge seat. It certainly made a statement in the room. Enjoy it!
Family going bonkers and a high styling' space, win - win. Love it. Had a a crazy overstuffed swoopy red sofa years ago, fun fun fun.
I just talked my best friend into a red couch because the rest of the room was SO BEIGE!  I also pushed for an area rug and now the room is so much ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù and actually has a personality!
Looks very nice. Much happier and easier than grey or beige.
I lke it,get fuller curtains,coffee table seems too big,nice room
Red is becoming more popular, 10 years they‚Äôll be singing a different tune.
India Hicks has a red sofa in her home in the Bahamas, I love her decorating with graphic textile and layering of local finds.
I like it.
I love it! I want a pink one but am hesitating because of family.
My couch is purple ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Everyone loves my couch.
No i like it
Love the sofa. It looks like a big, red, comfy couch. The kind you snuggle into or have great afternoon naps with the sun streaming in. 

I do wonder, however, if it feels out of place to some people because you don't have any supporting furnishings. For example, there is no red in the curtains, rugs, pillows or even artwork. It's a bright colour in a sea of neutrals.  It looks like a good start but needs supporting pieces. And the cushions do not look good against the red. Note, this thought is based on the one picture provided.
It‚Äôs your home, enjoy it.
No, that's a pretty sofa I like the color too
I like it. You‚Äôre the one who has to live with it. When they hate on it, ‚Äògood thing you don‚Äôt live here‚Äô or ‚Äòjust don‚Äôt visit and you‚Äôll never have to see it.‚Äô 

I‚Äôm considering getting a custom winter coat made. If I do, it‚Äôs gonna be red. Bold is fun sometimes
Your money . Your house. Your beautiful red sofa . None of their business.  Enjoy it !
Looks very cozy
I applaud your choice! Looks great!
No, it‚Äôs your statement piece. Bold, decisive and independent. Who cares what family thinks. Whose money paid for it? One reason to get one‚Äôs own place is the freedom to be yourself. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt like the sofa is free to leave and never come back.
Love it!
Wow, I luv it!! What's driving them bonkers about it? I mean, ok, yes, Scientifically, red & orange are seen to be a stimulate as opposed to the cooler hues, blue, green. Etc.

Maybe it's not just the colour but they're just missing ""their old"" couch. And this is a very big difference. 

But, as far as sofas goes, it's looks amazing and puppy seems to agree :-)
This could be useful on certain days!
Personally I love it, but I like bold colours and I'm making my bedroom look like a pirate captain's quarters and my living room like an old coffee storage room/warehouse someone moved into, and I intend to put up a pentagram for decoration somewhere so make of that what you will. I guess it might not appeal to people who prefer to be ""safe"" (or boring) with their decorating. I think it looks cozy and cute.
I love it, the color is beautiful. I‚Äôm so tired of brown, gray, black & blah.
Don't you dare get rid of it. It's lively and fun. I'm sick to death of all things gray and can't wait for the trend to go bye bye. There's so many ways to go here I almost don't know where to begin. Fun, textured rug? Lively print throw pillows? My personal favorite color combo is turquoise and red, but I would use it sparingly as too much would compete with the red sofa. Or you could go with something more muted like a jute or coir rug, and a tree trunk accent/ side table. Reds and tans play extremely well together! Good on you for having the courage to go against the flow.
Looks great.
You would be crazy buyi h a red sofa for someone elses home who doesn't  like red color. 

For your own place, u can buy what ever you like
I love it. One word of caution make sure the sun isn't bleaching it. I had a similar sofa a couple of years ago and the back against the window was a completely different color in a matter of weeks. I was so sad.
Hmmmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to go against the grain here and say sorry but I‚Äôm not a fan of the couch.  Personally, I loathe sectionals unless you e got a ridiculously large area and even then it would have to be a really stylish one.  They are too big, too awkward for guests and too domineering.  They are rarely stylish and look dated and worn in no time flat.  As for coloured couch‚Äôs - I think about sun fade and stains etc and whether it even goes with the rest of your houses decor. Otherwise it just looks like you‚Äôve gone out and bought a red couch because you want to appear funky and upbeat and fun but with little thought to how it will gel with your home - unfortunately that‚Äôs the vibe I‚Äôm getting from this couch.  

To make it work you‚Äôll need to change a number of things in the room.
I like the color, but always advise against buying a sectional, which so often turns out to be inflexible if you want to rearrange or move. But as long as it's working for you, no problem.  As others have asked, are the objections from people you live with or outsiders?
I love your red sofa! Life is too short to be boring and neutral!
No
Yes red is a bad choice. Red is energy and excitement. Psychology shows this. Red gets blood pumping - it‚Äôs evolutionary. Thus, a red sofa is an awful choice for a relaxing environment. If you have a salon conversation room, where people sit for 20 minutes before going out on the town, a red sofa could work. But not here. The good news is that you were brave enough to ask for help. So you are a better designer than most people already, because you‚Äôre willing to learn. I hope you have a wonderful time in your future design and decor efforts. Good luck.
Nah my partner and I bought this together with love. Its mostly my mid-30s friends and family and some older relatives. They seem to love the boring instagram/pinterest beige color palette. Yea I guess its none of their business, but I have a lot of company over at times so I do want them to feel relaxed. This holiday is going to be an interesting one that is for sure cause its probably be an on going topic for no apparent reason.
I agree! Let them have their boring couches!
I wouldn't dare go pink hahaha I need it a bit darker toned, like a darker violet, red, maybe even a burnt orange. But pink is waaay out of my range.
That sounds amazing tbh..
Thanks it really is an awesome find thanks! What color sofa do you own now?
P.S. I'd love it even more if you had a rug that had a matching shade of red in or some other complementary color from the room. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hahaha thats quite sassy and snarky I like it, will use!
That looks great with your rug
Ohhh lovely purple!!!! I love it with the rug :) And the arms look so comfy
Love the purple!
This is a very valid point that I will be making. Dog happy = we as a family is happy!
Yeah I bought a red sofa in the past and thought it was super cool at first. I grew to hate it.
Pics or it didn't happen.
Coral is a nice color too! But its a bit too light for my decorating style heh
This is so true about life being too short to be boring these days, I totally agree. Yea unsupported and decisive opinions seems to be all of the rage lately and is catching on to everything and anything it appears.

  
Ah that is true by not soliciting their opinions, but something you know I want to share something and hoped they like my choice =/
**Unless** this is like their own family, not the kind that visits occasionally, and they didn‚Äôt consult with them about it at all. I‚Äôd be so pissed if my husband bought a red couch lol
Thank you!
Hahaha true true
Agree that furniture doesn't last forever! I am in that mind sets as I get older and buying more quality furniture though. It gets expensive, but I am mindful of how long it should last and the main purpose the furniture is for (ex a sofa is meant to be sat on and not a decor)
I have a medium blue sectional!  People either love it or hate it.  But we are the ones who get to see it first thing in the morning, and when we get home from work, and spend football Sundays curled up on it, and we love it.  OP has great taste!
Yea I don't get having a lighter color and having to vacuum or spot clean my sofa all the time especially when I have kids (well they are quite grown now) and a dog.
Ahhh awesome! how long have you had it for? How are your cushions holding up??
Hahaha true the algos due huddle you into a little corner and you keep clicking upvotes and thats all they show you. Same with everything I guess including youtube and netflix & linkedin. 

Good insight though

>They seem to love the boring instagram/pinterest beige color palette.

That is called Filterworld. Algorithms drive homogeneity and flatten culture. 

the couch is awesome
I would not, could not ever object to a colourful sofa. Any colour is better than sad, dreary gray/beige. It looks great to me!¬†
Who cares lmao
They would poo their pants over my aqua peacock and floral print chairs, then. 

Life‚Äôs too short for boring colours. I‚Äôve owned beige couch but it at least also had a fun Aztec print (it was the 90s) 

I honestly hate that my main couch is charcoal colour, but I couldn‚Äôt get that in a cool print too.
mmm millennial greige üíï


I absolutely adore colourful sofas and this looks gorgeous. I'm with the other commenter that the wall colour might need re-doing now though!


my neighbour recently got a hot pink one that honestly I couldn't picture without hating but she's decorated with deep navies and tropical decor and it looks stunning in her home. we are so over greys and beiges now¬†
Writing this from my green velvet couch: your house, your choices, they can all learn some manners.
Tell the millennials in favor of grey to get out of Pleasantville. Their stepford wife sterile houses are a showroom complex, not a home of comfort nor love. 

The red looks great! üíú
Love the red! You want to love your space and feel it reflects the two of you. Shut the discussion down by changing the subject and ask them to move on.
I absolutely love it. I think it looks fantastic. Of course then I also bought a red sofa a few years ago and I love that as well, lol.

As you mentioned, it‚Äôs not your partner, but your friends and family well guess what, they don‚Äôt get to say in it
I decorated my home in very neutral, spa, earthy colors, but I love your couch!! I love the whole vibe of the room, even though it‚Äôs not how I decorate. Weird that they care so much how you decorate your own home
it‚Äôs not even a weird color or anything. it looks great
Put some Christmas üéÑpillows on your sofa, and I bet they won't even notice it!
I guess their algorithm hasn't caught up on latest trends yet. I feel like beige/neutrals are very much on their way out, replaced by exactly the type of color you've gone for.

When the trends trickle down and their algorithm catches up on the latest, they'll come around!
OP this episode of [Heavyweight](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/heavyweight/id1150800298?i=1000495637589) is officially for you. If your family gets weird at the holidays just play this for them and they‚Äôll be appeased.
The pendulum will slowly swing back to color and it will be like they always loved bold colors
It's called a conversation starter and that's a good thing.¬†
Do you do Christmas decorations? It would look absolutely fabulous with Christmas decor. But lovely year round.
I cannot even imagine the tackiness of people commenting negatively on your decor.  They must be jealous.
They can f‚Äî- off.
I was hesitant but it goes so well with my space and all of my plants!
My lifelong dream of having two sofas in my living room finally became a reality. (Silly, I know. But it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve wanted since I was a kid. üòÜ) I have two grey Italian leather sofas.

Here‚Äôs one
> Yea unsupported and decisive opinions

This is the key thing! People are turning this into a ""millennial grey, people are boring and allergic to colours"" Thing. It's just a rude person thing.

Look, I have chronic migraines, I sleep with blackout curtains. Highlighters can make me vomit from the pain it causes my eyes.

Your couch is lovely and autumny. I love it, personally, but even if I didn't, you know what I'd do? Shut up. I don't want people to feel bad about the stuff they own! It's yours, you bought it! You spent your own actual time and money on it, why would I add a negative memory to that? It's mean and none of my god-damn business.

And look, if it is genuinely so bright to the level it's causing me physical pain, I can ask if you have a neutral blanket to cover it in for a bit or another room I can rest my eyes in, or something. We'd work *something* out.

I am a boring and beige person out of health reasons. I'd love colours, but I know it can easily go from love to pain, so I play it safe and only add splashes with objects that can be hidden on bad days. In the end of the day, we all do what's best for ourselves, no reason for judgment on either end of the colour(ful/less) spectrum!
Well, it‚Äôs both. For sitting and for decor. But the main thing is that you have to like it. Everyone else gets to choose their own sofas not comment on yours. If you are a warm, happy, hopeful person, red is a good reflection of that. And even if you are not, as long as you like it, all is well. :)
I ‚Äúinherited‚Äù it from my parents. It‚Äôs a Lazy Boy sleeper. It‚Äôs far more comfortable to sit on than to sleep in!  But it looks and feels the same as it did when we got it three(?) years ago.
That looks super cozy! And your rug is nice matching! Great that you have plants but it isn't too much where it takes over the whole place
This is also a sympton of a broader term called refinement culture. Same thing making all cars grey and white, and why all logos look the same now. It‚Äôs really sad and I‚Äôm not even joking when I say it‚Äôs up to us to fight back against it by choosing color. Companies want everything to be dull because it‚Äôs less offensive and easier to sell, and there are lots of dull people these days.
Haha thank you! It was either red or green, and I red won the coin toss. Think we made the right choice!
Do you have a pic of your chairs that you could share? They sound incredible. I love colorful furniture, and aquas/teals/blues are my absolute favorites.
Hahaha thank you for teaching me the great term of millennial greige! I will definitely use that once in a while towards my friends while trying to be a bit snarky hehe

Wow I would never dare to be so bold as to choose hot pink or similar. We were deciding on something safer with either green or this darkish red. Think we chose well.

But I guess if you have the skill to decorate, you can make any color work!

What advice do you have on the wall color though?
I wish home decor companies would get the memo. I've been looking for a couch just like this and have had no luck. I'll take bright blue, purple, orange, green or even pink.
Right! Who rolls into a house as a guest and criticizes the decor lol? I wouldn‚Äôt even do that to familyü´†
Green velvet was one of our choices! Heard it is easy to clean and since we had a dog would be perfect. And be nice to decorate during the fall season, but dark red like mines is also great to decorate during the fall/winter!
Gorgeous, thanks for sharing! The matching kitties really bring it to life. Please give them pets for me
I LOVE that!  Great color and the rug is perfect.
Jesus, that‚Äôs gorgeous; nice looking pair of Siamese tooüòª
Ohmygosh I have the exact same lamp! 

Now THIS sofa knows how to work a room!  Looks stunning
FABULOUS. The cats are too!
I have a similar sofa.  I had it reupholstered locally.  Did you order yours in that color or have it done?
Oh I'm flattered but that's definitely not my living room, just inspo pic, people say my couch gives them a jump scare because of how ugly it is ü§° it's my husbands grandmother's couch

>Yea I guess its none of their business, but I have a lot of company over at times so I do want them to feel relaxed.  

If your guests can't relax on a red sofa they probably need medication.
I imagine the green was pretty, but this is such a beautiful color; and no matter what else you may change over time, you‚Äôre always going to have this great pop of color.
I‚Äôll go you one better and share the link, I did buy them here in Aus [Peacock chairs](https://www.eurekafurniture.com.au/shirley-blue-occasional-chair?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=pmax_online_sales_all_products_sept2025&utm_content=asset_group_1&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=PMaxOnlineSales&sku=CHRSHIRLEYWING&keyword=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22931919512&gbraid=0AAAAADSZ9ELR2qUK-1mhfSy55m2g9ImuD&gclid=Cj0KCQjw267GBhCSARIsAOjVJ4EkZ7ariiAnFOsEfCAWw0oU0Rc6lqdbUGf6bITWT5Lpox5-itXLqIoaAhp6EALw_wcB)
if you want to go bold, deep navies or teals, especially with all the natural light. calm and relaxed, maybe look into lighter shades of brown or sage greens?


the rich red would go nicely with accents of gold, too, if you go the deeper darker shades.¬†
lmao we bought the sofa a year before we adopted a puppy! but if I‚Äôm very honest most of the stains come from us eating dinner, not going to blame that on him. we are both currently napping on it.
Is it actually easy to clean? Cause I‚Äôve always wanted a green velvet couch but thought cat hair might cling to it too much. 

I have the boring gray couch myself, but only cause I‚Äôm not sure what color my family room will be in a year or two so I wanted flexibility
Thank you from me and from the kitties!
Thank you very much - we love colorful furniture and paintings!
Yay for our matching sexy Art Deco lady lamps!
We had it done. It was thrifted and the original fabric was royal blue velvet. It was also much lower to the floor so we added new longer legs when it was reupholstered.
They are exquisite! Thank you for sharing!
I love her so much! She was a gift from a friend that also has one, we both in NZ- she sure does get around! I think I shall rename her Miss Sluttypants
That's awesome...
They‚Äôre even comfy, which is nice
You found the Holy Grail of chairs!"

Kind of. You need a sander, start with 60/80 grid, then go up to 120/180, then more and more until it gers smooth. And then paint it.

What's the best way to arrange the table/kitchen to allow this?","How to fit kitchen table for 2 and baby?

We've got a small kitchen in our rental and I'd like to start using the table after our baby's born.

What's the best way to arrange the table/kitchen to allow this?

Start by cleaning up and decluttering and you should have more room
It seems like you lack storage, which means that you end up piling things on the table. 

Can you add more shelving to the laundry area off the kitchen? Or use storage baskets for smaller items above the cabinets?

I would move the dog crate to be up against the chest freezer and pull the table away from them a little bit. Add wall shelves above the crate and a solid top on the crate for some surface area for dog-related things.
Can you rearrange the cage to a different area?
Hard to see how much room is elsewhere in the house but: Move the freezer chest (?) to the wall along side the door. Or into the garage if you have one. Add shelves above it. Find a new spot for the dog crate. Find an old cabinet on FB marketplace or thrift store and put it just inside the FR to use as a pantry. How much room is in your laundry room? Add shelves in there. Babies take up A LOT of space. You‚Äôre going to need to figure out storage solutions.
Turn the freezer the other way so it‚Äôs mostly on the other wall. Get the stuff out of there. You have an okay table.
Well first you need to clean up. That should be your main concern.
That's what I'm working on today. I feel like there's not going to be a lot of room with the chest freezer and the table unless we're able to move the table somehow.
You're right about the table. We use it to handwash, unload groceries, and do food prep because there's not much surface space.


There does not appear to be enough room for another shelf, the washer opens up almost right under it. We want to build 3 shelves over the chest freezer but that's after I go back to work.


We've got some items on the cabinet tops but are trying to limit purchases as¬†I'm taking 2 months off for baby.
This is the best place at the moment because it's out of the way and we don't want the dog to be upstairs.
Unfortunately we don't have a garage, I wish we did. I'll ask my husband if he can't try to readjust the freezer tonight.


Other than the porch this is the only place the dog crate can go because everywhere else we would be tripping over it, we don't allow the dog upstairs.


Our laundry room is also small, I can't even stand in front of our dryer because of the wall. It has one shelf but that's currently where our cleaning supplies and things like the mixer are. We are hoping to put some shelves over the chest freezer to create some more space but are not quite there yet.
It is, I'm just getting to the point where my energy levels are getting lower and I can't do much. I've only got 6 weeks left before baby might come.
If it's in budget, places like goodwill have a ton of storage baskets. 

If it isn't in the budget, check your house for shipping boxes and shoe boxes that fit the space. See if any neighbors have boxes, or cut down diaper boxes to fit as you go through them. It's a good temporary option
i don‚Äôt know what magic solution you want here. you can‚Äôt move the freezer, you can‚Äôt move the cage‚Ä¶we can‚Äôt create more space for you. you have to get rid of things to make more space. there is no way to compromise there. can you get rid of the freezer, why isn‚Äôt the existing freezer enough?

never mind. i see from your other posts that you‚Äôre tithing $450 a month and spending $700 a month on groceries and spend all of your days judging people who get abortions. people get abortions because they can‚Äôt afford babies, just like you can‚Äôt afford a nice apartment with a decent amount of space because you make idiotic financial decisions. be well.
I never said I couldn't move the freezer, just that there's not a better place for the dog cage. The table is the only piece of furniture that has a space big enough for the cage to go under, it would be blocking a walkway anywhere else.


We could move somewhere else with more space but rent is under 1k here and I'd rather deal with a smaller unit than spend more.


We already bought the freezer as our precious rental's freezer couldn't even store a pizza without angling it. We also shop twice a month and I do frozen meal prepping so having the extra freezer allows us to store meat and bread, prepped foods, and items that don't fit well in the small freezer.¬† We wouldn't be able to move it anywhere even if we wanted to.


I'm glad you saw I'm trying to make good changes financially just like I am with space and storage."

Thank you! 

We have white dove in our house and really love it.
I think Dove white.  It‚Äôs bright and cheerful the others look a little muddy.
You need to find out what your light temperature is and how the paint will appear in your space. 

I have Alabaster on a really long wall that crosses into a bunch of different light conditions. It‚Äôs perfect for the space but this white is effectively YELLOW in some light. In my house it looks white, you‚Äôd never guess that it‚Äôs actually solidly a soft almost buttercream color.

And BM Swiss Coffee is very very similar. I have it as well and I actually patch my Swiss coffee walls with Alabaster because the Swiss coffee is in a few rooms from the previous owners and the two paints are close enough match in my specific light conditions.

All that to say, white paint is truly every color of the rainbow and you really need to determine how it will look in your space.
Snowbound is our current ""white"" for walls and such.  I use other colors for accent walls, but basically every room in our house has at least some Snowbound in it.  I like it.
I painted my floor Swiss coffee. It is very, very white. Does not really come across as it does jn the swatch, though I have a lot of natural light
What color is your furniture, any rugs etc
White dove really changes depending on the lighting so test a large swatch at all the angles throughout the day. 

With that being said, I love it in my home because it feels cozy and complex, never cold and boring.
I really like White Dove.  

And this just reminded me of Steel Magnolias in the best way-
‚ÄúMy colors are blush and bashful‚Äù
‚ÄúHer colors are pink and pink‚Äù
I am a fan of White Dove it is a good base and compliments other colors if you want at color later.
Look at Sherwin Williams Greek Villa
What‚Äôs the LRV of the first two colours?
I was between white dove and BM Alabaster (slightly warm white with pink undertone) - both looked really beautiful in our east and wear facing rooms. Weirdly though white dove pulled a strange undertone in some of the eastern walls in the shade so def try it on multiple walls.

I ended up going with BM alabaster (which is not nearly as warm as SW alabaster) and I LOVE it!!
I used alabaster outside in satin over brick it took 4 coats. It looks stunning..it was grey ish tan brick. It looks 10000 times better. If I would of used paint sprayer it wouldn't of taken so many coats. Lesson learned
I have Alabaster on all my trim and doors inside my house. The walls are Casablanca from Sherwin Willliams in the main living areas. It is a peaceful and calming combo.
Most of my house is snowbound and it‚Äôs just perfect. It‚Äôs neutral but still warm and not at all stark.
I painted our kitchen cabinets Benjamin Moore White Dove and it always looks good in every light üòä
All four are solid choices! Snowbound feels crisp, Alabaster is warmer, Swiss Coffee leans creamy, and White Dove is soft and versatile. Depends if you want bright/modern or cozy/warm.
Thank you all for the great feedback!!!
Same here. BM chantilly lace white ceilings (flat), white dove on the walls (matte) and trim (satin). Alabaster is also a great choice- Ive used it before and the two colors are very close.
Grey‚Ä¶ hopefully buy new stuff eventually lol
I used that as the trim color in my bathroom. It‚Äôs pretty but it reads VERY white.
Idk what the means ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Light reflective value. It‚Äôs 82 and 83 for the Benjamin Moore colours but not included with the Sherwin Williams. It indicates how much light gets reflected. The higher the number, the brighter it appears
I just checked and those are also 82 and 83. My pick would be Swiss Coffee"

TV is too high
I‚Äôd definitely put the tv on the wall where the bookshelf is‚Äîit will be much cozier that way
put it against the wall where the book cases are
It depends on your furniture

Either way would be fine. Above the fireplace isn't so bad unless your TV is too big for that space (edges jut out) or its too small for the height

Then it depends on the couches you have and any other seating/coffee tables etc 

Then you need to consider stuff like power points and cable hiding etc. All that is considered with the TV above the fireplace, so it might be too annoying to shift. Especially if you care about antenna TV

Only real way to find out is to move in and put your furniture down and then see what you like better and if its worth putting in the effort/energy/money to make it happen
Love the natural light here, so glare shouldn't be too much of an issue.
I put together a quick visualization using ReimagineHome AI. I work with them, so I thought I‚Äôd help you see how it might look. The TV on the right wall does look good, but just a heads-up: you‚Äôll likely get a lot of glare from that window unless you keep the curtains down while watching. Keeping that in mind, I think your wife‚Äôs idea of mounting the TV above the fireplace might actually be the more practical choice.

https://preview.redd.it/pcsq3d2fv8rf1.jpeg?width=1392&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1802e771c6498e674d3bfae77191eb0fd20fe7e8
The current position looks to allow someone in the kitchen to also see the TV . If moved you would no longer be able to do task or clean up and watch a show.
TVs just don't belong above fireplaces. It's tacky, makes for a terrible viewing angle, potentially bad for the TV, and it's tacky.
this is the way to go
I don''t know about this.. I think it'd be weird to be facing the tv and also facing the front door and hallway. Like as soon as you walk into your house, anyone watching tv is also gazing directly at you simultaneously? When you just got home? I don't know, maybe I'm just shy.. but yeah above the fireplace isnt looking great so this might be the only option
and that shouldn't be prioritised
That too
Haha I totally get what you mean that ‚Äúbeing watched when you walk in‚Äù feeling is real üòÑ. It‚Äôs a good point and definitely something to consider with the layout. I think the above-fireplace option solves a couple of issues at once: it avoids that direct sightline from the door *and* helps with the glare problem.

That said, if facing the entry still feels awkward, another option could be to slightly angle the seating or create a little divider (like a console table or plant) near the entrance to soften that direct view. It‚Äôs all about small tweaks to make the setup feel natural.
Why? You don‚Äôt know how they use their tv. I am only pointing out a reason to consider why the current position may be positive for them."

It's bulky and takes up a lot of room visually, but it's not physically too big. 

You could try to put it a few inches in front of the window and put the TV on the opposite wall to keep the pass through more open.
It‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôre overthinking it. Lol
I'd probably center it in the room depending on what's in the empty space. Centered, you could have probably done a bigger couch. Definitely not too small.
rotate it and put it under the window
Add a sofa table to the back and you're good
Ceiling too low.

Option A is the only one that makes sense to me.
https://preview.redd.it/hwfhvzb6h6rf1.png?width=2388&format=png&auto=webp&s=d15da37384728de09d86f782045dcbb8aad1d793

How about C?
Must be A!
Personally I would rather to integrate the kitchen wall with the sink in design A. The full wall of cabinets looks a little off.
A is the only sensible choice, it works, while B doesn‚Äôt have a cohesive plan and looks quite disjointed.

Edit: I‚Äôm editing to say I do like the seats at the island so someone can sit there and chat with whoever is doing the cooking, so I would only keep that aspect of B but everything else from A.
Design A for sure. The other isn‚Äôt functional but I hate the cabinet layout on the kitchen side. It should have countertops. Put the range where the sink is in B and the sink centered in the island. The other side of the island should have seating. Add a range above the stove, if venting to the outside is possible.
Why is option B even considered here? It's an obvious choice, option A, smooth transition between places, make food -> eat food -> rest. Option B crosses those spaces without any advantage whatsoever. Want a fireplace? The TV can turn into a Monalisa Harry Potter live painting with a fire in the background. Want to eat dinner? Too bad, you have to move the uncomfortable couch around and take out the foldable table and chairs, and deal with the undo process afterwards as well. If you want to make the most out of a well sun lit space, turn the couch around with enough space to let anyone rush from the kitchen to other places, so it's facing the window, add a low coffee table and some bookshelves as room dividers. You have enough space to have fun with it too, put an indoor swing and you can feel the breeze when the windows are open, or if it's a balcony it even extends the hang out place. What about an expose for a hobby? Turntable? Oil Painting? Puzzles? How else do you like to enjoy your weekend sun while you brew coffee/tea, as it fills the room with a peaceful colder breeze and the smell of sun lit curtains? Same with the kitchen, which doesn't look very functional in my opinion: take out food from the fridge -> wash -> cut -> cook -> dishwasher -> plate storage . These actions have to have their own mini station, and it has to be arranged as in how someone moves around the kitchen. In this island type of kitchen you take out food from the fridge -> place it on the island -> separate and wash -> back to the island to cut -> cook -> and wash. Lots of turning around with unreachable high storage even on your tip toes. Ballerinas don't dance in the kitchens with messy floors. Went down the spiral there a bit, but I hope I got the point across, design for the individual's personality after function meets the needs.
I would do A but put the appliances (stove, oven, sink) on the wall. If you REALLY need more storage add some more cabinets on the wall where the TV is in option B.
Why would you have your sofa facing your closet in any scenario

I wanna watch tv not dust settling on cabinetry
A
A
Living space a + kitchen b BUT flip flop induction and sink location
I really like A .  I've had  a home plan in my head for years and that's very much it.
Is this an apartment?
A1 with ottoman on other side of couch.
Neither kitchen, they are both a poor design. Who wants to use a sink while staring at the wall? I think a sink in the island is much more functional, cooktop centered on wall behind it with an oven (not shown in your renders) possibly a m/w drawer in island?-- the blank wall where it says A1 is what? If island is shortened, you could put a bank of shallow depth cabinets there.
LR A it's good but move the tall cab by TV to other end so people can see the TV from the dining table.
design a looks way more sleek and modern but design b has a more open feel to it - wish there was a third option with a compromise between the two
Option B seems to add a ton of storage, so there‚Äôs that benefit. But  overall A is just much more reasonable of course
Yes so B was considered because we have a big dining area in the room next to the living area.
Just to be clear: ~~kitchen from A + living room from B~~ and, if needed, additional cabinets where the TV is in B, right? If so, absolutely agree.

+1 on the storage. Do you really need that much?

Edit: living space from A + kitchen from B
That just your opinion which is not accurate
Nah I think I got my pictures mixed up a bit.

Just looking at the first picture, I would:

Leave living space as is.

Move appliances to the wall next to the island (instead of the walls of cabinets).

Add extra storage if needed on the back wall at the end of the island, where it says A:1
Yep, that's a simpler way to put it :D living space A+ kitchen B"

Why is the fridge in the pantry!
Sliding doors? You could have double sliding doors so you can have both doors to the right for the most part so the fridge is accessible but you can slide both doors over to the left to access the pantry and you can close both doors when you want for an overall tidy look
Move/replace the fridge someplace else. Put in bifold or double doors  to match the other kitchen cabinetry and ensure they are flush with the outside of the wall (so reveal is inside). Put open shelving all around with deeper shelves at the bottom and worktop at 900mm height and you have your very own walk in pantry that will store loads of stuff, give you more prep space but that can be hidden away when not cooking.
Can you install a twin fridge freezer setup and then you can use the storage above it?

Ooh I have some thoughts, but also have a couple of questions! 
- Does the wall jut out 40cm on both sides? Or is one side shorter? Hard to tell from your sketch. 
- is the total length of the space 185cm?
- how deep is the fridge - looks like it‚Äôs 85cm based on your sketch? 
- how much clearance do you need back from the fridge for the door to open fully? 
- is there anywhere else in the kitchen that the fridge can be moved to, or is the pantry the only practical place to put it?
Can you cut into the wall to remove the ‚Äújutting out‚Äù part?  Removing the obstacle would let you maximize the usable space.  Even better would be to also remove the left wall entirely.
Nowhere else to put it! Dunno what they were thinking when they built it in the 70s haha
That's a good idea, we'll look into it! Thanks
No other space for the fridge to go unfortunately. But would be great a idea if we could!
That looks quite good! We'd need a full size fridge though. We could have the fridge off to the left, and just have a wall of cupboard next to it +/- the bench with bifold doors or something
- It juts out about 15cm on the other side.
- Yep roughly 185cm
- Fridge is 70x70cm, but 85cm allows for the door to open and circulation space around the sides 
- Nowhere else for the fridge unfortunately
We could do that, not quite ready for those kind of renos yet, but maybe in the future we'll look at doing it
Do you rent or own?

I thought maybe you could pull the fridge forward and rotate it through 90 degrees then you don't waste all that space just for door opening

I would have the fridge open into the pantry (the door is the thick blue line in my sketch) and then build in L shaped shelves (green) if that leaves enough clearance to open the fridge? Down the track if money permits, you could extend the small jut out wall so it fully covers the side of the fridge (pink).

The section of shelves that sit behind the fridge can be used to store less frequently used foods/appliances, so that the hassle of reaching behind to access them isn‚Äôt a common occurrence.
We own, just moved in
Yeah that could work, hadn't considered doing that, thanks!

Use fillers to extend the cabinetry material up to the higher ceiling, I don't think the height difference is enough to warrant specialized treatments or extending the bulkhead unnecessarily.
I imagine once the dry wall and paint is done you won‚Äôt notice much! Turning that little area into a breakfast nook with built in benches under the window would be cute.
Depends on your style of kitchen but if a wood beam would fit (can be faux wrapped to lessen weight), that goes directly in front of the drop ceiling which will not decrease height in any way but it will visually hide that space better. Example of this is in episode 3 or 4 of Bargain Block New Orleans. It was a pretty great way to tie it all together.

Once you‚Äôve rearranged the furniture, consider adding a much bigger and more colorful  rug. It will anchor your room. It‚Äôs a warm room that I like a lot. Good luck!
- please consider more intentional open storage or utilizing closed storage. The standalone bookcase is so sad, please get rid of it.

- I would orient my living room to focus on the best features: the fireplace and windows. I would use an L or chaise couch that uses the far side open wall. 

- you neeeeeed color. The white and grey really steals any vibe or coziness from the room - consider painting it all white if you want bright, but bringing in color through art, design and pillows.
Your current layout feels kind of cramped to me, so I don't think it's a bad thing that it'll feel more open with the sofa swapped.
Turn on the lights and open blinds. Natural light is amazing
Think about creating space where conversation is easy.   
  
I'd center the large sofa across from the window on the wall that currently has the TV, then center the other sofa in the remaining space along the same wall where it is right now. Move the white bookshelf to between the door and the TV. Get rid of or move the chair to a different room. If you want to have a chair, find a much smaller profile one. 

With two couches, you don't have to worry about it feeling too open, but if it feels off balance, add some floor to ceiling curtains that have some weight.
Go ahead and flip it to test it. Don‚Äôt remove the TV yet and see how you like the flipped scenario. Then remove the TV as you wish.
I think big couch to TV wall, smaller couch centered on its current wall, and maybe add two chairs and a small table between them in front of the big window. I‚Äôd steer clear of big overstuffed armchairs, but maybe something smaller and slimmer, to not overwhelm the space but add something that helps with the empty feel. And imagine how cozy to curl up on a chair looking out the window and with a fireplace roaring!
I have an email architect if you need to talk back and forth about your layout with someone who has an architecture degree. You can also do some self study by finding Slowhome channel on Youtube, and PlanAttack with mathew on Instagram (he also offers layout design online). That said, you did very well my accurately measuring the room! You also need to measure the furniture! Then apply standard principles and allow for standard pathway clearances. One idea I considered was using the back of the couch for shoe storage if you flip it with the back towards the door entrance.
Whys that chair covering the door?
You could try compartmentalizing the room by having a sofa come out perpendicular to the tv wall about where your white shelving unit is. The door/hallway/fire place seems awkward to try and include. Making the living room its own space will make it feel cozier. I‚Äôd ditch the open shelving unit, maybe a cabinet console under the front door wall window for your things. A larger area rug and sleeker coffee table.
[removed]
Well if you do choose to go radical and get new furniture what I would suggest you consider is not placing couches against the wall at all. Paint the walls dark blue and get a slimmer profile leather couch in saddle leather and two chairs. The couches will overlap will be standing with its back against the TV wall and the chairs will have their backs facing the window
The problem here is the fireplace. This will seem radical but in my opinion you should put a wall up to create a hallway where the door opens up to and remove the fireplace from the room. This will give you another wall to place a TV¬† on. You could even make the wall be a built in TV unit with doors to hide the TV in when not in use.
Also set the TV down lower.
Also if that door is not used (just because you have a big armchair in front of it) why not remove the door and put in a single pane of glass to allow loads of light into the hallway.


It would mean removing some furniture but it might work for you

No longer have to fantasize about how to decorate what you want, you can intuitively turn your ideas into reality
This could get more better,  
here is an amazing interior designers you may connect with them or visit them for amazing designs suggestions:- shift-interiors
And when you do move furniture, don't have it squished back into the walls. Give 6"" + of breathing room so that it feels more natural / as a part of the room instead of as a part of the wall.
We moved it upstairs temporarily as a nursing chair for my wife. We normally don‚Äôt use that door anyways.
Thanks for the suggestions! I like the compartmentalizing idea. I think maybe I‚Äôd try to do it on the opposite wall though as we don‚Äôt use that exterior door very often and we go from the hallway to kitchen to living room often. I appreciate your thoughts!
here is another design

Strongly suggest some curtains for the windows. Will draw focus to the windows/views, add some visual weight to the upper walls (right now most of the visual weight is low around the furniture), and could add a pop of color to the room. I‚Äôd recommend curtains that are mounted high (above the top of the window) to make the room feel taller and more open.
I‚Äôd move a sofa to the tv wall and get a couple of chairs in swivel bases to sit near the front window. That way they can either be facing the sofa for conversation or face the window to look out. 
Put a. Table between the chairs, esp if you plan to lose the coffee table. 
Our house is full of book readers so I would consider a low bookshelf under the window where the loveseat is. And some plants

The mantle pictured isn't floating, it has supports under it. 

Holes can be drilled into tiles with no problem. The problem will come from finding an existing support structure behind the tiles that can carry the supports for the mantle. 

Is the fireplace tiled on just the front or is there drywall on the sides? I would cut an exploratory hole in a side to see what the structure behind looks like. If the existing structure is adequate you can take measurements from that hole and then drill the holes in the tile in the correct places for the supports.
Regardless of how it's done I don't think it'll look good. Wood mantle on a grey tile with a thick silver trimmed gas insert fire. If you want the look of the 2nd pic go for it in it's entirety.¬†
That being said you can approach this a number of ways. They manufacture hollow mantles that you can screw to a 2x4 that you fix to the tile. The hollowed mantle slips over the 2x4


https://www.azfauxbeams.com/old-barn-faux-wood-mantels/
You can certainly add a mantle, you just need to find your studs and use a drill bit for tile. You‚Äôre going to want to go slow and use water while you drill.
I think the main focus here should be design. Making sure that the mantle is in harmony with the tile you have and the overall look you‚Äôre trying to achieve, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve thought of that

Tile all the way around, I assume drywall underneath.

I am not opposed to brick facing it.
Thank you. My main thought has been whether I am stuck with the tile as is, or is this a complete do over. The original hardwood is a beautiful non red smoky dark oak, and I don‚Äôt mind the mix of tones. I‚Äôm not a fan of the silver gas fireplace, but that‚Äôs a problem for a different day. üòè
I never understood why people insist on mounting their TV over the fireplaceÔøº. Hurts my neck just looking at the picture.
You sound like our contractor.  His work, though, stands for itself.
Hopefully its not drywall underneath but tile board. There are bits for drilling tile you go slow and use water. Find a stud or use toggle anchors.
I think thin veneer style is the way.  Also consider old Chicago thin brick.  For nominally more you can source from vintage supplies. Did backsplash & accent wall in weathered red with light gray mortar, and effect so authentic & antiqued I want to redo stone fireplace in it.
I think you can dress it well enough so that it becomes a backdrop for other things to become the main focus. A mantle will help you start that progress, but above that, you can add a cool mirror or a painting, or a sculpture. Maybe some tall, slender vases on the side(s), cool cabinetry/millwork like you mentioned earlier. Idk there‚Äôs plenty to do with it, I think!
To be fair to OP, he did say hes just talking about the mantle, not the TV. I would hope there won't be a TV up there.
Also turns what should be *living* room into TV room.
I love that washed out brick look
Agreed, which is why I mentioned that there will be no TV in this room. This room is for living, lounging and petting the dog.

I would pull the door even farther out. Interior space is so much more valuable and you want a little space on the entry.
the mock up looks GREAT! absolutely love it!
Did the designer give you a floor plan of the proposed changes? I‚Äôm confused by the interior architecture shown in the renderings vs the as built photos.
Bringing the front door closer to the sidewalk works so much better and it would create an actual foyer hallway inside.
Make sure to pull dimensions first. Is there enough room to go from a door and a window to a door and two windows?
LOVE! i think the mockup does a great job of mixing styles. however, i would maybe consider a lighter wood door. but i love the angles. but also think about where you would put lighting in the doorway
3 and 4 are great
hmm, i hadn't thought of that. I'll talk with my contractor--i suspect there may be an issue with framing and i believe this as an exterior wall may sit on a footing so if i move it then i may need to address that as well...which can obviously get very costly (not including flooring/drywall/etc changes on the inside). It's an interesting idea i hadn't considered---thank you!!
Thank you so much!
[deleted]
Hi! Unfortunately he did not. I did look over the pictures and it seemed consistent. Would you mind sharing what seems to be off? 

As a note, the cathedral ceiling in the rendering is new from what exists today. It's what I'd like to add since we are putting in a larger door and have to do some structural work in the attic...I thought it'd be nice to have something a little more significant at the entryway (assuming it looks okay)
Is there a general design rule on mixing wood tones? While you can't see it, there is the wood siding that you see in my current entranceway in other spots throughout the exterior of my house. So, I'm pretty locked in on that color for the exisiting siding. For the door, should I aim to make it lighter than the exisiting siding or darker (this is one of my biggest struggles for this project is how to make sure the door and the exterior siding are complimentary).  
  
For lighting on the doorway, do you mean exterior lighting? If so, in my current set up (first two pictures). I do have a hanging light. I noticed that the designer omitted that light in the mockup and I've sent them a note to ask if that was intentional or an oversight. Regardless, i do have the opportunity to change the lighting for the entranceway. Do you think i should do something different than what i have now? I'm very interested in any suggestions, especially with examples as i'm pretty poor with visualizing things---i really appreciate it!  
  
Oh, one last thing, one of my other big struggles was to figure out what to do with my current crown molding. As you can see in the first two pics, i have crown. I can potentially change it, but am unsure what to use as i'm going for a more modern aesthetic. Also, I am planning to NOT use any crown in the cut out for the cathedral ceiling---is that okay?

Sorry for the length and i appreciate any thoughts!!
Thank you!!! All these posts definitely make me feel better as I have a narrow window to request changes--so far it seems in general there's no suggestion for a major change in the renders
That‚Äôs because those are the mock ups are the first two slides are the before photos lol.
What is happening with the doors leading into the room on the right? Are they moving? How do they interact with the new hallway? 

How much further is he proposing to move the entry wall? How does that affect the existing walls and doors? How does the new cathedral ceiling relate to what appears to be a beamed ceiling in the next room?

I would hesitate to approve any of this based on these renderings since they don‚Äôt appear to reflect the current conditions as well as the new ones.
Um, I‚Äôm aware of that. It‚Äôs in the description.

Please post a correct floorplan not  a mirror image  - thats way confusing.

  
1 - definitely steal half of the panty for an entry way drop zone

2 - increase island depth, def have cabinets to the ceiling.

3 - keep that corner free for casual dining, maybe a small round table and some upholstered chairs.

4 - def add some closed storage underneath the shelves - where else is the monopoly going to sit?

The peninsula feels like it cuts you off from the pantrys and trash can. The new openings are still pretty wide at 5-6ft. 

Best advice I can give you is to tape it out on the floor and see how it feels in your house.
What do you really get out of ""making the kitchen bigger"" in that way? You can fit one extra cabinet to the side of the fridge. You don't get any extra work space, or any accessible cabinet space on the other wall, unless you're prepared to take out the bar. If you're thinking about replacing the bar with an island, then I could see a case for it.
Thank you very much for replying

I forgot to change it, the Trash can and the (3 drawer) on the peninsula will be switched

Let me know your thoughts. I currently have less than 20 sq ft of countertop was one reason for opening it up like this, the peninsula/ bar stool area was for teenagers mostly 

I was concerned with it being too many cabinets and also I liked the 8/9' walkways but I agree the 5/6' openings arent terrible

Got it. My first reaction is that you could get 90% of the benefit on the right-hand side if you built the bar and lower cabinets but not the wall and shelves.

It seems to me that the wall extension on the left would close off sight lines a lot more than the one on the right would. If you don't want to separate the foyer/living room/dining room from the kitchen/family room, don't do the one on the left. But if you do want to separate them (personally, I would), the extension is a great idea.
ahh ok, I very much appreciate your insight and you saying you personally would separate. I have been trying to make decisions on my own and if you look at my post history ive posted alot about this kitchen situation, and with feedback, came up with what I posted above

That's the general idea, but it looks like you've extended the right wall a little bit in that render. I would leave it exactly where it is now, which will give you better visibility/communication between the family room and the kitchen.
Hey thank you for your repeated help. This is where it currently is on existing kitchen layout, I added a dimension on this one to show/ help. Current wall is 9'

Oh wow that is crazy about the fridge placement! Maybe scoot the peninsula further into the eat-in area, and move the fridge one cabinet space left so it will actually be inside the kitchen area.

I thought I‚Äôd come back and show you the finished result. Excuse the unpainted ceiling in some of the pictures.

I will never ever ever design someone a space with a step in a wet area. Aesthetics aside, it's so unsafe. Functionality and safety come first.
It‚Äôs lovely and I‚Äôm questioning the use of space here. Like, why have a huge tub and separate shower and one single sink with no counter space?  

That said, I hope that it exceeds your expectations of it
I like it, it's gorgeous. I guess it's a very European design based on the other comments, but I love a separate bath and shower. A free-standing bath has that luxury feel to it.
Ooooo that's pretty suite.....
My biggest gripe is the chrome trim. Should have used something closer in color to the tiles or had a plain metal trim powder coated to match. This is very jarring, especially around the window.
I like the layout with the tub as a focal point. I‚Äôm having trouble understanding the three colors of light bulbs. One color will help the space feel more cohesive than three disjointed spaces next to each other.
That's very very nice
I think it looks stunning.
Looks like a spa, def would stay here for hours
Nice job op
Bidet is missing üò¨
Yeah I get that, but the tiles you use should be wet rated which takes the safety issues away from it.
Not sure why you‚Äôd need counter space? I like a more minimalist living where things are stored away rather than on counter tops. Works for us I suppose. 

The huge tub is for zoning out and relaxing. The shower is for quickly getting washed. Suppose they serve different purposes?

I personally love it, but each persons needs are different.
No honestly i agree. Imo it looks very uncomfortable and unusable. Tub looks awful. The glass Shower would drive me crazy. Gonna be so cold with that window and empty space. Toothpaste will gather the bottom of the flat bottom sink. I would say it‚Äôs the visual completely overriding the actually beautiful. But it doesnt look that visually great either. Sorry op.
We don‚Äôt have them in the UK. They‚Äôre actually very very heavily regulated here.
It does not. All tiles must be wet-rated, yes, but that is a separate issue from structural risks. One does not mitigate the other.

Source: I'm a trained interior designer
Again, I‚Äôm glad it works for you. And most people have stuff they use in the bathroom (toothbrushes, makeup, hair gel, etc). Again, if this is sufficient for your needs, wonderful. If you‚Äôre not butting against your partner for time at the sink in the morning, fantastic. 

Design is very personal, and I‚Äôm glad this works for you.
Explain more about the structural risks.
Yeah, all that goes in the draws under the sink. There is a ledge that can be used under the mirror for stuff like that whilst in use. 

We‚Äôd have liked a double sink but it‚Äôs was a sacrifice for the other things we wanted more. 

I agree, design is very personal.
Can the bathtub levitate? If not, how do you clean the tub and the floor behind? It feels painful
Huh? It‚Äôs free standing, you just run the mop around it and wipe around it. It‚Äôs accessible from all angles.
Accessible is not convenient
ü§£
Just wanted to jump in here and say I LOVE IT. I kept finding myself agreeing with all of your statements. I too hate clutter and put everything in drawers when not in use. My partner and I also share a single sink, (the audacity!) even though we have enough room for double sinks...Counter space trumps faucet use. And just to pile on....I absolutely LOVE your tub area. As someone who also ""zones out"" in the bath I love how you made that space intimate. Ignore the haters, you crushed.

Wait, are you my partner? ü§£ 

Obviously I agree with everything you‚Äôve said. Who‚Äôs want two sinks anyway? I can hardly be bothered to clean one."

I have so many questions.¬†

1. Who did the design work? Highly minimalist spaces have a high level of detailing for proper execution. As someone noted, you need a J-Channel or similar to terminate and protect the edge of the drywall. There are alternative options though.¬†

2. The inspiration image shows a thin, flat trim. Is that an option?¬†
If you‚Äôre willing to pay for some more mudding, you can still do recessed baseboards.

I work in flooring, definitely do not ignore the expansion gap recommendations it will definitely lead to problems and manufacture will not help if you ignored their install instructions.

You could use a colour matching scotia beading with returns at each door instead of skirting as it's very small compared to skirts and if you use a colour match to your flooring it may be a bit more seamless, you could use a colour match flexible silicone to seal the gap but I'm not too sure this would play well with an potential expansion/contraction of the flooring.

Edit to add a Pic of Scotia as an example :

https://preview.redd.it/fl3u90q6xrqf1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91ae2f2b2a97764042b56748800a877ea1306c9
Undercut the wall.
Why did you pour the floor after you had done the walls? 

Think you‚Äôve gone too far to get what you wanted. Floor thresholds can have a rubber strip put in them _- assuming finish is polished concrete. Walls will need skirting but you could put in an ultra thin profile.
Just do 1/4 round.
If you need the skirting boards, then you need to allow for the door swing in the boards. There will be a small gap in the quarter round but that‚Äôs probably it. No one will notice it except you and anyone in construction

Could they still do a museum reveal also? I like that look better than the baseboard but they are both nice
Yup‚Ä¶ or cut the bottom 4‚Äù (or however tall you want your baseboards) of gyp out and replace with a fry reglet flush base or flush reveal reveal molding.
I agree! Expansion gaps are non-negotiable if you want your floor to last! I made a similar mistake in my own flat a couple years back, thinking I could get away without them for a cleaner look. Fast forward, some boards started to lift and I learned the hard way. Ended up using colour-matched scotia as you suggested and honestly, it blends in way better than I ever expected, especially once your eye gets used to it.¬†
Can you send me a link please for inspiration?
The height is already prepared for composite, so tiles are not an option ‚Äì we would have to lower the terrain. And with standard vinyl we would need to build up the height. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre sticking with composite.

Hi all! I'm planning a bathroom remodel and need to finalize the layout. Currently it's a separate bathroom and a small room with just the toilet. I wanted to join them into one room as the bathroom is currently kinda cramped (the washing machine has to be there too) and I don't like not having a sink in the toilet room. To join them I would have to knock down a concrete panel wall as well as move the door.

My aim is to make the room feel more spacious but also keep it functional, and with enough storage. Do you think the proposed layout is good?

A couple things that I'm not sure about:

Storage - I would have a cabinet beneath the sink that'd be only around 40 cm wide and another cabinet above the half-wall behind the toilet. Does that seem like enough, or would you add a mirror cabinet too?

The shower - is it too big? I'm worried I'm wasting space with it. Though I like the idea of adding a bench there or hanging towels at the far side.

Please let me know what you think and if this layout makes sense.

Note: The room is around 5cm bigger on each side than in the drawing. Door would be smaller, only 60 cm, that's enough. The partial wall behind the toilet and shower is drywall, and could be 15cm instead of 20. All other walls are concrete panels.

Can you put the couch infront of the radiator, TV on the DESK wall, Desk next to TV. Shelf is horizontal next to couch?
How tall is the radiator? Can you mount the TC bove it with the couch in the middle facing it? That would divide the large space into a main TV area and a smaller office. The office space would also include the path behind the couch to access the balcony.

Do you actually use your desk?  And do you have a laptop or a PC?

Personally, I don't end up using desks.  I'd probably get rid of that, and replace it with a lounge chair and a bookshelf.  I have a macbook air though, and I'm ok with just having it on my lap.
https://preview.redd.it/aym1srvahkqf1.jpeg?width=1374&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b6aa1fd100316d62409b9013b84f96c1e713784

if you want to separate the bed and desk more, you can use a bookshelf like a kallax to double as a bedside table. you can try making a reading corner with a round rug and a chair/beanbag. maybe put some floating shelves above the radiator, or a bookshelf at the end of the bed
You seem like you have a lot of space for what you want to achieve. I‚Äôd leave the bed and computer desk in the same location, however, I would get rid of the small desk place a bookshelf on that wall, and place an armchair right in front of the shelf against that corner.  Later you could add a floor lamp with a footstool for comfort.
thank you for the help!

Actually I am using my desk a lot as I study, work and chill on it bcz I have my macbook + a monitor and also my ps5 (I'm thinking of moving it to the living room actually)

and moving it to face the window may be a little uncomfortable bcz I'd be sitting with the door behind me.  
But I can get rid of the second desk (the small one) and I'm thinking of turning it to a reading corner but not sure how do it tbh

is there any other place I can put my main desk except facing the window? and do you have any ideas for the reading corner?
this is a great idea!

You need a bigger office or you need to make some choices. Do you really need two desks (with a desk chair each) AND the board gaming table with space for 4? Upper right door is entrance from the hall? Lower right door leads to....?
Get a large boardroom table and put it in the middle of the table. That will be your desks, and when needed, the board game table.
Thanks for the reply and sorry for the vague information.

Upper right door is entrance from corridor , lower right is glass door to the balcony.

One desk is for work, I work remotely and need a deks with a monitor, while the other is for creative work. I don't think I need two office chairs. 

The boardgame table doesn't have to come, it's really big :/

Thanks for trying to help, I'm a bit frustrated as every layout I try, I don't like it
i don‚Äôt think this is the best idra
Did you consider getting a smaller board gaming table and use it also for creative work? You could put some shelves on the wall to store your creative work items for when you use the table for board games. And I think one of your cabinets can be placed at the wall between the doors. That will create a bit more space for a board gaming table.
A smaller table isn't an option, this one is already a bit smaller than I'd like x) but I can leave it in the dining room which is where it is currently :/ the office is too small for it I've come to accept it. Unfortunately 

Do you think the desks could be opposite of each other, and only have one chair? It doesn't save that much space I guess.

The space between the doors is a bit narrower and has a light switch.

[Space between the doors](https://imgur.com/a/DLzQwLI)
Putting the desks opposite of each other probably makes the room feel smaller, I would not do that. I would put the desks next to each other or even better: go for an L shape. [idea](https://imgur.com/a/I1zrZtZ) The red is the kallax cabinet since I saw on your pic it's a low version."

Definitely 2. The first is just off in terms of utility and symmetry. Instead of 2 chairs in the second option, maybe something like a narrow chaise or a single lounge chair may work better.
Love two, feels more natural
Pic 2 for sure. But do you need two chairs in there? Just seems like not a big enough room for a sitting area.
I like 2 better, it‚Äôs just unfortunate that you can‚Äôt have the chairs by the window without throwing everything else off.
I felt agitated looking at the first and immediately relaxed seeing the second. I think it‚Äôs to do with feng shui.
2nd one but hang the tv with flaoting shelves under to give u more space for moving.
2Ô∏è‚É£
lol one is wild
What app you used to make this low plant?
2.
what is this drawn on? thanks :)
Looks good. Go for it.
How is everyone saying 2?! It‚Äôs 1, dude. The answer is 1. Tucked away from what I‚Äôm assuming is exterior doors and room entrance. Plus you have extra room with chairs at the end of bed.
The way the door swings into the room is so unfortunate. I'd consider mirroring the swing. I know the wall on the other side is kind of awkward but it still might be worth it.
Put the bed between the 2 windows on the left. Chairs by big window. Dresser on bottom wall.
2nd one..though you have to sleep with your head to east
I already have couple of chairs laying around so will just use them for now, but will definitely lookout for options to upgrade in the future.
I honestly don‚Äôt, I want to get then out asap but the bottom will look very empty without them so thinking of a better alternative
Yeah, I‚Äôll probably just switch out chairs with something else in the future
Yeah, It‚Äôs about time I switch to second. i just wanted to know if there a third alternative better than the other 2
Good tip on hanging the tv, will definitely keep in mind. Thanks
Ikr! This was the layout for a while and I‚Äôm sick of it, it was originally layout 2 but my wife just wanted to switch it up so I went with layout1. I don‚Äôt know how I lived with it for so long but hey, you know what they say about happy wife‚Ä¶
Came here to say the same thing.
The bedroom door swings inside as shown in the pictures but the bathroom door actually swings out (inside the bathroom) so idk which door you‚Äôre mentioning. But in anycase I won‚Äôt have space for bedside tables which is definitely a must for me
There are no windows on the left, there is a room door and a bathroom door. There are 2 windows on the right, which is where the bed is in the 2nd pic.
Who said the blueprint was oriented properly to the cardinal directions?
It will be towards north east
A chest of drawers or dresser? Large plant(s)?
Ya maybe a bench
I think option 2 is very good, and I personally don't see any other possibilities that could work better.
Exactly
Oh my bad. I would still try the bed between those 2 doors.
Exactly..the blueprint doesn't show that ..that's why saying that though I like 2 layout and the directions are not pointed out.. the bed should be put in such a way that the head comes to east
Definitely won‚Äôt work for me, either mine or wife‚Äôs head will be right next to bathroom door and not to mention to no space for bedside tables and won‚Äôt be able to have a sight to the bedroom door which I‚Äôve heard is not ideal
Direction you sleep has absolutely 0 impact on anything
Fair. It was just a thought based on the image.

","Couch crash out

I fear we selected the wrong layout of our new (and expensive) sectional couch which is not modular and can‚Äôt be returned.

Couch is fine, move that corner lamp to the corner by the kitchen counter and push the couch to the wall.
## The it's not so bad
The opposite configuration that would have slightly blocked the door would have been worse.

## The honest truth
It's too big for the space. There's no way you can make that room look big and open and we'll designed with that sofa. But some people care more about where they sit in a room than whether the furniture looks right and creates a magazine like aesthetic. You'll certainly spend more time sitting on the couch than using the corner next to the counter. And if you have visitors, the extra couch seating beats having no comfortable chairs, even if they judge you for having a huge couch. It's at least cozy.

## Advice 
Move the lamp to the wall by the counter and push the chaise against the wall. Still won't be perfect, but the extra space on that side isn't gaining you anything, and by shifting the sofa over you'll create enough space by the counter for the room to have two divided, usable areas.
Move the couch over towards the wall with the door on it, and put some kind of table or hidden storage solution between the window and the back of the couch. Gives you more room around the counter seating. And you‚Äôll have another surface behind to decorate and stash stuff away.
If this were my dilemma, I'd try pushing the couch right up against the wall (near the vent.) Remove that lamp for now (and whatever else is between the couch and the wall that we can't see in the photo.)

This will do a couple things. One, it will bring it further away from the windows, because of that small bump out in the corner. That may not seem like a good thing in terms of it filling the room. But, it's already a huge sectional and having it right up to the windows seems cramped. Second, it will give you more space to sit at the counter and feel more open from that end of the room. 

You can figure out the lighting after you find the right spot for the sofa. Sconces on the window and sliding door wall? You'll figure that all out. Right now, you just have to find the best spot for the sofa.
Move the lamp and shove the couch in the corner it‚Äôll look Cozy af. 

Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with that coffee table though, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to make that work
I actually think it looks cozy! The main thing that stands out to me is actually how close the right side of the couch is to the bar-top counter space. It looks like it would be pretty cramped to actually use that space. 

That being said, maybe you find a new room for the shelf/lamp on the left, move the chaise flat against the far left wall (this will leave a space between the back of the couch and the back wall due to the protrusion in the left corner, but I feel like that would be the space to put a table the same height as the couch in order to fill that space, or could even leave it open or move the lamp behind the couch there). Then, if the lamp were to go away completely, you could opt for a hanging pendant light over that corner for the lighting/decorative interest. Could be a simple plug-in deal, could go all in and wire it to a switch, but that‚Äôs personal preference. 

Also, those cushions look VERY thicc, I would bet that is a pretty comfy couch.
I would not add anything to the back of the couch the space is already too small. I would have removed the light and put the couch against the wall.
The couch is fine, the problem is the table.
If the back of the couch is bothering you, you could style a throw blanket folded over the back. Similar to how some people style it over the arm of a couch/chair. I got this space saving tip from Studio McGee and found it worked well for me. You can change it up with the seasons as well - something thicker/cosier in winter and then something light in spring/summer.

Here‚Äôs an article that talks about it 

https://chrislovesjulia.com/try-this-a-blanket-over-the-back-of-your-sofa-as-a-design-element/
I had a similar situation and ended up getting a slim lamp intended for a corner so I could push the couch up close to the wall. Similar to this one: https://a.co/d/fYQOmky
If you like comfy cozy vibes I think it can work pretty well, it‚Äôs just a lot of white going on.
that cough is way too big for that room. the back of the couch is nearly touching the bar stools.
Can you rotate it 90 degrees? So that the back of the chaise is the part obscuring a little bit of the sliding door?

Some curtains hung high n wide over the sliding door would help a lot. 

I‚Äôm a bit obsessed with your recessed ceiling - I‚Äôd love to paint the walls, and then mix a little white into the colour and paint the highest part of the ceiling. I feel like it would make it feel so much higher üòç
Can you switch your sliding glass doors the other way around? If so, swing your couch 90degrees and have the  chaise in front of the  unopening glass door
I‚Äôm so bad with buyers remorse too. I think this looks fine
I have an idea. Do you know there are companies that can cut the couch and make it modular? Then you can move it around in different ways. Look up furniture doctors.
Your tv should be on the wall to the right of the sliding glass door, use the room space to feature your sitting area and have the coffee table out in front of it.  The long narrow table goes against the windows.
Looks inviting enough to me. Might want some color in there though
I think it works. I would add a tall plant in either the chaise side corner or the opposite corner of the sofa. That would draw your eye‚Äôs attention away from the sofa‚Äôs back.
The main problem with the couch in my opinion other than the fact that it's huge and not placed well, is it's the main offender of something going on here which is there is too many tones that are too closely related. There's so many things that are sitting in this tiny range of white to dark beige, and it's making everything look like a bunch of shapes rather than separate objects. I'd try to add more black and more colours that are far from that beige range that everything's falling into, in various spots, as well as a better placement of the couches. Items like pillows, blankets, some dark greens from plants, and some more reflective objects like a shiny steel standing lamp. I'm just taking a look.. maybe black stools.. I'd do a black coffee table that's round because I think also there's too many square and rectangle details. Just play with the texture, shape, and colour of things, find harmony and balance within those details, and I think you'll find overtime your buyers remorse for the sofa will fade away
I would switch the orientation but keep it about 2.5-3‚Äô away from the wall with the sliding door. The arm side of the couch will then be parallel to the breakfast bar but it looks like there is a wall beside the bar that‚Äôs about the same width as the arm side of the couch. Even if you have to go a bit closer to the bar, it won‚Äôt seem as intrusive as it does with the back that close to the bar.  

Edit: Alternatively, you could move your TV stand to the right of the sliding glass door and move your couch 1/4 turn, and closer to the sliding glass door wall. It will make a cozy TV watching area, but will still feel open bc the TV will be visible from the entire space and the couch won‚Äôt be pushed up so close to the breakfast bar.
Do you absolutely need a couch that seats that many people? If not, I would honestly just remove the one part with the back facing the countertop and put it in a different room so it‚Äôs like a standalone lounge seat. Like if you have space in a bedroom or office. But overall it‚Äôs not so bad, it‚Äôs just really big for the space
Contrary to what some might think the way to clean a window (especially a dusty exterior window) is not windex and paper towels, but a bucket, very dish soapy water, and a squeegee. Finish any final smudges with windex.   
  
Oops sorry, thought this was r/cleaningtips.
There is a column/duct in that corner, which looks to be why they have that gap at the wall. That is also kind of screwing them without having a true corner in the room.

Gives you room to play on both sides without making the room any smaller. Right now the couch is just places slightly awkwardly.

Give it some time and see how you‚Äôre using the space.
I used to be a window cleaner, don't know why you're being downvoted. Windex is horrible.

1 or 3. You don't want your back or monitor towards the door, even if you live alone.
1. Your depth of field while working is the length of the room instead of a wall like 2; and you won‚Äôt feel as locked into the desk as 3. Plus facing people is more social
Option 2 would be spacewise easiest to move around. But if I would be on a lot of videocalls I would go for option 1.
If you're working from home full-time, I would remember #3.¬† But maybe most the desk about 6 inches closer to the sofa to have a bit more space for working.
3
2 will maintain the most amount of floor space. 1&3 allow you to see the TV and view and also prevents your back to the doorway into the room.
All work, it's just going to depend on what you prefer. Space or view"

I wouldn‚Äôt want my sibling‚Äôs feet that close to my face while I‚Äôm in bed.
if this is a longterm arrangement I would consider loft beds ‚Äî one for each child. And put all the clothes storage under the lofts. that would make space for another desk
https://preview.redd.it/gjlso6mrzjqf1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23e94e21cfae32c5189067d90a67658b21e64950

Minimal changes
If you're not going for loft beds I would put both beds with the head of the bed on the same wall as the door and then you can fit two desks on the wall with the window.


Otherwise I would go for loft beds and put some curtains up for privacy.
Bunk beds is the answer.
Can you do a loft bed with desk under it? Ikea has good options:

I would rotate the one bed by the window 90deg so it blocks the window. Not ideal but feet pointing at other siblings head is bad vibes. This way the beds are parallel and you can fit another desk between the beds against the short wall. Each girl should have their own desk if possible.
Thanks everyone for the ideas! Currently yes there is a bunk bed but the girls would like their own low beds üôÇ

I also think that two desks is a good idea and probably this solution is good.

(There is a small correction in the plan where the big window is)

I found this YouTube video so helpful ‚Äî even though it‚Äôs a dorm room it‚Äôs a small space that needs to accommodate 2 people comfortably

What about something like this?  I don‚Äôt think the flow into the room is great, but would allow for a double desk and night stands.

You can also get a desk that has half that can roll under the other half so you can collapse it if you want to reach the window.
Have you seen bunk beds like [these](https://pin.it/7SXIWwPlA)? 

I‚Äôd put one opposite the window so each child has some privacy and you‚Äôd still have room for 2 desks and 2 wardrobes or chests of drawers.
Hello! 

Would you consider to have a cabin bed? Would help you a maximize the space. 

I would: 

1. Get a cabin bed
2. Place the wardrobe in the wall beside the bed 
3. Place the desk in front of the windows to not blown the sunlight but have curtains and shades to control the light. 

I hope it helps you! 

Good luck!
We loft our twin boys beds. When they were 3/4/5 we had lattice up so they couldn‚Äôt fall out and a slide and swing for fun. Now that they‚Äôre 12 the lattice is gone and underneath has TVs and desks.
I highly recommend this video for some ideas:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daX1I3B7bwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daX1I3B7bwc)

It's an interior designer with ideas for laying out a shared dorm room, but many of the same principles apply
What software is this?
Lofted beds so dressers and desks fit under?
Or the desks could go under the beds.
Agree. You need two desks one for each child. Alternatively desk under loft bed imo since that offers more privacy. The storage can be shared.
Ot you can do a bigger change and build them a really long desk that goes in front of the glass door where they can both get a chair that pushes under and do shelves to the right of that
this is definitely it, but if they really arent feeling that idea maybe a bookshelf or some large shelf and or wardrobe type of thing can be put along the wall between the beds. I think the beds would go on the left sides with the pillows touching the walls, on either side of the room. I think the beds have to be on the same side or else you're really creating a problem with a lack of room and ability for motion in there. The picture alsz posted is probably the closest to what would work best here
Aside from getting bunk beds or loft beds, this is 100% the best way to make sure they don't feel like they are sleeping on top of each other.
Maybe with an L-shape wardrobe we have the solution

But here the wardrobe covers the window :(
Or switch the placement of one of the beds and the wardrobe so they are farther from each other
Exactly this.
Although the night stand I think is needed‚Ä¶
Jinx! I linked to the exact same vid
Currently I am considering two standard low bed, but thanks for the idea!
Looks like magicplan app

Oh nice, I really like that layout.
I would suggest a short chest of drawers to go under the window.¬† But I guess you could swap the left desk.
Could you mount a shelf to the wall above each of the beds instead of fitting in a night stand each?
OP have you looked at my design plan? I dont think they would enjoy having a desk wedged between their beds??
Could you sort of build in night stands into the wall for each bed?
Correct
Nice. I'm using planner5d in 90% of my interior projects but I love to explore new tools too. How's your experience with magicplan?
I Like This one a lot
This makes the door open into the side of the wardrobe and causes tight circulation between bed and wardrobe
Bumping your design. I think it‚Äôs the best solution so far and it seems like it would all fit comfortably.
I saw that, the only issue is the wardrobe covering the window
This one has the best feel and while at their desk they can look out the window! Plus there‚Äôs not a bed or wardrobe blocking the window. I think this is the best option outside of doing lofted beds.¬†"

great sofa choice!
The first one
I like the built in option! Both look beautiful, although I‚Äôm curious where the speakers would go in the first option?
First one is nice but pretty trendy material. Go for it if you love it but I‚Äôd go with the second option. 

The seamless built in look is truly timeless and sleek. It becomes a part of the home instead of attached floating furniture. As you fill in your home with furniture and collect things, it‚Äôll just look so much cleaner.
I really like the continuity of the ""built-in thing"" with the wood storage on the right.
Number 1
I had this same issue...if you wall mount the TV the same level as the window, it looks more intentional. Then you can add decor to the shelf.
Off topic but can the tv please be centered on the center height of the window, the current height is irking the shit out of me"

I am not the best when it comes to designing so hopefully I can get some advice on how I should go forward with my kitchen.

The dimensions of the room are 147 in x 136 in. That makes it about 138 square feet. I will post a few photos here of what it looks like now in the middle of the demo process and see if anyone has some ideas!

The issue I run into is making a good design when I have all these doorways and 2 windows (1 of which is the window that goes out and has a small platform on it). This house also has a cutout area for the refrigerator as you can see in the photos that does not impact the square footage of the kitchen. This is a plus as it adds more room for things.

If it helps with giving ideas, I have a range that is coming in and will be keeping that microwave as it is also new.

I am also open to any color schemes you may have. I already purchased the flooring which is a gray/brown color laminate flooring. I will also attach a photo of the flooring.

","Kitchen Layout Advice

Hello everyone!

  
I am not the best when it comes to designing so hopefully I can get some advice on how I should go forward with my kitchen.

The dimensions of the room are 147 in x 136 in. That makes it about 138 square feet. I will post a few photos here of what it looks like now in the middle of the demo process and see if anyone has some ideas!

The issue I run into is making a good design when I have all these doorways and 2 windows (1 of which is the window that goes out and has a small platform on it). This house also has a cutout area for the refrigerator as you can see in the photos that does not impact the square footage of the kitchen. This is a plus as it adds more room for things.

If it helps with giving ideas, I have a range that is coming in and will be keeping that microwave as it is also new.

I am also open to any color schemes you may have. I already purchased the flooring which is a gray/brown color laminate flooring. I will also attach a photo of the flooring.

Go wild if you have time!

  
Thank you in advance for any help that is provided!!

  
PS: Is there room for an island in the kitchen? ü§û

I think your ideas are good and will have room for a small island, preferably on wheels to move for easy access.

reddit,InteriorDesign,1nldmdg,1758311526,Rectangular Living Room Layout,"Hello there!

I recently moved into a house with my fiancee and we're trying to plan out the living room we're almost done updating. The previous owner used it as more of a formal living room since there is also a family room off our kitchen. The room, however, is quite large so we're looking to use it as an actual living room with a TV. The shape of the room and the location of the doorways are sort of throwing me through a loop when trying to plan out the space properly. Dimensionally (see the last picture), the room is approximately 20 ft x 11.5 ft.

The room has two doorways--one to/from our main foyer (where the french doors are) and one from our dining room. We'd really like to keep the french doors, which I know does sort of limit the space a tiny bit when the doors are open. The room has 1 main window that faces the road and does let in quite a good bit of sunlight during the day. We plan on putting up a combo of shades/binds + curtains.

My original plan was to put the TV on the blue accent wall, then have a love seat facing across from the TV and a full sofa along the window wall. When doing the dimensions and checking, things don't seem like they'd work. The room is approximately 11.5 ft wide (138""), meaning the sofa's depth (call it \~36"" deep) + a loveseat's length (\~60"" ?) + 4"" of space along the window wall for air vents would leave \~38"" of space for walking next to the loveseat. Not sure if I'm crazy, but That doesn't feel like a lot and assumes that my rough estimates are current. It could be a bit more, could be bit less.

I could also put the TV along the north wall of the room, but there are a some problems I can think of with that. Most notably, the viewing angle, sun glare from the window, and the fact that that wall houses a couple AC return ducts on the other side.

Any advice would be most appreciated. I'm open to any and all advice on TV placement, chairs instead of a loveseat, anything. I'm a bit out of my element here lol. Some options I put together are in the last few images.

TLDR; Rectangular living room (20'x11.5') with multiple entryways. Desperately need help on optimal room configuration to a healthy amount of seating for entertaining without it feeling too cramped or restricting flow through the room.

reddit,InteriorDesign,1nkz80r,1758275273,Kitchen impossible: doesn't look good,"Hi guys! 
I am planning my future flat and would like it to not look like ass. At the same time I would really enjoy it being functional.

So here we have plenty of pictures.
1. Floor plan - yellow walls are movable, the entrance is at the middle, upwards. Windows in the living room are facing south. The hatching in the kitchen is counter area, so the oven is a hob + oven combo. About utilities location: the notch between oven and dishwasher is a wall, there is also ventilation going out in the direction of oven. Water is located where dishwasher and sink are.

2. It is kinda how it would look in IKEA planner. I get a bit of cabinetry facing living room. Two major issues: it elongates the already long corridor to 6.2meters, the window to the kitchen might look really bad. My partner does not really want a completely closed kitchen.

3 and 4 is how it could be done differently. My main concerns are: this way I get really small amount of counter space, there would also be only 40cm of counter on one side of hob. I am not sold on the table though - I would enjoy a possibility of seating 6 persons, maybe 8 really tightly in this flat. 

5. I could give up some living room space and elongate the kitchen. Now the table is completely unplacable, at least my ideas ran out here.

As per styling, I would be aiming at Mediterranean/ japandi if that matters a tiniest bit. I am thinking of an arch here and there, probably limewash on walls. 

I generally value living room space more than the kitchen, but I cook almost daily so some compromise has to be done clearly. 

What are your opinions and ideas for this kitchen conundrum? 
None of my options seem satisfying to me, though any of them looks good enough to pass. If partner doesn't change mind on closing up the kitchen, I will probably stick to the Island with table against one wall or another.","Kitchen impossible: doesn't look good

you dont have room for an island and a table. if you have 8 people round then make it a finger buffet. Go with 3/4.
Slides 3-4 have a small amount of counter space? It looks pretty decent sized to me and you can use the table for more space. This is your best option honestly, it looks good, gives the nice open feeling to make it more spacious, and your cabinet space stays the same
I'm diggin 4

What are these bump ins?
What‚Äôs on the room behind the kitchen on the left hand side in your plans? Is that a laundry room? It says washing machine?
I‚Äôd pick 3

Thank you. I kinda understand there is not enough space for everything.

As I value my living room (sofa) space way more than the dining, it would be reasonable to have the priorities straight.


4 persons dining is quite a possible scenario, while an 8 person one is once in a few years scenario.

Would you say that with a foldable table extension a 6 person seating configuration is doable? 4 default with +2 extension would be a configuration that doesn't sound too radical in any way, at least to me.
Okay, I see I created some confusion. 3,4 are from the internet, 1,2,5 are my work in cad/Ikea kitchen planner. So my fear of 'not enough counter space' can be visualised here. It is from my IKEA kitchen planner. There is a total of 40cm of counter space divided by the stove once fridge lands on this wall. It looks reasonable to me though. Not ideal, but acceptable

If the table had a foldable extension, which way would you imagine the extension would go?
Ventilation & sewage shafts. It's a multi storey building.
In the kitchen this forces oven/induction combo to be seated on that wall, as ventilation for it is impossible to rotate to the other wall. 

I could also just not connect the hood to the ventilation, but if there is one...
It's a walk in closet that will also host washer+ dryer combo.
yes you can easily find a 4 seater that can extend to 6.
What do you mean

So much space dedicated to laundry. What about this?
Love this input, thank you. However, the room you cannibalized is supposed to serve as a walk in closet, and I'm afraid I cannot allow myself to not have that storage space."

your layout is fine. to make it look intentional define each space. By that I mean on the left add a rug that cover 80% of that space and tucks 20 cms under the sofa. you can also add a sofa back table to give more seperation , nothing high so you still get light and space."

Kitchen Designer here!

Have you considered something more like this? I've turned your kitchen into a U-shape - which although isn't my favourite style, it does work well for your particular project. It gives you more useable counterspace, cabinet space, seating space at the peninsula, and separates the living room and kitchen.

As a cook, this kitchen is not functional. There‚Äôs no counter space for food prep or washing dishes. I would need a peninsula or small island
Sinks in corners are horrid.¬†
Personally I‚Äôd make the kitchen along one wall with fridge and high cabinet in the tiny wall opposite.¬†

Just make it all along one wall.¬†
There‚Äôs no counter space. In reality, this will be a nightmare for anyone.
Struggling to understand why you'd want a corner sink and not just extend this 1 more cabinet/unit along ü´† 

Cooking would be hell. I have to chop next to the fridge which might not open fully due to a weird wall or worse open into me and my chopping zone?? then ferry my fresh food over a sink of dirty pots to put on the stove and theres no second counter space to chop meat or place food that is cooked so I deem this a salmonella out of 10
It looks nice at first glance interesting l imagine cooking in that kitchen. There is no counter space!¬†


I've lived in a house with that little amount of counter space and it's so stressful to cook in!
Corner sink is a nightmare to live with.
I have a similar setup, and I hate it. The corner sink is a pain in the ass. There is not enough counter space, and those high cabinets are very hard to reach the top shelves. I find the lack of counter space very frustrating when I'm cooking. The single sink is less than ideal for prepping veg/keeping dishes done while cooking. I do see a dishwasher, I have one as well but I still hate my single sink lol. 

This design looks very nice at first glance, and I do apologize for ripping your design apart. Speaking from experience with an almost identical kitchen, please consider a redraw ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit - clarification/poorly worded
You have basically zero counter space for prep or small appliances. That 3‚Äô deep fridge will make your space feel real small (speaking from experience).
If you actually plan to cook something more complex than instant ramen, I would strongly suggest an over-the-range microwave.¬†
Not enough counter space, I speak from experience. I'd extend the run further down  that wall if you can afford it. Basic units don't cost a lot. As others have said a simple under unit oven rather than a range. If you like it, and induction hob would add to the streamlined look and keep the lines clean.

If you can afford it, I'd do a longer run of floor units and remove most if not all upper units for a more modern look/feel but it depends on your tastes.
no working/chopping space.
If you are standing at the sink can the dishwasher door  be open? If not, going to be hard to load it
Is this for an AirBNB? If so, I think it's fine. If this is your actual kitchen that you're cooking daily meals in... It's a no from me, dog. 

Unless you don't actually cook and you just warm-up prepared meals, which in that case it's probably just OK
You won't be able to remove any of the fridge components like drawers or shelves if you can't fully open the doors.  Normally you'd want them to be able to swing wide open.
Why is it so cramped into the corner? Having two large pieces (fridge and pantry) at each end emphasizes this even more. 

I would move the big pieces on the short wall and then expand the kitchen a little further into the room. Finishing with a open concept type of ending.
Zero prep space and lots of wasted space elsewhere
I have a corner sink in my apartment and I hate it so much. Water always gets everywhere. It's such an unnatural way to stand.
Your sink doesn't have a draining area and you have almost nowhere to food prep. Also if the extractor hood works then there wouldn't be a cupboard above it as that is where the exhaust would be. 

If the room is so small as it appears - do you have an option of creating some foldaway/hideaway surfacing for food prep?
No counter space currently! If you can id definitely try and fit at least a few feet extra in, otherwise you‚Äôll need to be buying more furniture things to make your kitchen usable
Very little prep/counter space.  Is there room to add an island?
too small ,u clearly have space to expand it ,pls exapand

Extend the counter for the kitchen. Move the stove.  Put the microwave in the cabinets to the left of the stove.

You may not have enough room in that corner for your sink‚Ä¶so I would change that corner.

Create a built in for the dining seating, making it a breakfast nook.

The drawing below the floor plan is like an elevation.
I can‚Äôt imagine standing at that sink for an hour washing dishes with those cabinets right in my face. That corner sink is a huge red flag.

Whereas some of the best real estate in your kitchen, the left-most side, you put a cabinet. 

The stove and the sink needs space around them.
Make sure your fridge door can open all the way. I just bought a house where there's a relatively new fridge with a wall running a bit past the edge so the door can't  quite open to a full 90 degrees (ideally it'd be more) and it drives me crazy. Less bad/annoying with a top/bottom fridge/freezer vs side by side
Just a few in the plan.

\[Edited because I uploaded a whole mess the first time\]
Your issue is counter space and work flow.

I strongly suggest taping off the floor and then walking through typical kitchen use to see how it feels. Like pretend you make dinner and clean up after. Pace through the space as you do - you'll  instantly ""feel"" if anything is off.

My guess? You will find it cramped. Two people coming together will probably be frustrating.

You're lacking counter space. So things like your sink will feel off. It's very small. It's in a dark corner (not best for cleaning tasks) and dishes (dirty and clean) and food that needs to be washed, etc. has no place to live before and after.

You have a huge amount of dead wall space on the left. The best layout would be a galley kitchen (ideally with an island) - not ramming everything into a corner. 

Yes, it all fits. But it doesn't have room to breathe.

So put fridge on bottom part of far left wall.≈ì. Counter space beside it. Stove/microwave (consider that floats above the stove - not on counter). Then counter - another prep area. Then sink and serving area.

So workflow it optimized. The place beside the fridge to take out food and put it on the counter and prep or to unload groceries and put in fridge.

Then you move a long the galley to cook/bake - additional prep/staging area on the right. Then sink to clean and cook then area with all your serving stuff (ideally, the dishwasher lives under that so unloading dishes becomes as easy as opening it up and putting them in the cupboard or shelving above). 

Again, yes, it fits. But it will feel cramped and not fun to cook in there. 

I'm not quite clear on if that's a bistro table and chairs with a bench or.... 

If you don't need seating in here or that much seating, ditch it. A bigger kitchen will make you much happier and look less crammed.
Why is it so small? I would want more prep space.
i would extend by at least 2 more cabinets, and add a small mobile island.

> Big red flags 

https://media.nkba.org/uploads/2022/05/Kitchen-Planning-Guidelines.pdf

Go study this and try to follow as many of the guidelines as possible

Why not expand the kitchen to cover the entirety of the left wall
As others have said, there‚Äôs no countertop prep space. I also think this looks like a full-sized fridge, which isn‚Äôt strictly necessary for a 2-person suite. The cabinet widths are all pretty variable which looks a bit wonky and the narrow ones won‚Äôt be as functional. Is this a guest suite? Or is this a primary residence?  The answer dictates how functional it needs to be (including the size and proportions). Either way, I would consider:
- Move the microwave above the range. Use an electric range so you don‚Äôt need to worry as much about ventilation (though some microwaves can be used above gas stoves).
- Use a counter-depth fridge 
- Move the fridge to where the microwave is
- Put an 18-inch cabinet between the oven and the fridge. (Looks to be 9 or 12 now)
- Move the dishwasher to where the fridge is in your rendering 
- Move the sink to the current dishwasher space 
- Pick two cabinet widths and stick to those 
- Avoid cabinets more narrow than 12-15 inches 

Good luck! Thinking through all these things now, as you‚Äôre doing, will help you to end up with a final result you‚Äôre happy with!!
It looks like your fridge will swing open to the right. Will you be able to fully open the fridge door? I can't tell if the fridge is flush against the wall/cabinet space (looks like it is). 

You want to be able to fully open fridge door/s for cleaning.
The biggest red flag for me would be that sink in the corner when theres more than enough space in the kitchen to make a decent sink with more apace for cooking. 

The distance between sink and stove is too small and will be a pain to use it to cut ingredients to cook.
is your stove on an exterior wall? if so i‚Äôd consider a range hood that vents out of the house instead of a recirculating hood. recirculating hoods are way less effective and if you‚Äôre spending money on a remodel it‚Äôs truly worth the effort to add this.
What is up with your upper cabinets? They‚Äôre all over the place. Try to simplify a bit the heights/shapes/positions of the upper cabinets it looks messy.
Let me see:

- A gas, non-integrated stove
- A freestanding dishwasher 
- A bulky invasive fridge
- An awkwardly placed microwave
- A corner sink??

I'd rate this: American/10

What I would do:

- Integrated fridge where the microwave is, with a freezer underneath.
- Induction stove with integrated stove (can also be gas, as long as the setup is part of the cabinets and not a freestanding model)
- Extend counter space to where you put the fridge 
- Kitchen appliances in the corner and move sink in that counter space
- I would honestly just do a kitchen island at this point, and put the stove on it.
- Integrate the dishwasher of course

What I mean with integrated stuff:
[Example](https://pin.it/2JlJcXWXV)
Can you bring the cabinets to the ceiling? Or at least create a faux panel that goes to the ceiling?
I‚Äôd consider an over-the-range microwave and make the cabinet to the left of the stove a regular counter and upper‚Äîmore counter space will make meal prep a lot easier. Plus, based on the size, I‚Äôd assume this is a kitchen for 1-2 people, so a large pantry isn‚Äôt really needed.
I hate a sink facing a corner.  Can you not make a  peninsula between the dining area and the kitchen and put the sink there? Then you'd have much more counter space under the cabinets. If you're doing a full reno, it'd be easy to get the plumbing done for the sink in the peninsula.  You might as well put the dishwasher there too.
It's 2025. As someone who grew up on fancy gas stoves and was crawling in my skin for the years i had to use shitty coil stoves

Go induction and never look back. Go induction with knobs like a nice samsung or LG and not the stupid ass touchscreen buttons that frigidaire does.

Also, why is that wall there next to the fridge and why is it sticking out so much? I get fridge enclosure but that's mega overkill.

Also also - why are you using a freestanding stove? Get a slide in with the knobs in the front.

Freestanding is such a bad idea. Harder to clean, uglier, clashes with any backsplash, and makes you reach over hot shit to grab the controls. Nah fam.

Personally, i hate range hoods that have the faux cabinets. Just get a nice looking range hood and the space around it lets it become a statement piece while giving the kitchen an airier feel. Also, get a range hood that's one size larger than your stove (so if the stove is 30, go 36 on the hood). It lets you run it at a lower speed and be much quieter while getting the necessary CFM. It also looks a lot better imho
I am looking into a similar size kitchen. I‚Äôm going with 2 burner induction stove and a built-in oven. We only cook for two adults and we never use more than two burners but we need prep space. 

Also going to add a butcher block cart/island
Might want to consider adding an additional base unit and pushing the microwave etc further along the wall. This would give prep space and additional storage which will help keep the whole room looking tidier and calmer. It‚Äôll also stop you hating your kitchen and having to use it!
Yes - you haven't got a dining table?    
  
It would look much cleaner to have a straight run of cupboards on the side wall 

Always do an integrated fridge and integrated cooker if you can
I would AVOID putting a cabinet above the range hood. I have one and I have to constantly degrease and clean them. It‚Äôs the worst. Especially if you have a shaker style, forget it. Those nooks and crannies are a pain to clean.
Get rid of the cabinet about the range hood. And move the hood higher. You will hit your utensils on it when you have a large pot on the stove.
Personally I prefer having my countertop cooking prep area to be closer to the stove. Any way to switch the dishwasher and sink?
You don‚Äôt need a full range unless you absolutely need it. 
Two burner cook top and a microwave with an oven in it.

Here's a better top down measurements view.
You're really good ü§©
It also blocks the kitchen whe the door is open
Oh! That‚Äôs supposed to be a living space, I thought it was a dining nook. This is actually the right answer
I was thinking that the space between the fridge and the sink would be enough for prep. Its supposed to be a kitchen for 2 people at max.
Agree. They are often set back in a weird way that requires bending funny to use them
Yes!! And there's always that awkward corner behind the sink. And facing a corner is like extra punishment for having to do dishes! üòÇ
Yea, this is not a functional space for actually cooking with that counter space.
Also make sure there is LOTS of open headspace over sink. You‚Äôd be surprised how often you need to lean over or towards a sink until you put a cabinet there and are constantly hitting your forehead.
Yeah I was trying to figure out where they could even put down a cutting board...
It looks like my old kitchen before we extended it.... bc there wasn't enough space.
I had a corner sink in my kitchen before the renovation and I loathed it. Not only did I hate using it (water splashed on the floor when I moved the faucet between the two basins) but getting under it to solve a leak was also terrible. My shoulders didn't fit through the opening so i had to go in sideways and contort myself around the pipes to see anything. 0/10 do not recommend.
I agree about the food prep but I put in a range hood a few years ago and the exhaust exits straight back behind it, so that‚Äôs not necessarily true.
I agree with everything except the built in dining nook. That‚Äôs a one trick pony and outdated.
>I can‚Äôt imagine standing at that sink for an hour washing dishes with those cabinets right in my face

Good thing there's a dishwasher on the right!
Here‚Äôs my suggestions

https://preview.redd.it/bdtb7rpjmrqf1.jpeg?width=2360&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8092482b5b49e49cd48aa1e10812be3a63ac4246
Awesome suggestions! I agree 100%
You cut ingredients in your sink...?
i'd generally advise against a gas stove. it's linked to asthma (due to the release of nitrogen dioxide) and also to heightened risks of lung cancer and leukemia (due to release of benzene, a known carcinogen). The levels in a home use environment are usually higher than those in second hand tobacco smoke. In the US, there's just lobby interests that have led to a lack of regulations of gas stoves in homes.
This minus the island stove. Such a pain in the ass to keep the area clean, the rest of the counter becomes so much less useable, and range hoods are expensive and clutter the visual field making it feel more claustrophobic
Gas is for people that enjoy cooking and make great food. Induction is if you cook to eat and are OCD about cleaning. Gas is easier to clean than coil electric by far.
Good height is usually 24-30‚Äù above the range. The stove will spec range hood height based on burner output. Too high, and it doesn‚Äôt efficiently extract.

That space will be half filled by some dirty dishes on any normal day.
That is no where near enough space. I‚Äôm stuck with a very similar amount of counter space due to having a very small kitchen. There are only two of us and it miserable putting together even a simple home cooked meal and I love to cook.

Edit: also if you ever sell this house no one who cooks regularly will want this kitchen.
I live with my fianc√©e and do all the cooking. I am telling you there is no universe I would ever buy or rent a place with this kitchen. In fact if I saw this kitchen I would laugh and said ‚Äúclearly the designer doesn‚Äôt cook‚Äù. This is fucking terrible.

That sink is in an awful spot. There is no counter space. The only thing you got right is the work triangle, which is so small that it‚Äôs basically worthless.

I would extend the cabinets and counter all the way down to the other wall and add an island. Otherwise the only thing people are going to use that massive seating for is takeout.
Only if you're a Sim! Real people need more than one counter to prep.
Absolutely horrible to use. Without being mean this is one of the worst designed kitchens I‚Äôve seen.¬†
You can never have enough counter space. I have a U.shaped kitchen in a standard 3 bed UK semi, one side of the U I put tall units. Then the other two sides there's a hob in the middle of one and a sink in the middle of another. I wish we had gone for low units all around.
Yeah I have a cabinet above my range hood with reduced Cappadocia, but it still has storage
Ah interesting! Never seen it be done that way but good to know!
I love them. I love the ability to put storage in them and the look along a window line. Plus, it saves space. 

Design is up to the homeowners. It could make the project too expensive. Homeowners can also do open shelving instead of closed cabinets above the counters. That is nice as well, but a dust collector.
Tell me you don‚Äôt cook without telling me you don‚Äôt cook.
This but put the dishwasher across from the fridge to the right of the sink that way you can clear and rinse in the sink and load directly into the dishwasher
I'd do an island stove, and sink/dishwasher at the wall, so you can cook while overlooking the living room and have dishes at the back. Also having a big cutting area island makes sense and you can grab stuff from the fridge behind you..
I would love to have a gas hob! Imagine being able to use an actual wok as intended!
As someone who is objectively a great cook, I'm sorry but you're terribly wrong lol

And coil is radiant/conductive heat, not induction.
I cook and I also don't even have a dishwasher :)

So it takes you 1 hour to wash your pots and pans? I think you're the one who doesn't cook.
Or shift it to the left along the same wall, away from the fridge. Not directly next to the sink. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ha yeah can you even use a wok on induction?
Yeah thats why I specified coil electric is harder to clean than gas. Its not the same as induction. Gas>induction>coil
I'm not even sure, ours is electric and it can't heat the pan enough to heat the sides. I often resort to using the wok on the chimenea in the garden instead when I fancy a good old stir fryüòÖ
Not without an induction hob/stove that's bowl -like. 

You do have to make some tradeoffs with induction, namely no woks, but honestly that and not being able to fire roast slices of bread is pretty much it. Ifk about you, but wok use is very rare.
You mentioned induction vs gas, though. 

I know tons of people who are trash cooks and gas doesn't make them any better. I know tons of people who pull off great works on an electric stove to my amazement.

Electric coils/radiant is just criminally bad, and induction is just plain awesome. Everything heats quickly and evenly and temp control is super easy. You def have a lot less of an excuse for making mistakes on it. It's safer, cheaper to operate than both gas and electric, and has been becoming the standard globally in developed nations for the past 20 years.

For some reason the marketing of induction here is so weird and americans are very... kind of dumb and rely on marketing and socially engineered cultural assumptions instead of just self education to make their decisions for them. Like why do warranty companies never cover the induction top on a range, but will for gas and radiant electric when the parts cost the same? Why do induction ranges cost so much when they're cheaper to produce and warranty? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Idgi

Gas is a much more emotionally involved experience, I'll give it that. Fire make Ugg feel a certain way. Controlled fire makes Ugg feel like they are at the pinnacle of the natural world. I think it's one of those things you just need to acknowledge is the reason and learn to move on to better.

Another benefit of induction is that it's a hell of a lot harder to have your pans warp (living with roommates who suck at caring for cookware) and you can flash dry your cookware on the stove lol
I just looked it up and they make flat bottomed ones for induction. I thought what a perversion.
I use mine a couple times a month.
I still can't imagine it heats the sides of the wok  to the right temperature though. And like.. how would you go about seasoning a new one too? Fire is üëåüèº
Awesome, but rare exception. You'd still be better off with an induction wok hob separate from your flat induction top for the up-to-60+ other times/month you're cooking on it"

Oh, so cozy and so beautiful OP!
Your home is cozy and cheerful and filled with the love between you and your animal companions. Nothing is sweeter than that in life!
Love your space!! Looks so airy and well lit!! Love the decor and color combos. You can add relaxed linen roman shades on that window. It will look pretty!
It looks so cheery and peaceful
Hey, where did you get that sunflowers by van Gogh?
I bet you were really pleased when you figured out the rug matched with your cat tree so perfectly. I know I would have been! üòÜ

I can feel my stress-level falling just looking at this picture.

Very cozy.
Oh yeah... I could read the shit out of a book there.

Plz invite me over OP.  Ill bring you coffees and my own cozy blanket.
Beautifully cozy! Love it.
Where did you get those lamps?
where is this :o
Oh; this is absolutely THE spot üòç‚ú®
Damn.
That room looks great!!
What are those letters out the window?
I‚Äôm obsessed
This looks so much like my old place in Kansas City! You‚Äôve made me miss it! Such a cosy space!
The urge to be here
I love this üíì Such a vibe!
I like that shelf, where'd you get it from?
This is a wonderful atmosphere!
The glow from the lamps against that window is unreal.
I love the lighting!
This literally looks like my apartment except the bricks are white. I think my ceilings are taller but I have that exact same  pipe on my ceiling (except it's over my kitchen).

I hate my furniture and was trying to figure out what type of entertainment center I wanted, and this gave me a good idea. I want cozy vibes like this.
The lighting in this loft during blue hour is so nice. The mix of warm and cool tones creates a really cozy vibe. Looks like a great place to relax
Incredible! Can feel how relaxed and cozy this feels. Especially after a long day. Well done :)
This is so serene. I love it this way in my home.¬†
Looks amazing. Well done!! Where‚Äôd you get your paper lamps? I‚Äôve been struggling to find good ones that aren‚Äôt like $500 lol
Woah dude be more careful with your TV
I love this! Do you happen to know the paint color? I just put similar lighting in my bedroom but I‚Äôm having trouble choosing a paint color now
Who makes the shelving? Beautiful btw!
I can imagine myself unwinding for the day.
What tv is that? Panel soo slim
If it's blue hour why is everything orange?
Blue?
Thank you üòä
It‚Äôs as cozy IRL as it looks!
Thanks!
The one hanging from the ceiling is from Hay, the floor lamp by the windows is from Noguchi, and the two on the shelves on the left are Five Below (top shelf, it‚Äôs a shitty lamp, I just needed something up there!) and IKEA (bottom shelf). I am a lamp fiend, if you couldn‚Äôt tell!
Rhode Island :)
The sign on our apartment building
It‚Äôs a modular shelf from MUJI
Thanks so much!
Also I love the colored lighting. I was thinking about getting some govee strips but I like what you did with the lamps and lampshades.
I‚Äôm so glad you like it! Glad I could provide some inspiration.
Thank you so much!

The big one that‚Äôs hanging is from Hay, I believe it was $99. The floor lap by the window is Noguchi, it was our biggest splurge and my fiance and I split the cost. But I just saw a video of a dupe of it on Amazon in someone‚Äôs place and it looked really good for a knockoff. 

IKEA also has some decent ones from time to time!
?

What‚Äôs wrong with my TV?
Our walls are just boring white! The lighting reflects off the white at night making it seem colorful
MUJI!
LG Oled C5! Eventually we‚Äôll mount it to the wall, whenever we get a new entertainment console to replace the current one, which is a bit too small for the TV
Thank you I love them...I have an issue with sensitivity to light and these look great (with the right bulb) thank you!
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that makes sense lol
Have you got a link? Can't seem to find it.
Oof, $500. Ah well.
appreciate the response! I try to not support Amazon if I can help it but we‚Äôll see lol. $99 is pretty reasonable and I just checked out the Noguchi site and they have some beautiful stuff for a pretty decent price as well. Thanks again!
I‚Äôm just joking, from this angle it kinda looks like it got shattered lol
Okay this is amazing I thought for sure they were orange!
I do too. I use the Hue bulbs and I love them!

Same here, so I respect that!
Noguchi sometimes has sales too, just keep an eye on their website.
You can also try Etsy for dupes. I‚Äôve seen some lovely paper lamps there too.

Hey\~hey I got so much to say. Yes, I was wondering why I seen snow outdoors. I‚Äôm a native upstate NYer ,  but I live in CA because my 2 children and 3 grandchildren are here.

Thank you! It's a work in progress (what home isn't?) but this image popped up on my phone from last winter and the dog made my heart melt!
Thank you! It's the Luca Sectional from Rove Concepts, and I've had it for over 7 years now! It's pretty easy to clean and maintain, and it's absolutely gorgeous. It's comfy to sit and lounge on, but sometimes I miss a wall behind it so I could have full back support.

Came to post this exact meme but you speak for all of us.
I wish I could edit the post to clarify this but I‚Äôll have to hijack your comment (so sorry lol).

These are NOT AI generated photos and they are my own lol. They were shot on an IPhone 15 and a Fuji x100v in our 1930s house that we‚Äôve been renovating since we bought it in February of 2024!
I always forget that Reddit exists and then do my bi-annual photo dump here haha. Thanks for hanging out in my little corner of the internet though, I appreciate you sticking around ü•π
Came here to say the same! Love your cottage OP, it's so cozy & beautiful, and love following you on IG!
We got super lucky with south facing windows on a majority of the house, I don‚Äôt think I could ever give it up & live in another space with limited natural light lol
As someone who used to be raging minimalist and everything they owned was some shade of white, I‚Äôve clearly swung to the opposite end of the spectrum haha
This is such a thoughtful compliment, thank you ü§ç
We actually had our friend who is a wood worker make them for us because the kitchen used to only have 2 dinky cabinets that were not even screwed into studs lol
They‚Äôre from Piglet in Bed!!
When we bought it it was being sold by a landlord who had been renting the property for the last 15 something years, so we‚Äôve been slowly incorporating charm & character back into it
I don‚Äôt do fiber spinning, but I do knit!! Currently working on the Crippen cardigan by Woolfolk!
A dream, maybe one day haha
Yes!!! Not an expensive designer bag or fancy sports car person, but I am a 100% linen beginning person through and through lol
Yes!! It‚Äôs from Etsy, I‚Äôll message you the link
Thank you so muchü•π It‚Äôs been quite the work in progress since we first bought it but with each little thing we do I feel like life is being breathed back into these four walls!
The walls are loft light by behr and the cabinets are antique white by behr! Loft light can have a very warm/pinky undertone depending on the time of day but I really like how it shifts in natural light!
The walls in the living area are antique white and the walls in the kitchen are loft light, both by behr!
Can promise you it‚Äôs very real (and took many many months to get to this point), it had been a rental for the last 15 something years and had a tragiccc case of the landlord special lol
These were shot on an iPhone 15 and Fuji x100v! I absolutely detest AI, I‚Äôm the kind of person who reports AI generated content every time I see it - especially if it‚Äôs something creative taking away from actual creative humans lol
Pipe dream is to one day own a Bed & Breakfast and if it ever pans out, everyone here is invited haha
What is the Instagram account. I want to see more. üòÇ
What‚Äôs your Instagram? I wanna follow you, too! Your house is a dream ü§©
Oh that's interesting. I'm not sure what 1930's are suppose to look like but congrats on having nice cabinets that aren't the horrid from hell country poorly cut oak with the ugliest wood cutting pattern possible.

What size is that bed? I like the metal frame look but it seems like a lot of vintage ones are like twins and stuff.
How does it feel? I had linen bedding once and it was a little coarser than I‚Äôd like to sleep on.
I was once told if you‚Äôre going to splurge on anything, make it your bedding and footwear since we spend so much time in them! Love the cozy cottagey feel
thank you!
It‚Äôs @apkipps! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs against the rules to share but if it‚Äôs frowned upon mods just lmk!
It is coarser & stiffer at first but I find after 1 wash & sleeping on it for a week, it feels lovely!

Where do you get ""untouched by time"" from ?
What do you think ‚Äúuntouched by time‚Äù means?

Also, what do you think ‚Äúcozy‚Äù means?

Let me be clear: this place appears to me to be neither untouched by time nor cozy. These are subjective opinions, so I‚Äôm interested in hearing you defend your stance. I‚Äôll share mine, too.

My rational: ‚Äúuntouched by time‚Äù means a thing that should have aged has not aged. Like if you found a pristine secret room amongst ruins and rubble, then the room (unlike the surrounding ruins) may appear *relatively* untouched by time. An important part of this is the context; you can tell this pristine room has aged *not according to expectations* cuz there‚Äôs naturally aged ruins next to it.

Your photo gives no context for time. Care to provide context that might help us understand or support your take?

And ‚Äúcozy‚Äù tends to be reserved for things that have some of these qualities: warmth, intimacy, marked lack of excess spaciousness, comfort, snugness. This looks like a cold outdoor market street with enough spacious sky above it to allow for a full view of the top of a construction crane. There are no soft comforts, and a notable lack of people in a space meant for people to be. It gives me a sense of almost spooky discomfort.

If it were the exact same photo but with a big soft fuzzy blanket in the foreground, I‚Äôd say the blanket might seem cozy, but it would still be in contrast to the rest of the photo.

Idk stranger, I think this is just not the place for this photo. But it‚Äôs a cool photo!

Tv looming like the eye of Sauron and also blocking a window. Interesting choice
TV is positioned perfectly for listing departures and arrivals.
Im with the others on the TV. Especially when there‚Äôs that small decorative table right below it doing nothing. Get rid of it and get a TV stand and some blinds.
That TV???
tv high
The place looks absolutely lovely but that TV placement is giving me a stroke. Waaay too high, covers the window and the window itself doesn't have any shutters so the sunlight would be bothersome while watching.
Do you own the TV or does the TV own you?
Tv WAY too high
You have a lovely home, it exudes warmth, comfort and coziness. There has to be a better way to place the TV or smaller size?
For the love of god lower the tv
Good God, that TV is way too damn high. It's the only thing I see wrong with this space cuz otherwise it's lovely. 


I used to hang TVs for work and I would have done everything in my power to convince you otherwise if you had asked me to put it there. 


Like for example I would have put the mounting hardware below the window and then attached the brackets on the back of the TV in a way that would make the TV sit a little higher on the mount so that it would still block a lot of the window if that's part of what you were going for. The TV has a large enough footprint that it'd still hide the brackets.


Also if any direct sunlight comes through that window you're going to want to put at least a light-filtering curtain behind it otherwise your TV is going to get fried.
That tv üòÇüòÇüòÇ love everything else
This one giving me anxiety
Kill that TV. Jeeze!
The tree and the TV are conspiring. I‚Äôd keep one eye open if I were you

Edit to add: that power strip is definitely in on it tooüò≥
That tv is coming after you.
Nothing says cozy like a massively oversized TV hanging off the wall!
Just a world of warning for OP, your tv position  is an 'ergonomic sin,' you're likely asking for chronic neck issues and even headaches looking up at that angle for an extended period.
I know your neck hurts when you watch that TV
this actually upset me hahaha. you have this adorable window and you could set the TV just below it and have the TV at the perfect height, but instead it's hung FAR too high AND blocking a window?! this feels like rage bait and it's working
I LOVE everything about it except for the placement of the television.
That tree is uncomfortably close to the house.
Ignoring the TV, why the hell is that tree so close to the house? Why was it not cut before building, OR while living there? Super weird
is this rage bait? ;\_;
Where?


The nature outside adds to the coziness.¬†
Where is your animal art from? Is it custom?
Im usually not as discerning when it comes to the height level of TVs but this is genuinely too high my dude.
Update:

I did some measuring and ordered a wall mount. It‚Äôll be here later this week. I‚Äôll probably change it over this weekend. Whenever I have extra hands to help me mount it.

I hear what you‚Äôre all saying about the size. But the cost for an equivalent smaller tv is more than I can spend now, and I use cheap monitors for work and an older tv (10-15 years or so) in my room. I want one nice tv. Even $400ish for a nice tv is more than I want to spend when I have a big and good one that works.

I also moved my couch back about 6‚Äù to get it closer to the optimal viewing distance when the tv is mounted to the wall.

Also, adding a picture of the departure board from my kitchen. Part to show how it looks, and part because it‚Äôs still a very cozy view to me.

The tv will still be viewable from here when it‚Äôs lower to the table.

I renovated my house two years ago and it came out exactly how my mind saw it. It was amazing!

I‚Äôm glad that other than the tv, you all like my cozy space.

Ok, since you‚Äôre getting plenty of feedback on the tv I just wanted to say I love the rest of the room!! Really nicely done and definitely cozy!

But about the tv‚Ä¶I too have a 65‚Äù and got it mounted way too high. It does affect your neck even when slouching down on the tv. I got a reasonably priced and stylish stand on Wayfair that I was able to assemble myself. Got some legs/feet for the tv on amazon. Much nicer experience for watching.
What is that abomination hanging in front of the window? Lol. Otherwise, very cozy vibes!
I love your windows, I‚Äôm kind of sad you had to cover the other with the TV.  Also love the table on the left with the art above.
Quite a lovely room otherwise!
The tv is awful, yes, but who cares about that - talk to me about that cat painting!!! It‚Äôs glorious!
upvote for how well you're taking this on the chin haha. you drop that tv and i bet the whole room will turn up 10x on the cozy scale
Rainy days are the best if you just want a cosy, chill day at home!
I love all the windows and that you can see the green right outside.
I'm in love with the setup. Warm and cozy aura.
Put your TV on a stand and save the necks of your future selves... Might seem fine now but eventually your necks will be fecked!
I could not look myself in a mirror if I mounted a tv like that in my house. The exposed wires would drive me nuts.  All my shit is in wall
I love the cat and dog art to the left of the tv. Are they custom portraits of your pets?
See you on the other sub
It's raining all over the world now. I hope you're enjoying yourself.¬†
What's the thing in the window?
Yes.  Yes.  YAS!!!!!
This is original content.
Your home is beautiful¬†
Eh I get why you have the TV there, it's for personal practical usage and the light will still come through anyway, just around it.
I see a giant TV with a room attached to it. Way too big and conspicuous. I would get a much smaller TV and put it lower to the ground. Otherwise it's a cute and cozy space :)
üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
That TV is a choice.  Yikes.
Don't forget the power strip just hanging on for dear life.
""Looming"" is absolutely the best way to describe the TV placement!
/r/tiltofguilt
I thought this was the home decor cj at first. Shocked that it's actually real üò¨
Yep. It came from a different house and I got it in the divorce. Who am I to say no to a free top of the line tv that my ex didn‚Äôt want?

The window looks out on my neighbor‚Äôs house about 10 feet away. Nothing is lost by blocking it.
Every single one of you are nasty people. Peaked in high school type folk.
This one made me laugh. Now I need to see if there‚Äôs a departure board screensaver.
Dat's funny
I second this. The tv could have fit much better under the window than whatever this is. For a room that has as much thought put into it for decor and lighting they really blew the lid on the tv placement.
Or get a 'stainglass' film or whatever you preference is, still get some light while keeping privacy.
My comment got removed for linking certain subs but yeah, it kind of overwhelms any cosy feeling
Haha....was waiting for that crowd üòÇ
There‚Äôs no sunlight. My neighbor‚Äôs house is about 10‚Äô away.
https://youtu.be/tOyNzDALz7k?si=WLk4pPy7WD-NmJfu
TV comically high
I didn‚Äôt buy it. It was for an old house‚Äôs media room. When we moved after the divorce, my ex didn‚Äôt want it, so I made it work for me. It‚Äôs a free top of the line TV. 

With four cats, putting it on the table seemed precarious. I do have the stands, and I‚Äôve thought about it, but I also swing it so I can watch it from the kitchen while I‚Äôm cooking. So it works for me. 

And it doesn‚Äôt hurt my neck. I watched a lot of TV while in a neck brace after surgery last year. *shrug*
This weekend. I ordered a mount.
You happen to live in Seattle and want to help remount it this weekend?  My new mount will be here later this week.
I found a cord kit that looks like I can do it myself to hide the cords in the wall. 

But first I‚Äôm going to remount the tv lower. Then see what the wire situation looks like and go from there. One step at a time.
LOL  

The power strip drives me nuts.  I keep trying to think of how to deal with it.  Get more extension cords and elongate everything so I can cover it?  Drill through the wall and hide them all?  Just paint over them?  I go back and forth, which is why none of them are done.  They need to be able to move a bit, since the TV swivels so I can watch from my kitchen.
It doesn‚Äôt. I tend to lean back, so it‚Äôs right in line with my eyes. But I‚Äôm remounting it lower (bought a new mount today) so it‚Äôll have fewer concerns.
I‚Äôm going to lower the tv this week. 

But looking at it, I think half the window will still be gone. If I remember I‚Äôll take a picture out the window tomorrow. I‚Äôm really not lying when I say there‚Äôs nothing to see.

Right now it‚Äôs dark, so there‚Äôs really nothing to see. ;)
I thought it was a person at first.
The one outside the front windows?

I‚Äôve had people out and the roots aren‚Äôt an issue (my house has been renovated, the basement walls and floor have been redone and checked and inspected so many times, so I‚Äôm positive they‚Äôre not an issue), but the branches on the roof need to be trimmed back so animals don‚Äôt go up there.   I need to do that.
The front yard?  No idea on that one. It‚Äôs been here longer than I have and I don‚Äôt know when it was planted or if it predates the house (1909).
I was going to say I like how close it is. Unsure of the safety of it all but, cozy.
You got me curious. Seattle went around in 1937 and took pictures and descriptions and measurements of all the houses.  

The tree is not in that picture. It is in the 2007 first google street view. So some time in those 70 years it was planted.
Seattle, WA, USA.
Local consignment store.  It may have been at one point, but it's not custom for me.  

They make me amazingly happy.
Thanks!

I have the feet for this one. But my cats will knock it over on the table. And it won‚Äôt swivel. 

I bought a wall mount tonight and I‚Äôll remount it this weekend. It‚Äôll look like it‚Äôs on the table.
Thanks.  It's a unique table.  It actually goes up and down.

The window is both beautiful and a pain in the ass.  I renovated the house and there were many discussions about what to do with the window.  Removing it was never on the table, but do we drywall over it?  Do we build a fireplace (which was my first choice) and leave it open?  Do we put curtains over it (a lady who came into the house for another reason gave me disgusting suggestions without being asked about how my house should be staged and what I should do about that window)?  

There's no light coming through because my neighbor's house is right there.  Getting rid of it isn't an option because it's part of the history of the house.  The TV is high, but swivels and so we turn it when we're eating in the dining room or cooking in the kitchen, so I don't want it on the table and it needs clearance.  I removed the other walls in the renovation, so it can't go anywhere else.

And the TV was free and top of the line, so I wasn't going to replace it.  We laugh about it too.  We actually saw a TV larger for a room about the same size in someone else's home and oogled at it.  We joked when we hung it that we'd have to sit in my neighbor's house to watch it.
I wish I had more details!  I got it and the dog at a consignment store together.

https://preview.redd.it/hl8stujud1rf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86a908b1111d4b6930e37307a2281b4dd49d3816

That‚Äôs the artist‚Äôs signature.

I love them.
One thing that I've hated since the day it was hung is how much space it takes up away from the wall.  It's a big TV, it'll always be a big TV, but it was mounted further out than I thought it would be.  And it makes sense, it needs it to swivel.  But I hated it then and got used to it now.

So I'm excited for my room to feel bigger.  I didn't think it was possible to hang it under the window (all my other TVs and monitors have the mount in the middle of the back, and that would put it right in the window.  This TV has it on the lower third, which I didn't realize until yesterday).  So I got the ceiling mount.  There are no other walls to put it on, and it's too big to fit in the corner.
Had spinal fusion surgery last year. I beat you to it!
It‚Äôs being lowered this weekend. 

Then we‚Äôll see how the wires look. One step at a time.
They are not!  I found them at a consignment store. I just love the colors and the subjects.
Thank you.
Yeah, there are no other walls to put it on (I removed them during a renovation).  

We laugh about the TV, too.  Great for watching hockey on.  They're life sized!
The wiring situation concerns me even more than the TV. I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could accept that as anything other than ridiculously absurd.
I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this
It just ties the whole thing together.
Or the peeping Tom of a tree
you should put it on the stand below it, so it doesnt hurt to look at
Oh something is lost alright. A room that looks well designed
Why is it on the ceiling though?
Light? Views of trees? Common sense?
Thank you!  You‚Äôre the first person to say this looks put together (ignoring the tv). It was always my ex who decorated, and he made the house look like a magazine. I wanted my house to look like a home. 

The tv will be moved this weekend. I‚Äôve bought a mount. It‚Äôll still be covering the window because of the height, but it‚Äôll be mounted lower and looking like it‚Äôs on the table. That‚Äôs eye level.
Frosted window film is super easy to apply. Also that painting could be mounted above the window if the TV was brought down into a proper TV stand.
Is this logic why you are divorced? ü´£
You can purchase a swivel stand. This will let you change the angle as you please while also weighing the set down so there's no concern with the cats.
Wonderful thing about top-of-the-line TVs is that they can be sold at a pretty solid price so you can buy something reasonable that doesn‚Äôt resemble sitting in the front row at a cinema!
Even though the TV is really high, it make totally sense what you are saying here. I also have cats and there is no way I would have the TV on a stand. Your room seems so cozy!
so proud of youü•π
Legitimately if I did I would take you up on that offer, but I don't, unfortunately.
Yay! I‚Äôm proud of you! I still support switching it for something smaller, but do you girl. Try to get it out from in front of that windowü©µ
Girl. That TV situation is insane. Sell the TV, get a smaller one, and put it on a standüòÑ

Or don‚Äôt! It‚Äôs your life ü§™
I am genuinely so happy to hear this news. Please, I beg of you to consider placing it on a TV stand. TVs should be at eye level when sitting down! You may still lose a few inches of window, but it will be SO much better. I see the cat concerns, but if this tv is as heavy as you're saying the they're unlikely to knock it over unless they all decide to wrestle on the TV stand.
It‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôve had someone out to check. I thought I was going to have to have it removed. 

The branches need to be trimmed from above the house for wildlife management. But the roots aren‚Äôt an issue according to the arborist I had check. 

Which was a relief. I LOVE trees outside my window. Clear cut neighborhoods make me want to cry.
Very interesting!   

I saw your other comment, and it's good that atleast someone has checked it.    

Like I love trees myself, don't get me wrong- but having it that close seems like a really weird idea üòÑ   

I mean my parents' household had their neighbours tree about 15m (16yds) away and it still fell down on top of my parents' house in a storm :D so I guess it doesn't matter if it's 1m or 15m in the end, when the trees are 30m long.   

The builders these days tend to cut every tree down for logistics' reasons. Maybe I wouldnt go that far, but cutting ones too close would probably still make sense before building.
I love them too!!! Thanks for the signature :) I‚Äôll try to make sense of it
Why're you so set on mounting it and not putting it on the table just below it? it'll look off with the scale but if you switch out that table for a proper tv stand (or a table 2-3"" wider than the tv) it'll look great and still give you access to the window! (or cut a foot off each leg and use what you have!!)
Damn! How long you been watching TV like that?! ha!
Honestly, the tree worries me. Hopefully OP is not in a hurricane-prone area.
Stand would definitely not hold the weight of that tv
Because I didn‚Äôt think it would fit on a wall mount with the window there. 

I measured after work this evening and I‚Äôm pretty sure it will. So I bought one.
The tv does catch the eye, but once you lower it, you will solve that issue. Aside from that, it is a really warm and inviting space. Well done!
Not quite. It‚Äôs probably an inch too tall for it not to be awkward. 

I‚Äôm going to hang it above the bookcase when I remount the tv this weekend. 

Not sure yet where the plants will go.
No.  My ex came out as gay.
Cackled
I measured with this in mind tonight (many people here are being assholes, but I‚Äôm looking at the options). 

Not sure how the stand will work. The tv is 67.75‚Äù wide and the table is 16‚Äù deep. The stands for the tv are 14.5‚Äù deep (I have them).

I don‚Äôt know how the tv could be on a stand on the table to have it swivel about 35¬∞ and have it fit. 

But I ordered a wall mount that telescopes and swivels. So I can make it *look* like it‚Äôs on the table without worries about the cats knocking it off.
Let me see how it looks mounted on the wall.  One decision at a time.  I'll see it from my sofa, from my dining room table, and from the kitchen (the three places this tv gets watched from).  

Using these sites for a 9'10"" seated distance, this TV size is fine (77"").  And that's to my sofa.  The table is probably 12', and the kitchen is likely 20'.  [https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship](https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/size-to-distance-relationship) [https://www.tomsguide.com/us/choose-right-tv-size,news-24708.html](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/choose-right-tv-size,news-24708.html)

But you're not wrong.  If the tv sells for $5k on Amazon like it shows, and I could buy a 65"" for $1300, that's a bunch of money in my pocket, which is nice.  65"" would likely be too small for viewing from everywhere I view it from, though.
Appreciate it!

Also, no direct sunlight through the window, or if it does it‚Äôs very briefly. There‚Äôs a two story house about 10‚Äô away.
This is a super nice tv. I think I remember my ex saying it was $4-$5k when he got it. I can‚Äôt afford anything that nice. 

My other tvs are all older (the one in my room I think is 10-15 years old), and I buy cheap monitors for work. I can‚Äôt afford to replace this tv with something equivalent and smaller. 

Maybe I‚Äôll look into selling it, but that‚Äôs a down the road concern (the new mount I bought will work with tvs down to 55‚Äù, I believe, so I did future proof it).
Can't swivel if it's on a stand.  We move it around often.  If we're baking or cooking and there's a hockey game on we point it to the kitchen.  Or the kids will move it so it's pointing more toward the dining room while they're eating.  

Believe me, I've had these thoughts, too.  The room it was bought for was twice the size of my living room, AND designed to be a media room, so this made sense.  

What was hilarious was while we were cleaning out the storage unit where this had been stored for over a year, the box was so big we thought it was a mattress.  LOL  When I pulled the wooden box open to take a peek at the ""mattress"" I was shocked to see the TV.  It wasn't supposed to have been removed from the other house.   But my ex oversaw that move, and so the movers packed it and he never noticed.
The tv is tall and thin, so while it‚Äôs 63.7 pounds (you guys have me amazingly curious about my tv now, so I looked it up) its center of gravity is such that my cats will try to climb it and knock it over. Or use it to jump onto the bookcase or window.

But the mount will make it *look* like it‚Äôs about two inches above the table, which is both eye level and about where its stands would put it.

[https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/televisions/all-tvs/p/xr77a80j](https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/televisions/all-tvs/p/xr77a80j)

It‚Äôs this one. 77‚Äù, apparently.

https://preview.redd.it/64h78gps41rf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac10133791dbf840836ea7a7e71000598e1379c1

Cat tax of the one who would absolutely use it to launch herself.
I don‚Äôt know if it was an intentional plan or if it just grew. I was eating cherries on the porch of our old house and if you look at google street view now there‚Äôs a cherry tree out front from me spitting pits. LOL 

I don‚Äôt know of any others around here (it‚Äôs a tulip tree), so my guess is planted. But I don‚Äôt know.
If I put it too much lower than the top of the table height it'll be too low to see it from the dining room or kitchen.

And if I put it on the table/stand I won't be able to swivel it, and the cats WILL knock it off (one will likely jump on top of it to launch herself to the bookcase).  I don't trust the stands against a determined cat.  Broken tvs suck.

When it's mounted it'll be the same height as if it was on stands on the table.  About two inches off the top of it (which is literally the height of the stands).
LOL. Nothing to do with the tv. I woke up after the age of 40 and tried to get out of bed. That was literally it. Bone spur pushing against my spinal column and 10/10 pain. Do not recommend.
Thats why you buy a proper TV stand instead of mounting it on the wall like a spider.
Just place it below the window, whatever it takes
This looks like a 65"" TV. They usually weight around 30 kg without the stand. It wouldn't be hard to find an RTV table that can handle that kind of weight.
Damn you turned him gay with your tv silliness
Good lord, I can‚Äôt for the life of me grasp the importance of televisions. You need to see it from that many places? Are there not other fun (or, perhaps, cozy) things to do in your house but watch tv?
They make swivels for tv stands.
This.
I‚Äôm looking into a wall mount for below the window. 

I think the issue was that the TV‚Äôs mounting places are too high, but I‚Äôm looking into it. The tv would be visible from the dining room and kitchen lower. 

And a diy cord kit to hide them in the wall.  Need to look at the wall mount first, since that‚Äôll show where that kit would go. 

But I do want it mounted rather than sitting on a table because of the cats. Broken tvs suck.
85‚Äù, I think. 

With four cats in the house, this seems safer.
I get you're joking, but it did totally rip my life apart.  

Luckily we're still friendly (as we share two kids) and I love his husband.  But we'd been together for 25 years and he told me a week before our 21st wedding anniversary.  

It sucked ass.
It's no fun to watch hockey games after the fact.
Not as much as your TV placement sucks ass.

(Sorry for your husband. (But even sorrier for your TV.))
You're getting a hard time but as someone that has also had a long marriage end devastatingly and suddenly, that tv is still a crime.
Well your TV takes up about 1/9 of your picture, meaning it‚Äôs ridiculously big. Your house, your life. Not cozy. Put it on a stand, and it‚Äôs still going to take up half your wall. Everything in moderation and within reason, friend. You do you.
Relentless lol

Question. I love this, but always wonder what about rain?
I love it üòç I want to cozy up my balcony too. Do you have issues with insects making their home in the cushions etc?
Beautiful!
To read, and smoke here while it's raining>>>>
This looks absolutely beautiful. I hope it doesn't rain soon.¬†
It‚Äôs a covered porch! The roof extends out and it‚Äôs completely covered. It‚Äôs raining right now and I‚Äôm sitting outside as I type this.
I haven‚Äôt but I have a pest control company that comes every 3 mos. The orange pillows and rugs are outdoor materials, the beigish ones are just cheap goodwill finds that I can toss when they are worn.
Yes! Heaven.
It‚Äôs a covered porch so it‚Äôs nice to sit on when it‚Äôs raining!"

Cat tax paid ‚úÖ
Such a lovely rug
 I live on the second floor of my bff's home, this is my living room/office/library.  I liked the old rug well enough but then bff's elderly cat wouldn't stop peeing on it so I had an excuse to replace it (& now I shut the door if I'm not in the room).  LOVE this one but now I wish the blanket on the ottoman was pink...
Omg I bet fall is great to experience in this house
The bookshelvesüòç
Cat and books. Awesome!
Where did you get such a pretty rug?
I adore your rug
Feels relaxing just by looking at an image. Lovely rug!
I would never leave this room üíô
What‚Äôs your cats name?
Beautiful! What lights are you using for the shelves?
It really ties the room together does it not?
This is beautiful!!!!!!!
Looks great, enjoy your lovely space üíï
So are your bookshelf lights on the bottom BEHIND the books?  Just curious - looking to do something similar.
Wonderful cat
Your bookcases look great!  It took me a minute to realize they weren't built in.  And the lights are extra cozy.  Stealing this entire idea for my house, Kthxbye!
That is one lucky cat
the bookshelves of my dreams
And not a mishung TV in sight.
I love the vibe!
Is the rug heavy enough that the corners don‚Äôt get kicked up easily? I really want a carpet like this but afraid the corners will curl up over time
That rug really ties the room together! And the lighting on those bookshelves is genius btw, gives it such a cozy vibe without being too much.
How did you achieve the back lighting?
Lounging here during a thunderstorm must  slap so damn hard!
Almost overpaid. Good lord that cat is pretty.
It really is!

Amazon of all places.  I specifically need it to be nice but ultimately cheap bc realistically bff's cat is going to pee on this one eventually, üòÇ.
They're just cheap Govee strip lights! This is two strands, each about $15.
They're not at the bottom, but yeah about halfway down the shelf.  They make diffusers so you don't see the individual little lights but I'm super cheap & this works just as well imo!
It's light relative to a high quality woven rug, but it has a kind of not sticky but anti-slippy stuff on the back side.  I have trouble walking so it was a big consideration for me too, so far it's working well!
Just cheap Govee strip lights, I put them half way down the shelf, so you mostly just see glow instead of diodes.
It REALLY does.  Although I have metal roofing over my bedroom, so it's pretty rad in there too.  It's just the coziest fricking home, I'm very lucky by bff invited me here while I finish my degree!
link? It's the perfect rug!
Really nice - thanks for sharing.
Sure! https://a.co/d/bzzmxcL
I've been looking at the washable rugs but can't get over the feeling they would be like a blanket on the floor. Do they ""stick"" like a rug?   
  
Love this room, especially the bookcase lighting!"

Queenie has plenty of comfortable spots to nap.  I'm betting every chair & couch is slept on daily.

Are your kids young?  She might be resting up for the after school chaos.  üòÇ 

No matter, your dog is living well.  Bet she loves the sun beaming through the windows, as well as the windows being low.

Oh boy do I LOVE your furniture. Holy cow.
And it's a beautiful castle to be queen of.
Spectacular
I have that same table!
That‚Äôs her peace time right there, finally gets the house how she wants it when the kids are gone
Is that an Irish terrier?

Beautiful living space!
Beautiful, unique, cozy! Love it!

Oh, how envious I am of your mum living in this lovely house.
The French doors leading to the back garden are lovely - one of the most attractive doorways I‚Äôve ever seen. Can you please ask your mum what kind of climbing plant that is?

Oh very nice! We did London, then rented a car and made our way to the Cotswolds for a few days, then an afternoon in Bath on the way to Wells for 1 night (Hot Fuzz fans) before heading back to Heathrow to come home. Passed Stonehenge just from the highway, but didn‚Äôt stop. Gorgeous countryside.

The stove is to the right all the way back.  Microwave on top, and stove under it , built into the cabinets.  The range is on the other side of fridge.  They are sort of tucked away.
Amazon! I have bought some similar locally, but I couldn‚Äôt find it again.  I am very impressed with the quality!
I honestly have never heard of an oven being referred to as the stove. 

What the above, and myself were likely both looking for was the thing you referred to as the range.
You are correct , my bad.
No problem, i just didn‚Äôt know if it was a regional thing or not."

I'm sure it's no more dangerous than most things we do these days, but something about sleeping every night with your head amongst radioactive glassware gives me pause lol

But it always looks so dope

Is that cabinet putting out UV light ? Dont wanna get any damage from that
What's in the cabinet?
Hehe good one

That is pretty cozy! Does it have a kitchen?
I love how large the bed is. You and the pup can lounge out and still have room to be comfortable. Large bed = instant cozy for me.
Your little cutie is enjoying it! I also like to lie down and look out the window! üòÇ

What a lovely jungle bungalow. Looks very peaceful and your pup seems to enjoy the view!
Love it! Get that monstera in the corner a grow light tho, its really reaching hard for the window. Youll get big fat leaves as soon as you do.
What a comfy home! Blessings to you and your pup!
So homey!  Love the mid mod pieces here and there too.

Yes! I have a white metal cabinet next to the fridge for some extra storage. I haven't gotten a microwave yet, but if I do, I'll put it on top of the fridge. It's just random stuff up there right now. It's cozy too!

I really went back and forth on downsizing the bed, but I'm tall and he's a big boy and decided on keeping it - cheaper that way too. When he really stretches out, he has no problem taking up a good chunk of a king size bed haha
I love your username! I, too, am a goth sloth, hence the very large bed and comfortable space!  my closet and record collection is really the only way to clock my true gothness ‚ö∞Ô∏è
Thank you, definitely my #1 goal!

He likes to overlook the sidewalks below and watch the neighborhood dogs go by. No shortage of action!
I know! I need a light over there for sure. A lot of that growth is actually from the last place we lived, as we just recently moved here, but you are very right. I am looking for the right fixture.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you! I've been a collector for years and had to downsize from a single family home, so I have a storage unit that's always calling out for me. But I brought my favorites and recently inherited some pieces from a beloved aunt that I made space for.
Worf says awOoOoOo
haha thank you!
Thank you so much. Basically nothing wakes me up when I'm truly asleep, so the light in the morning doesn't bother me at all. The blinds stay up most of the time. 

There are trees and a windowless commercial building across the street, so it's relatively private too unless I'm standing at the window.
Honestly mostly just my brain and my great-aunt who passed away last year. She picked out most of her furniture for her 1 bedroom condo in the 1960's and never changed it. She liked muted colors, modern classics, technology & plants. She always made sure to have a lot of family photos and fun collections. I grew up visiting her often and I just admired the heck out of that woman - never married, brilliant mathematician, traveled the world... I was lucky enough to take care of her the last year of her life and I'm so happy I have a few of her things in my place now to remind me of her on the daily. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh thank you! I had a really difficult time deciding what to put up and what to keep in storage. But I think I kept a nice assortment of family pieces, collected originals from friends and a few prints! (And keeping some space in the inevitable event I find something else or frame something else I find in my closet!)
Thank you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è the TV is a 15 year old Samsung  UN55C6500. 

The soundbar's a samsung HW-t450, not LG, either sorry! üòü I had a terrible blip of a roommate situation just before I moved in here recently and her dog ruined the remote - so now I can't control the subwoofer, but thankfully I think it's stuck on the lowest setting!
Oh thank you, it was our first ""soup day"" of the year today - super cozy on a cool rainy day!
Lovely kitchen too! Great that it is separate - my daughter is looking at studios and so many have a tiny ‚Äòkitchen‚Äô in the corner. Do you have your own bathroom, or is it shared, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
It's cozy too! üòç

Some sort of hanging floor lamp would look cool coming from the corner! (IMO)

Something like [this](https://midinmod.com/products/lisbon-black-floor-lamp-off?srsltid=AfmBOorXt8Oiuth7HMyIWOUVWAMpI2awlu2_s-JFLkxwwIaZKaElW3IR)
Same way at my home. No window coverings and we look out into nature, with no one overlooking us, so we let the morning light (well actually the cats) wake us!
I love those kinds of days! I'm in the south and greatly anticipating our first cool-weather soup-making days! I love lighting the fireplace for the first time. The rainy, cold, windy days are my absolute favorite!

Nice little bathroom too.
Not great if you have a helper, but it's very convenient for just me to cook and bake in! I have some work to do on the counter clutter by my espresso machine - but I swear if I don't SEE my medication... out of sight, out of mind for me. And the dehydrator is in the metal storage cabinet now, so that's some extra space too. I haven't had a dishwasher in 10+ years, but I tell you, being in a studio keeps me on top of my dishes because I do NOT want to be seeing that out of the corner of my eye.

This is my closet from the old house I moved from! I miss my libra poster, but, no place to put it in this place. Too vibrant to see all the time, so inside the closet was perfect. haha
You are spot on there! One of the issues I've been running into is finding a floor lamp like that with a short enough arm. It has to nuzzle between the radiator and the record table so really can only have a depth of like, 12"" and a base no bigger than 8"" round. 

Everything but the bed has been purchased second-hand, so I try never to buy new if I can help it, which is also one of the issues and a reason this poor plant still doesn't have a light. It's suffering because of me, I know!
omg it has a tub ??  and accepts Pets...

SERIOUSLY - Let me know when you are going to move and I'll take your place !!  lol
Oh my gosh I love the super bright poster with the closet of all black! Haha it‚Äôs perfect
Yeah! Original to the building too, so it's cast iron and long, which is amazing for me. They don't technically allow pets... Worf is an ESA, but my manager is so sweet, I don't think he would've cared because he loves my dog so much. He calls him ""a Great Friend of the building"". I know he didn't check his paperwork anyway. I'm very lucky to live here. I love it. ü•∞
NICE.  I'm actually petsitting right now and there's a bathtub... but it's not super long AND there wasn't even enough hot water available to fill it more than half way !!  Lol Tragic."

This is a photographic definition of the word cozy!

Looks so cozy for a chilly autumn evening
What was the movie? Poltergeist (1982)? (The ""snow"" on the screen made that my first thought.)
omg!! my partner and i keep looking at mini apartments like this. this is a dreammm. looks SO cosy
Expert mode cozy.
Hard to see people living your dream.
Oooo...what movie?
I want to go to there...
What kind of cookies?
Judging by that tv you live in 1983. Congrats.
Is this like a cabin? If not, it's giving me vibes of an ideal cabin life for me.
Cozy but haunted but still cozy
i wanna be inside that
Love the vintage TV. Doesn‚Äôt need to be gigantic‚Ä¶ just big enough to tell the story. ü§òüèº
I want this.
I love this!!!
Is this for real?
This looks so ‚Äò90s to me for some reason.
This is the absolute definition of cozy, comfy and nostalgia. I would eat the cookies while watching Poltergeist.
Is that the ancient version of the so called ‚ÄúTV‚Äù that our ancestors used to gather around?
Oh man that‚Äôs nice . Cozy and homely looking !
The Halloween cat cookies!
Your ceilings are so high. It looks cool. I like it because it seems very warm in your place.
Now that's cozy!
Cozy! üòç
Omg, is that a lil old school tv with a VHS player attached?! What VHS tapes do you own?? I didn‚Äôt know people actually had these around.
Can you give us a hint as to where it is?

Perfect evening so cozy!
Obsessed
You watching The Ring??
So cozy I wanna be there
That‚Äôs a great space!!!

I wanna play the first halo game on that tv just for the nostalgia wow

Aw this is like my dream place!
my kind of cozy lol
Oh that takes me back to my youth! I‚Äôm getting a late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs vibe and I love it! Nostalgia for the win!
The warm lighting, comfy setup, and cookies with a movie make for a perfect relaxing night. I'd love to spend an evening here, just unwinding and enjoying the moment.
Is that a CRT?! ü´® blast from the past ! Love ittttt
Oh my god. Honestly screw owning a home. I‚Äôd die happy with this setup üòç
I wanna get stalked by a masked killer in this place.
Where‚Äôs the tv tho?
Haha silence of the lambs on vhs .
Waiting for the ring girl to crawl out but I think she's retired now.
Based on how much wide the tape opening is relative to the width of the TV, it must be a tiny 9"" -- like a [Toshiba MK9KD1](https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/xuamxp/toshiba_mv9kd1/).

Back in the day they were OK for playing NES in your bedroom, but to watch a movie on? If you managed to haul all that furniture up there, I'd at least go for a 19"" CRT. Same kind of cozy CRT feel but easier for 2-3 people to watch on.

And the movie?  Agreed with the other replies that it has to be horror. Maybe Poltergeist, with how central the TV is to the plot?
Aw come on you missed a PERFECT opportunity to say ‚Äúwhat the helly are you gonna watch on the retro telly‚Äù haha
I zoomed in and the TV does indeed look like it has a built-in VCR:

https://i.imgur.com/1KDjs3M.jpeg

And it's got RCA composite inputs so they could hook up a DVD player, too. Wouldn't look great on a TV this small, and it's only got mono audio input from what I can tell, at least on the front, but still possible, certainly
My friend told me her family once rented a cabin that had an old tv with the VHS player, and there was only 1 movie at the cabin, Titanic (which was split into 2 tapes- Part 1 and Part 2). They got bored one night and decided to watch the movie, opened the double VHS case‚Ä¶and only the first tape was in it. They still watched it. I always found that wildly funny
I'd be so relaxed and comfortable there that I might actually melt.
Except for the Ring playing on TV and Samara about to crawl out of it anytime now.
This psychopath baked theirself confections to enjoy static TV by
Until you see the VHS sleeve on the table that shows that they‚Äôre watching Hellraiser 2
You‚Äôre in the right genre
Looks to be The Ring
The original Poltergeist.
They look like the pilsbury halloween sugar cookies
I need these
Looks like it has built in vhs player so bump that up to 93 at least
Gotta be eating BBQ chicken legs and crunchy Cheetos for that.

Avoid steak.
Crts are quite popular with people playing retro games (like PS2  generation and older as they were made for those tvs personally just played N64 on mine yesterday)   and vhs are in with some extent again same with cassette tapes which is popular enough for new music being released on it
I hope so üòÇ
As someone else pointed out there's an empty VHS sleeve on the coffee table of hell raiser 2
Good point üòÑü§òüèª
I know I zoomed in after I posted the question haha ü§ó
In all seriousness though, it appears they're about to watch Hellbound: Hellraiser II, from the empty VHS sleeve on the coffee table. But vintage horror can be pretty cozy, too.
or it's underground bootleg sequel, Ring Ring


also, the big bang
Although a place like this would be nice to cut Wi-Fi and all tv radio etc . A nice escape cabin .
How in the WORLD?‚Ä¶. Can anyone see that.
Nothing like some cookies, milk, Pinhead, and cenobites‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a pun in there somewhere, but I‚Äôm too sleepy to come up with it‚Ä¶
I mean, doesn‚Äôt everybody want cookies and cenobites?!?"

Get moving, buddy. No loitering zone. 

(I had 2 beagles years ago, Songsam and Piper- Thai whiskies, I found them in the market in Bangkok. They  need a very specific type of owner- that is not me, lol. I saved them, they both had parvo and were just little babies so I snatched ‚Äòem. They made it against the odds. But my god- they don‚Äôt listen to shit. They could both swim in my pool really well though. Shockingly. I think it‚Äôs cause they had been taken into the water since they were 10 weeks old. They were about 5 when I moved countries and a very good Thai friend with a big garden and pool wanted them. She had known them since the beginning. They are about 12 now. Snowy faces, still very happy and very bonded. K- that‚Äôs my beagle story. Thanks for coming guys.)

Awww‚Ä¶looks like kitty likes it too!
wow..! those nepenthes..! And a cute kitty cat too..! Surely cozy..=)
So lovely!!! Your own private jungle!
* This is in Florida

* I have big plans for my yard I'm slowly working on.. mostly wanting to dig up most of the ferns and vines and get some different kinds of colocasias and colorful jungley plants. There's also a sunny corner I want to put a rose garden and succulents. Also digging up the giant bougainvillea the previous owner put there for some reason... super shady spot.
Absolutely stunningly beautiful
Loooove ü™¥!! üòç
What‚Äôs your cats name?
It's the perfect porch for cats! They have a big sectional sofa just off camera they love lounging on all day.
I was legit looking inside the pitchers yesterday. Found some ants idk what I expected haha.
Noooo! Leave it natural. Add some flowers but the ferns and other natural plants are gorgeous and make it special. Do not get rid of them!! 

Work with nature, and just add a few things for color. Chat with a natural landscaper to get some ideas of what to add.
Thanks so much! It's my own little sanctuary I'm so happy for
This one is Ash Lynx, but he's always getting into trouble so we will shout ASHTON
Can I have their life?! ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è
Natural is still the goal, all of the plants I buy thrive in subtropical environments and can fill the space up in the ""overgrown"" way I like. The ferns look nice but attract gnats and are overgrown and suffocate other plants, like you can't even see any of my bromeliads back there. Also not a huge fan of flowers generally, I prefer colorful leaves.
Nice. It‚Äôs going to look gorgeous. I said flowers because you mentioned roses. I much prefer plants too. It‚Äôs such a great environment for beautiful colored leaf plants. Growing in FL is such a joy!
I'm a sucker for roses because I've never really grown them, but there's a neighbor that has some beautiful, rare ones that I have to stare at every time I walk by haha. Personally my favorite flowering plants I've grown are Passionflower and Dragon's Breath, both grown from seed during 2020 when I was bored lol.
It‚Äôs going to be gorgeous, please post when you‚Äôre ready!  Love to see it!"

This sub has GOT to stop parading around thinking stiff wooden desks and wooden chairs are somehow cozy.
I have a pair of cranes identical to the one on your desk from the international crane foundation! I‚Äôve never seen another in the wild, got them as a kid from a class field trip there in the 90s.
I also found one of those amazing vintage bankers chairs at a garage sale for $5 a few weeks ago and it has the same casters except in steel/gold but one is broken. Trying to find a replacement but they‚Äôre all so expensive :/
Cool.
I love the partitions in that wood desk drawer !
It's your golden retriever that got my attention. Such a cutie.¬†
This whole setup is from 10 years ago and long gone! The desk was found free on the side of the road. It was a cute little setup!

Love it
I have to say your space is really nice, I went through a few posts and I envy how cozy and amiable everything looks, especially with the Tortie Coven for company (I didn't know almost every tortie is a female! There's one I often pet nearby my workplace, and never thought of checking for it, but I assume she's a girl too). Hope you'll find many lovely games to enjoy too, props to your SO!

[removed]
This is calm and collected. What are you watching on TV?¬†
how sweet of you, thank you so much!
Oh but other aspects of your house make me think it's an amazing place. Beams, island cabinet/rooms, etc.
couldn't catch the initial comment, since it was deleted by the mods. but let me tell you, it's actually a very small (rented) apartment right under the roof, and we just try to make the most of the place... that said, I'm always open to constructive feedback!
I was just saying the TV is so far to the right that it makes me uncomfortable (the word I used might be auto removal?). I was just saying flanking both sides from plants might bump it over and look good. I can't say it'll actually work or anything. It's just my reaction. 

That looks a lot nicer than any small apartment I had in college.
Thanks for your perspective, I see where you‚Äôre coming from! We pushed the TV right to save daylight from the glass wall, but it never felt ideal. Your comment reminded me to rethink it...maybe a bigger change, since as it is now, I agree it doesn‚Äôt feel quite right
Personally I'm very excited for consumer grade TVs that roll up or something when not used. Or even better turn into a chair somehow."

This post has made me realize that the term ‚Äòcosy‚Äô can be very subjective. 

Just want to be clear that I don‚Äôt mean that in a snarky or negative way at all, that place is gorgeous, as are your pics.
The crazy thing is that so many buildings in Budapest are just as lovely. üëè 

I seriously considered moving there the last time I visited, as the architecture is simply gorgeous.
What does it look like inside ?
Loved my time in Budapest, such a beautiful city.
I lived in a house like this in Budapest those staircases are ideal hiding space for junkies with needles
Im really curious if [this is your view,](https://i.imgur.com/uKQr4Y4.jpeg) cause if so, we stayed at the same place lol

I‚Äôve visited twice now and really enjoy this city! The massive market in old train station was a highlight, and spent some time in the bathhouse with other locals just reading a book or chatting. Boat tour down the river.
The inside was quite modest and utilitarian, but still charming. Was perfect for this particular quick-trip pass through.
Junkies like to be cozy too
That‚Äôs an American problem
I think I‚Äôve stayed here too!!
same!! hahah
A good ballpark figure is 1M huf / sqm. 

Source: i live here.
Yes! Reminds me of one of the Bourne movies leaping from building to building
Part of that was filmed outside my office building when I lived there! And some of the chase scene in the car went down the cobblestone street outside my apartment!
This trip was thrown together so last minute I honestly can‚Äôt remember. Took the train in from Krakow and only stayed one night. Rented a car and left for Croatia/Montenegro the next day.
How much is rent? What's the minimum contract term limit?
Lol, what an inaccurate thing to say.
No I lived in Budapest
Absurdly out of touch take
I mean to rent per month?
Decent, which movie?
Rent in my experience would be in the ballpark of 200,000 and up per month, though I imagine a short term contract might put that quite a bit higher.  
Source: I also live here.
To buy. Rent is approx 250-350k / mo in Budapest depending on location. Only like 10-15% of people are renters though, most people buy their homes. Renting is considered a temporary solution, this is a cultural legacy of socialism.
Thanks for the info, I would say I expect to pay $1000/month for short term rental like few months. I visited Budapest few years back and I would love to come back and stay longer to explore the area. My favorite places are the hot spring and parliament building, it look beautiful"

Baby, it's yours, all yours, if you want it tonight
I'll give you the red light special all through the night
Looks cozy. I made a pretty sweet guest bedroom too. Then the kids moved back in. I had another project planned for the other open bedroom, was going to be a Victorian era room red floral wallpaper or paint job. Gold accented small side tables, with my steam punk projects on display. And old photos from passed family members in black and white.

I really like that beam that goes through the middle.
I thought you were getting pulled over.
I don‚Äôt blame you. I would too.
I wish I got a roku tv because I love that background
I want to visit ot
Mine is my wfh office, so I'm in there more than my living room lol. I recently put a TV and bed in there (no more air mattress) so now I call it second living room sometimes.
Thank you!
I put a lot of thought into this space for exactly that purpose

Small by American standards maybe. In an inner suburb in Australia, there would be another house in the lawn.
Houses in my dreams look just like this‚Ä¶.
Cute little house!
Very inviting!

Love this, but put your house number underneath the light.
Awww man, I went to high school in NH and this night vibe‚Ä¶brings back memories ü•π
I love this home!
You forgot to mention long shutter speeds and low noise
It definitely has seen some love: no weeds in gravel driveway or between the brickwork, nice edging.  Siding and roof in good condition.  A fair amount of water and a rapid cycling freeze-thaw-freeze cycle make it seem like New England is constantly trying to destroy your house.  Smaller= less maintenance= better
I guess we'll just take your word for it and imagine the cozy insides ourselves.
This is the dream right here. I'd kill to see the inside, it looks like the perfect size to just hunker down and escape a New England winter. That classic New England architecture always adds so much charm. Seriously cozy spot.
Beautiful!
Love it! Perfect vibe!
Another one here who wants to see more pictures, inside and out! üòç

I so much love the little touch of green with those flowers.¬†
Why so much light pollution?  This why we don't have fireflies/lightning bugs or bats anymore, and more mosquitos.
America? No thanks
I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt invite us in‚Ä¶

In the greater Boston area a house that size in a good neighborhood will run you 750k plus. American standards don‚Äôt apply to a lot of New England op is just being modest lmao
It‚Äôs about 940 square feet so still on the small side for a single family house in the area. Definitely more than enough space for two people. I have a large yard which makes for great neighbors üò¨
I do too. Mine was built in 1923 and I am the third owner. I was told that at one time there was a family of 6 living inside of it!

Perfectly understandable, just know it's New England and there's a lot less support for fascism here

I'd say colourful rather than cosy
Ah yes, nothing says cozy like a wooden bench with a wooden backrest and little leg room.
This might be the opposite of cozy
Wow- I stayed there about 20 years ago! That‚Äôs triggered a lot of very hazy memories .  Even remember a beer Olympics in there. We won easily
I think this is Flying Pig Beach Hostel. I have stayed there few years ago. Had an unreal time. Very cool place with very nice vibe. A hidden gem and yes very cozy!
Amsterdam doesn't have a beach nearby. 
It's just marketing. Please don't buy into it.

(This is in Noordwijk.)
Very Malibu, lol. Was it all just focks outside?
Omg the faint flashback that brought me, thanks !

Spent 2 days there with my friends 10yrs ago, it was always heavy raining so what else to do besides smoking.. the bluriest couple of days ever üòÇ
looks like the spot where u just lose track of time and forget ur phone for a bit
This is original content
Which hostel?
How much did u pay per night ?
Nothing in Amsterdam is ever cozy
And a cigarette-butts can! Don't forget the cigarette-butts can!!
I did stay there too like 2 years ago, nice backpacker hostel and the beach is so beautiful!
Which is outside of Amsterdam
Ijmuiden beach is 24 km from the city center. You can go there with your bycicle. For comparison downtown Los Angeles is 22 km from the closest beach.
I think OP meant beach theme. Also Zandvoort erasure? Lol
Everything is ""nearby"" to Amsterdam to us Americans.  It's physically a very small place and nothing is more than a casual few hours drive.   All relative of course
What do mean by focks? üôÇ
The flying pig beach hostel
20 euro i think, really cheap for the Netherlands
Weird take but ok.
It‚Äôs gezellig, which is even better than cosy üòú
Maybe not if you are sober in the city center
They're not really for cigarettes, if you know what I mean
Yeah, I get that, but reducing a third of our country to ""Amsterdam"", thereby foregoing tons of villages and towns with their own names and characteristics is inconsiderate, at best.
I mean absolutely nothing by focks, it's not a word in my language. I like to know very much what Google Keyboard thinks I might have meant by focks.
That's not even near Amsterdam
Well, kinda, it‚Äôs still an hostel in the end
I'm not gonna start a fight over a subjective opinion on how ""cozy"" a city is. That would be such a dumb redditor thing to do.
Or sober in general.
This hostel is 33 km from Amsterdam central. The distance between Groningen and maastricht is 270 km. The distance between the German and Belgium border is over 300 km. This is alot smaller than one third of the country. It took 40 minutes to get there from central Amsterdam, how is it not accurate to call it outside of Amsterdam?
I have some words that I misspelled once, several years ago. And for whatever reason Google keeps autocorrecting real words into those
Google maps says 45 minutes to the city center. Is that not considered ‚Äúoutside Amsterdam‚Äù?
I know that the Netherlands is the size of an average parking lot in Houston. But it takes like 40 minutes to the center with the hostel shuttle. And the hostel advertises themselves as being in Amsterdam
Yeah but even the hostels there are expensive asf
Yes, just as far as Den Haag is, so it is not relevant.
That‚Äôs true: how was ur experience? How were the beds?
That‚Äôs fascinating to me! Here in the US, you‚Äôd still be in the metro area. Hell, in many cities like NYC or LA, you‚Äôd still be in the same city.
The beds were fine, nothing out of the ordinary. But good atmosphere. And the free earplugs they gave out were literally the best earplugs I've ever used. I must have reused those over 100 times!"

the infamous Make Art Not War print... did you buy it at the Mauerpark Flohmarkt? :D  
the room looks lovely, both vintage and 'modern/young' to me. I love the little fabric lamp over the blue chair!

I did üòå many friends said a bed in the middle of the room feels totally off but for me it was the best sleeping place ever
It is, it‚Äôs a lava lamp projector made by Mathmos. Highly recommend!
The ones on the wardrobe? These are artisanal, bought them on a Christmas market. Top and bottom made from carton cut in circular, triangular and rectangular shape, connected by metal string bent to the same shape and wrapped in translucent colourful paper. And then normal fairy lights inside, pretty straightforward :)
Highly recommend, these lava lamp projectors are a game changer üåà

It‚Äôs a Mathmos lava lamp projector :) it sucks you in, super relaxing to watch!

perfect example of the difference that CRAP makes! (curtains, rug, art, plants)
I love the cloffice
THAT RUG! üíú
That office nook!
Love it! Looks curated over time.  100% my style.  Slightest recommendation is to get an ottoman or pouf for that chair.  It would then be the perfect reading/napping spot.

OK, loving just about everything about this! And trust me, I‚Äôm the weirdo that zoomed in on the bookshelves and the pictures because I‚Äôm a book at it and I used to frame pictures for a living. Your pictures are hung perfectly. And when I saw the comment that said you used command strips‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not only brilliant you‚Äôre a magician. And the touches like the antique typewriter‚Ä¶. That sound of music poster that‚Äôs framed or that beautiful rug, or the framed newspaper in the back of the bookshelf. Every piece came together brilliantly. And as a southern woman, I love that she gave Willie Nelson a place of prominence. Absolutely love this.
Can someone give suggestions on how to build a gallery wall like this? Or even just find art in general? Everything here feels so eclectic and cohesive yet also like they gathered everything over 40 years. I've tried going to antiques stores and I have a few pieces but I'm still super far from having enough to fill out a wall like this. I don't even know where to go to find good frames to put stuff in!
Love this, but the dust build up must be suffocating üíÄ
I feel like lighting needs to be in there somewhere too
Plus lamps
adopting this phrase kthanx
Cloffice!??!!  Haha - love that term.  And yes, what a cozy perfect cloffice OP has!
Haha thank you
It really ties the room together.
Yeah! I love it!!! OP where is it from please hehe
And lamps!
Same I love the rug!
What if I told you everything except for the Ikea painting was hung using command strips? No holes.
Amazon. There's a bunch on sale if you look up Vintage floor lamp
Thrift stores for about 90% of them. The others were bought online or stuff I photographed myself.
Thanks! No it's just a set I bought online. Supposed to be ""hand made"" in Poland or something but not sure I buy that lol
You know I always wondered but now that you mention it, I don't have a front door. I can only enter through the backdoor in the kitchen. There used to be a front entrance but the landlord boarded it up a long time ago to make the place bigger. This is probably a remnant of that. Mystery solved lol thanks
You're so kind! Thank you!
I gathered this over 1 year. I definitely could not have made this in a couple months or anything like that. The gallery wall used to be in my bedroom in my old apartment. I just moved it here. 

Almost everything is thrifted. But everything is related to my interests. Gallery walls don't work if it's filled with stuff you think you should like. It only works if your personality is somehow reflected in them too.

I love Europe and I've traveled to a lot of European countries so a lot of the pictures are of Europe. A bunch of them are pictures I've taken myself and there's a story behind it. 

The pictures I've collected are either Canadian artists or represent my city. 

I have a minor in history so I've tried to tie in my history interests to other parts of the room. 

Good frames are found in thrift stores. Value village is solely responsible for 80% of these. See if it's a frame that you can repurpose. You can't do it for some of them.
[deleted]
How about CLARP? ü§£
true!
PM me the link?
Disagree with most of this except for curtains! 
Curtains! Get longer ones
I don't think people are down voting you because they think you're being dishonest and mean. I think they are down voting you because they disagree. 

People saying they like this are not just saying it to be ""super nice"". They probably genuinely like it. It's bizarre to accuse dishonesty because you can't fathom a difference perspective.
Thank you for the advice! I agree about the curtains. I think I screwed up there. But the pictures are all pictures I thrifted or bought because it represented my interests. I buy a lot of things on amazon but none of the pictures were bought there. 5 of the frames are amazon purchases though, not the pictures themselves.
Most passive aggressive comment I've ever read.
OP only moved in *a month ago*!  Maybe put yourself in their place.
Appreciate a real comment.  Cheers

Yeah because this isn't a design help sub. People don't post asking for advice. The general etiquette in that kind of context is if you don't have something nice to say don't say anything at all. If you want to provide feedback, do it somewhere where people are actually asking for feedback. There are plenty such design subs.
Admittedly I don't frequent this sub as much as you do, but my opinion still applies. The OP may get upset if people don't give them the validation they need but there is no real reason to believe that the nice posts are being fake. 

Also, I don't see any issues with buying stock standard, impersonal stuff from Amazon. Some people don't have the financial availability to get bespoke art."

Amazing combination of colors! Just had to check your other posts and wasn't disappointed - your projects are amazing, right up my alley! Designs like yours are so refreshing to see, I'm so bored of seeing mostly tones of grey and beige while there's endless possibilities of creating color combinations that rock.  
Btw., can you recommend any resources that inspire you? I love books about interior design, but exciting ones are hard to find...
Where is it from?? Gorgeous!
This is amazing. Right now, I think I want something exactly like it.¬†
Swooooooon üòç
Love all your posts!
I believe this is the first time in reddit that someone tells me what‚Äôs your inspiration or from where that comes from. I‚Äôm gonna be honest, and this might sound weird but design is an exercise of faith and profound humility.

It‚Äôs about visualizing something that is going to happen for the first time and probably will never happen again. 

Could anything be more uncertain than this? Could there be more room for error in something that is being conceived for the first time and has never been tested? In my opinion, no. And this confronts you with all your fears, but at the same time it‚Äôs part of its charm and of this tingling feeling that I experience. It‚Äôs an inner fire that guides you and lets you know that you have arrived here to stay, hopefully forever.
It‚Äôs from a very close Spanish supplier and I'm so glad you loved it!

It‚Äôs actually insane the amount of people who downvote my comments or posts, however people like you specifically who tell me directly that they know who I am because they saw other posts that they liked, are the ones that I take seriously. 

What value can I get from people who just hate without actually analyzing the whole perspective and just because they are mean people.

I prefer to have 10-20 people like you that I will always answer and try to help because I know how kind and smart you are, rather than random haters.

Thank you so much my dear I will always have you in my mind! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Love it!
Love that chair - and how when sitting in it, the contents of the bookcase are easily within reach. 

This makes me want 2 see what's in the small gold frame behind that chair! Perfect lamp btw:)

OP, the pic's presenting as super-dark on my iphone - do you have a stool / ottoman in front of the chair? 

The overall murkiness...sigh. Makes me want 2B deep into a lengthy murder mystery, with a a pint of Haagen Dazs very, very close.
Love everything about this. The lamp, the books, the mat, the flooring. Beautiful space. Love it.
Love the cozy reading space. I would pull the chair out of the corner a wee bit.
Nice! What's your current favourite book in that collection?¬†
That‚Äôs a beautiful bookshelf; it would fit right nice in my home üíü

No ottoman, I have a leather recliner that will go back there as soon as I‚Äôm recovered from my shoulder surgery. Here‚Äôs the gold framed art.üåü
Thank you!!
We have a big comfy leather recliner that should be there, but it is currently doubling as my recovery bed from shoulder surgery. It makes the room even warmer.

Ive rarely been so glad that I asked a question! It's stunning.

Would you mind sharing the name of the piece & the author? (If not, I understand.) 

The recliner sounds perfect. Hope your shoulder's healing well.
I have one too and began sleeping in it after surgery. That was 1.5 years ago and I‚Äôve been sleeping in it since. Best sleep ever!

I love everything about this!
Cosy AF! And I love the mid-century modern vibe you've got going on. Plus cat.
This has transported me back to my grandparents' living room in the 90's, and I do mean that as a compliment. It would take me no time at all to peacefully fall asleep on that couch.
What is ‚Äúblue hour‚Äù?
gilmore girls?
Unreal. I‚Äôm jealous
Where do you live? This is gorgeous.
Honestly, the blue hour is so underrated.
Love that lamp on the book shelf but damn everything here is a vibe!
This is OC.
Blue hour has got to be one of my favorite time of the day. Really reminds of the cozy 90s tv atmosphere.
This picture is clean af aye
10/10 cozy.
The time you‚Äôre talking about is referred to as twilight, of which there are 3 different stages, but I think I might have to adopt ‚Äúblue hour‚Äù instead. I kinda love it, like a counter to golden hour, haha.

Great pic and great place, looks super cozy!
it looks simultaneously cozy and out of a horror movie lol
Yeah that looks cozy af
I love it!
NEDERLANDS! Ik hou ervan
COZY!!!
Love the cat bed.
Love the cat.
Your cat is the master of the space. This looks good.¬†
r/thatnightfeeling
This is literal cozy paradise.
I love love love this
Looks like a dream üíô
Magical
Love this pic. looks pretty and so cozy, I‚Äôm jealous
Cool. And it comes with a kitty cat too!
Stunning. How do we get a blue hour of our own? So pretty.
Those windows are incredible, wow. Enormous but still private. I'd trade some of the shelves for a larger TV, but other than that I'm in love with this space.
I love this so much! Looks like the perfect place to hang in the fall with that huge window
Stunning!
Suggestion: a little ottoman
OMG, is that a cat bed mounted to the radiator?

Is it weird I‚Äôm jealous of a cat?
I love that warm and cool room
I love lamp.
You‚Äôre doing so well for yourself. Can you please teach us your ways?
is there a second cat on the couch?
Absolutely lovely ü§©
absolutely awesome
This room is so peak it makes me think it's Ai generated even though it's not
The adorable white fence outside makes it look so cottage-y and quaint!
The only improvement that can be made is to a) have two cats, and b) have two cats lounging in that kitty bed at the time of the photo.


Otherwise, no notes.
I love this ! I zoomed in and took each part of it So cozy
The blue hours adds a serene touch to the space. The warm lighting combined with the natural twilight creates a perfect ambiance. Having a space like this to relax in is a real treat.
During the what
The cat always completes it.
Ahw, thanks! I got the wall unit from my grandparents; they bought it new in the 60‚Äôs!
I love this comment! My grandmother gifted me her 60‚Äôs wall unit, so you got the vibe completely right!
Just after sundown (in this case) or (I suppose) just before sunrise
Haha! Good eye! It‚Äôs autumn after all. üòå
The Netherlands!
Isn‚Äôt it!? It‚Äôs my favorite time of the day!
Thank you!! It‚Äôs a bit small, but I love it as well. Sometimes I find it hard to go to bed on time, because I‚Äôm so enjoying all the coziness around me. üòÅ
Ahh, so it‚Äôs not an existing expression in English?? I just figured it was, but it could be just a Dutch expression I translated too literal! üòÅ
Haha!! How!?
Also: KAT
He loves it as well!! It‚Äôs superbig and soft. I wish they made human sized ones.
Yes, I really love that about my apartment!! I also LOVE watching the trees change with the seasons. In winter, when they‚Äôre completely bare, I‚Äôm able to watch into the park. üòä
The tv is the perfect size for me! I‚Äôm sitting very close to it. The one I had before this one was way smaller (I had to lift the shelf for this one).
It is!! I love watching ‚Äòmy‚Äô trees turn orange!
Great idea! However the table is extendable, so I need that tiny amount of free space I‚Äôve got left üòÅ
It is! And I‚Äôm jealous as well, it‚Äôs so nice and toasty in winter haha! Wish they made human-sized ones haha!
Ahw thank! It‚Äôs tiny though, but ‚Äòlight/see-through) furniture (no ‚Äòblocks of furniture‚Äô, if that makes sense) and lots of smaller warm toned lights are enough to make it feel more spacious!
Haha no! That‚Äôs my pumpkin pillow. üòÇ
Ahw, never looked at it that way! üòÅ I appreciate it even more!
It's gorgeous, Lou; nice job with the whole space <3
I guess I e heard of ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù but never ‚Äúblue‚Äù. Interesting.
It's the best autumn show! ü•∞ Love the vibes here, everything is perfect! üíñ
What!? It _is_ the Netherlands? I knew it!

I can literally always tell if a picture is from the Netherlands or not (I'm also Dutch). But this one surprised me. 

There's really not much except the brick wall and the trees that gave me a strong feeling of it being Dutch ;p
Thank you for sharing OP! It was so cozy I thought it was AI for a second, lol
Okay, a translation explains how ‚Äúblue hour‚Äù could come into existence, definitely not a thing in English üòÇ but people don‚Äôt usually refer to the time as twilight either. 

I honestly very rarely come across anyone mentioning this specific time at all, actually, but a good blue hour can be just as amazing as a good golden hour. Very under-appreciated in my opinion.

Thanks again for sharing üòä
Leave it to Americans.... we do have human ""dog beds"".   [https://weareplufl.com/products/plufl-the-dog-bed-for-humans?variant=43193966067938](https://weareplufl.com/products/plufl-the-dog-bed-for-humans?variant=43193966067938)Amidst everything crazy-town we have going on here we also have some ridiculous stuff.
Which table?
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è This is the other side of the room!

Hi, videographer here. When I shoot weddings, we often discuss with our couples how golden hour will transition into blue hour. It makes for some very beautiful photos/video and is a deep contrast to golden hour. Lovely stuff!
Absolutely!! I just started my yearly rerun! üòÅüçÅüçÇ‚òïÔ∏è
Haha, I can always tell as well. Most of the times it‚Äôs the ‚Äòlaminaat‚Äô flooring that gives it away. Americans tend not to have it?
And massive windows too haha, when I lived there it was the thing I loved the most !
Thank you for teaching me something! üòÅ
Hahaha! BUT: can I attach it to the radiators? üòÇ
It‚Äôs in the lower right corner! I posted a photo from the other side of the room in the comments. üòå
Lovely. Perfect yellow chairs. I really like when people are bold with colour. A piano and a guitar, and maybe a record player...I can see the contours of your soul <3
Wow, I love your light game. It looks amazing.
That‚Äôs interesting!!
Blue hour is absolutely a thing in English, though you hear it used more often with regards to photography, like golden hour. Gorgeous room by the way!
Thank you! Lots of smaller - warm toned - lights is key!
Huh, I‚Äôve actually somehow never come across it myself. Granted, I‚Äôm not a photographer, but I do tend to float around those kinds of spaces. Maybe it‚Äôs a regional thing? Either way I appreciate you letting me know :)
Of course, it‚Äôs not nearly as common of a phrase as golden hour, so I can‚Äôt blame you. 

Here‚Äôs a link: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_hour

And if you look up ‚Äúblue hour photography‚Äù or something similar, you can find a decent amount of guides or just photos in general shot during blue hour"
