Bonus points to pants with practical perks like wrinkle-resistance, technical fabrics, and — the holy grail — pockets!<br /><br />From elevated joggers and ribbed sweater pants to pull-on trousers and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10982020/cargo-jeans-trend"">roomy cargo pants</a> (plus the odd sweatpant that we couldn’t resist), meet our 24 favorite travel companions ahead.

<p>November starts off like a smoldering poem written in invisible ink, and ends like an action-packed indie film with a rom-com twist and a psychedelic soundtrack. If October was about uncovering what haunts you, November is about <em>what you do with the ashes</em>. Are you going to keep poking around in the ruins, or are you finally going to build the fire pit, roast the marshmallows, and invite your higher self to come hang? <br /><br />The astro-weather this month is intense, deep, philosophical, and yes… messy. But in the best “clarity-through-chaos” kind of way. We kick off the month with Mars shifting into Sagittarius on November 4 after an emotionally consuming six-week stint in Scorpio. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio was laser-focused</a>, obsessive, and operating like a detective with a vendetta, chasing one target at a time with no room for distractions. <br /><br />Now, with Mars in Sagittarius, the energy gets more expansive, scattered, and inspired. But don’t let the hype fool you. This isn’t just a sprint toward “bigger and better.” Jupiter (Sag’s ruler) is retrograde in Cancer, so the compass is internal. Expansion for expansion’s sake is out. <em>Heart-led, intuitive expansion</em> is the only way forward. Every opportunity that knocks this month should be questioned: “Do I want this because it’s shiny? Or because my soul says yes?” </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 is like a cosmic weighted blanket. It’s earthy, ancestral, and anchored in reality, but still deeply sensual and steeped in beauty. Venus rules this moon, and she’ll be in the final degrees of Libra at the time, which adds a soft, romantic, and artful lens to the emotional intensity. There’s an invitation here to release the need to hustle for worthiness. Let your nervous system downshift. Let pleasure be productive. Let simplicity be sacred. <br /><br />Venus joins the Scorpio party on November 6, the day <em>after</em> the Taurus full moon. So while Mars has left the chat, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio energy is still very much holding court</a>. With the Sun, Venus, and later Mercury retrograde all swimming in Scorpio’s dark, transformational waters, the vibe is: “If I can’t bond with you on a soul level, what are we even doing here?” Expect obsessions, secrets, power plays, and some steamy (and possibly confusing) connections. Intimacy is currency this month — spend it wisely. <br /><br />On November 7, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde</a> shifts into the final degrees of Taurus, where it will complete its seven-year revolution through this sign. This is major. Taurus represents our values, our money, our bodies, our land, and our sense of stability. Uranus represents upheaval, revolution, and awakening. Over the next few months, we’re being asked to reflect: How have your core values changed since 2018? What financial, physical, or emotional risks have actually brought you closer to your truth — and what comfort zones have quietly been killing you? These final Uranian activations are wildcards, but they’re also full-circle. Prepare for the plot twists. </p>



<p>Here comes the real kicker: Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, just five days after Mars enters the sign. And it’s giving existential crisis with a laugh track. Expect mental overload, spiritual rants, lost documents, misunderstood texts, and big ideas that may not land… just yet. You might say too much, or not enough. But it’s all part of the recalibration. <br /><br />Then on November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio. Cue déjà vu. Whatever themes came up in October when Mercury was originally in Scorpio? They’re back. But this time, you’re not just collecting receipts — you’re reading them aloud and deciding which ones you want to return <em>and which ones you’re keeping as trophies</em>. Lessons will repeat until integration happens. </p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Jupiter retrograde begins on 11/11 in Cancer. If Mercury retrograde is the mental review, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is the emotional one. Expect tender feels, nostalgia bombs, family karma flare-ups, and a re-evaluation of what emotional security actually means. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer asks: Have you been caretaking others at the expense of yourself? Or avoiding intimacy under the guise of independence? Either way, this is your cue to grow — not by going “out there,” but by going <em>in here</em>. <br /><br />And then — finally — the clouds begin to part. On November 21 at 8:35pm, the Sun enters Sagittarius. That’s when the heaviness begins to lift. Your inner child wakes up. Your passport starts winking at you. There’s laughter again… the kind that surprises you mid-sentence. Sag season reminds us that we don’t always need a plan; we need a vision. And with Saturn finally stationing direct in Pisces on November 27, some of the lessons and limits we’ve been trudging through since June <em>finally</em> start to make sense. You’ve earned your wisdom stripes. Now you get to dance with them. <br /><br />To wrap it all up, Mercury stations direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30. So not only are we clearer, but we’re funnier, flirtier, freer. The month ends with a bang… in the best way. So yeah, the first three weeks of November may feel like crawling through an emotional escape room, but the final stretch? It’s giving spiritual carnival. An open road. And if you play your cards right, you’ll end this month with a deeper trust in your heart, your boundaries, your voice — and your ability to rise. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to fire, Aries, but this month starts in the deep end of water, and asks if you’re really ready to feel the heat that comes from <em>within</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season is activating your sector of shared intimacy</a>, soul ties, and karmic debts. That’s not exactly light-and-breezy terrain. Especially with your ruling planet, Mars, still journeying through Scorpio until November 4, you may find yourself quietly wrestling with themes like: <em>“Who do I trust enough to let all the way in?”</em> or <em>“Why do I keep giving energy to situations that don’t pour back into me?”</em> This is the kind of month where you could meet someone and immediately sense their presence in a past life — or finally have a long-overdue financial or emotional breakthrough around shared resources, inheritances, or entanglements. You’re not being dramatic, you’re being spiritually initiated. There’s a difference. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, landing in your money and selfworth zone, and things get <em>very</em> real, <em>very</em> fast. Suddenly the spiritual downloads from Scorpio Season have price tags attached: Are you charging what you’re worth? Are you getting paid fairly? Are you spending in ways that align with your values? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a> nearing its final degrees, this full moon might trigger a surprising plot twist with your finances or possessions — a job opportunity that wasn’t on your radar, an unexpected payout (or expense), or a radical new way of thinking about your resources altogether. Think of this as a cosmic audit, not a punishment. The Universe is asking: <em>Do your values and your budget actually match?</em> </p>



<p>From November 4 onward, things get feistier, as Mars enters Sagittarius, your zone of adventure, long-term vision, and personal expansion. Suddenly, all those emotional lessons you’ve been processing don’t feel quite so heavy — they feel like motivation. You might feel a deep pull to book that trip, apply to a course, publish your writing, or finally say the thing you’ve been holding back. But heads up: Mercury will be retrograde in this same part of your chart starting November 9, so while you <em>should</em> dream big and speak freely, double-check all logistics, contracts, and travel details. This retrograde may delay or reroute your plans, but not to block you. It’s to help you clarify your “why.” And once Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, you’ll get one last chance to rewire your mindset around fear, power, and desire before moving forward with more clarity and strength. <br /><br />The month ends on an upward note, as Sagittarius Season begins November 21, and Mercury Retrograde wraps up by November 29. You may feel like a fog is lifting, and suddenly the big picture makes sense again. Venus joins Sagittarius on November 30, sprinkling blessings over your long-term goals, education, and spiritual path. You’re not the same Aries you were at the start of the month; you’re deeper, wiser, and more attuned to what motivates you from the inside out. You didn’t just rise from the ashes. You studied the fire, danced with it, and now you’re ready to use it to light up the next chapter of your life. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins with intensity dripping from every interaction, Taurus. Scorpio Season is lighting up your relationship and one-on-one connection sector, and it’s not here for shallow vibes or lukewarm half-commitments. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">With Mars in Scorpio until November 4</a>, your relationships are your mirror — and they’re showing you everything you need to see, especially the stuff you’d rather avoid. This could be a sexy, soulstirring transit for some Bulls (yes, even the emotionally reserved ones), and for others, it could stir tension, jealousy, or unmet needs that have been bubbling under the surface for months. If you’re single, your standards are getting higher — as they should. If you’re partnered, you’re realizing the partnership needs to evolve if it’s going to last. You want more. And you’re not wrong for that.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, your annual cosmic spotlight. It’s been a <em>year</em>, hasn’t it? And yet here you are — softer, stronger, and more self-aware. This moon is ruled by Venus, your planetary ruler, which is finishing her journey through Libra before diving into Scorpio the next day. So this full moon is bittersweet: a celebration of how far you’ve come, and a shedding of all the versions of yourself you no longer need to perform. Since Uranus is retrograde in your sign and now in its final degrees, you may feel a deep urge to <em>finally</em> accept how much you’ve changed in the past seven years in appearance, identity, relationships, and direction. What used to define you might feel like an old costume now. Good. Hang it up. Something new is trying to grow in its place. </p>



<p>By mid-month, things start to shift from emotional excavation to deep embodiment. Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, joining the Sun there, and asking you to love deeper, choose wiser, and stay attuned to your real desires… not just the aesthetic ones. Then Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, your intimacy and merging zone. This can bring back old lovers, contracts, or money matters tied to shared resources. Don’t be surprised if someone from the past wants to “talk.” But you’re not who you were before. You’ve got receipts. And Mercury’s backspin into Scorpio on the 18th will give you the chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2021/07/10567193/toxic-relationships-setting-boundaries"">renegotiate your emotional boundaries</a> if you need to. Be honest, but don’t overexplain. Your energy speaks volumes now. </p>



<p>The last stretch of the month opens the portal to real healing. Sagittarius Season kicks off on November 21, encouraging you to take your time before leaping into the next thing. Your soul is still digesting everything you’ve let go of this fall. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on the 27th, helping you re-establish faith in your friendships and long-term dreams, especially the ones that took a back seat this year. And with Mercury direct on the 29th and Venus entering Sagittarius on the 30th, things that once felt emotionally foggy (money, sex, trust) become clearer. You’ve been through the depths and didn’t flinch. Now, you’re ready to trust your body, your desires, and your evolution — even if it doesn’t look like anyone else’s. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s be real, Gemini — November might start off feeling like molasses. The Sun is in Scorpio, combined with Mars wrapping up its time in your wellness and routine sector, means you’ve been in <em>fix-it</em> mode: fixing your habits, your mind, your environment, your inbox (or trying). But it’s not just about optimizing your calendar… this energy is calling you to ask: <em>What is my life force actually fueling?</em> Your body is speaking louder now. If you’ve been ignoring rest, boundaries, or hydration (you know better!), this month will make you feel it. Let the first week of November be your reset — your personal rehab for burnout, guilt spirals, and emotional avoidance. This is your permission slip to pause and <em>listen</em>. </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your spiritual sector like a dream download. If you’re someone who has trouble slowing down, this lunation might knock you into stillness through a dream, a sign, or a gut-level knowing. You’re ending a chapter here — maybe a limiting belief or an outdated loyalty. Venus is still in Libra when this full moon peaks, making it an aesthetic moment too. Surround yourself with music, scent, softness. Then, as Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, the vibe gets deeper, more reflective. Your daily rhythms might get a bit moodier, or you may notice you’re craving more alone time than usual. It’s not isolation, it’s a form of integration, especially with Uranus retrograde in Taurus, hovering at the end of a seven-year subconscious transformation. You’re realizing just how much you’ve been rewiring — even the invisible stuff. </p>



<p>Then things get… interesting. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your partnership zone. Oh yes, exes may text. Collaborators from the past may circle back. Current partners may say something that makes you go “Wait, what?” But don’t spiral… this is your cosmic cue to <em>review</em> the terms of your emotional contracts. Mercury re-enters Scorpio on the 18th, bringing the focus back to how your boundaries and emotional labor are being managed. If you’ve been doing <em>too much</em> (classic Gemini when anxious), this is your call to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-detox-how-to-cleanse-your-mind"">delegate, detox, and discern</a>. Don’t be afraid to <em>not reply immediately</em>. Mercury’s got you covered. </p>



<p>The final stretch of November is giving plot twist with a happy ending. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on the 21st</a>, energizing your one-on-one connections and reminding you that vulnerability is not a weakness — it’s an invitation to intimacy. Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer starting 11/11, bringing a money mindset reset, while Saturn shifts direct in your career zone on the 27th, helping you take your creative visions more seriously. By the Venus in Sagittarius shift on the 30th, you’re magnetic again — romantic, radiant, and recharged. You’ve done the shadow work, now get ready to flirt with life like the main character you are. Trust: you can do both depth <em>and</em> levity. That’s your superpower. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins like a poem with a plot twist, Cancer. Scorpio Season activates your sector of creativity, romance, and joy, but it’s a deep kind of joy, not the fleeting fireworks. It’s the kind that comes from healing your inner child. That’s why this month may bring tender feelings to the surface: unresolved heartaches, old crushes, or forgotten dreams asking for a second chance. Mars is here too, stirring up passion and creative urgency. If you’ve been sitting on an idea, this is your green light to birth it. Just know that Scorpio doesn’t do anything halfway. Whether it’s love, art, or sex, you’re either <em>in</em> or <em>out</em> — no halfway intimacy allowed. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">your friendship and community zone</a>, helping you see who’s really in your corner. You may realize that a long-standing connection no longer fits the vision of who you’re becoming, and it’s okay to let go with love. Or maybe you’re finally ready to <em>lead</em> in your community, turning a private passion into a public project. Since this Full Moon is ruled by Venus in late Libra, your home life and family dynamics are also highlighted. Beauty rituals, ancestral wisdom, and long phone calls with your favorite cousin are all medicine. And then — bam — Venus enters Scorpio on the 6th, turning your love life into a gothic novel. Think: slow burns, meaningful glances, psychic intimacy. <em>Someone</em> wants to go deeper with you, but can they meet you where you are? </p>



<p>Here’s where the retrograde fun begins. Mercury Retrograde starts in Sagittarius on November 9, shaking up your daily habits, health routines, and work-life balance. You may lose a file. Miss a meeting. Or get a strong urge to quit something that’s draining your spirit. Take a breath… this isn’t sabotage, it’s realignment. When Mercury slips back into Scorpio on the 18th, you’re being asked to rework a creative idea or reconnect with a lover from the past. Don’t romanticize the rewind, but <em>do</em> be curious. Meanwhile, Jupiter retrograde begins in Cancer (your sign!) on 11/11, making the second half of November a mirror. How have you outgrown your own identity? What would expansion look like if it were rooted in <em>self-love</em>, not performance? <br /><br />Then comes the glow-up. Sagittarius Season starts on the 21st, helping you turn chaos into a system. Your task? Find structure that feels <em>freeing</em>, not confining. Saturn shifts direct in your expansion zone on the 27th, grounding you in your truth, and Mercury stations direct in Scorpio on the 29th, freeing up creative blocks or emotional confusion. Finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you find joy in the small things again: making your matcha, editing your playlist, flirting in the grocery aisle. November ends with you feeling more <em>you</em> than you’ve felt in a while — bolder, clearer, and ready to move from survival to sparkle. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November’s energy begins in your emotional roots, Leo, as Scorpio Season activates your sector of home, family, and your inner world. With Mars also in Scorpio, you may feel more sensitive than usual, even if you’re trying to keep up your bold and brave front. This isn’t the month to push feelings down. It’s the month to look them in the eye. There may be tension with loved ones or a desire to move, rearrange your space, or finally set boundaries with a roommate or parent. You’re reclaiming your sanctuary — physically and emotionally — and it’s not always graceful work, but it’s soul-deep and necessary. Journaling, therapy, crying in the bath… it all counts as progress this month. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public recognition zone, and the world is watching. You’ve been working on something behind-thescenes, and this lunation could bring praise, press, or even promotion. But it also asks you to reflect: <em>Am I doing this for legacy, or for applause?</em> Venus is still in Libra that day, softening communication and helping you speak your truth kindly, but clearly. The next day, Venus enters Scorpio, adding more intensity to your private life. Expect deeper conversations, late-night pillow talk, and some potent family revelations. It’s like your inner world becomes the real love story of the month, even if that means finally loving yourself in the places you used to abandon. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the retrogrades start stirring things up. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your fun, flirtation, and self-expression zone. If a creative idea stalls or a romantic prospect ghosts, don’t panic. Rethink your approach. Ask yourself where the spark went — maybe it’s you that needs rest, not the idea or the lover. When Mercury re-enters Scorpio on November 18, you’re brought back to unresolved emotions at home or with family. A childhood memory may resurface. Or an old version of yourself might be grieving what you’ve outgrown. Don’t rush through the tenderness. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, lighting up your spiritual zone. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Your dreams may be extra vivid</a>. Your ancestors extra loud. Listen. <br /><br />And then: lift off. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and you start to feel like <em>you</em> again. Not the Leo who has to hold it all together, but the one who laughs loud, kisses like fire, and shines unapologetically. Saturn shifts direct in your intimacy sector on November 27, helping you better understand what commitment actually means for you — and what’s worth saying yes to. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, bringing emotional clarity at last. Then Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, and romance, creativity, and confidence start bubbling again. November ends with your heart wide open — wiser, softer, and still burning bright. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The beginning of November pulls you inward, Virgo. Scorpio Season is activating your communication and inner dialogue sector, and with Mars also in Scorpio, your mind is a hotbed of activity. You might feel more argumentative than usual, or more quick to defend your ideas. But instead of getting stuck in loops or overexplaining, take a beat: <em>Who are you really trying to convince?</em> Others… or yourself? The truth is, this month wants to help you refine your inner voice — to trust it, but also challenge it when it’s stuck in outdated loops. Therapy, journaling, or even audio notes to yourself could be surprisingly clarifying. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 activates your expansion sector, which is all about publishing, travel, and higher learning. Something you’ve been studying, writing, or dreaming about may finally come full circle, and you’ll be asked: <em>Do you still want this?</em> Venus in Libra that day helps you align your values before making any big declarations. But the very next day, Venus enters Scorpio, and suddenly, everything feels more emotionally charged. Your words can cut — or heal — depending on how you wield them. Old conversations may come back for review later in the month when Mercury Retrograde (starting Nov 9 in Sagittarius) retraces its steps, first in your home and emotional sector, then eventually back into Scorpio on November 18. </p>



<p>And yes, Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius may stir up home drama or nostalgia. You might reconnect with a sibling, parent, or even an old roommate. Or you could find yourself rethinking where you want to live and what kind of foundation you’re building your future on. The Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting 11/11 adds an emotional edge to your friendships and long-term dreams. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mid-distance-relationships"">Some relationships might feel distant</a>. But that distance is showing you who truly sees you — and who’s just there for convenience. Not everything that’s consistent is actually nourishing. <br /><br />Then comes relief. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and the Sun lights up your foundation, helping you feel more secure and centered. Saturn shifts direct in your relationship sector on November 27, bringing clarity around boundaries and long-term commitment. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, restoring flow to your conversations and mindset. And to wrap it all up, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, helping you beautify your home and maybe even plan a cozy holiday gathering. You’re leaving November with a clearer head, a softer heart, and a deeper understanding of what home <em>really</em> means — inside and out.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November wants to talk about your worth, Libra. And not just in terms of money — though Scorpio Season and Mars in Scorpio are definitely heating up your financial sector. This is bigger. It’s about your value system, your sense of self-worth, and how those two things intersect. You’re being asked: <em>Are you charging enough for your gifts? Are you pouring your energy into people who match your frequency?</em> The month starts off intense, especially if you’ve been overextending yourself in order to be liked. No more. You’re recalibrating. Even if that means pulling back. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your intimacy and merging sector, bringing some financial, sexual, or emotional entanglements to a head. Something’s gotta give. It could be a final bill, a revelation in therapy, or a sexual connection that either deepens or ends. Venus is still in Libra that day, helping you move with grace and charm. But on the 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, and your vibe gets much more private. Suddenly, you’re craving quality over quantity in love, in money, in everything. </p>



<p>It’s giving: “If it doesn’t feel sacred, I don’t want it.” Honor that. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your communication zone. So watch what you say and how you say it, and also how you <em>hear</em> others. Miscommunications could spark easily, especially in text or over email. When Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, y<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">our money and self-worth come back into focus</a>. If you’re negotiating rates, contracts, or even just trying to figure out your holiday budget, take your time. This retrograde is your chance to revise, not rush. Add in Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting on 11/11 — lighting up your career sector — and it’s clear: November is all about long-term alignment, not quick wins.<br /><br />By Sagittarius Season (Nov 21), your voice gets stronger again. You’ll feel like sharing more, laughing more, connecting more. Saturn shifts direct in your daily routine sector on November 27, helping you get back on track with health, organization, or wellness habits that may have fallen off. Mercury shifts direct on the 29th, clearing mental fog. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, and you’re back in your social butterfly flow — radiant, expressive, and ready to flirt again. You end the month remembering who you are: an artist, a lover, a light. Don’t forget what you’re worth. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You are <em>the</em> moment, Scorpio, but you already knew that. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season keeps going strong through November 21</a>, and with Mercury also spending time in your sign from November 18th to December 11th, your energy is magnetically focused, deliciously intense, and hard to ignore. You’re in transformation mode, and the world can feel like it’s rotating around your evolution. You’ve likely been tunnel-visioned lately, obsessed with a particular outcome, person, or path. But as Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, it’s time to loosen your grip. The work you’ve done to go deep now wants to expand. But not just anywhere… your soul knows exactly where. <br /><br />Right after Mars exits your sign, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your relationship sector, bringing closure or clarity in love. Someone may surprise you with their emotional maturity, or their lack of it. You’re seeing clearly now. Venus is in her final degrees of Libra that day, moving through your soul and secrets sector, helping you end a chapter with grace. But once Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, you’re magnetic as hell. People are watching you like art. You’re watching them like a hawk. Your beauty is sharper, your desires louder. Love, sex, and money all take on deeper significance, but beware of projecting old wounds onto new people. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets tricky, though. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, clouding your money mindset and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-confidence-code-a-reminder-that-you-are-worthy"">self-worth sector</a>. Double check receipts, revisit pricing, and be gentle with self-talk. Then on November 18, Mercury dips back into Scorpio, and boom — you’re reviewing your own words, your own intentions. Something you said or decided last month may need to be reworked. Don’t panic. This is a cosmic do-over. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on 11/11, activating your publishing, travel, and belief system sector. You may postpone a trip or start questioning your bigger life plans. Let the questions come… They’re clues. <br /><br />And then? Big breakthrough. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on November 21</a>, and with it comes the shift from intense introspection to grounded action. You’re focused on your finances, your value, your legacy. Saturn shifts direct in Pisces on November 27, in your creativity and romance sector, helping you solidify a passion project or commit more seriously in love. Mercury shifts direct in your sign on November 29, unblocking your voice and clarity. And finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, reminding you that abundance is your birthright, but only when you believe you’re worthy of it. You’ll end the month sharper, sexier, and more self-aware than you began. Phoenix status: reactivated. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The month starts in the cocoon, Sag, but it doesn’t stay there for long. With the Sun in Scorpio through November 21, your sector of rest, release, and dreams is activated, nudging you to slow down before your season begins. This is your yearly invitation to clean house spiritually and emotionally. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, launching a six-week period of accelerated movement, confidence, and main-character energy. The tension between the two — wanting to retreat and also being pushed into the spotlight — can be confusing at first. But here’s the thing: just because Mars is in your sign doesn’t mean you have to rush. Move with clarity, not chaos. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your wellness and work sector, helping you re-evaluate your daily habits and rituals. If you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-anxiety-and-depression-symptoms"">neglecting your body</a> or overextending yourself with work, this lunation is your wake-up call. With Venus at the final degrees of Libra the same day, friendships may play a surprising role in helping you ground yourself. Then Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, stirring hidden feelings. Someone you thought you were over may resurface in your dreams, your inbox, or your heart. This Venus transit moves through your solitude zone, so you might be more sensitive to energetic shifts; don’t dismiss your intuition. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets hazy. Mercury Retrograde begins in your sign on November 9, making you rethink everything from how you show up online to what you <em>really</em> believe in. If you’re working on a pitch, post, or big reveal, delay it until next month if possible. Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, activating your intimacy and soul-merging sector. Emotional boundaries may blur, but this is also a chance to heal old wounds around trust. By November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio, pushing you back into reflection. Whatever came up during Scorpio Season needs a final purge, so make space. <br /><br />Then your solar rebirth season begins — finally! Sagittarius Season starts on November 21 at 8:35 PM EST, and the shift will feel like a deep exhale. You’re back, baby. The Sun in your sign brings vitality, clarity, and the courage to dream again. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on November 27, stabilizing your home and emotional foundations. If you’ve been navigating family tension or housing uncertainty, things start to feel more solid. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on November 29, giving you a clearer sense of what to say, or <em>not</em> say. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, gifting you with charm, beauty, and cosmic flirtation. You’re ending the month glowing, expansive, and ready for your next adventure. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first three weeks of November remind you that even the most selfsufficient mountain goat needs community. Scorpio Season activates your sector of friendships, social networks, and long-term dreams. You may find yourself orbiting new circles, or reevaluating the people who get to be in your orbit at all. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, stirring up your sector of closure and healing. This is a sixweek invitation to burn away what no longer resonates with you, especially habits or mindsets you’ve outgrown. With Mars behind the scenes, not everything needs to be public. Power moves can still be made in silence. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 turns your attention to your sector of romance, creativity, and pleasure. You deserve to feel good in your body, and this lunation reminds you of that. Whether you’re deepening a current connection or expressing yourself through your art, something you’ve been nurturing is ready to blossom. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra that day (your career zone), a professional payoff may also arrive — recognition, a collaboration, or a glow-up that reminds you you’ve still got it. But the next day, Venus enters Scorpio, so expect your social life to become deeper, more emotionally layered, and maybe a little more intense. </p>



<p>The middle of the month asks for patience. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on November 18. Conversations, contracts, or collaborations <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">may feel like déjà vu</a>. You might revisit an old dream, a past friendship, or a vision for the future that you shelved. Don’t rush to act… just listen. Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on November 11, calling for reflection in your relationship dynamics. Ask yourself: are your partnerships truly reciprocal? Are you overgiving? Or perhaps being too guarded? You don’t have to fix it all this month,. but consistent self-awareness is step one. <br /><br />Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and it’s your time to slow down before your own season begins. Think of this last stretch of the year as your cosmic hibernation: rest, review, and reconnect with your inner compass. Saturn, your ruling planet, ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27, making communication, writing, and mental clarity much smoother. You’ll start to feel like your words hold more weight… and they do. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, softening your inner world and giving you the grace to forgive yourself for how long healing has taken. You’re in deep preparation mode. By next month, you’ll be ready to rise. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re a visionary, Aquarius, but even visionaries hit fog. Scorpio Season rules your sector of legacy and career, so the first three weeks of November are deeply focused on your purpose. But it’s not just about what you do, it’s about <em>why</em> you’re doing it. Mars’ entrance in Sagittarius on November 4 ignites your sector of community, collaboration, the future. Suddenly, people are reaching out, ideas are flowing, and projects with purpose start calling your name. You’re not just chasing the bag this month — you’re chasing the vision that aligns with your soul’s mission. Still, with Uranus (one of your planetary rulers) retrograding in Taurus, your home, family, or sense of inner stability might feel shaky. Breathe through it. You’re building a new foundation. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your domestic sector and your emotional center. Something you’ve been suppressing about your past, your upbringing, or even your living situation may come up for release. This is a heart-check moon, one that reminds you to nurture your inner world before building the outer one. And just when you think you’re getting grounded, Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, intensifying your desire for power moves and recognition. Yes, you’re deeply magnetic, but protect your peace. </p>



<p>Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on the 18th. This combo could feel like you’re reworking both your dreams <em>and</em> your professional direction. An old project may return, or a past ambition reawakens. Take notes, but don’t rush. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starts on 11/11 (an ascension portal day!) And nudges you to reconfigure your routines and health habits. Are you doing what actually sustains you, or just what looks good on paper? <br /><br />By the time Sagittarius Season starts on November 21, life gets a bit lighter, more adventurous, and hilarious in that Sag way. The final 10 days of the month bring major energetic shifts: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27</a>, helping you finally implement new financial or self-worth boundaries. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you align with the friendships and collabs that uplift your spirit. You’re not here to follow trends, Aquarius — you’re here to shape the future. So stay weird and stay wise. You’re closer than ever. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, November opens with a whisper from your higher self: “You’re evolving.” Scorpio Season rules your sector of wisdom, expansion, and travel, and these first three weeks may feel like a spiritual initiation. Maybe you’re craving distance, space, or perspective. Maybe you’re being pushed to outgrow a belief, a path, or a relationship you once thought was forever. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, activating your sector of career, and just like that, the stakes feel higher. You’re climbing a new mountain, Pisces. The next six weeks want you to lead, to be seen, to step into the role you’ve quietly been preparing for. <br /><br />But slow your roll… the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your sector of communication, teaching, and truth. A conversation, message, or idea lands deeply. You could launch something, publish something, or even receive news that shifts your course. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra, your intimacy and financial dynamics reach a point of clarity, and then Venus dives into Scorpio on November 6, bringing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-finances-transparency-relationship"">emotional transparency into your relationships</a>. Say what you feel, even if your voice trembles. Say what you want, even if you’re not sure how it’ll be received. </p>



<p>The middle of the month is retrograde heavy: Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius begins November 9 and then Scorpio (Nov 18) may slow career launches or travel plans. You might question the direction you’re heading — don’t panic. That’s part of the process. Then Jupiter Retrograde begins in your fifth house of love, creativity, and joy on November 11, nudging you to reconnect with what lights you up from the inside out. Have you been making space for beauty? For your art? For romantic playfulness? Don’t wait until you burn out… nourish yourself and tend to your needs now.<br /><br />Sagittarius Season starts November 21, and with your career in the spotlight, the pressure may rise, but so does your ambition. Then on the 27th, Saturn shifts direct in your sign after months of restructuring your identity and path. You may feel more grounded in who you are and what you offer. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, ending the month with a boost of charm and cosmic green lights. November ends on a high note: expansive, exhilarating, and a little chaotic in a good way. You’ve done the inner work, Pisces. Now let the world catch up to your brilliance. </p>

Mamacita has many meanings. Literally, it translates to “little mother,” but colloquially it can describe an attractive woman or serve as a sweet nickname for someone dear. For Miami-based fashion label <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection%2Fproducts%2Felsa-cardigan&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carolina K</a> and model <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/helena-christensen-proves-shes"">Helena Christensen</a>, the name of their newly launched line captures all those nuances — strength, sensuality, and affection — while also honoring the Andean elders who hand-knit each piece.<br /><br />Launched on October 24, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mamacita</a> draws inspiration from both Carolina Kleinman, the Bolivian-Argentine designer who founded Carolina K in 2005, and Christensen, the Peruvian-Danish supermodel, as well as from the South American mothers who shaped them. In fact, the collaboration became a deeply personal creative journey when Christensen returned to her mother’s hometown of Lima, Peru, after decades away. She brought her mother, Elsa, along, and together they reconnected with family while visiting historic neighborhoods and art galleries from their past.<br /><br />“We were in my hotel room looking at all the pieces, and we were all just expressing how important it felt. For them, it was a personal trip, and I got to be part of that,” Kleinman tells Refinery29 Somos.<br /><br />Timed to the 20th anniversary of the Carolina K brand, Mamacita represents both a creative milestone and a heartfelt tribute to the communities that have inspired Kleinman’s vision from the start. For nearly two decades — long before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/can-fashion-be-sustainable"">sustainability became a buzzword</a> — Kleinman has championed ethical fashion through handcrafted pieces that celebrate ancestral techniques and empower the artisans who keep them alive. Working with makers in remote regions of Mexico, Peru, and India, her brand continues to honor cultural traditions while protecting the planet.<br /><br />“We are not about inventing something new every season. Instead, we want to give what we make a longer life. The more timeless we get to do things, the better it is for everyone,” Kleinman says. “Some things are just classic. And we wanted to create a brand that was classic and meaningful.”<br /><br />From limited-edition hand-embroidered garments and Peruvian-made knitwear to design details inspired by the Andes and the ocean, the collection embodies a timeless elegance.<br /><br />As Kleinman explains, the capsule includes pieces “for every occasion.” In the lookbook, Christensen models the collection in moments that span her life’s journey: dipping into the ocean, walking through the Lima neighborhood of Barranco, attending a dinner party, and wandering the cool mountains. “There’s a look for every moment in our lives, because it represents different women. There’s not one prototype of a woman.”<br /><br />Swipe through to discover some of our favorite pieces from the Mamacita collection.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on Friday, October 31 (Happy Halloween!), and both VIBs and Insiders get the green light on November 4. <em>All</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>

<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever.

<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>

<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>

<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>

<p>This time last year, celebrity makeup artist Mary Phillips’ brand, m.ph, was still waiting in the wings. This year, however, is a different story. The versatile complexion palette is already a Sephora bestseller, and thanks to a recent restock, you can snag yours at a discount during the sale. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939826.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><em>Warning: This story contains graphic details of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/10/8643443/15-signs-of-domestic-violence-that-arent-physical"">domestic violence</a>.  </em></p>



<p>I will never forget the night that finally made me leave. My ex-partner and I were at an event with friends. Everything seemed fine until he — as he often did — switched from affectionate to enraged without warning. Throughout the night, he sent me cryptic texts: <em>“I’m watching you. You’ll see what happens when we get home.”</em></p>



<p>The venue was dark and crowded, which allowed him to hide in the shadows. When he finally appeared, I was already in tears. I told him I was done. He grabbed me so tightly I could barely breathe, whispering, “You’ll never leave me.” When I tried to escape, he threw me to the ground and began kicking me—my face, my stomach, my back. I remember praying, <em>“God, please help me get through this.”</em> A friend eventually pulled him off me, and another rushed me outside.</p>



<p>That night, I ran to my sister’s apartment. My best friend joined us, and together they convinced me to call my mother. I didn’t want to; I had been hiding so much from my family, and I knew calling meant going to the hospital and filing a report. I also feared what my ex had always threatened: <em>“If you send me to jail, I’ll kill myself.”</em></p>



<p>When my mom saw my bruised face over FaceTime, she broke down. At the hospital, I was surrounded by police officers and doctors, forced to retell the story again and again. Even then, I tried to protect him—until I learned he and his mother lied to the police, saying I’d fallen down stairs. That betrayal broke something in me. I told the truth. I filed for a restraining order, terrified but determined to protect myself.</p>



<p>When I met him, I was in a vulnerable place and searching for love, something I think now that he sensed. The control and manipulation started subtly—name-calling, jealousy, isolation. I was shocked, yes, but I took it because I convinced myself that he loved me. Then the emotional abuse became physical. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of his next outburst. He would punch walls, throw objects, and then apologize, promising he’d never hurt me again. Like so many survivors, I stayed, believing he could change. I was in a constant state of hope—hope that the man I first met would return, hope that things would go back to “normal.” However, the truth is that there was never anything normal about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The abuse only escalated from there. Over time, I became someone I didn’t recognize—isolated, anxious, and ashamed. He would push me against walls, crack drywall, and then threaten to harm himself to pull me back in. I remember breaking down locked doors to stop him from self-harming. Every time I thought of leaving, he’d promise to change—or promise to die.</p>



<p>After that final night, something inside me broke open. I started therapy and eventually found <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/"">Safe Horizon</a> through friends and family who told me about the work they do. It was the first time I felt truly ready to speak out.</p>



<p>I learned that my story was not unique, and that’s what makes it so devastating. Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age. The tactics abusers use are eerily similar: isolation, intimidation, emotional manipulation, and control.</p>







<p>Safe Horizon, the largest victim service nonprofit in the U.S., provides critical resources for survivors of abuse and violent crime. What drew me to them was their inclusive approach—they support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and more. Their <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/streetwork/"">Streetwork Project</a> helps young people experiencing homelessness due to abuse, offering food, shelter, medical care, and compassion without judgment. They reach survivors wherever they are, meeting them with dignity and safety.</p>



<p>Too often, young women—especially Black women—don’t feel safe seeking help. We’re told to stay quiet, that no one will believe us, that leaving is pointless. And the question survivors hear most—<em>“Why didn’t you just leave?”</em>—is one of the most harmful. As FKA Twigs bravely shared when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html"">speaking about her own experience</a>, that question blames the survivor instead of the perpetrator. Leaving isn’t simple—it’s dangerous. It’s layered with fear, shame, financial dependency, and psychological manipulation. Even after leaving, survivors face systemic challenges: renewing restraining orders, reliving trauma in court, and constantly looking over our shoulders.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5wSrVmPeQSA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Through Safe Horizon</a>, I found healing, advocacy, and community. The <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/about-us/leadership/senior-leadership/"">organization’s leaders</a> like Lisa A. O’Connor and Liz Roberts, create true safety by approaching survivors with empathy, patience, and emotional intelligence. Even small gestures—asking <em>“Do you welcome hugs?”</em>—remind survivors that we have autonomy again.</p>



<p>One of the most profound parts of my healing has been realizing that survival doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means transforming it. As <a href=""https://grief.com/"">author and grief expert David Kessler wrote</a>, I learned to turn my “pain into purpose”. I use my voice now to help others recognize the signs of abuse before it’s too late. Love should never make you smaller. Real love doesn’t silence, it protects and uplifts.</p>

<p>Calling all fashion lovers because the nineties… and seventies… and sixties called, and they want to be back inside your closets. Luckily, New York-based fashion designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11377960/anna-sui-career-collaborations-designers"">Anna Sui</a> was tapped by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-the-occasion-dresses"">Old Navy</a> for its <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/now-trending/anna-sui?cid=3050175&amp;bc=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">first-ever designer collaboration</a> — fronted by Y2K-coded singer-songwriter PinkPantheress.<br /><br />“Anna really understands who our customer is, what she wants, how she lives, and we knew this was an amazing moment to bring that,” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-collection-01-zac-posen"">Zac Posen</a>, creative director of Gap Inc. and chief creative officer of Old Navy, tells Refinery29. “Anna is a design and style icon, and I thought to bring that to another nineties icon, Old Navy, made perfect sense to launch this.” <br /><br />Known for “her whimsy, her magic, her cool, and her rock ‘n’ roll energy,” in the words of Posen, Sui’s <em>Almost Famous</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10008469/penny-lane-costumes-almost-famous-kate-hudson-fashion-looks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Penny Lane</a>-meets-witchy Stevie Nicks aesthetic is on full display with this “Bohemian collection.” Think: <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864620002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">faux fur Afghan coats</a> (aka Penny Lane coats), lace cardigans, floral dusters, and <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864614002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">satin slip skirts</a> (one of Sui’s favorite styles),<br /><br />But we’re not just swooning over the styles… we’re also thrilled about the prices. “There’s a lot of Anna Sui DNA incorporated into this collection, but made with the expertise of Old Navy, and into very accessible, affordable pieces,” Sui tells Refinery29 about the collection, which ranges between a $10 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864653002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">floral headscarf</a> and $120 <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864630002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vegan suede coat</a>.</p>

<p>Sui and Posen pulled from the designer’s archives, from flowy tunic dresses, sought-after graphic T-shirts, and velvet laser-cut designs to <a href=""https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864616012&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050175&amp;cid=3050175#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">reimagining her iconic “grunge dress”</a> (for just $70).

<p>My natural nails and I have been on a journey. I was a chronic nail-biter for the majority of my childhood, and even as I went through college and my 20s, I constantly experienced dry, brittle nails that would break as soon as they grew past my fingertips. And while yes, I loved my Après extensions and builder gel manis to encourage growth, the truth is, these services are pricey and time-consuming. My inner monologue, screaming in QVC, knew there had to be a better way.</p>



<p>Enter from stage left, DIY nail bestie Olive &amp; June. The Los Angeles-based nail salon turned <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/regular-nail-polish-vs-gel-manicure-benefits"">polish purveyor</a> has perfected the art of the home manicure, even launching <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"">its own gel system</a> earlier this year. Taking things a step further, Olive &amp; June is unveiling its own <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/pages/builder-gel"">Builder Gel collection</a> — and honestly, I might never set foot in a nail salon again. (I’m exaggerating, of course — support and <em>tip</em> your manicurists!) </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939495.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=734&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A367"" /></figure>



<p>“Because gel had done so well, but we knew people were like, ‘How do I get stronger, longer nails that are mine? How do I get nail extensions that I can build without a tip?'” Olive &amp; June founder and CEO Sarah Gibson Tuttle tells Refinery29. “[Our community] loves press-ons, but they wanted gel almost to work harder for them.” Designed to work seamlessly with the brand’s existing Gel Mani System (which includes a proprietary lamp, base, and top coats), Builder Gel comes in 15 sheer, milky neutrals inspired by Olive &amp; June fan favorites, and allows the user to achieve the plump, durable look and feel of salon builder gel, or craft gel extensions at home using patent-pending forms. “We want to give you the ability to either have instant extensions or grow your nails over time, and also with the color that you want,” explains Gibson Tuttle. As with salon builder gel, Olive &amp; June’s formula is a thicker consistency (compared to its regular gel polish), which allows you to manipulate the shape and get extra rise and plumpness. (Don’t worry, the brand includes a liner brush in the kit.)</p>



<p>For my second builder gel mani, Olive &amp; June graciously set me up with an appointment with manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dreamer_nails/"">Julieta Martinez</a>. Martinez walked me through the steps of using the Olive &amp; June nail forms, which come in three sizes to fit your finger and create a customized extension. (If you’ve never tried nail forms before, they work by wrapping around your finger and painting on the builder gel in your desired length and shape.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939643.jpg?width=773&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=773%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>As much as I’d love to be a press-on girlie, I can never seem to have them stay on for more than a few hours. Builder gel extensions get me the length I love, without any glue or tips. (They also feel lighter on my fingertips than press-ons or acrylics.) For my extensions, I went with <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-builder-polish/products/rose-glaze-builder-gel"">Rose Glaze</a>, a sheer pink iridescent shimmer that gave major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wicked-for-good-movie-brand-collaborations"">Glinda vibes</a>.</p>



<p>Individual builder gel shades go for $12 apiece, and you can shop <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/builder-gel-sets/products/shimmers-new-neutrals-builder-gel-polish-set"">sets of eight</a> for $85 (a savings of $11, off the à la carte price — basically like paying for seven shades and getting one free). Removal is the only thing I hate about gel manicures, but don’t worry, Olive &amp; June has a solution for that, too. The <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-removal/products/gel-removal-system"">Salon-Speed Soak-Off Kit</a> includes everything to gently remove your gels, including builder. Per the brand, start by trimming the builder extension (if applicable), then file off the top layer of top coat before soaking with acetone.</p>



<p>In general, I’m super impressed with Olive &amp; June’s builder system; I work in beauty, and even I never thought I could do my own builder gel manicure at home. For special occasions (especially ones involving nail art), I’ll still be at the salon; but in the meantime, it’s safe to say that my journey towards longer, stronger natural nails has leveled up in a major way.</p>





<p>As a fan of the existing gel system, I loved that I didn’t have to buy a separate lamp or anything to use Olive &amp; June’s new builder gels. “Builder can be very intimidating for people, especially the building the length portion of it,” Olive &amp; June’s VP of product development Anne Reigle tells us. “And because builder gel is a thicker formula than regular gel, we wanted it to be self-leveling and really easy to work with; it strengthens on contact, lengthens your nails, plumps the surface, smooths the surface, and protects your natural nails all at the same time.”</p>



<p>For my first attempt, I did a DIY mani using <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/products/creme-caramel-builder-gel"">Creme Caramel</a>, a gorgeous warm tan shade that’s perfect for fall. I’m pretty comfortable with doing my own nails without making a mess, but the brush came in clutch for cleaning up edges before curing. (Also, flipping hands upside down for a few seconds after applying polish helps let gravity create a soft, domed shape to the nails.)</p>

<p>Happy Halloween, everyone! The astrological vibe for the creepiest time of the year is nothing short of fa-boo-lous. The Moon enters Pisces in the morning of October 31st, harmonizing with the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sun in Scorpio</a> and squaring Uranus retrograde in Gemini. We’ll be in the mood for amusement and pleasure, making this spooky holiday bewitching. It’s a day you’ll want to sink your fangs into. Have a total scream, get wicked, and read your horror-scope below! <br /></p>



<h2>Aries </h2>



<p>It might take a lot of effort and coaxing to get you out and about, mainly because you’re thinking of having a low-key night carving pumpkins and baking pies. Rather than having a bunch of peeps over, you could invite one friend to enjoy your homemade desserts. They’ll relish the flavor and ask to take leftovers with them. When alone, you’ll indulge in a luxurious bath with Halloween-themed bubbles.</p>



<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p>There is enchantment and positivity in the air, urging you to use your power to help others. Your witchy ways can motivate those you care about to do better and change their lives significantly. Being the shoulder your pals cry and lean on, after several Spooky Spiders or Caramel Ales, allows you to offer insight on matters and advise them to evolve. Face the facts, you are their role model! </p>



<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p>Since you’re the charismatic storyteller of the zodiac, tell your pals a true-life scary hair-raiser about a haunting you experienced. After you’ve shocked your friends to the core, let one of them take over, then another, and so forth. The best way to connect is by sharing frightful narratives that bring chills, such as these. At the end of the evening, nominate the best terror-tale to take home a prize.</p>



<h2>Cancer </h2>



<p>Family is important to you, so use Halloween as a gateway to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">connect with your ancestors</a> in another realm. Cleanse your altar with copal incense and declutter the area. Place pictures of deceased loved ones on the stand with flowers (marigolds call in the deceased) and a few of their favorite foods or items. Talk to them and celebrate their life. Lean into your shared pasts to honor their memory. </p>



<h2>Leo</h2>



<p>Your intuition is peaking, allowing you to receive psychic downloads from the universe. Take note of what you’re seeing in your journal for the future. These visions could help you make decisions when you come to a crossroads, so pay attention. You’re being told about specific events and situations for a reason and you should use the information to your advantage. Listen with an open heart and mind, Leo!</p>



<h2>Virgo </h2>



<p>The soulful Moon in Pisces is getting cozy in your seventh house of partnerships this Halloween. If you’re in a ‘ship, cuddle up with your boo on the couch and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">watch a horror movie</a>. If you’re unattached, invite friends or your crush over and play a game that builds intimacy — no, the Ouija board isn’t advisable because it can awaken spirits, perhaps “Never Have I Ever” will be fun. </p>



<h2>Libra </h2>



<p>Although you’re known for your tender temper, this Halloween, your besties will have a chance to see that you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. You might decide to dress as a character that allows everybody to see that you have at least two sides. No matter what you wear, your rizz will make a grand impression. Don’t fear, your look will be killer!</p>



<h2>Scorpio </h2>



<p>Slay the social scene! Mingle and party with your crew. You may even hit up a few events with everyone. Fortunately, Halloween is on a Friday, which means you can sleep in the following day if the gathering lasts until the wee hours of Saturday morning. Apple bobbing and the Monster Mash will be exhausting, so dance your heart out to Bloody Mary, knowing you can rest and relax all weekend. </p>



<h2>Sagittarius </h2>



<p>Opting to stay in and hand out treats to trick-or-treaters doesn’t mean you’re basic and boring. The opposite rings true. You’re bringing joy to children everywhere by handing out lollipops or other cool goodies they might like. If you want to embrace your inner child, throw on a mask and ask your neighbor to fill your bucket with sweets. Don’t be too shy to knock on their door.</p>



<h2>Capricorn </h2>



<p>For once, you’re not being a tryhard when hosting a soirée. You’re going with the flow and being chill — as long as no one spills red wine on your white carpet or copies your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween-costumes-ideas-pop-culture"">Halloween costume</a>. Regardless, the drinks are flowing, and no one is going, indicating you know how to throw an awesome Halloween shindig. This is a fantastic step towards adulting, so totally own it and cut loose!</p>



<h2>Aquarius </h2>



<p>Looking for a ghoulish time? A bunch of your colleagues want to team up and prank your boss. At first, you might be unsure if you wish to partake in the hijinks, but once your employer lets it be known that they’re down to clown (as long as no one takes it too far), it’s on. This activity helps you to bond with coworkers in ways you never thought possible. </p>



<h2>Pisces</h2>



<p>Pisces Since the transiting Moon in Pisces syncs up with your Sun by sign, this is a time of new beginnings for you. Use the magical time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">set an intention that brings you luck</a> and makes your dreams a reality. You can manifest anything in your heart if it aligns with your path. Meditate on your goals, light a white candle, and bring your vision to life.</p>

<p>Cosmic beings, the sky is still rippling with the emotional, existential echoes of last week’s Jupiter–Chiron square, and many of us are noticing which parts of our inner child still feel exposed, reactive, or defensive. Jupiter in Cancer wants to nurture and expand whatever it’s touching — but squaring Chiron in Aries can feel like an overwhelming magnifying glass on the sore spots we’ve tried to outgrow. You may notice themes around independence vs. support, overfunctioning vs. receiving, or childhood family roles vs. your current adult boundaries. The key? Don’t try to “fix” yourself… move with yourself. Let your body release some of the internal pressure. Dance, cry, write, scream, walk barefoot in the grass. You’re allowed to <em>feel</em> and <em>heal</em> at the same time.<br /><br />And here comes a bit of lightness: Mercury, Planet of Communication, enters Sagittarius on October 29th, helping the collective release some of that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio heaviness we’ve been marinating in</a>. Mercury in Scorpio had us speaking in riddles, keeping secrets, obsessing over the unsaid, or analyzing every look and silence. We’ve been reading between the lines for weeks — not just in others, but in ourselves too. There’s beauty in that depth, but also a risk of becoming paranoid, withdrawn, or overly cynical. Now, Mercury in Sagittarius swings open the windows. It doesn’t whisper; it shouts joyfully from the rooftop. This is your permission slip to share what you’ve learned, even if it’s still messy or raw. Say it with humor, with honesty, with heart.</p>



<p>Also: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is in its final degrees of Scorpio</a> this week. If you trace back to September 22nd, when Mars first entered the sign of the phoenix, you might notice that you’ve been undergoing some sort of personal mission — a deep, unflinching investigation of power, passion, and purpose. As Mars approaches 29° of Scorpio, it becomes a culmination moment. A final test. A last temptation. Or, a moment of confirmation that yes, you’ve changed — even if no one else knows how much. The shift becomes clear as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, but this week is your last chance to harvest the lessons of your own underworld journey.You may find yourself asking: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-equinox-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects""><em>What did I begin around the equinox</em></a><em> that’s reaching its climax now? What am I finally ready to release — or claim?</em> This week doesn’t rush you to answer, but it will keep nudging you toward clarity.<br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, just because it looks like stillness doesn’t mean it’s not power. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, your ruling planet, is finishing its six-week trek through Scorpio</a> — your sector of intimacy, control, transformation, and energetic merging. But unlike some of the more dramatic Mars moments, this finale doesn’t scream. It simmers. You’ve been slowly, maybe even secretly, building momentum around something deeply personal. Whether it’s a financial entanglement, a physical craving, or an emotional reckoning, this week could reveal just how much you’ve outgrown the need to “win” at all costs. Do you really need to dominate, or are you just scared of disappearing if you don’t? Mars in Scorpio has been showing you how to reclaim your power without losing your soul. Now’s the time to integrate what you’ve learned about vulnerability, pleasure, and restraint.<br /><br />The week ends with a mic drop — or at least a one-liner. Mercury enters Sagittarius on the 29th, launching you into a more playful, philosophical headspace. Suddenly, you’re inspired to sign up for that course, book that spontaneous trip, or tell a story that’s 80% true but 100% entertaining. And honestly? We need that from you. Just be mindful that not everyone’s as down for blunt jokes or semi-accurate monologues as you are. Mercury here wants you to express your belief systems, but do it like a good stand-up set: hit ‘em with the truth and the punchline.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you can’t carry someone else’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-closure-ex-meaning"">relationship baggage</a> and call it love. Mars is wrapping up its journey through your sector of partnership, and if it’s been exposing some passive-aggressive tension or behind-the-scenes resentment, you’re not imagining things. But this final stretch isn’t about confrontation… it’s about clarity. You’ve likely realized that your energy has limits, and the desire to merge has to be mutual. This week, ask yourself: <em>What does it look like to stay connected while still protecting your peace?</em> Mars in Scorpio didn’t just reveal others’ patterns; it showed you your own default settings in connection, especially the ways you overextend or under-express. Let this week be an energetic recalibration in love, business, and even your relationship with your own reflection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your “let’s talk about the money” zone. Starting October 29th, you may find yourself talking about loans, inheritances, taxes, or even kink. Mercury in Sagittarius isn’t subtle, and when it activates your sector of shared resources and taboo topics, you’re basically in your <em>Succession</em> era — equal parts honest and unhinged. Don’t be surprised if a conversation gets way deeper than expected. Or way weirder. You’re learning to speak your truths even when they’re not pretty — and laugh about them when you’re done.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, you don’t always need to optimize yourself. Sometimes you just need to rest. Mars has been powering through your sector of routine, health, and responsibility since September, and now it’s almost out. This week, instead of trying to finish everything on your to-do list like you’re being filmed for a productivity documentary, check in with your body. Where are you pushing too hard? What are you avoiding by staying “busy”? Mars in Scorpio taught you how to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">confront burnout patterns</a> and perfectionist tendencies. Let yourself integrate. It’s not weakness to pause — it’s strategy. Your real power move this week is listening to your body when it whispers, not waiting until it screams.<br /><br />On a lighter note, your crush might start texting in full paragraphs again. Mercury (your ruler!) enters your opposite sign of Sagittarius on the 29th, lighting up your one-on-one connection zone. This means: more banter, bolder flirting, and possibly deeper conversations with someone who’s actually emotionally available (what a concept). It’s cuffing season, but with memes. You’re feeling more honest, and so are they — even if it’s oversharing in a “sorry-not-sorry” way. Don’t overanalyze the vibe. Lean in. Say what you mean. And maybe download Hinge again… but only if your last message wasn’t left on read.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, not all passion is sustainable… but some of it is worth the mess. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio is finishing its slow burn</a> through your romance, creativity, and pleasure zone, and this week is your chance to reflect on what, or who, lit you up since late September. Maybe you’ve taken bigger risks with your art, your heart, or your bed sheets. Maybe you’ve confused chaos with chemistry once or twice (hey, it’s a learning curve). But this final stretch of Mars in Scorpio isn’t about shaming yourself for what you wanted… <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-responsive-spontaneous-desire-styles"">it’s about refining your desires</a>. Who turns you on intellectually, spiritually, creatively? That’s your real type. And no, they don’t have to be perfect, just emotionally literate and occasionally funny.<br /><br />Speaking of funny… Mercury’s got jokes now. As of October 29th, Mercury enters Sagittarius and turns your everyday life into a sitcom. You’ll find humor in the absurdity of routines, and honestly? It’s medicine. Your health, work, or to-do list may have felt heavy under Mercury in Scorpio, but now you’re allowed to laugh at the chaos. Expect random inspiration to hit while brushing your teeth or running errands. Talk to your coworkers like they’re your podcast co-hosts. Say the weird joke. Eat the protein bar. Mercury in this part of your chart is a reminder: healing isn’t always solemn — sometimes it’s hilarious.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your power doesn’t need an audience — but that hasn’t stopped you from delivering a performance anyway. Mars is in its final stretch through your home, family, and foundations sector, and even if you didn’t mean to stir things up… you did. But here’s the twist: it was necessary. Since September 22nd, you’ve been privately unpacking your relationship with roots, rest, and responsibility. Some Leos have moved, redecorated, cut ties, or cried in the bathtub — all valid. Now as Mars approaches 29°, the question is: <em>What emotional habitat are you building for yourself?</em> This week is less about dramatic change and more about internal integration. You’ve grown, but have you <em>noticed</em> how differently you respond to old triggers? That’s your Mars work, right there.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your joy sector like a chaotic but loveable bestie. Starting October 29th, Mercury in Sag lights up your romance, play, and passion zone. Translation: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/flirty-text-messages-examples"">your texts might get flirty</a>, your jokes land louder, and you may be tempted to post a thirst trap just to feel something. Mercury in Sag wants you to remember what it’s like to fall in love with your own damn mind — and maybe someone else’s too. Say yes to the spontaneous invite. Go on that “just for fun” date. Make something dumb and beautiful. You’re in your comedic rom-com era, and even if it gets messy, it’ll be entertaining as hell.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, you’re not here to be a spreadsheet… you’re here to be the whole story. Mars in Scorpio has spent the past six weeks in your communication and expression sector, and it’s been a <em>lot</em>. You’ve probably had to have difficult conversations, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communication-style-mercury-sign-meaning-astrology"">revisit the way you communicate boundaries</a>, or even learn how to stop over-explaining when someone clearly isn’t listening. But now, as Mars prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you’re being asked to <em>trust your voice</em>. Not the polished, PR-ready version — the messy, tender, weirdly specific one. That’s the one that hits. This week, stop editing yourself in real-time. Mars has taught you that speaking up doesn’t always mean yelling… sometimes it means whispering the truth and letting it echo.<br /><br />Now Mercury, your ruling planet, is in full Sagittarian chaos. On October 29th, Mercury enters your home and emotional roots sector, and let’s just say… your inner child is taking the wheel. Expect random family stories to surface, nostalgia to hit during a random song, and for your jokes to get more dark-humor-meets-toddler-energy. You might also feel inspired to say things to family members (chosen or blood) that you’ve held in too long. Mercury here can heal old wounds — but only if you’re willing to talk about the awkward stuff. Say it clumsily if you must. Say it while laughing. Just don’t swallow it anymore.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, you’ve spent enough time calculating your worth… now it’s time to feel it. Mars is finishing its journey through your money and values zone, and chances are your relationship with resources — physical <em>and</em> energetic — has gone through a few plot twists. Maybe you’ve been investing more, spending less, or just noticing where your energy leaks. Mars in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level; it wants you to understand your <em>emotional</em> relationship to currency. What’s your price for peace? What are you no longer willing to sell out for? This week is about remembering that your value doesn’t require validation. Let the final flare of Mars give you permission to invest in yourself like you’d invest in your dream. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s entering your chatty, curious, slightly unhinged phase. On October 29th, the planet of communication enters your learning and local community zone. Expect a surge of texts, new ideas, and the occasional accidental overshare on IG stories. You’re talking faster, thinking bigger, and possibly planning three projects at once. But don’t forget: not everything needs to be monetized or turned into a brand. Mercury in Sag is here to help you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9602100/online-learning-websites-classes"">rediscover the joy of learning something</a> <em>just because</em>. Be curious, not calculating. Read a weird book. Ask a question you already know the answer to. Let wonder replace your inner critic, just for a while.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve burned it all down and you’ve rebuilt it from scratch. Now this week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">your mission is to breathe</a>. Mars, your traditional ruler, has been in your sign for the past five weeks — and it’s been both a revival and a reckoning. You may have felt hyper-aware of your desires, more impulsive than usual, and somehow both exhausted and energized. As Mars prepares to exit your sign and enter Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a phase of integration. What did this version of you fight for? What did it finally walk away from? This isn’t about constant transformation anymore — it’s about ownership. Mars at the final degrees of Scorpio is like the silent samurai: calm, dangerous, and done with drama. You’ve grown in ways you don’t need to prove. Trust that your actions speak loud enough now.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s ready to spend your money or make you laugh about it. On October 29th, Mercury exits your sign and enters your income and values zone. Suddenly, your inner voice shifts from existential philosopher to impulsive travel agent. Expect a mix of financial epiphanies and random purchases — a tarot deck here, a pair of platform boots there. But deeper than that, you’re learning to speak about your worth more directly. Mercury in Sag gives you the gift of comedic timing and financial clarity… use both. Talk about your rates. Joke about capitalism. Buy the expensive oat milk if it makes your inner child giggle.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re already feeling the buzz, Sagittarius — Mercury enters your sign this week (on the 29th), and suddenly your inner monologue sounds like a TED Talk, stand-up set, and motivational speech all in one. But before you go launching into a thousand new projects, take a moment to reflect on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the final full week of Mars in Scorpio</a> lighting up your spiritual sector. How have your subconscious patterns, intuitive nudges, and quiet obsessions shaped your motivations lately? This Mars transit has pulled you deep into your own psyche — not to make you spiral, but to help you break through. Notice what fears you’ve confronted, what secrets have surfaced, and what taboos you’re learning to reclaim. There’s strength in your shadows.<br /><br />With Mercury in your sign and a full moon in Taurus coming up next week, you’re entering a period where your words have weight — and your jokes could accidentally become spells. Use your voice with care. You might be more impulsive, excitable, or brutally honest now, and while that’s part of your charm, Sagittarius, don’t use it as a shield. Be curious rather than combative. The best breakthroughs this week come when you speak your truth <em>and</em> stay open to being surprised by others’.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, if you’ve been lowkey exhausted the past few weeks, Mars in Scorpio may be to blame — but also, thank. As this transit wraps up, you’re getting one last push to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ending-friendship-emotional-wellbeing"">reassess the dynamics of your friendships</a>, community, and long-term goals. Maybe someone in your circle showed their true colors, or maybe you realized you’ve outgrown certain group projects. Mars has been pruning your social garden, Capricorn, and now you get to decide what, and who, is worth watering. Make space for the relationships that feel reciprocal, collaborative, and inspiring.<br /><br />Mercury’s shift into Sagittarius on October 29 helps you loosen up and laugh again. This transit lands in your house of closure and healing, so your humor may lean toward the dry, surreal, or even absurd… but it’s cathartic. You might find yourself journaling more, reconnecting with spirituality, or speaking to a therapist (or your dream journal) with newfound honesty. Don’t underestimate the power of being funny <em>and</em> vulnerable. Your dreams may be extra vivid now, so keep track of them. They’re sending you clues. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re wrapping up a powerful chapter in your career life, Aquarius, as Mars in Scorpio spends its final days in your public image sector. Since September, this has been a time of bold moves, boundary-setting, and behind-the-scenes ambition. Maybe you’ve been wrestling with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-be-successful"">what “success” even means to you</a>, and whether it still fits the version of you you’re becoming. This week, instead of forcing momentum, try to integrate the lessons you’ve already learned. What motivates you to create? Who do you want to impact? Let your intuition be the driver now, not your ego.<br /><br />When Mercury moves into fellow fire sign Sagittarius on the 29th, your social life lights up with new connections, ideas, and invitations. You’re thinking big picture, brainstorming wild solutions, and probably texting five group chats at once. Let yourself flirt with possibility. This is the week to say yes to spontaneous convos, brainstorms, or even signing up for an online class you forgot you bookmarked. Some of the best collaborations ahead will come from unexpected DMs and late-night debates with your fellow weirdos. Say what you believe, then evolve it in real time.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mars, Planet of Action, has spent the last month stirring your desire for truth, travel, and transformation — and now, as it prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you get a final chance to process what it’s really taught you. Maybe you’ve been craving adventure, questioning old belief systems, or feeling itchy in your comfort zone. But before you jet off or burn it all down, Pisces, take stock. What ideas or philosophies have truly sustained you? Where have you gotten lost in the sauce of someone else’s worldview, and where are you ready to claim your own? This final week is a portal for recalibration.<br /><br />With Mercury entering Sagittarius on October 29, your career house lights up, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of you. Your words hold power now, so use them intentionally. Whether you’re pitching yourself, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/resume-tips"">updating your résumé</a>, or just posting something meaningful online, trust that the right people are listening. And don’t be afraid to bring your whole self — messy, mystical, hilarious — to the table. You’re allowed to be multidimensional (you are a Mutable Water sign after all). The more you let people see the real you, the more aligned opportunities will flow.</p>
