<p><strong><em>Minor spoilers for </em></strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11239502/emily-in-paris-season-3-fashion-outfits""><strong><em>Emily in Paris</em></strong></a><strong><em> Season 5 ahead. </em></strong><a href=""http://www.netflix.com/emilyinparis""><em>Emily In Paris</em></a> is back for another season of champagne-fueled chaos, couture-level escapism, and questionable romantic decisions, all wrapped in a brightly-filtered fantasy where the stakes are low, the outfits are loud, and the drama is deliciously unserious. If you’ve been watching the show for four seasons, you know that it’s usually Emily (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11280477/lily-collins-bangs-beauty-routine"">Lily Collins</a>) in the midst of an ill-advised cobblestone alleyway makeout and while her bestie Mindy (<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7166706221678857514"">Ashley Park</a>) is no stranger to a love triangle, she’s usually the one dishing out advice for Emily on her messy entanglements instead of finding herself wrapped up in them herself. Not this season. </p>



<p>Enter the scandal no one saw coming but everyone will have an opinion on: <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/mindy-alfie-emily-in-paris-season-5-relationship-rcna248864"">Alfie and Mindy</a>. Yes, <em>that</em> Alfie (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/its_lucien/?hl=en"">Lucien Laviscount</a>) — Emily’s charming, handsome, British, jilted, (did I mention handsome?) ex — and Mindy, the glitter-soaked pop princess whose devotion to Emily is as strong as her impressive vocals. At the end of last season, Mindy was single, fresh off a breakup with Nico (Park’s <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a46541315/ashley-park-paul-forman-relationship-timeline/"">real-life ex, Paul Forman</a>), and moving on from Benoît (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kev.dias/?hl=en"">Kevin Dias</a>) and her band after they got <a href=""https://screenrant.com/emily-in-paris-season-4-part-2-ending-explained/"">disqualified from Eurovision</a>. This season, she flees to Rome to join Emily and outrun her problems, and runs straight into Alfie. Of course, drama is destined to ensue after you sleep with your best friend’s ex, and it would be easy to write this off as a Season 5 gimmick the writers threw in because they were searching for storylines, but the Alfie and Mindy hookup feels fresh. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>When we first heard about this might be a plot line, I really thought it was a joke, and I called [Lily], and I was like, ‘Wait, what’s going on’? </p><cite>ashley park on alfie and mindy</cite></blockquote></figure>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951273.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /><figcaption>Emily In Paris. Ashley Park as Mindy in Emily In Paris. Cr. Giulia Parmigiani/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>First of all, the chemistry between Park and Laviscount is surprisingly steamy considering they’ve interacted onscreen for seasons without even a hint of a spark. But this season, it’s electric. What begins as a “when in Rome” moment (sparked by boredom, champagne, and more champagne) detonates into the most deliciously messy hookup the series has ever served, threatening the fragile ecosystem of Emily’s inner circle. Like moving the series to Rome (temporarily), the new relationship has injected a much-needed jolt into a series that had been floundering under pretty clothes, quips about Parisian cliches, and not much else. This unsuspecting situationship is exactly what the show needed. </p>



<p>I tell Park and Collins how much I’m feeling <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSYHuAcio0Z/"">Alfie and Mindy together</a> over Zoom during the show’s press junket. The real-life best friends are in Paris, naturally. “I’ve been so nervous how people are going to [react]!” Park says, relieved. Collins chimes in: “That’s great. We love that!”</p>



<p>When I ask for more of their thoughts on Alfie and Mindy and the ethics of hooking up with your best friend’s ex, Park has<em> a lot </em>to say. “The main thing in terms of girl code and your best friend’s ex [is] first of all, Emily broke up with Alfie, there were a couple relationships [in between], there’s time that’s passed,” Park says. “I think that the hurt that is caused is because [Emily and Mindy] have always been each other’s safe place, and they’ve always been nothing but honest with each other. And for Mindy to be leading her life out of fear and assuming and projecting that Emily’s gonna feel a certain way towards it, and not giving her the opportunity to be happy for her, that’s not friendship. It’s the first time we see that tested.”  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951286.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Emily in Paris. Lucien Laviscount as Alfie in Emily in Paris. Cr. Caroline Dubois/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a viewer, the Alfie-Mindy situation feels both deeply wrong and impossibly right, raising thorny questions about loyalty, desire, and whether a friendship can withstand this kind of betrayal. But Park sees it differently: “It’s not necessarily about,<em> oh, you slept with my ex</em>, it’s <em>how could you not trust that I would be so happy for you?</em> When we first heard about this might be a plot line, I really thought it was a joke, and I called [Lily], and I was like, ‘Wait, what’s going on’? But it’s because I didn’t see how the story was going to blossom and flourish and in the end really deepen their sisterhood. And I think that’s something we really enjoyed doing.”</p>

<p>Collins agrees, but when it comes to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11237400/emily-in-paris-season-3-quarter-life-crisis"">Emily’s love life</a>, her advice for her character is to stay away from the drama. “It’s okay to not have somebody that you’re interested in. Like, you don’t have to have somebody to be somebody,” Collins says. It’s a lesson that Emily is learning in real time this season as she starts a new romance with Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini) in Rome. But will Emily dive back into a serious relationship so soon after ending things with<a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/lucas-bravos-emily-in-paris-season-5-absence-explained-after-gabriel-shade/""> Gabriel (Lucas Bravo)</a>? Collins teases that with a new gig and new city comes a new outlook for Emily: “This year, we get to see her just being okay and saying this isn’t for me, and not being afraid of what the other person is going to say,” she says. “It’s the first time she’s been really honest with the person she’s talking to in her romantic life. I love that because I think there’s societal pressure for people who are single to want to be in a relationship. But there’s such a beautiful thing about Emily being single and being like, <em>here’s my focus, and here I am.</em> I think that’s really cool.” </p>

(L to R) Lily Collins as Emily, Eugenio Franceschini as Marcello in Emily in Paris. Cr. Caroline Dubois/Netflix © 2025</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s also cool that <a href=""https://www.thezoereport.com/culture/lily-collins-sharp-bob"">Emily (via Collins)</a> has a new, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">sharp bob</a> this season. Usually, when a female character comes back from a hiatus with shorter hair, it’s because she’s shedding layers after a breakup (<a href=""https://time.com/6318711/felicity-haircut-25-years-premiere/"">Felicity from <em>Felicity</em></a>) or as a cruel punishment (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/154084/aria-a-team-pretty-little-liars-theory"">Aria in <em>Pretty Little Liars</em></a>), mostly because of a man. Emily’s bob is barely even explained this season, and Collins loves that decision. “She didn’t even need to explain it,” she says. “It was just like a life choice. She’s like, <em>Okay, I’m gonna change my hair. So what?</em>” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>She didn’t even need to explain [the bob]. It was just like a life choice. She’s like, <em>Okay, I’m gonna change my hair. So what?</em>” </p><cite>lily collins on emily’s new bob haircut</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>You’ll have to turn into <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/emily-in-paris-season-5-ending-explained-recap""><em>Emily In Paris </em>Season 5</a> to see if Emily is just as chill about Alfie and Mindy. This season dares us to decide if their hookup is a betrayal or the most honest thing either of them have done all series. I’m going with the latter. Both Alfie and Mindy have been done dirty in the romance department over the seasons and it’s time they get their happily ever after. I just hope it’s together. I also love seeing an interracial couple on mainstream TV that doesn’t involve a white person because that representation is still so rare. Let’s just forget that Alfie and Mindy’s pairing comes with a side of betrayal. Hey, we watch <em>Emily in Paris </em>for the escape, the eye-candy, the kissing, and the outfits. It’s a fantasy that thrives on us turning off our brains for a bit and sinking into the comforting belief that even the most unlikely connections can feel inevitable… especially in Paris! Or Rome? Or whatever European adventure the show wants to take us on next. <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/emilyinparis""><strong>Emily In Paris</strong><strong><em> Season 5</em></strong></a><strong><em> is streaming now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Content warning: This article discusses violence in a way that may be distressing to some readers</em>.<em> It was original published on Refinery29’s Australia edition.</em></p>



<p>On the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/hanukkah-in-australia"">first night of Hanukkah</a>, beneath the quintessential glow of a Sydney summer evening, globally beloved and iconic <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/International/alleged-bondi-beach-gunman-charged-15-counts-murder/story?id=128475208"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bondi Beach</a> turned from a scene of joy to one of terror. Families and friends had gathered for a festive beachfront celebration, lighting the menorah and singing songs, when gunfire shattered the laughter. Two gunmen, a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/live/ckgk391yzm7t"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">father and son</a> armed with rifles, opened fire on the crowd, killing at least 15 people (including a child) and injuring dozens more. One attacker was shot dead by police, and the other was wounded and arrested amid the chaos. Australian authorities swiftly declared it a terrorist attack motivated by antisemitic hatred, an assault on the Jewish community that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said “struck at the heart of the nation”. What should have been a night of light and hope became Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years.</p>



<p>The next morning, Bondi’s sands lay empty and silent, an unheard-of phenomenon for one of the most popular shorelines in the country, save for investigators pacing the cordoned-off area. Since then, the stories and the heroism of bystanders who tried to stop the shooters have dominated headlines. Yet the impact of this attack cannot be measured only in lives lost or injuries. Its shockwaves have rippled far beyond those who stood on the sand that night; the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-help-bondi-beach-terror-attack"">tragedy</a> has seared itself into the psyche of people around the world, including many who were nowhere near Bondi Beach when it happened.</p>



<h2>Beyond The Shore</h2>



<p>Not even in the hours after the attack, but during, phones pinged with news alerts across Australia and overseas. Many who read the headlines or watched grainy and graphic videos felt a chill of grief and fear. It didn’t matter that they were seeing it through a screen; their hearts broke, and their fear was felt in real time. In Sydney, thousands gathered at vigils the next day, mourners at Bondi laid flowers and sang prayers under the open sky. Similar tributes appeared in other cities, in Melbourne, in London outside the Australian High Commission, and beyond — a sign that the world was mourning with Bondi. </p>



<p>“Collective trauma can impact how we view the world and how we see ourselves in it — the social norms and security we were used to are challenged, making us feel unsafe and unsure, and grieving the world we understood,” explains Mental Health Therapist <a href=""https://www.baretherapy.com.au/meet-tammi"">Tammi Miller</a>.<br /></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These are valid feelings — the goalposts of our beliefs have been moved, and we’re trying to redefine what they are. With a big event like the Bondi attack, we’re also being fed new information over hours and days, meaning those goalposts continue to shift. It’s a lot of work mentally, and we can feel exhausted, overwhelmed and anxious.</p><cite>tammi miller, Mental Health Therapist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>According to Principal Psychologist at Umeed Psychology, <a href=""http://www.umeed.psychology.com.au"">Anushka Phal</a>, this reaction is a form of collective trauma or vicarious trauma. “Humans don’t exist in isolation; we’re part of communities,” Phal describes this as identity-based trauma: “For people with histories of trauma, chronic stress, racism, gender-based violence, or migration stress, the nervous system is already primed to ask: Am I safe? Am I next? The body doesn’t treat it as ‘news’ — it treats it as confirmation.” She adds: “Even secondhand exposure can activate the threat system — particularly in a 24/7 media environment. The nervous system doesn’t respond to logic; it responds to danger cues, which can show up as hypervigilance, irritability, flatness, grief, and even physical symptoms.”</p>



<p>Decades of research on vicarious traumatization show that people can develop stress symptoms from simply hearing about or seeing footage of violent events. Our brains, in a sense, replay the horror as if we were there. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifting-the-veil-trauma/202001/watching-the-news-can-be-traumatizing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">One study</a> even found that individuals with no prior trauma who watched distressing news reports showed symptoms of secondary traumatic stress, such as anxiety, nightmares, and feelings of helplessness. In the case of the Bondi attack, it brutally resonated far and wide – from the Jewish community in Sydney to anyone who has ever set foot on Bondi.</p>



<p>As <a href=""http://www.mymirror.com.au"">Rachel Tomlinson</a>, a Sydney-based therapist (and one of many professionals volunteering at community support sessions this week), points out: “Trauma is processed through the nervous system first, not the thinking brain. That’s why people feel sick, shaky, or disconnected — the body is responding to a perceived threat even before we can name the emotion.”</p>



<p>She continues, “Even indirect exposure — like media — can activate this system. Freeze or dissociation responses are just as real as panic. You might feel emotionally flat, stuck, or spaced out. It’s a survival response, not weakness.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950751.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA – DECEMBER 15: Candles are lit at the Bondi Pavilion as people pay tribute to the victims of a mass shooting at Bondi Beach yesterday, on December 15, 2025.

<h2>Coping With The Invisible Wounds</h2>



<p><strong>1. Mental health experts emphasize that your feelings are valid.</strong> Even if you were not physically present. There’s no need to say, “I wasn’t there, so I shouldn’t be this upset.” Grief, anger, fear, outrage, and numbness, all of these are natural responses. “Give yourself permission to feel whatever comes,” advises Anushka Phal. “Don’t bottle it up just because you weren’t at the scene. You’re human, and at our core, humans care about each other.” Acknowledging the pain is a first step to healing. That might mean talking to friends or family about how the news affected you, or writing down your thoughts in a journal. Some find comfort in attending vigils or religious services to honor the victims, as coming together in solidarity can ease the sense of powerlessness. Others might light a candle at home or say a prayer as a personal act of remembrance. </p>



<p><strong>2. Limiting media exposure</strong> is another important coping strategy. While it’s natural to seek information after a traumatic event, endlessly scrolling through graphic images or videos can retraumatize you. “Being unable to control when or what imagery you see following an event like the Bondi attack can make it difficult to self-regulate,” says Miller. “Repeated exposure can trigger a stress response — difficulty sleeping, irritability, trouble concentrating. It’s important to remember that you are safe in these moments, to look around you and name three things you can see, touch, feel, practise deep breathing and centering, and definitely to seek support from a confidant or trained mental health professional.”</p>



<p><strong>3. Connecting with others is crucial in these times.</strong> The Bondi Beach community has exemplified this – within 24 hours, thousands of people gathered to comfort one another, sing together, and remind themselves that they are not alone. Whether you attend a local vigil or simply call a friend to talk, sharing your feelings can lighten the emotional load. Sometimes just hearing someone say “I feel it too” can be profoundly validating. If your distress persists or feels overwhelming, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. Therapists are aware that indirect trauma is real and can help you work through it. There is no shame in seeking help; it doesn’t matter that “it didn’t happen to me,” what matters is that it affected you, and getting support is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>



<p><strong>4. Finally, it can be healing to channel your emotions into positive action. </strong>Donate to a victims fund. Support crisis lines like Lifeline, which are seeing a huge surge in calls and will continue to through the holidays. Volunteer your time if you have capacity — or if you don’t, drop off a meal, check in on a friend, walk someone home. Acts of care don’t need to be big to matter. They just need to happen.</p>



<h2>Finding Light After The Darkness</h2>



<p>In the days since the attack, the golden sands of Bondi have been blanketed with flowers, candles, and handwritten messages. Strangers hug each other on the promenade, united in grief. The air carries the mingled scents of saltwater and candle wax as the sun sets each evening over a beach that is healing from trauma seen and unseen. The emotional wounds from that night will take time to mend, and some scars may never fully fade. But amid the sorrow, there is a steadfast resolve that the forces of hatred will not break the spirit of the community. </p>

Being human, compassionate and empathic means being impacted by violence and loss, especially when it hits close to home or touches your identity.

<p>For anyone struggling with heavy emotions after this tragedy, know that you are entitled to those feelings, they speak to your empathy, and that with time and support, the fear and anguish can evolve into strength and meaning. </p>

<p>While we all may have very clear visions of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11430657/carrie-bradshaw-style-it-girl"">Carrie Bradshaw</a> running around Manhattan in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/05/10490787/sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-carrie-manolo-blahnik-heels"">Manolo Blahnik heels</a> and spending hours playing dress up in luxury stores, the real life style icon Sarah Jessica Parker, <em>today</em>, is opting for quick and efficient online shopping with the help of Google.<br /><br />“I don’t consider myself a very good shopper because I’m seduced by imagery and what looks great on somebody else. But there’s a truth about my size and what colors look good on me,” Parker exclusively tells Refinery29. And thanks to <a href=""https://blog.google/products/shopping/how-to-use-google-shopping-try-it-on/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s “Try On” feature</a>, Parker can actually envision herself in pieces before hastily carting them up. “I think this is one use of [AI] that feels not only benign, but potentially quite helpful. It creates clarity about how things may or may not look on you.”<br /><br />While I’m personally quite weary of AI in general, as I was speaking to SJP, I knew I had to try this feature for myself. Because although I wax poetic about all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gifts-for-fashion-lovers"">best fashion to shop</a> online, I find myself gravitating more towards in-person shopping because I’m unsure how many pieces will fit my petite-yet-curvy body. With that, I used some of SJP’s best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">holiday season dressing</a> advice to see how her favorite styles actually look on myself through Google Try On.<br /><br />The technology came out earlier this year, but it’s just gotten a refresh with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DSXfkjDjVkT/"">SJP’s new holiday campaign</a>. According to <a href=""https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-mode-virtual-try-on-update/"">Google’s blog</a>, the virtual try-on technology allows “shoppers to try on billions of items of clothing from our Shopping Graph. It’s powered by a new custom image generation model for fashion, which understands the human body and nuances of clothing — like how different materials fold, stretch and drape on different bodies.”<em><br /></em><br />Again, I was skeptical but excited at the same time.<br /><br />Self-declared “lousy shopper” Parker explains: “I just think it’s really helpful and really user-friendly, and I’m hoping it kind of cuts out some of the chaos and hysteria around shopping,” adding: “I think this idea of Google Shopping with the ability to actually see it on your person takes some of that intimidation away, but also you feel more assured that you’re purchasing something that will likely really suit the occasion and your person.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950842.jpg?width=569&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=569%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It works by searching for fashion items on Google and clicking into a product suggestion before seeing a “try it on” pop-up button. Then you can upload a full-body image of yourself and the AI technology realistically adds the clothing onto your body. It also has a follow-up feature where you can save and send the image to your group chat if you need a second opinion. (And if you’re wondering, SJP says she would definitely text looks to longtime collaborator and <em>Sex and the City</em> costume designer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/and-just-like-that-season-3-carrie-fashion-costumes"">Molly Rogers</a> for fashion help). <br /><br />As SJP went on listing her favorite festive attire — from houndstooth and platinum to “chiffon big skirts from the eighties with a leotard” (à la Carrie Bradshaw) and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">jewel-tone tights</a> paired with patent leather Mary Janes — I put some to the test with Google Try On.<br /><br />After uploading a couple of full-body photos of myself wearing fitting clothing as suggested on my phone, one photo worked best and saved into Google so it could be reused for every new product I selected. (I think in the future I’d opt for a tank top and biker shorts for the most accurate depiction of my body, especially for skin-baring pieces, but I was pleased with how Google auto-generated my body, especially in mini dresses (see below).<br /><br />“I went to a party the other evening and the host was wearing a pinstripe suit, but the pinstripes were all sparkly, and I loved it,” Parker says. And so I searched for just that and clicked on a suit from Sandro via <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-nordstrom-gifts-sale"">Nordstrom</a>, which I could see myself standing in within 10 seconds. (It’s important to note that the feature doesn’t work on the first sponsored products that pop up on the search page, and not <em>every single</em> retailer offers it.)<br /><br />I also wanted to virtually try on a vintage-inspired <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">party dress</a> after Parker declared: “I personally love plaids and tartans this time of year. It’s really old fashioned, but I see more and more of it and it’s really exciting.” Eager to try a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"">Free People</a> dress with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-drop-waist-dresses"">drop waist</a> <em>and</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-bubble-skirts"">bubble skirt</a> (both trendy yet polarizing silhouettes), I was pleasantly surprised by how it looked on my body. The feature even styled me in the same shoes that the model is wearing.</p>

<p>And when she isn’t attending lavish soirees, SJP is opting for humble winter wardrobe staples. “My day-to-day, I’m in waffle-cotton Hanes <em>men’ s </em>leggings in white. And I’m in 20-year-old cashmere cardigans from J. Crew.”<br /><br />I’ll spare you the unflattering image of me wearing Hanes’ men’s leggings. But hey, thankfully I could try them virtually before assuming just because SJP loves them that they’d also look good on me, and wasting my time and money! But it was fun playing around with how more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">practical cardigans</a> — as well as more elaborate styles, like gowns that I may never actually wear — looked like. <br /><br />“I just think people can have things on their body that they might never have had a chance to try,” Parker explains, adding: “It feels like it’s a nice way for people to have some more assurance and also a touch of fantasy.”<br /><br />So, if you’re needing some <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">festive outfit inspo</a> and fantasy (from the comfort of your couch), consider it sorted.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4jx0Xgc_Pc"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Is This Thing On?</a> </em>may not seem like a movie where you’d find Grammy-award winner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10442765/andra-day-oscars-beauty-hair-makeup-nails"">Oscar nominee Andra Day</a>. It’s about a white man doing stand-up comedy after all. But the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bradley-cooper"">Bradley Cooper</a>-directed divorce dramedy starring <a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/culture/film-and-tv/film/article-stand-up-guy-bradley-cooper-gives-will-arnett-the-role-of-a-lifetime/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/153024/laura-dern-interview-daughter-jaya"">Laura Dern</a> wouldn’t be complete without Day, who brings some brutal honesty and a delightful groundedness to the film. She plays Christine, the best friend to Dern’s Tess, and the wife of Cooper’s Balls (yes, that’s really his character’s name). Tess is going through a divorce with Arnett’s Alex, who turns to stand-up comedy to cope with their breakup. Day is so good as Christine in every scene, it feels like you’re eavesdropping on old friends who can’t help but tell each other the truth — no matter how uncomfortable. </p>



<p>Cooper handpicked Day for the role and was sure she’d say no. “I was just crossing my fingers with Andra,” Cooper says in the <a href=""https://press.searchlightpictures.com/is-this-thing-on"">film’s production notes</a>. “I just knew she would say no, but I had to offer it to her. When I saw<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10332763/is-united-states-vs-billie-holiday-drugs-arrests-death-accurate"">The United States vs. Billie Holliday</a>,</em> I was floored. I was like, ‘Look, I apologize that the real estate is going to be small here, but here is the terrain. Would you please come do this with me?’ It was a huge coup to get her.” And with the small real estate Day is given, she builds a brick house. It’s a no-bullshit performance that leaps off the screen, leaving the audience wanting more of Christine. And the dynamic between her and Tess “makes for a delicious, spiky friendship,” Dern says. </p>



<p>Here, Day talks about Cooper’s support, building rapport with Dern, singing with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanhayes/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sean Hayes</a>, and why she’d never get back together with an ex.</p>



<p><strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Refinery29 Unbothered</a>: I loved the film and was surprised by how much I was moved by it! I know that Bradley Cooper said he had to convince you, or that when he asked you to do this, he didn’t think you would say yes. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Andra Day:</strong> Is this what he’s telling people?<em> [laughs]</em> He did not have to convince me of anything! He just popped on the screen and he was Bradley Cooper and I was like, “great idea, let’s work together!” He’s so funny. I genuinely was very excited to be a part of [this movie]. I’m a huge fan of his work as an actor. I’m a huge fan of his work as a director. I just think he’s just shown he’s just such a brilliant director. He’s just a great filmmaker. So I was excited. I was like, “I’m actually looking forward to being in your hands and seeing what you put together with this cast.” I’m so glad you love the movie. And maybe I’m biased, but I love the movie too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth… We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. </p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tell me more about why you chose to take on this role</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I was really moved by [Bradley Cooper’s] support. I also knew that he was really supportive of two other movies I had done. So for him to back up that support with the offer to play this character, I thought was really, really special. And then he starts describing the movie to me. It’s <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/is-this-thing-on-review-will-arnett-laura-dern-1236397884/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Will Arnett’s baby</a>, and they’ve been friends for such a long time. So I love that it was he [cast] himself as [the character] Balls, because who else better to play Will’s best friend than his actual best friend? I love the dynamic of the friend group. I love the themes of truth, of rediscovery, of transformation, and communication, and just growth. I think it’s so funny. We always talk about growth, but we never allow each other to change. So I love that the movie dealt with all of those themes. And then Bradley mentioned the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. And I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>They are all just so great. It was a dream cast to work with and it was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950917.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=625&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A625"" /><figcaption>From L to R: Bradley Cooper, Will Arnett, and Andra Day in IS THIS THING ON?

<p><strong>I love what you just said: “we always talk about growth, but we don’t allow each other to change.” That was a bar! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>You know, maybe I was a little rapper in my past life<em> [laughs].</em> Nah, I’m just kidding but I think it’s true! </p>



<p><strong>I want to talk about that cast that you mentioned, because there are some heavy hitters. You play Laura Dern’s best friend, Christine. Talk about building that rapport with Laura Dern, because it does feel like you’re just dropped into this years-long friendship. How did you build that rapport?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>It’s amazing to feel like you were just dropped in this relationship. I think that’s a testament to the great writing, the great direction and how it was shot, but also the truth.  Bradley absolutely requires truth. That’s the thing we’re looking for. But working with Laura, first of all, I’m just such a huge fan of her work. Laura plays such an array of characters, and so, of course, you walk into her space and you’re intimidated at first. You got to make sure you show up and support and you’re present but beyond that, being able to work with Laura and discovering,<em> oh, wow, she is amazing. </em>She’s great at what she does, and a huge part of that is how generous she is on set, how generous she is with not just the director and her co stars, but everyone on set, every actor, personnel on set and and how honest and open she is about herself as a human, and how much of that she brings to the character. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950918.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Laura Dern and Andra Day in IS THIS THING ON?

<p><strong>Christine is such a protective friend.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I love that you see that! <em>[laughs] </em></p>



<p><strong>She’s like, don’t mess with my girl! How protective of a friend are you? Could you relate to that in Christine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD:</strong> No, I have ADHD, so I can’t focus on shit. Most of the time I don’t even remember. <em>[laughs] </em>I’m just kidding! No,I think I am a protective friend.<em> [gestures off camera]. </em>Look, I have a friend in the room that’s nodding her head “yes” and laughing right now.</p>



<p>I think I am definitely a protective friend, for sure. What I like about Christine, though, is that she is a protective friend, but she will also protect you from yourself. I think that what I love about her character is her brutal honesty. I think what makes it so not just digestible, but actually endearing, is the fact that she is equally as brutally honest with herself. That’s really the only way to be honest with someone, that’s the only way they can actually trust your advice or your critique, if that they know that you hold yourself to that same standard. I think we’re similar in that way. I can be very protective, and not just physically, but also emotionally when it comes to friends and people that I love.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Bradley [said] the names Will Arnett, Laura Dern and Sean Hayes. I was like, <em>this is all just getting too crazy. </em>It was a dream cast to work with. It was exactly what I thought it would be. And better.</p><cite>andra day</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Stand-up comedy is the beating heart throughout this film. Is stand-up something you’ve ever thought about doing? Did this movie change your opinion of it at all? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Stand-up comedy is never something I ever thought about doing, and still have never thought about doing because it looks terrifying to me. You know what’s funny, I was saying  about the movie that it makes me laugh when we describe <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50ze1xn0zo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Bishop</a> [who inspired] Will Arnett’s character, Alex Novak, and they’re like, “Yeah, he just kind of did this stand-up because he didn’t want to pay the cover.” And I’m like, “guys, that’s not normal.” <em>[laughs]. </em>Like, if it were me, and someone was like, you can either pay the cover or you can go do stand up. I’m either coming out of my pocket 15 bucks or I’m going to the restaurant down the street. I’m not going to do a set of stand-up for $15!  It’s too terrifying. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950919.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Will Arnett with director Bradley Cooper on the set of IS THIS THING ON? Photo by Searchlight Pictures/Jason McDonald, Courtesy of Searchlight Pictures. © 2025 Searchlight Pictures All Rights Reserved.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think it takes something inherently in you to do that. But what I learned was about the community of stand-up. I think it’s an incredible community. Bradley [Cooper] has always loved stand-up. And I think we all have, right? The Richard Pryors, Eddie Murphys. But the connectedness and the camaraderie were amazing to me. It used to be a lot more competitive. Now, when you dip into the culture, you realize that they’re doing, like, 3 to 6, clubs<em> a night,</em> which is insane. The grind is such that I’ve always admired stand-up comics, I loved to see how connected they are. And I think that Bradley [Cooper] and Will [Arnett] did an incredible job of showing this community, how they support each other, how they joke, and how honest they are as people.</p>



<p><strong>There’s this incredible scene where you and Sean Hayes sing “Amazing Grace.” How did that come to be?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>First, I love singing with Sean. I love Sean’s voice. Twas an amazing scene to shoot. It was amazing because it wasn’t written in the script. The night before, I got a call from Bradley that was like, “What do you think about singing ‘Amazing Grace’?” I was like, “Sure!” That was one of the later scenes we shot and I was, I was used to us being on set and being able to pivot. Who knows if it would be amazing or if it’d be really cringe and weird? I didn’t know. But it worked.</p>



<p>That scene, for me, and a lot of the Oyster Bay scenes, helped me to feel much more a part of this group. It just felt like we just were enjoying each other’s presence while we were on set filming that scene. And then I think it translated for the audience — them singing Amazing Grace added like, 10 or 15 years to their friendship. </p>



<p><strong>We’re going to end on a little game. I’m going to give you scenarios — based on the movie — and the answers are either “Bothered or Unbothered.” Your partner decides to become a stand up comedian later in life, bothered or unbothered? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered! I’m an artist in that way. I’m just kind of like, “you’re fine. Try it if you love it!”</p>



<p><strong>You don’t like your best friend’s husband: bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Super bothered! Super duper bothered! </p>



<p><strong>Telling your best friend’s man you used to have a crush on him.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Oohh. This is where I differ from my character. I’m a little more bothered about that.</p>



<p><strong>Getting back together with an ex.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered, bothered, bothered! You an ex for a reason.</p>



<p><strong>Your friend doesn’t tell you she got back together with her ex. Bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Bothered. Not because you got back with your ex — unless he’s a toxic ex — I’m like, sis, what are we doing? Bothered, because if he’s a decent person, then what am I doing that made you feel uncomfortable to talk to me about that? If we’re best friends and I’m a confidant, then I’m bothered a little bit with myself and the situation.</p>



<p><strong>When people announce their breakup on social media or publicly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>I don’t care. Unbothered. I’m like, do you! Who cares?</p>



<p><strong>Finally, using your personal life as fodder for art or comedy, bothered or unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AD: </strong>Unbothered, that’s actually art and comedy. I’m bothered when you don’t use it at all. You know what I’m saying? That’s when I’m bothered.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11950003.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Highly detailed “Supermoon” Pink Moon image with a star field background</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In true form, the New Moon in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-december-14-to-20-meaning-effects"">on December 19th</a> is going to be a wild roller coaster of emotions. It’s officially the last new moon of 2025 and it’s going to bring high energy and a truly uplifting lunar reset.</p>



<p>But just when we thought we had escaped confusing and ambiguous times brought on by a season of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">five planetary retrogrades</a>, the New Moon in Sagittarius arrives and shakes up our emotions and relationships — once again. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-sagittarius-november-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a>, Saturn in Pisces, and Neptune in Pisces aspect the New Moon, creating a mixed bag of emotions. Venus’ alignment gives us hope to enhance our love lives, while Saturn limits and Neptune heightens our fantasies — so, we may feel as though we are <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">stuck in a situationship</a> that’s holding us back, but have faith that things will get better soon. Add in a minor frustration from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a>, and the vibe gets both saucy and sassy. </p>



<p>As a result, our intuition will prove to be powerful. It’ll be easier than ever for us to comprehend matters on a spiritual level. The flip side is that we might also be paranoid or delulu in certain matters. Finding a balance between embracing our instincts and logic is pivotal to ensure we don’t go overboard in one direction over another. It’ll be challenging to remain centered, which is why grounding exercises such as connecting to the body through yoga or a walk in nature will do us good. This activity will clear our minds and remind us to remain present — no matter what the universe throws our way.</p>



<p>The need for change is strong, as we yearn to evolve in our love lives. The lessons Saturn imparts on us are going to rock our worlds for the better. The fog brought on by Neptune might hold us captive, but it will dissipate soon. Trusting our hearts and others unthinkingly can lead us to question what we want and whether we are making the best choices, but we’ll see that our innate divine wisdom and knowledge hold the key to our happiness. Ignoring outside noise and opinions of others helps guide us to the right space and place. Venus and the New Moon push us to roll the dice and bet on our feelings. We have to “know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em.”</p>



<p>The following day, Mercury in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny on the Pisces and Virgo lunar axis. It’ll be hard to find the best way to move forward without drama or arguments, since we are bewildered about what the best path is. The mutable T-Square is causing our nerves to heighten. Our anxieties might reach a fever pitch as we continue to ruminate over the avenue we wish to pursue. Before getting into a headspin and over matters, take a step back and contemplate through meditation. If we are lucky, the universe will grant us both clarity and self-discovery.</p>



<p>In moments like this, it’s always great to reflect and take stock of our desires and progress. The Temperance tarot card (which aligns with the sun sign Sagittarius) represents this sentiment, since it focuses on how we can find our calm in turbulent times. Patience ignites the dream to come alive. Therefore, we shouldn’t make impetuous decisions. Moderation is essential to finding our deepest feelings, motives, and passions. Even though we are caught in the middle of the storm, we can navigate it. The only way out is through — we won’t realize it immediately, but we are in the driver’s seat. Let your senses and heart be the map that you listen to.</p>
