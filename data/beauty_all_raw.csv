<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> said “an artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” she wasn’t referring to only the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/most-impactful-tv-shows"">moments in history</a> that feel like sunshine and roses. The iconic singer and activist meant the dark and ugly parts, too. </p>



<p>Lately, however, there’s been an alarming trend of people in power <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVG7PNTZbtM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">censoring art that reflects reality</a>. Just recently, Apple TV postponed the release of <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/""><em>The</em> <em>Savant</em></a><em> </em>in the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The series follows an investigator (Jessica Chastain) who interferes with white supremacist organizations before mass shootings occur. In a statement to <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"">Deadline</a>, a spokesperson for the streaming platform said, “After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” adding that it would be released at a later date. <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jessica-chastain-the-savant-delay-will-it-be-released-apple-1236406858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain expressed her disappointment</a> on Instagram, stating that “we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States” since they began making the show five years ago. </p>

<p>This is just one example of Hollywood executives <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/after-jimmy-kimmels-show-was-suspended-a-key-question-is-does-the-fcc-have-the-power-to-regulate-speech"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">canceling or suspending shows</a> and movies seemingly in immediate response to headlines of the day. Their statements may be broad, and their actions may do little more than appease shareholders, but the consistent <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62le8q959yo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">attacks on freedom of speech</a> and expression through the arts do nothing but hold the entertainment industry — and society — back.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth praising the TV shows and films that confront the times instead of running from them. These are the best series and movies that have refused to shy away from the social and political climates they were made in. </p>

<h2><strong><em>Fruitvale Station </em></strong>(2013)</h2>







<p>The world was introduced to the genius of Ryan Coogler through <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, a poignant film that highlights the final day of Oscar Grant’s life. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, Grant was <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/10-years-since-oscar-grant-s-death-what-13489585.php"">killed at age 22</a> on New Years Day in 2009 by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer Johannes Mehserle. The killing occurred in Oakland, California — Coogler’s hometown — but the film resonated across the nation, and with timely reason: It debuted one year after the killing of Trayvon Martin, an event that sparked protests nationwide and ignited the Black Lives Matter movement in a formal way. State-sanctioned and racist violence was all too common, yet it had been long ignored on the silver screen. Coogler’s directorial debut shined a light on the deadly cost of institutionalized racism that the United States has yet to contend with. <strong><em>Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>Watchmen </em></strong>(2019)</h2>







<p>Regina King is the true hero of this HBO limited series, adapted from the DC Comics graphic novels of the same name. Though <em>Watchmen</em> is set in a present-day alternate universe, it’s based on the true horrors of the <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tulsa-race-massacre-100-years_n_60a574b2e4b0313547925c09"">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921, in which white supremacists targeted an area of town known as Black Wall Street for its thriving Black-owned businesses. Unlike in reality, the descendants of the massacre receive reparations, leaving resentment amongst the white supremacist group known as the Seventh Kavalry. King is a masked vigilante on a mission to put an end to the group’s pattern of racial violence. <em>Watchmen</em> also stars Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Irons, and Jean Smart as their characters must confront their own ethics in ways they’ve never had to before.. This nine-episode series is a masterclass in rich, nuanced storytelling about the traumas that wounds inflicted from racism hold — and the inherited pain that ensues if not addressed head-on. With the resurfacing of white nationalism and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/us-black-history-dei"">erasure of historical facts </a>on federal and state levels, this prescient show is absolutely worth a rewatch today. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>One Battle After Another </em></strong>(2025)</h2>







<p>There’s a reason Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest has been heralded as one of the best films of 2025 while also spinning <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/one-battle-after-another-conservative-reactions-1236394128/"">conservatives into a tizzy</a>. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti, and highlights the cost and complexities of serving as part of a revolution. Though <em>One Battle After Another</em> doesn’t specify what the protagonists are fighting for other than freedom, it’s evident that patriarchal and white supremacists systems are a known enemy. (Sound familiar?) The film tackles racism, sexism, xenophobia, and classism as the main characters reunite after decades of inactivity in the effort to save the daughter of one of their own. A secondary plot focusing on immigrant rights reflects the reality of so many people and families who have recently been targeted by ICE raids under Trump’s regime; markedly, the film spares no punches in its depiction of this violence. <strong>One Battle After Another<em> is in theaters now with a digital release date of November 20.</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong><em>The Morning Show </em></strong>(4 seasons, 2019-present)</h2>







<p>Season after season, this Apple TV series understands the assignment. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, <em>The Morning Show</em> is a novel depiction of the inner workings of the media, this time from a nationally syndicated morning show on a major network. Each season, these journalists are impacted personally and professionally by major events happening in the world, from the #MeToo movement to the pandemic to the rise of artificial intelligence. Throughout the series, they must contend with a changing media landscape that leads to layoffs and a challenging environment for journalism to thrive. Watching this four-season show can be triggering for those working in the industry. Binge at your own risk.<strong><em> Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Adolescence</em></strong> (2024)</h2>







<p>This Netflix original is an uncomfortably ugly ride that exposes the life-threatening dangers of the digital manosphere. Owen Cooper plays a 13-year-old named Jaime, who — despite coming from a solid home with a seemingly normal foundation — is arrested for killing a female classmate who declined his advances. The four-episode series is a devastating depiction of how the dark corners of social media and the internet at large are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"">radicalizing young men</a> today. <strong><em>Stream now on</em></strong> <em><strong>Netflix.</strong></em></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Her</em></strong><strong> </strong>(2013)</h2>







<p><em>Her</em> isn’t a horror film — but it might soon become a documentary, as a recent Vantage Point Counseling Services study showed that almost a third of Americans have admitted to having an <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/americans-romantic-relationships-ai-chatbot-study-b2838217.html"">intimate or romantic relationship</a> with an AI chatbot. That is more or less the premise of this film, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as the lonely and introverted Theodore Twombly. Fresh off a divorce, Theodore falls in love with Samantha, a chatbot voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Though the Spike Jonze feature premiered more than a decade ago, it eerily predicted the moment in time we currently live in, particularly as a <a href=""https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/24/10/what-causing-our-epidemic-loneliness-and-how-can-we-fix-it"">loneliness epidemic</a> and advancements in generative AI converge. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></strong> (6 seasons, 2017-2025)</h2>







<p>Watching this dystopian Hulu series is sombering, especially in a post-<em>Roe v. Wade </em>society. Based on Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, the Emmy-winning series takes place in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian nation that was once the United States. Its power-hungry men have made laws that subjugate women to follow an extreme set of laws that essentially gives the government total control of their bodies. It is illegal for them to read, vote, divorce, and freely express themselves in any way. June Osborne (Elizabeth Moss) is one of the few fertile women left in Gilead; for this, she is captured, enslaved, and forced to become a surrogate for a Commander and his wife. The torture, abuse, and dehumanizing conditions these characters experience make this show a hard watch, especially as lawmakers <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/health/usaid-contraceptives-destroyed-trump.html"">continue to police</a> <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/09/texas-abortion-pill-ban/"">and chip away</a> <a href=""https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2025/09/birth-control-incorrectly-labeled-as-abortifacients-by-trump-administration.html"">at women’s reproductive rights</a> at the federal and local level. <strong><em>Stream now on Hulu.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em></strong> (2019)</h2>







<p>Gentrification has been a hot button topic for quite some time, but seeing how it’s depicted in <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em> gives the conversation around it a fresh lens. The film centers on Jimmie Fails, a third-generation San Franciscan holding onto the Victorian home his grandfather supposedly built despite it no longer belonging to his family. When the home’s white former tenants vacate, Jimmie moves out of his friend’s apartment in a low-income neighborhood that’s built on toxic waste and begins squatting. The realities of the movie continue to this day: As the cost of living in one of the country’s <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/income-needed-to-live-comfortably-in-most-expensive-us-cities.html"">most expensive cities</a> continues to rise, <a href=""https://capitalbnews.org/black-displacement-gentrification-watts-study/"">communities established by people of color</a> have only become whiter and whiter. This Sundance Film Festival winner maintains its relevancy as Black and Brown neighborhoods across the country contend with what “home” looks like when so many of their neighbors are being displaced. <strong><em>Rent now on Prime Video or AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em></strong> (2018)</h2>







<p>Barry Jenkins masterfully adapts James Baldwin’s novel of the same name into the beautiful love story. Fonny and Tish are a young, Black couple from Harlem. Their relationship is tragically interrupted when Fonny is falsely accused of raping a white woman and thrown in prison. Though the film depicts the tragedy of mass incarceration and corruption, it takes care to treat the families impacted by these systemic travesties with  sophistication and dignity. The moral of <em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em> is that no matter what systems try to break love, its resiliency is undeniable.<strong><em> Watch now on Prime Video.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong> (2015)</h2>







<p>The housing crisis took place in 2008 but Adam McKay’s <em>The Big Short</em> still feels eerily relevant. Starring Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, it takes a comedic approach to explaining how a group of investors predicted that a crash was coming and bet against the banks. They won big while the rest of the country went into an economic downward spiral. The Oscar-winning film depicted the role Wall Street’s greed played in causing The Great Recession. While other factors certainly contributed to the economic realities of 2008 and the following years, the film still hits as today’s everyday Americans increasingly feel financial strain. <strong><em>Watch now on Paramount+</em></strong>.</p>

<h2><strong><em>Don’t Look Up</em></strong> (2021)</h2>







<p>As a comet hurls towards Earth, two astronomers (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) try to warn the global population in this Adam McKay-directed film. Few are taking this death star seriously, however — including the U.S. president. <em>Don’t Look Up </em>follows DiCaprio and Lawrence’s charaters as they take matters into their own hands and warn the general public. Political hijinks ensues as the comet becomes a divisive issue rather than a rallying cry for action. Though a comet is the big threat in this film, it feels like a metaphor for many things, including the looming dangers of climate change and the gullibility of viewers who believe something is “fake news” because a politician told them so. <strong><em>Watch now on Netflix. </em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>Severance</em></strong> (2 seasons, 2022-present)</h2>







<p>This Emmy Award-winning Apple TV series premiered after the onset of the Covid pandemic and the work-from-home era, when many Americans had the time to assess their relationship with their work. Seasons don’t exist in the cold and dreary town run by Lumon, the company that sells the dream of a true work-life balance by literally severing their personalities into two. Their workplaces selves (innies) don’t know anything about their outside selves (outies). What initially seems like the ideal technology becomes an actual living hell for a group of employees who have effectively lost their free will. <strong><em>Stream now on AppleTV.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>The Wire</em></strong> (5 seasons, 2002-2009)</h2>







<p>A hallmark of prestige television since the moment it debuted in 2002, <em>The Wire</em> should be required viewing for anyone looking to pursue careers in law enforcement, journalism, local government, or the legal field. Set in Baltimore, the HBO original chronicles institutions on each side of the drug trade and examines how cops, drug dealers, reporters, lawyers, teachers, and blue-collar workers are all connected by the same system. Creator David Simon paints a vivid picture of the toll political corruption, racism, and addiction take on both individual people and the entire city. Though specific to the Maryland city in its accents and details, the show’s message easily applies to other urban cities across the country. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong><em>After The Hunt</em></strong> (2025)</h2>







<p><em>After The Hunt</em> poses a frustratingly timeless question: Who gets to be the perfect victim? Ayo Edebiri stars as Maggie Price, a queer Black student at Yale University whose family is filthy rich. This complex background — a mix of privilege and marginalization — as well as her suspected missteps call her integrity into question after she accuses a male instructor of raping her. Julia Roberts plays Alma Olsson, Maggie’s professor and mentor, who has to make a decision: Support her mentee as Maggie seeks to hold her abuser accountable, or side with her colleague with whom she shares romantic chemistry. The film challenges assumptions as it holds an uncomfortable mirror to the ways in which modern society still views consent and cancel culture.<strong> After the Hunt <em>was in theaters in October and will be released digitally on PrimeVideo soon.</em></strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em><strong>I May Destroy You </strong></em><strong>(1 season, 2020)</strong></h2>







<p>The series created by and starring Michaela Coel premiered two years after bombshell allegations against Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein thrust Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement into the national spotlight and sparked widespread conversations about sexual assault, harassment, and survivorhood. It’s a visceral but necessary watch. The show centers on three main characters as they navigate what it means to heal after being subjected to sexual violence. In just one season, <em>I May Destroy You</em> tackled the messy, dark, harrowing reality of what it means to process sexual assault and maintain a sense of your own agency as a survivor. <strong><em>Stream now on HBO Max.</em></strong></p>

<p>Jupiter, the planet of divine wisdom and luck, will be moonwalking in the water sign Cancer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 11, 2025 (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-11-11-angel-number-november-2023"">11/11 is the 1111 portal</a> to success — hopefully that transcends to the overall energy of Jupiter retrograde…fingers crossed) to March 11, 2026. The next four months will be when we rethink what makes us secure and safe, which is unraveling because the expansive planet is moving more slowly, making matters seem more difficult and bigger than they need to be. Reassessing relationships and family dynamics will be a big story during the holiday season and Valentine’s Day, since we are determining who and what we wish to take into the new year with us. We have gained insight into the actual colors and motives of others; now, we must plan how we should move forward. <br /><br />Although we like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-in-cancer-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Jupiter in Cancer</a> (this is the sign of Jupiter’s exaltation), the flipside is that it can also harm our lives. Jupiter always takes big swings and makes huge bets to win large. The caveat is that we’ll get minimal returns on investments and wagers. The stakes are high, so don’t play in a higher bracket and above our capabilities to ensure we lose less. The same applies to relationships — protecting our energy and deciphering who we let into our hearts ensures that we won’t hurt when it comes to romantic partnerships and friendships. Another theme at play is travel. Jupiter retrograde might make us stay close to home, harness delays, or cause us to be in closer proximity to family. </p>



<p>The planetary backspin occurs amidst two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrogrades</a> — that’s right, this transit will add to the intensity. The Mercurial backspin from November 9 to 29 in Sagittarius <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">and Scorpio</a> gets immense drama from Jupiter’s backward rotation. We’ll be more reflective than usual and unsure about our circumstances. The Mercury retrograde that backstrokes in Pisces from February 26 to March 20 makes our emotions extremely tender. We may have to cry out our sentiments to release them. Carry a pack of tissues everywhere in case they are needed because the slightest comments or annoyances could set us off at these times.<br /><br />Other planets, such as Saturn and Neptune in Pisces, and Uranus in Taurus will also be retrograde for the majority of the time. As a result, we’ll be apt to be in an ocean of emotions. It’ll be hard to set our sights on newness, as the cosmos are pulling us backward. The tides are high, resulting in cautious behavior. There will be moments when we act on impulsive, but it’s advisable to meditate on matters a few times before taking charge. <br /><br />As with all retrogrades, prepare for the unexpected. Go with the flow to ensure smooth sailing. Doing so can make a huge difference because we won’t overthink or stress so hard. Good luck! </p>

<p>PSA: The final <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9903579/is-mercury-retrograde-bad"">Mercury retrograde</a> of 2025 is the messiest. The optical illusion, which is caused by Mercury’s slow motion, causes disruption and disorder to earthlings. The disruptive transit affects us so much that it’s become impossible to ignore and part of our modern lexicon. This month, we’ll be drowning in the theatrics — make sure your life preserver is fastened. <br /><br />At the same time, four other planets are moonwalking in the cosmos: Jupiter (which turns retrograde on November 11), Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Prep for emo interactions with people we’ve long forgotten or resentments to come out into the open. We will not be able to get a hold of our words, resulting in us saying potentially offensive statements that we’ll regret. So, don’t drunk dial, email, text, DM, or lurk your ex’s social media after a few cocktails with friends from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November 9 to 29</a>, expecting them to be empathetic or vice versa.</p>



<p>Before November 9, the pre-retrograde began on October 21 in Sagittarius. Look at the dates from October 21 to November 9 to determine the story that will consume the most energy during the retrograde. This is the first time we trace over the degrees. We dive into the retrograde backtracking on these degrees. When the retrograde is over, we move forward and deal with the same degrees one last time from November 29 to December 16, when the planet moves back to the place and sign it was in on October 21. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">T</a>his third moment is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-november-2024-meaning-effects"">referred to as “retroshade”</a> because we are making final decisions based on the discoveries and observations made in the past weeks. Now that Mercury is direct, we can assess matters with a keen eye. <br /><br />Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius can make us more erratic and demanding. Basically, we’ll have no chill. We may become highly reactive and less reasonable, resulting in irrational exchanges with others. When Mercury backs up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">into Scorpio</a>, it’ll allow us to understand relationships and our feelings after several hours or days of introspection. Our spy senses are overactive, leading to paranoia. The key to calm is to not crash over a tidbit of gossip. Handle it like a boss and discuss it openly with a heavy heart. </p>



<p>Mercury’s backpedal starts with a conjunction to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> on November 12, setting the stage for an argument due to a confrontation over a misunderstanding. Mercury retrograde links up with Pluto in Aquarius on November 17, piling onto the issues from the 12th, a few days later. Matters can reach a fever pitch on the 17th, so tread lightly and don’t let conversations get too out of control. Mercury moves back into Scorpio on November 19, but moments after, Uranus retrograde in Taurus and Neptune retrograde in Pisces reveal secrets. The Sun forms a conjunction to Mercury retrograde on the 20th, a few hours before the New Moon. Saturn retrograde in Pisces and Jupiter retrograde in Cancer try to add structure to the vibe on November 22. However, we will break boundaries on the 24th when Venus and Mercury retrograde in Scorpio come together, forcing us to deal with situations and people from the old days. <br /><br />Yes, this Mercury retrograde is going to be tough. The best way to thrive is not to gaslight ourselves. Acknowledging our feelings and not compromising our needs could create conflict with those not ready to hear them. We shouldn’t hold back our sentiments to avoid drama and to make others happy. Speaking our truth and being as direct as possible during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> is vital. We must clarify and simplify words several times to get our points across. IKYK miscommunications are rampant, so checking messages before sending for typos is essential. There could also be travel issues, so allotting ourselves an extra half hour to get to a destination helps lessen anxiety and stress. <br /><br />This Mercurial moonwalk is going to fuel our tempers and emotions. All of the watery planets are making us long for the past. Just because the moment has slipped away doesn’t mean the merit is gone. The universe is giving us another chance to mend fences, heal our hearts, and look back and right our wrongs or attempt to make good on former promises. The Mercurial reckoning is here — are you ready? </p>

In November, the veil between the living and spirit realms is thin. This traditionally is a prime opportunity for us to tune into the silence and grasp the guidance that is being given to us through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">our ancestors</a> and spirit allies. Between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dia-de-los-muertos-for-mom"">Día de Muertos</a> and Gede Season, spirit reminds us that death is not an ending but an additional chapter in our lives. It’s a new beginning of sorts. <br /><br /> This month, our task is to listen to the direction we are being pointed to. This will help us sharpen our intuitive and psychic gifts that we’ve inherited from our ancestors and surrender to whatever is meant to shed from our lives so that a new beginning can arise. This is a time to celebrate your lineage, pour libations, and embody the prayers that made you possible. November’s tarotscopes will grant you clarity on your next steps during this season.<figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941368.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: Ace of Cups<br /></strong><br />This month is an emotional rebirth. Prepare to embody a more mature and abundant you. The ancestors and guides are pouring into you, whether that is through mirroring to you your truth and magnificence, providing juicy opportunities that will have your cup overflowing, or giving you the space to process your emotions and release in a safe way. Allow your heart to lead you. You’ve spent enough time surviving; now it’s time to receive. The Ace of Cups opens a new cycle of intimacy with yourself, your spirit, and the people who see you clearly. Don’t overthink. Let whatever is coming up to flow. What’s meant for you won’t require force. Your ancestors are blessing this new beginning. Drink from it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941369.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: Knight of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />This season implores you to slow down, milk the present moment, and seek the portal to all possibilities by enjoying the luxuries you have now. Find ways to devote to yourself versus rushing onto your next destination or attempting to control outcomes you have no control over. You are the wealth and success that you seek, so you do not chase something you already are. You are being asked to be disciplined on the homework your spirit guides have appointed to you. If you know doing something is for your betterment, commit to it. Be consistent. Everything you do, act on, say, think, and believe is sacred work. You are powerful. Focus on alignment and precision. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941370.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 7 of Wands<br /></strong><br />Your ancestors are fighting for you. They are carving pathways that you did not deem possible. They are defending your names behind closed walls and protecting you from unseen dangers and setbacks. Have you taken the time to thank them and to honor them? Have you considered what incredible qualities and characteristics you’ve inherited from them that you have yet to leverage? This season is about fighting back and ensuring that you will no longer play small or be taken for granted. Enough is enough. It’s time that you show the world what you are made of. Are you going to be a victim and just accept life’s circumstances as if you have no power of your own? Or will you invoke the flames of your ancestors to accept what is rightfully yours and enjoy every minute of it? </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941371.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: Justice<br /></strong><br />Behind the scenes, your ancestors are ensuring that justice is paid off and that the scales are balancing in your favor. This season, say that powerful prayer that is known to clear the roads of obstacles and unfavorable conditions. Ask your ancestors to remove any limitations, hindrances, and unwarranted energies in your life that are keeping you from reaching your next level and are not for your highest good. Prepare for the plot twist of your life and for a new chapter to emerge with more clarity than ever. Remain in integrity with yourself and the spirit realm. If you say you will do something, do it. If you receive benevolent guidance that will accelerate your life, act on it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941372.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 6 of Swords</strong><br /><br />You’ve got the green light to move on. You are being supported by the spirit realm to make this transition and shed that energetic weight with as least resistance as possible. Anything that has been making you stuck or showing no progress, will now be alleviating itself from your life. Your ancestors are guiding the boat now, steering you toward calmer waters. Don’t look back out of guilt or nostalgia. What’s ahead is peace, clarity, and spiritual renewal. Trust the transition.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941373.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: The Star</strong><br /><br />It is safe to believe again. Prior to this month, you might have questioned your desires and possibility of you actually attaining them. You may have questioned the route you are taking and whether or not you are on the right path. This season you will be shown just how aligned you are. Your ancestors are lighting the path ahead, showing you what’s possible when you believe again. This is your season to rebuild your faith, not from fantasy but from alignment with your higher purpose. You are blessed and highly favored. It is time to believe and pour into yourself so heavily that no other assumption exists. Allow yourself to shine because it is your identity. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941374.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: 4 of Swords</strong><br /><br />Rest is sacred work, and it holds the key to you attracting all that you need. The guides want you to slow down and intentionally implement old and new ways of relaxing and resting because that's how they get to speak directly to you without resistance. You need to be open and receptive to the guidance that wants to stream through. The information and downloads you receive this month are paramount to your evolution in life. Call your energy back to you and engage in practices that bring your awareness back into your body. Catch how many times your consciousness begins to wander somewhere outside of you and gently pull it back. Pause because clarity comes in stillness. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941375.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: 5 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You’re being asked to let go. Stop replaying what didn’t work or who didn’t stay. Something more glorious and aligned is on the horizon, but grief is keeping you from tapping into it. Give your sorrows, frustrations, and angst to your ancestors. Allow the emotions to be fully felt and embraced, but don’t hang onto them too long that they become a hindrance. This season, choose acceptance over attachment and seek peace. Mourn and release. Then lift your head, because the blessings ahead need your full presence and anticipation, not your pain.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941376.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 10 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />This season is about cementing your legacy through bold quantum moves. You’re not just acting from this timeline but from four timelines above it. Envision the person who already has what they want: what would that version want, and what would that other version want, and so on and so forth. Act from that space because leaping above the mundane is what’s going to set you apart and rapidly accelerate the attainment of your desires. You are not making yourself proud but breaking barriers for your entire lineage. The abundance is overflowing from you because you are secure in the embodiment of it. The amount of value you exude and provide is tremendous. Know that you are the answered prayer and everything you do moving forward will expand. Celebrate yourself and how far you’ve come. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941377.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 2 of Cups<br /></strong><br />You are being invited to learn more about yourself through your interactions and relationships with others. Your ancestors are sending mirrors: people and situations showing you how you give and receive love. Take notes. This is a time to consider if you have been providing the right energy that will foster supportive harmonious relationships and if you’ve been poured into as well from the other end. This is an optimal opportunity to allow old dynamics to shed and transform into beneficial supportive partnerships but also to call in new community and relationships that you desire. Prepare for the truth to be revealed to you and don’t run from it. Lead with your heart. You’ll know what to do. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941378.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: The Sun <br /></strong><br />You are the center of your own universe and the source of all abundance, so move like it. This is your glow up season where all eyes are on you, but, most importantly, you are shining on yourself like no other. This period is going to bring visibility, praise, recognition, joy, creative expansion, orgasms, and the successful results of doing the inner work and embodying your highest timeline. The ancestors are celebrating you and clearing the path so you are free to live your best life and, through example, show others that they can do it, too. Trust that so much is coming your way, and you will be perpetually making room for it all. You deserve it all.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941379.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Luxury is your birthright. Don’t you forget it! There are so many ways that you will choose to indulge in luxury this season that it becomes the baseline and the standard of your reality. Your ancestors are reminding you where you come from and how to shift struggle and turn it into gold. Your ability to generate abundance will be evident by the way you glow and live your life. You’ve cultivated this season of abundance through discipline, healing, and divine timing, so enjoy it! Don’t shrink your shine or apologize for your success or for choosing joy over suffering. Dress well, move with grace, and own your softness as power. You are walking proof that self-worth attracts everything.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941401.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Every year, when Venus enters Scorpio, we dive headfirst into our passions. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio is an intense water sign</a> that instantly knows what it wants. The intuition of Scorpio is fire, leading us to align with those at our level by forming close relationships with them. When Venus is in Scorpio, the romantic planet becomes slightly more seductive and goes after what it wants, encouraging our affections to reach a feverish pitch. We do not settle for anything less than we deserve, as we know to shoot for the stars and beyond. The caveat is that we can get competitive, since our ambitions take center stage. Calming this part of ourselves will be challenging — especially with this season’s cosmic line-up. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-scorpio-2024-meaning-effects"">Venus in Scorpio</a> is adding to the swampiness of the next several weeks. Since we are already in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a>, the connection to Mercury retrograde in Scorpio, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, and Saturn and Neptune retrograde in Pisces is tapping into our emotions and the past. It’ll be hard to escape the present ramifications of our former decisions, urging us to be more reflective. As a result, we may spend time alone, ruminating over our choices and trying to forge a new path forward. The one positive thing is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">the signs in the water element</a> keep us going; however, most planets are retrograde, making us feel like we are paddling against the current flow of energy. The best way to handle the vibe is to stop working hard relentlessly for the future and to be present. Water can heal and soothe our pain if we let it.</p>



<p>There could be moments of enlightenment during Venus’s stint in Scorpio. Having a discerning eye during the New Moon in Scorpio on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">November</a> 20 urges us to break free from situations and relationships holding us back. Releasing people, whether by unfollowing them on social media or keeping a safe distance, will make us lighter. Carrying around resentments and jealousies isn’t emotionally healthy, so it’s ideal to do a cleansing to ensure we can mend our hearts. Remember, this may take a while. There is no timeline for recovery. Everyone is different and does what works with their own methods. <br /><br />Watch out for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-support-partner-with-ptsd"">trauma bonding</a> at this time because we might align with those going through parallel experiences. Although the instant reaction is to assume that they are our spiritual counterpart, the relationship will shift when Mercury turns direct on November 29 and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30 (these dates are markers for specific cycles’ ending). The lesson is to maintain boundaries and not to blur lines. Staying in our lanes is advisable to ensure we do not become upset when the rapport dissipates. Therefore, it’s best to discuss our baggage with a therapist, close friends, or family members who will be by our side through thick and thin. <br /><br />Words of wisdom: From November 6 to 30, while Venus is swimming in the deep end of the ocean in the enigmatic and provocative sign of Scorpio, make sure to do something nice for yourself. Whether buying a cute pair of shoes, driving to the countryside to bask in the beautiful foliage, or reading an exciting book. The celestial waves of Venus in Scorpio are bringing change, which means putting ourselves first. More importantly, becoming obsessed with ourselves because we are fabulous in our own unique ways.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940839.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I caught up with celebrity and editorial makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/?hl=en"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> in L.A. while she was in glam-tour mode with Dua Lipa, and we went deep on career longevity, the internet’s role in her rise, and why her namesake line, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-hyper-shine-high-lite-kit-review"">KJH Brand</a>, is built to teach—not just “trend.”</p>



<p>When I asked how posting changed her bookings, Katie didn’t hesitate. Early on, when legacy shoots felt out of reach, she treated her feed like a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/224876/katie-jane-hughes-makeup-artist-instagram-interview"">living portfolio</a>. “My page became my editorial,” she told me, a place to set her own brief, show technique, and get discovered by celebrity teams. She still swears by artists sharing work on themselves; it demystifies the process for clients and doubles as a lookbook they can point to on set.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Instagram became my editorial.”</p><cite>kATIE JANE HUGHES</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Teaching-first beauty (and the case against heavy primer)</h2>



<p>If you follow Katie, you know the mantra: <strong>skin should look like skin</strong>, even with coverage and color. One of my favorite corrections she made to my routine is simple brushwork: <strong>press and tap</strong> product in instead of swiping it around. And while she’s not anti-primer, Katie believes “priming starts with skincare,” emphasizing the importance of cleanser, moisturizer, and smart layering over extra steps.</p>



<h2>Why she built KJH Brand</h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940847.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I asked what pushed her to create a line when her career was already thriving. Her answer: <strong>Education</strong>. Every formula is designed to be teachable and multi-use, with adjustable application for different skin types. Her <a href=""https://kjhbrand.com/products/soft-smudge-lip-cheek?variant=49496738627895"">Soft Smudge Blush</a> (I love the shade Soft Raisin) took years to perfect—it gives that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">diffused, powdery-meets-creamy payoff</a> that stays put and doubles on lips with a balm or serum. She also let me play with <strong>Precision</strong> micro-contour crayons for underpainting eyes and lips, plus a <strong>clear brow gel</strong> that she describes, simply, as “a damn good brow gel”, no gimmicks, just hold and flexibility.</p>



<h2>Inclusive shade thinking, from deep to fair</h2>



<p>We talked shade development, and I loved her philosophy: <strong>start deeper and work to fair</strong>. “If it works on melanated complexions, you can always shear it down,” Katie said, pushing brands to build equity into product design—not tack it on at the end. Her PD process includes testing across tones and tapping makeup artists of color on the core team.</p>



<h2>Retail dreams, startup reality</h2>



<p>KJH Brand is self-funded so far, and Katie’s considering <strong>Sephora</strong> for 2026—whether to debut on a smaller discovery shelf or go big with a full bay that tells the brand story. It’s thrilling and terrifying, she admitted; beauty ops mean long lead times, lots of POs, and real capital discipline. Her husband, <strong>Tarek</strong>, runs the finance side. As founders, they’re learning to set boundaries, take 15-minute walks, and communicate like a true startup.</p>





<h2>Getting over color fear</h2>



<p>Katie wants more of us playing with color—<strong>starting small</strong>. Try a mossy green or rust liner, a single wash of berry on the lid, or a taupe-y contour crayon as a subtle lip overliner (“aim for your <em>volume</em> lip line, not just the pigmented border”). And her reminder I cosign: it’s makeup. It washes off.</p>



<h2>What’s exciting her right now</h2>



<p>We swapped innovation picks during our chat.
