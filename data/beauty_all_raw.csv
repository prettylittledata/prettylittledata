Each of its small-batch, handmade floral pieces feels like it belongs in a cottagecore period drama. Black Puerto Rican designer Mikaela Greene describes her heart locket necklaces, bracelets, and watches as “wearable nature,” because she handpicks flowers from farms across the country, dries or presses them, and transforms them into timeless pieces that tell stories of love, care, and connection. “I ultimately want [people who wear my jewelry] to feel love,” she says. “That really is the heart of everything I make. I’ve always been a lover girl, so creating something that helps people express care, connection, and emotion feels so fulfilling.” For instance, wearing Esperanza, a stainless-steel heart locket filled with preserved flower petals, is a beautiful way to hold and celebrate your loves.<br /><br /><strong>Greene is Gold</strong> Greene is Gold's Esperanza Heart Locket Necklace, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greeneisgold.com%2Fproduct-page%2Fesperanza-2"">Greene is Gold</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1102"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1668&amp;height=1102&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=834:551"" width=""1668"" /><figcaption><strong>Luni</strong><br /><br />Lorenia Henriquez’s jewelry brand <a href=""https://luni.style/"">Luni</a> is a modern expression of magic and heritage.

<p>Few things get under my skin like psyching myself up to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/washing-hair-after-exercise-workout"">wash my hair</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-drying-vs-blow-drying-hair-damage"">blow-drying</a> it with painstaking precision, only for it to look — and feel — just as oily as before. You know the frustration, and it seems countless others do, too. </p>



<p>On TikTok, the queries “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/why-is-my-hair-greasy-all-of-a-sudden-after-i-wash"">Why is my hair greasy all of a sudden after a wash?</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/discover/why-is-my-hair-greasy-underneath-after-washing"">Why is my hair greasy underneath after washing?</a>” serve up hundreds of videos with thousands of views, likes, and comments. It’s quite a common conundrum. Suppose you’re doing everything right, like double cleansing your scalp, being sparing with hair oil, and not touching your hair as much throughout the day. Why, then, does your hair never feel clean? </p>

<h2>Why does my hair look oily right after I’ve washed it?</h2>



<p>Interestingly, Kingsley points out that your hair texture can impact how oily your scalp is. “Those with finer hair tend to have more hairs per centimeter on their head [compared to] those with thicker, coarser, or coiled hair textures, and therefore, they have more oil glands producing more sebum,” she explains. This, adds Kingsley, is why fine hair often becomes oily faster.</p>



<p>With genetics out of the way, there are a handful of other reasons why your hair might look and feel oily even after you’ve washed it: “Firstly, not washing your hair thoroughly to properly cleanse away oils, product build-up, and pollution can leave your scalp feeling dirtier,” says Kingsley. </p>



<p>She believes that there’s only one correct way to wash your hair: “Wet the hair fully, [apply] shampoo, and clean the scalp thoroughly for one minute. Then [repeat the step], rinse with water, and apply a conditioner to the ends before rinsing again.” As a rule of thumb, Kingsley says that massaging shampoo into your scalp should take a full 60 seconds — no less. </p>

<h2>Can you train your hair to become less oily?</h2>



<p>Contrary to popular belief, you can’t <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-training-tiktok-trend"">“train” your hair</a> to become less oily by reducing the amount you wash it. “There are no pros to <em>not</em> washing your hair regularly,” says Kingsley. “You wouldn’t leave more than three days between washing your face, and you likely wouldn’t wear the same outfit more than a few times before washing it. Apply the same thinking to your hair and scalp,” she says. </p>



<p>Infrequent shampooing can also contribute to scalp problems, says Kingsley. “It leaves excess oils sitting on your scalp, and certain yeasts called malassezia thrive in an oily environment. When these yeasts overgrow, your scalp can become flaky and irritated.”</p>



<h2>When should you use a clarifying shampoo?</h2>



<p>The type of shampoo you use matters, though. Kingsley says it’s imperative to choose a product suited to your hair texture so that it provides the right level of cleansing and moisturizing ingredients — and doesn’t weigh your hair down. Those with fine hair might like to opt for a ‘volumizing’ or ‘thickening’ shampoo, which will clean your hair and scalp without leaving behind a heavy feeling, suggests Kingsley.

<p>If your hair is thick, curly, or coily, consider something packed with hydrating and moisturizing agents like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP455861"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OUAI Thick Hair Shampoo</a>, with panthenol and shea butter, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP475150"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Hydration Shampoo</a>, with aloe and honey, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP513301"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fenty Beauty The Rich One Moisture Repair Shampoo</a>, with plant oils and strengthening amino acids.</p>





<p>As long as you’re washing your hair thoroughly as per Kingsley’s advice, you shouldn’t need to enlist a clarifying shampoo every time. But Dobson says that using one every one to two weeks is helpful to remove product build-up, which she says is one of the biggest culprits for making hair appear unclean: “If you’re using styling creams and oils too often, they can leave behind a residue that weighs your hair down and causes it to look greasy,” she says. </p>



<p>Kingsley suggests shampooing twice, using something with the ingredient lauryl betaine, which cleanses deeply without irritating. Try <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us/p/swell-shampoo/600g"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush Swell Shampoo, $48</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flovenoughty.com%2Fproducts%2Fpumped-up-volumizing-shampoo"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Noughty Pumped Up Shampoo, $11.99</a>.</p>





<h2>Does conditioner make hair look oily or dirty?</h2>



<p>Assuming you’ve switched up your shampoo routine, your next port of call is rethinking your conditioner, says Dobson: “A conditioner can also be an element of your routine that’s making your hair look greasy,” she says. Conditioners that boast ingredients like moisturizing shea butter, nourishing coconut oil, or shine-enhancing silicones are beneficial for thicker, drier hair, but Dobson says that they can be too heavy for other hair types. “If you have finer hair, a lightweight conditioner — free from silicones — or even just using a leave-in spray post-shower, could be a better option,” says Dobson.</p>



<p>Exactly <em>where</em> you apply your conditioner matters, too: “Do so from the mid-lengths [downwards] rather than directly on your scalp, as it can lead to product build-up,” says Dobson. Kingsley agrees: “To avoid heaviness at the roots, keep conditioner away from the scalp,” she says. “Use it on the lengths and ends of your hair only.” Just be sure you’re rinsing it out properly: “Sometimes people rush this step, which leaves behind traces of product that make your hair look dull and greasy,” says Dobson. Like massaging in your shampoo, aim for a full minute when rinsing away the conditioner. </p>



<h2>Can air-drying your hair make it oily? </h2>



<p>Dobson believes that allowing your hair to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/air-drying-sleeping-wet-hair-mold"">air-dry naturally</a> is not only potentially damaging (this is because hair is at its most fragile and prone to breakage when wet), but it could be a reason why it appears oilier than usual: “When you blow-dry your hair, it disperses the natural oils through the root to tip — and closes the hair cuticle,” she explains. </p>



<p>Kingsley agrees that a gentle blowdry can help smooth down the hair cuticle, making hair more sleek and minimizing tangles. In fact, she prefers not leaving the scalp damp for long periods — and especially not overnight. “[An oil-rich], humid environment can encourage the overgrowth of the yeasts that live naturally on our scalps, potentially triggering dandruff,” says Kingsley. </p>



<p>In other words, there are benefits to blow-drying — even rough-drying — your hair. Just be aware of the temperature: “Excessive heat styling can cause the hair to become brittle and more prone to breakage,” says Kingsley, “so remember to keep the heat setting on medium or low.” She also advises heat protection, whether that’s a lightweight spray for those with fine hair or a moisturizing leave-in product for thicker lengths. </p>

<h2>Will a scalp toner make your hair less oily?</h2>



<p>Besides washing your hair regularly (with the right shampoo for your hair type), and using conditioner sparingly, Kingsley says that topical toners and serums can help to balance the scalp and minimize oil production. She suggests <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philipkingsley.com%2Fphilip-kingsley-flaky-itchy-scalp-toner-250ml.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Philip Kingsley’s Flaky/Itchy Anti-Dandruff Scalp Toner</a>, with the star ingredient piroctone olamine, which soothes scalp irritation and targets the yeast that causes dandruff. If you use lots of styling products, including dry shampoo, hair oil,s or a particularly thick conditioner or hair mask, consider <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2FP480636"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Scalp Treatment</a>, with exfoliating salicylic acid to gently chip away at dead skin, oil, and product build-up, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.alpha-h.com%2Fproducts%2Fhealthy-scalp-exfoliating-treatment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alpha-H Healthy Hair Exfoliating Treatment</a>, with salicylic and lactic acid to reduce oil and flakes. </p>



<p>On the topic of styling products, it’s easy to go overboard. Start with a small amount and gradually add more if you think your hair needs it.  </p>





<h2>Will a shower filter make hair less oily?</h2>



<p>Lastly, while there is little scientific research to suggest that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/shower-water-filter-skin-hair-benefits"">shower filters</a> are beneficial to prevent oily hair, Dobson believes that your water quality is an important factor in how hair looks after it has been washed: “Hard water contains a high amount of minerals, which often build up on your scalp and make hair feel heavy or look oily, and a shower filter can help with this,” she says.</p>





<p>If you’re intrigued, try the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhelloklean.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fhello-klean-shower-filter%3Fvariant%3D41819539767401"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hello Klean Shower Filter 2.0</a>, which reduces chlorine and heavy metals, or if you have a little more to spend, the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fact-acre-showerhead-filter%2F14910052%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Act+Acre Showerhead Filter</a>, which makes hard water softer.</p>

<p>If I lost <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">my makeup bag</a> today, the first thing I’d replace would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"">my mascara</a>. Even a single slick makes me feel awake and ready to take on the day. It’s why my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">R29 Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a> always includes one. In 2024, it was the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvoluminous-panorama-washable-mascara-pimprod2042577%3Fsku%3D2617241"">L’Oréal Paris Panorama Mascara</a>, and while I won’t reveal this year’s winner just yet, you can bet it’s even better. But my favorite skincare brand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us"">The Ordinary</a>, might have just convinced me to quit mascara altogether thanks to its latest launch: the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a>.</p>



<h2>What does The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher do, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher</a> is a clear, waterless gel designed to coat every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners, lifting and holding your curl for longer. If your lashes tend to fall flat after curling, think of this as invisible scaffolding. Not only does it help to keep your curl in place, but it also gives lashes a natural, glossy finish, like you’re wearing mascara — all without smudges or flakes.</p>



<p>A handful of clever ingredients make it all work. Without getting too technical, you’ll find non-irritating polymers — or film formers — like butylene, ethylene, and dimethicone copolymers, all approved for use around the eyes. They help the gel cling to lashes, provide all-day support for curls, and keep lashes flexible and comfortable, rather than brittle or caked in product. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948337.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lash Curl Finisher, $9.90</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948127.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Beyond the film formers, you’ll also spot ingredients that have become staples in your skincare routine. Squalane softens and conditions lash hairs and the surrounding skin, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">while glycerin</a> deeply moisturizes. Though the main effect is cosmetic, mimicking the effects of an expensive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-lash-lift-review"">lash lift</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">luxury mascara</a>, it also doubles as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11243440/keratin-lash-lift-tint-review"">lash treatment</a>.</p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, and is it any good?</h2>



<p>I use the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a> just like mascara. First, I curl my lashes with my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyelash-curler-P244437"">Shiseido Eyelash Curler</a> (an imperative step, according to The Ordinary), then I apply it in coats. But make no mistake: this isn’t like the clear mascaras of the ’00s that did nothing but make lashes feel rock hard. This actually makes them look thicker thanks to the lustrous sheen it leaves behind. It’s not quite a wet look, but it’s not invisible, either. If you touch your lashes, they feel slightly tacky before drying — and it’s this texture that keeps them upright, like your curled lashes are preserved (in a gentle way). </p>



<p>You might’ve seen the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">Vaseline lash lift hack</a> on TikTok, where people use petroleum jelly instead of mascara for a no-makeup lash look. <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">I’ve tried it myself</a>, and it works well, but because Vaseline is so soft, it keeps lashes almost wet. The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, on the other hand, dries down, making it more transfer-proof than petroleum jelly.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948339.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>The curved brush also makes it easier to capture each lash, and I’m convinced that both the shape and thickness of the wand give my curls an extra boost, keeping them perky. Honestly, a couple of coats of this is infinitely better at thickening my lashes than a single coat of mascara. Of course, I have dark lashes, so I’m not exactly certain how it would perform on blondes or redheads, but the product does make them appear darker — like I’m wearing black mascara.</p>



<p>My lashes stay curled — with a very slight drop, as is natural — until I remove the product at the end of the day. I just use a cleansing balm, but micellar water or a foaming cleanser works just as well, since the product doesn’t need much effort to dissolve — nothing like the scrubbing mascara can require. </p>



<p>While The Ordinary doesn’t specifically recommend this use, I run the wand through my brows, too, and it works just as brilliantly as a brow gel, keeping my thick hairs perfectly in place.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. And it’s the kind I can only say now, in my thirties, after <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/motherhood-experiences"">having a child</a> and after finding and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latinas-redefining-marriage-traditions"">marrying</a> an incredible man: I love my husband. I love our life. And I love our daughter. But if we ever divorced, I would never get married again.</p>



<p>It’s not because marriage has failed me. Javy and I met during the middle of the pandemic (remember 2020?) on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">Latino dating app Chispa</a>, and we’ve been attached ever since. We dated for six months before moving in together, and we got married in Las Vegas in 2023, when I was already three months pregnant. He’s a great partner and father. He works two full-time jobs, and still teaches our daughter how to count in Spanish and helps out during bath time. It truly feels like I’ve found a diamond in the rough. </p>



<p>But five years later, I now understand what the real <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/this-is-the-surprising-cost-of-being-in-a-relationship"">cost of partnership</a> looks like and what marriage asks for. And if I ever had to rebuild my life from scratch, I simply would not hand all of that over to someone else again.</p>



<p>Marriage, even the good kind, demands things from women that it doesn’t equally demand from men. No, I don’t mean the often-physical labor of keeping a house or raising a family, though, according to the <a href=""https://thegepi.org/the-free-time-gender-gap/"">Gender Equity Policy Institute</a>, heterosexual women perform twice the amount of childcare and household work as their male counterparts<em>. </em>But for many women, that can be the tip of the invisible labor iceberg: How you plan your day with someone else’s schedule factored in and how you approach bills and major life decisions — it all changes with another autonomous person’s thoughts, hopes, and limitations thrown into the mix. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/staying-sane-inside-insanity/202204/is-marriage-a-bad-deal-for-women?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Psychology Today</a> revealed that women end marriages not only because of abuse or infidelity, but also because “the relationship is no longer worth the sacrifices required of them.” Turns out, the emotional labor, lack of empathy from partners, and unequal effort are just some of the reasons many women walk away.<em> </em></p>



<p>Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally. For generations, women have swallowed our needs, softened our ambitions, and built our identities around care: care for our partners, our home, our children, and everyone else before us. And for Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”<em> </em>isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would. And it’s not because we’re weak but rather because the world still subconsciously expects it, praises it, and labels anything less as selfish.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I went into marriage thinking I understood partnership, but once the cake was eaten and the honeymoon was over, I realized how much of my life had become work to keep <em>our lives</em> functioning. The calendar-keeping, the appointments, the remembering, the meal-planning, and the million invisible decisions that keep a household running — it all fell on me by default. I carried it convincing myself it was normal and every partnership goes through this. And part of that came from my culture. I married a loving, devoted Latino man who was raised in a world where men are applauded for “helping.” And I’m a Latina raised with the same script: be strong, but also be accommodating. Build a life, but also carry everyone else’s.</p>



<p>This isn’t how things are for us anymore. Eventually, we talked it over and agreed that we’re not continuing that cycle. Not in our marriage and not for our daughter. And slowly, things shifted. Not perfectly, but intentionally. Today, he carries his share of both the parenting and day-to-day responsibilities.</p>



<p>“Marriage isn’t always 50/50,” <a href=""https://www.waytoknowthyself.com"">Stella Barrutia, LCSW,</a> a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in Chicago, tells Refinery29 Somos. “Some days, it’s 80/20. Other days, it’s 20/80. When the foundation is truly love and respect, the balance will always realign. The challenge is that many women are taught, implicitly or explicitly, that once they’re married, they must continue doing everything for themselves — and now also for their husbands and children.”</p>



<p>Barrutia, whose work is bicultural and includes a focus on Latine experiences, added that “honest conversations about partnership, roles, ambitions, and expectations are absolutely essential” when it comes to choosing a life partner. In other words, the day-to-day setup of marriage and partnership can be imperfect while the relationship itself is deeply loving. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>My critique is of the structure, not with the man I chose. Javy is a great partner and a great father, and I’m so grateful for him. He fully supports my career and business, cares for our family to make sure we never go without, and shows up when life gets heavy. He brings steadiness into our lives. Just last week, after a 24-hour shift at the firehouse, he walked in, took our baby out of her crib when she woke up at 7 a.m., and fed her breakfast, did the whole routine, and let me sleep without ever making it seem like a favor.</p>



<p>But marriage as an institution? It’s complicated and, based on current trends, is becoming outdated.</p>



<p>Here’s the reality: Americans are <a href=""https://usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting married way less</a> and much later than previous generations. The marriage rate in the U.S. has dropped by more than 50% since the early 1900s, and only about 1 in 5 people in their mid-20s today has ever been married, the lowest level ever recorded. People of all genders aren’t rushing down the aisle anymore, and instead are taking their time, building careers, and figuring out who they are before they sign up for that kind of commitment.</p>



<p>And the myth that marriage is the only path to stability? Well, that’s gone, too. Latinas, and women in general, are now earning <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/15/how-latinas-educational-and-economic-situation-has-changed-in-the-last-two-decades/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">more college degrees</a> than men, and we’re showing up in spaces our mothers and abuelas could only dream about. Financial independence has shifted the power dynamic, too. And to add to that, women are delaying motherhood (I had my first baby at 31), choosing different family structures, and rejecting the idea that being a wife or a mother has to define your entire identity. </p>



<p>Many of us grew up watching our mothers carry the emotional load, the childcare, the cooking, everything — and now we’re refusing to recreate what drained the women before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs. So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.”</p><cite>Stella Barrutia, LCSW</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs,” Barrutia notes. “So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.” </p>



<p>Barrutia continues: “When women ask, ‘Can I be ambitious and married?’ they’re really asking, ‘Is there room for all of me here? Healthy partnership answers that with a yes. But culturally, many haven’t seen that model reflected back to them.”</p>



<p>True, these ambitions can feel a little less isolating when you have a partner cheering you on. Javy supports my dreams in the ways that actually matter. When work gets intense, he picks up what I can’t. When I’m building <a href=""http://themamicollective.com"">The Mami Collective,</a> he steps in with childcare, dinner, and whatever else needs to be done. He asks how he can help before I say I’m overwhelmed. He celebrates my wins with me. He makes space for my goals. And, most importantly, he shares the invisible load so it’s not all on me. Because that’s partnership: not perfect, not 50/50, just two people choosing to show up for each other.</p>



<p>Yet, even still, it often feels like the contours of marriage are constrained by outdated and ever-present expectations. </p>



<p>When writer Chanté Joseph posed the question <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/is-having-a-boyfriend-embarrassing-now"">“Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?” </a>for <em>Vogue</em> in October, I noticed something interesting in the Instagram comments and the surrounding discourse. By and large, respondents echoed the same sentiment: I love my partner, but sometimes I fantasize about the freedom I’d have if I didn’t have to factor someone else into every corner of my life. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Not because we want our partners gone, but because we want ourselves back. We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.</p>



<p>So when I say I wouldn’t get married again, I’m not saying that I’m rushing to divorce my husband. In fact, when I told him I wouldn’t get married again, he didn’t spiral. He lifted his eyebrows and said, “Honestly? I get it.” We’ve talked about how marriage hits differently for women and how the mental load and expectations pile up even in the healthiest partnerships. He knows I love him; he also knows the institution asks more of me than it ever will of him. His reaction wasn’t defensive. It was honest, a little uncomfortable, and very, “Yeah, you’re not wrong.”</p>



<p>I’m not married because of fear, tradition, or cultural pressure. I’m in it because I choose to be. Because this specific partnership works for me. Because the love and respect are mutual and because my husband makes the sacrifices with me, not just for him.</p>



<p>But if the water were to rise and hell were to freeze over, I wouldn’t do it over again. Not the white dress, not the bridal shower, not the honeymoon. I’m not interested in further contributing to a narrative in which a Latina’s value is tied to having a partner. I’ve worked my butt off to build my life, career, and identity. I don’t need to rebuild it all over again.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This clarity can be powerful. It helps me show up intentionally in my marriage today — not because I fear divorce, but because I understand what marriage takes from the both of us. A good marriage takes honest conversations about the hard things, even when they’re uncomfortable. And it takes partners choosing effort and accountability on purpose, because the relationship deserves it.</p>



<p>My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough. I’d want to keep the version of me that survived. The woman who rebuilt her identity not as a wife or mother, but as herself.</p>



<p>On <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8UrKksq/"">TikTok</a>, many women have expressed feeling similarly. “I love my husband, but marriage still asks more of me than it does of him,” Diana Lopez, a 34-year-old Mexican-American mother of two based in Chicago, said. “I don’t want out, I just want room to breathe, to grow, and to still be my own person. Wanting yourself back isn’t a threat to your relationship — it’s a sign you’re finally paying attention to what you need.”</p>



<p>And why is that? Because we’re finally being honest about the price of partnership, even when it’s good.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-french-nails-manicure-trend"">Glass nails</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"">cat-eye textures</a> have been huge this year, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DCpFxs2u3ws/"">Aistė Haas’</a> interpretation of the trend feels special enough for New Year’s Eve. The deep color palette means the finish doesn’t feel too OTT, but you could mix-and-match the shades depending on which outfit you’re wearing.</p>
