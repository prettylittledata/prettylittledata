When the leaves have left the trees, the air turns cold and misty, and the temperature stays 50 degrees (or below), there’s only one thing to do. Tuck yourself under a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-season-essentials-editors-picks"">toasty blanket</a> for as long as socially acceptable with a collection of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">comfort movies</a> right by your side.<br /><br />There’s no shortage of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/217808/christmas-movie-tropes"">good Christmas films</a>. Classics like <em>Elf </em>or <em>Rudolph: Red Nose Reindeer </em>are perfect comedies and low-stakes dramas to watch with your friends and families. But they’re not the most snug and soul-warming flicks out there. Yes, they’re all about the holiday cheer (which is an element of coziness), but they’re more funny and entertaining than anything. <br /><br />No, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/07/163987/best-feel-good-movies"">perfect cozy film</a> has a story that’ll tug at your heartstrings but will also make you ugly laugh. <br /><br />To ease your quest for the coziest film, we searched far and wide (aka the libraries of most major streaming services) for the best cozy movies the internet has to offer this holiday season. Some are new, some are oldies but goodies; some have absolutely nothing to do with the holidays at all. Regardless, these are the most heartwarming films to watch by yourself (or with friends and family) on the sofa by the crackling fire with a cup of cocoa and a tray of Snickerdoodles.  Merry streaming.  <figure><figcaption><strong><em><h2>The Wrong Paris (2025)</h2></em></strong><em>The Wrong Paris</em> makes for the ultimate comfort movie when you’re over holiday movies but still want that feel-good buzz. On the surface, it’s a breezy Netflix rom-com about Dawn (Miranda Cosgrove), an aspiring artist who joins a Bachelor-style reality show thinking she’s headed to Paris, France — only to land in Paris, Texas instead, thanks to an outrageous producer twist. What follows is a lighthearted mix of reality-show antics, cowboy charm (hello, Trey, played by Pierson Fodé), and the kind of predictable but satisfying romantic beats that make you sigh with relief rather than eye-roll with exhaustion.<br /><br /><strong>Stream it on <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81700163"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Netflix</a></strong>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><strong><em>The Best Man Holiday</em> (2013)</strong></h2><br /> <br />A rare sequel that’s better than the original, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sanaa-lathan-interview"">The Best Man Holiday</a> </em>is a must-watch every holiday season (though, we argue it’s a great film to watch all year round). Similar to its predecessor, it follows a group of college friends gathering again, this time for the holidays. But unlike the first film where secrets stayed hidden and buried, everything is out in the open this go-around and past hurts and old resentments threaten the holiday cheer. Watch this for the laughs, the cries, and the fuzzy feels. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.7f4b0fc9-c7e1-4ce2-8fd9-1f0239de8d27?autoplay=0&amp;ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Home Alone (1990)</em></h2><br /><br />John Hughes, the mind behind <em>Ferris Buller’s Day Off</em>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/breakfast-club-30th-anniversary"">The Breakfast Club</a></em>, <em>Pretty in Pin</em>k, etc., also did big with this 1990 flick. The classic holiday movie, which made Macaulay Culkin’s scream an iconic staple imitated by kids everywhere, may be more than 30 years old, but you’ll never get tired of it because it has *literally* everything you want from a cozy film. Humor (who else cracks up at Kevin’s weird but also effective traps against the robbers), not-so-serious drama, and a happy ending.

There’s something nostalgic about watching little kids in their onesies, drinking cocoa, anxious to meet Saint Nick. It makes you think of simpler times, when you used to be that age full of wonder, innocence, and excitement. <br /><br /><strong>Stream it on </strong><a href=""https://www.max.com/movies/f98c234d-660a-417e-9732-0d920d4b40f8""><strong>Max</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=""https://www.hulu.com/watch/cfaafa9b-a8e0-4d0a-88bd-c3fecfbf695b""><strong>Hulu</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.71df62ca-d7a1-4626-aa07-27836d37e8d9""><strong>Prime Video</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Last Holiday (2006) </em></h2><br /><br />Who’d thought a film about a terminally ill woman jet-setting to Europe for one last hoorah would be one of the coziest films ever? (Lol, not us.) Sure, the movie’s synopsis doesn’t give warm and fuzzy vibes, but thanks to Queen Latifah’s performance as Georgia Byrd, and a witty screenplay, <em>Last Holiday</em> is a charming and sentimental tale about taking control of your own destiny and living life to its fullest.

In this 1989 film starring rom-com queen Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, we follow the titular Harry and Sally over a decade as they bounce from strangers to friends to enemies (it’s complicated, okay??) and finally lovers.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828686.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-planners"">2026 is the money year</a> many of us have been preparing for without even realizing it. In numerology, 2026 adds up to 1, the number of beginnings, boldness, and unfiltered potential. And because it carries the purity of initiation, it asks us to step into the frontier of our lives with intention. Layer that with the fact that 2026 is the Year of the Fire Horse in Chinese astrology, and suddenly the collective energy becomes unmistakable. Fire Horse years do not whisper… they gallop. They set the air ablaze with courage, momentum, and manifestation. So financially this means we aren’t thinking small in 2026. We’re thinking fast, wide, brave, and new.</p>



<p>Astrologically, this rebirth is echoed by Saturn and Neptune both entering Aries, the first sign of the zodiac. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, structure, and mastery, joins Neptune, the planet of dreams, intuition, and surrender. Aries is the flame that says “go,” even when you’re shaking. So we enter a year where dreams demand structure… and structure demands imagination. Fire and faith are learning to coexist. We’re collectively remembering that discipline is sacred, that courage is spiritual, and that starting over is a portal, not a punishment. This is a year of initiation that doesn’t wait for your confidence before giving you the opportunity. It gives you the opportunity so your confidence can rise to meet it.</p>



<p>By contrast, 2025 was the Year of the Snake, a numerology 9 year, and a cycle of closures, purging, and spiritual composting. Many of us spent 2025 confronting the roots of our money stories… the fears we inherited, the habits we unconsciously upheld, the emotional knots tied to worth, earning, and receiving. We learned that money isn’t just currency, it’s spiritual energy… a mirror of our subconscious relationship with safety, sovereignty, and expansion. 2025 loosened the soil. It forced us to acknowledge where we shrink, where we self-abandon, and where we avoid our deepest desires. Those realizations were not meant to break us. They were meant to prepare us.</p>



<p>Now, in 2026, the universe says: apply it. This is a year of experimentation, risk-taking, courage, and embodied learning. The best way to integrate what we healed in 2025 is to <em>become</em> the version of ourselves we kept envisioning. Many of us will feel the pull toward entrepreneurship or creative independence — not out of pressure, but out of alignment. Jupiter’s entrance into Leo (on June 30th) and the ascent of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a> until 2044 is accelerating this shift. Pluto transforms whatever it touches, and Aquarius rules innovation, digital futures, alternative paths, and self-liberation. I predicted last year that we’d collectively turn toward entrepreneurship, and now we’re entering the phase where that prediction becomes undeniable.</p>



<p>And the energy intensifies: Saturn and Neptune in Aries form harmonious aspects to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">Pluto in Aquarius</a>, helping us translate ideas into systems, visions into strategies. Then in July 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, creating a rare triad of Fire and Air that electrifies communication, creativity, and financial flow. Suddenly money comes more easily from simply being yourself: from speaking your truth, showcasing your gifts, sharing your weird, unfiltered magic with the world. Throat chakras open, creative channels widen, and opportunities meet you halfway. But this acceleration comes with a challenge: the temptation to move too fast, burn too quickly, and forget the foundations needed to sustain your success.</p>



<p>Because with all this Fire and Air dominating the cosmos in 2026, many of us will feel the urge to leap without looking: to quit the job, impulsively start the business, launch the product, change the career, monetize the art, reinvent every aspect of our lives overnight. And while that instinct is part of the collective medicine, it only works if it’s paired with grounding. True wealth is built through rhythm, through containers, through systems that can hold your expansion. Your task this year isn’t just to dream or to leap; it’s to <em>architect</em>. To create sustainable frameworks for your passion. To invest in the future self you’re becoming through education, mentorship, coaching, real estate, stocks, creative tools, business infrastructure, or values-aligned ventures. Every investment in 2026 echoes for the next decade.</p>



<p>This year’s eclipses deepen the storyline with fated financial and professional turning points. The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius (28°) may bring a major opportunity to join or build community. Your digital presence might expand. Your work may reach more people. Yet because it squares Uranus in Taurus, you’ll need to check in with your values and avoid spaces that don’t fully resonate. Then on March 3rd, the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo pushes you out of your comfort zone professionally, revealing where you’ve been settling, playing small, or overworking. Many will quit jobs, request raises, restructure workflows, or choose rest to reclaim balance.</p>



<p>Later in the year, the August 12th Total Solar Eclipse in Leo arrives as a creative rebirth, especially potent for artists, performers, and entrepreneurs. This is the moment to launch, to reveal, to be seen. And finally, the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces delivers emotional, intuitive, serendipitous blessings… the kind of blessings that feel like miracles. This is where dreams break through the material realm.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most important theme of 2026 is this: authenticity becomes currency. Pluto in Aquarius and Uranus in Gemini harmonize throughout the second half of the year, inviting us to embrace our eccentricities, our quirks, our rare inner genius. The world is saturated with imitation. What people crave — and pay for — is truth. Your weirdness is your wealth. Your originality is your open door. This is the year where posting that unfiltered IG dump, sharing the opinion no one else dares to say, or releasing the art only you could create becomes the catalyst for financial and spiritual expansion. When you stop hiding your true self, the opportunities meant for your true self finally find you.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828720.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aries, 2026 is literally <em>your</em> era. Like, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11280107/main-character-trend-tiktok-aesthetic-lifestyle"">main-character-walks-in</a>-and-the-crowd-goes-silent energy. With Saturn and Neptune both in your sign, you’re stepping into a cosmic bootcamp that’s half discipline, half dream alchemy. Saturn, the planet of responsibility, is teaching you how to build structures that actually protect your fire instead of dimming it. Neptune, the planet of compassion and creativity, is reminding you that money comes when your heart is in the room. The secret to your financial growth this year is the fusion: fun and consistency.</p>



<p>If your creativity felt stale or if your finances dipped last year, it wasn’t because you lost your magic — you were in spiritual hibernation, healing things nobody saw. Now Saturn wants you to create a rhythm, a workflow, a “don’t-burn-yourself-out-this-time” container. And Neptune wants you to actually enjoy what you’re building. Think: turning your passion project into a real business, but doing it in a way that feels like play. Aries is discovering that “grown-up money” doesn’t have to feel boring… it can feel like freedom.</p>



<p>Starting July 7th, Uranus in Taurus leaves your financial sector (since 2018 it was giving “one month I’m up, next month I’m down, next month I’m manifesting rent from thin air”), and enters Gemini, your communication zone. Translation: your <em>voice</em> becomes a revenue stream. The more you speak, write, teach, post, present, or share your unfiltered Aries takes… the more money finds you. This is “launch the Substack,” “start the podcast with your bestie,” “post that TikTok even if your hair isn’t ‘ready’,” “finally write the ebook,” and “accept that panel invitation you think you’re not qualified for.” Uranus in Gemini is literally begging you to diversify your income like a bold entrepreneur. You’re suddenly generating ideas faster than you can type them. And the best part? People actually listen. Your words hit, your humor lands, and your authenticity magnetizes opportunities you used to pray for. This is the year where an Aries rant goes viral and changes your life.</p>



<p>The plot thickens on March 3rd with the Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, activating your work, routine, and health sector. This eclipse is basically your cosmic intervention. Something in your day-to-day workflow has been draining you… unhealthy pacing, lack of boundaries, doing everything alone, micromanaging every detail, eating lunch at 4pm because “you forgot” (Aries… <em>please</em>).</p>



<p>The eclipse pulls the curtain back and forces you to see what you’ve outgrown. It may look like quitting a job that’s low-key been shrinking your spirit, delegating tasks you’ve  been gatekeeping, switching industries, taking a sabbatical, or simply restructuring your routine so you’re not sprinting through your life every day. It’s uncomfortable but liberating, and it clears the path for actual abundance. Then the August 12th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo enters like the grand finale of a Beyoncé concert, activating your creativity, your romance, your fame sector. Something you create within six months of this eclipse could skyrocket your visibility. A passion project becomes a revenue stream. A hobby becomes a brand. A “just for fun” idea becomes the thing that makes everyone say, “Wait… you did THAT?”</p>



<p>And through all of this, remember: you’ve earned this era. Saturn and Neptune spent years in your spirituality and closure sector, dragging you into self-reflection mode, forcing you to heal wounds you never had time to acknowledge. That wasn’t punishment… it was preparation. Now they’re in your sign saying, “Rise.”</p>



<p>Aries is one of the zodiac’s biggest winners in the Fire Horse year and the numerology One year. The universe is literally asking you to initiate the life you’ve been imagining, not in a reckless way, but in a <em>visionary warrior</em> way. You are the hero of your story in 2026, and money flows where courage meets consistency. When you stop playing small with your gifts and start structuring your brilliance, everything changes for the better. This is your year to build the foundation of a life that feels both prosperous and true. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828721.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Taurus, 2026 is the year the universe lovingly pushes you out of your comfort zone and into your calling. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries activating your spirituality and healing sector for the next two years (and Neptune for over a decade), your relationship to money becomes more soulful, more intuitive, and more values-driven. You’re realizing that your financial expansion is directly tied to your spiritual alignment. Many Tauruses will feel called toward work that heals, guides, restores, or uplifts, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/05/10982731/too-much-therapy"">whether that’s therapy</a>, astrology, Pilates teaching, Reiki, intuitive coaching, wellness work, or even starting a “soft-life” content platform rooted in emotional wisdom.</p>



<p>And if you’re already in these fields, Saturn blesses you with the discipline to structure your offerings, raise your rates, and stop apologizing for charging what your gifts are worth. Neptune meanwhile whispers: “It’s okay to be spiritual <em>and</em> well-paid.” And if you’re in a corporate path that feels spiritually dead, you may feel an unmistakable urge to leave — like your soul is tapping you on the shoulder saying… “We’re done here.”</p>



<p>And then comes the cosmic plot twist: Uranus finally leaves your sign in July after eight roller-coaster years that rocked your identity, finances, relationships, and stability. Many Tauruses went through job losses, career pivots, moves, breakups, breakthroughs, glow ups, and reinventions during Uranus in Taurus… the universe basically sent you through “unstable earth sign bootcamp.” But on July 7th, 2026, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your money and income sector, and suddenly the pressure eases. You start feeling… lighter. More curious. More open to experimenting with new streams of income.</p>



<p>Uranus prefers the airiness of Gemini, so this shift feels like the universe finally cutting you a break. BUT, the catch is: you cannot control your money flow the way you used to. Uranus in Gemini makes money feel like a game of cosmic ping-pong: ideas flying everywhere, inspiration hitting at random times, unexpected deposits, unexpected opportunities, unexpected collaborations. The more flexible you are, the more fun you have with it, the more wealthy you become. Taurus’ biggest challenge will be letting go of rigidity and letting your money breathe. Treat it like play, not punishment.</p>



<p>Financial blessings begin early, though, particularly around the Full Moon in Sagittarius on May 31st, which activates your wealth, investments, and shared resources sector. Something you initiated or dreamed about during Sagittarius Season 2025 could manifest in a major way. This is prime energy for payouts, inheritances, scholarships, royalties, business investments bearing fruit, or finally getting approved for something you’ve been waiting on. It’s also a good period for debt reduction or consolidation, financial healing, and calling in support from outside sources without shame.</p>



<p>Then, the August 8th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces lights up your community, technology, and networks sector, meaning one online moment could change everything. A post goes viral. A connection leads to funding. A collaboration expands your audience. A LinkedIn update brings job offers. Or you join a community that ends up opening doors you didn’t even know existed. This eclipse is loud about the importance of being seen and sharing your art, your wisdom, your story, your gifts — especially online.</p>



<p>And yes… all of this becomes so much easier once Uranus leaves your sign. The first half of 2026 still carries that “final exam” energy — the kind where the universe asks, “Did you learn how to adapt or nah?” But by the second half of the year, you genuinely feel like your head breaks above water for the first time in years. You’re calmer, clearer, more intuitive, and more confident in your worth. You stop clutching your money out of fear and finally begin circulating it with trust. You stop hiding your gifts and start monetizing them with integrity. And above all, you surrender your tight grip on control and let abundance come the way it wants to. 2026 is the year where Taurus finally exhales and says… “Wow. My time really has come.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828722.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Gemini… 2026 feels like someone finally opened the window and let the light pour back into your life. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">your friendship, networks</a>, and tech sector, you’re stepping into an era where your connections, your community, and your ability to “just show up and play” become your greatest financial assets. The professional fog of the past few years finally lifts. Saturn in Pisces had you second-guessing your purpose, doubting your abilities, and working behind the scenes in ways that didn’t always offer immediate results. Now Saturn in Aries gives you structure through collaboration, and Neptune gives you soul through community.</p>



<p>Your money this year is directly tied to networking, sharing your gifts publicly, being seen, and letting your natural charisma circulate. Healing modalities, community organizing, digital platforms, group projects, and social-media-based entrepreneurship explode for you. You’re not meant to do 2026 alone… your revenue streams literally expand through your relationships.</p>



<p>The first major breakthrough arrives around the February 17th Aquarius Solar Eclipse, lighting up your expansion, travel, and higher-learning sector. This is the eclipse that could put you on a plane, in a classroom, on a stage, or in an entirely different timezone. Whatever intentions you set around this eclipse — studying something new, launching a business, traveling for work, relocating, applying for visas, accepting opportunities abroad, pursuing entrepreneurship, enrolling in a certificate — will directly link to your income over the next six months. Think “international checks,” “global clients,” “remote work upgrades,” or “publishing something that reaches way more people than expected.”</p>



<p>You’re not meant to think small this year… Aquarius energy demands liberation. And then Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, unblocking money flows, dissolving limiting beliefs about earning, and helping you trust your value again. This is when you stop undercharging, under-selling, or underestimating yourself. Money begins moving again.</p>



<p>But the real spotlight moment arrives when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, lighting upyour communication sector and saying, “We can’t let you hide anymore.” Jupiter in Leo amplifies your voice, your humor, your content, your aesthetic, your intelligence, and your creative output. People notice you. They want to hear you speak, read your writing, buy your products, or engage with your work. Opportunities come from podcasts, panels, TikToks, Instagram reels, newsletters, courses, vlogs, workshops… basically anything that allows you to share your brain and your brilliance.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Cancer had you stacking coins behind the scenes. Jupiter in Leo puts you center stage. And it harmonizes beautifully with Gemini energy — so shining feels natural instead of forced. There’s also massive financial potential through media, publishing, presentations, collaborations, and anything that involves your voice or visibility. You are literally being asked to take up space.</p>



<p>The most powerful awakening arrives during the August 28th Partial Lunar Eclipse in Pisces, activating your career sector. This is the culmination of something you began six months prior, around the Pisces New Moon. And unlike the last few emotional Pisces eclipses, this one comes with clarity — thanks to the full moon being ruled by Jupiter in Leo (your communication sector) and Neptune in Aries (your tech and community sector). Your creative desires, your public image, and your community support suddenly click together like puzzle pieces. You may land a dream role, launch a major project, go viral, receive recognition in your industry, or pivot into a career that aligns with the childlike version of you who always knew what you were meant to do.</p>



<p>This eclipse can push you forward <em>even if you’re not ready</em>, because your soul is ready. The shadow of this year? Uranus in Gemini brings genius downloads, but also unpredictability. Your mind changes fast, your plans shift suddenly, and people may struggle to keep up. Your task is to check in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">with your intuition</a> before making promises or financial commitments. As long as you don’t over-promise, you’ll thrive. With the right balance of freedom plus consistency, 2026 becomes one of the most exciting and lucrative years Gemini has had in a long time.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828723.jpg?width=852&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=213%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Cancer, 2026 begins with the universe practically spoiling you. With Jupiter, the planet of luck and expansion, in your sign for the first six months, you’re walking around with a cosmic spotlight on your gifts. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Your intuition is sharper</a> than ever, and your money magnetism is off the charts. Anything rooted in your identity — your story, your culture, your softness, your nurturing, your humor, your aesthetic, your home — becomes a business opportunity. Home-based businesses thrive. Careers involving children, healing, cooking, interior design, real estate, food content, wellness, and lifestyle influencing thrive. If you’ve ever wanted to be a conscious influencer, write a book, launch a podcast, lead circles, teach something, or build a brand around the way <em>you</em> move through the world… this is the year. Because here’s the secret: your authenticity is your currency.</p>



<p>The more you let previously hidden parts of yourself express themselves, the more abundance arrives. Don’t overthink it. Share what you love and let people see you. Then, the plot twist: Saturn and Neptune join forces in Aries, activating your career sector for the next two years — and Neptune stays over a decade. This is huge. Saturn in Pisces had you drifting, daydreaming, doubting, waiting for “signs” or “perfect timing,” and often being too passive about your ambitions. But Saturn in Aries? That’s a whole new era. It’s saying, “You’re done playing small.” Neptune in Aries reawakens your childhood dreams about what you wanted to be. Saturn then gives you the discipline, structure, and stamina to <em>actually</em> pursue them. Leadership roles, public speaking, creative direction, entrepreneurship, management, becoming the face of something, stepping into authority you didn’t think you were ready for — all of this becomes available. You will feel seen in ways that feel both thrilling and a little uncomfortable. But uncomfortable doesn’t mean wrong. It means growth.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Uranus in Taurus continues shaking up your community, friendships, and technology sector until July 7th — which explains why networking, job applications, referrals, and social connections have felt inconsistent or unpredictable these past seven years. People drifted out. People appeared suddenly. Collaborations dissolved or transformed. When Uranus enters Gemini, your spirituality and subconscious sector awakens dramatically. You may uncover financial fears, scarcity beliefs, ancestral money wounds, or internal narratives that have been quietly running the show. But instead of spiraling, you reinterpret wealth as a multidimensional experience: health, family, safety, joy, creativity, nourishment, emotional fulfillment. Ironically, the moment you stop chasing traditional versions of success and start embracing this spiritual definition of abundance… actual material abundance increases. Your aura softens. Your voice strengthens. People trust you more. Money follows authenticity.</p>



<p>And then comes the financial fireworks. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, staying for 13 months, blessing your finances, self-esteem, and earning ability. And topping it all off, the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo supercharges a six-month financial rebirth. This is a full-on Leo stellium in your money zone, making Cancer one of the most prosperous signs of 2026. Raises, new jobs, brand partnerships, speaking gigs, real estate wins, viral moments, sold-out offerings, unexpected checks… it’s all on the table.</p>



<p>But here’s the catch: you must stop hiding. Jupiter in Leo wants you center stage. Saturn and Neptune in Aries want you leading. If you retreat into your shell during the biggest glow up of your career, you block blessings. The life hack? Every time you want to shrink, ask yourself: What’s one small step out of the cocoon I can take today? Slowly expand your capacity to shine. Fall in love with the money journey, not just the outcome. Abundance wants you — and for once, you’re fully ready to want it back.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828724.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Leo… this year was practically written for you. A numerology 1 year, a Fire Horse year, and the arrival of Saturn and Neptune in Aries, a fellow Fire sign? This is cosmic synergy. Saturn gives you discipline, structure, and long-game strategy, while Neptune gives you imagination, purpose, and dream-blueprints — and both are activating your expansion, education, and exploration sector. Translation: life wants you to stretch, to risk, to evolve, and to invest in your next level. You’re no longer meant to coast on natural talent alone… you’re being asked to deliberately sharpen your gifts, develop your craft, study what excites you, and say yes to opportunities that expose you to people, places, and possibilities you once thought were “too big.” The fire energy of 2026 (plus Uranus entering Gemini later in the year) lights you up with inspiration, but Saturn keeps you grounded in what actually works. You’re stepping into a year where your ambition is finally matched by cosmic support — but consistency is the key that unlocks it.</p>



<p>Before the spotlight finds you, though, there is a sacred preparation happening. For the first six months of 2026, Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your spiritual, intuitive, and healing sector. This is your incubation period… your chrysalis. You may feel quieter, more reflective, more inwardly focused, and more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">protective of your peace</a> and energy. Old fears around visibility, self-worth, or deservingness may rise to the surface so they can be released. Jupiter in Cancer shows you the parts of your identity you’ve been hiding, dimming, or underestimating.</p>



<p>All of this emotional groundwork becomes crucial, because when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month stay… everything accelerates. Suddenly, you’re magnetic. Booked. Center stage. Abundance comes from simply being yourself — boldly, colorfully, unapologetically. What you learned in your quiet season prepares you to receive, hold, and manage the Golden Era that’s coming. Jupiter in Leo is a financial glow up, but it’s also a soul glow up. The more you know who you are, the more the universe can amplify you.</p>



<p>Then comes the moment that changes everything: the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo: your cosmic rebirth. This eclipse is your personal reset button, a full-on identity upgrade. Reinvention is not just allowed; it’s inevitable. If you’ve been craving a rebrand, a new creative direction, a shift in industry, a move, or a change in how you present yourself to the world, this eclipse opens the door. Many Leos will start the year making money one way and end the year making it through a completely different, more aligned avenue. Eclipses don’t ask for permission; they accelerate what your soul already chose. If you’ve been secretly wanting to pivot from corporate to creative, from artist to entrepreneur, from behind-the-scenes to center stage, this eclipse is the ignition. With Jupiter in your sign, you’ll have the confidence, charisma, and visibility to make it happen.</p>



<p>But the real anchoring energy of the year comes from Virgo. First, the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo highlights your money, values, and self-worth sector, revealing the financial habits, insecurities, or patterns that need to shift for your wealth to stabilize. Then, on September 10th, we get the first non-eclipse Virgo New Moon in over a year. This is the moment everything clicks. After months of expansion, opportunities, attention, and abundance from Jupiter in Leo, this Virgo New Moon gives you the practical clarity to organize your finances, budget wisely, build systems, and protect your wealth.</p>



<p>Remember Leo: Jupiter expands everything — including spending, indulgence, lifestyle inflation, impulsive purchases, and diva moments. The shadow of your 2026 is thinking you’re unstoppable and forgetting to manage your money. The cure? Virgo discipline. If you take this Virgo New Moon seriously, you end the year not just wealthier… but <em>wealth-stable</em>. Leo’s biggest lesson of 2026 is this: you’re allowed to shine, but you must also steward the light.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828725.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, 2026 is the year your spirit finally exhales. The March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in your sign — on the ascension portal of 3/3 — is the continuation of a cycle that has relentlessly reshaped your relationship with yourself. These Virgo–Pisces eclipses have pushed you to release identities, habits, roles, and financial dynamics that were draining you. They forced you to confront the places where you were over-giving, undercharging, overworking, or tolerating responsibilities that weren’t yours to carry.</p>



<p>This penultimate Virgo eclipse brings clarity, closure, and reclamation. Suddenly, the rejections, delays, endings, and redirections of the past two years start making sense. Jobs that are draining you end. Financial agreements without reciprocity dissolve. And most importantly, you finally outgrow the “comfort zone income ceiling” you unconsciously created for yourself. This eclipse shows you how much more you’re capable of earning — and how deeply you deserve it. Asking for raises, charging more, setting boundaries, leaving unfulfilling roles… it all becomes easier.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, joining forces in your shared resources, investments, and generational wealth sector. Neptune will stay for over a decade, Saturn for two years, meaning you’re entering a profound money-mastery era. Saturn gives structure to your long-term financial plans; Neptune gives intuitive guidance and imagination. Together, they ask you to stop downplaying your potential and start building real wealth.</p>



<p>This is the perfect time for Virgos to explore conscious investing, real estate, entrepreneurship, high-yield savings accounts, grants, accelerators, stock or bond portfolios, crowdfunding, or even collaborative income partnerships. You are being initiated into the world of financial expansion… not through hustle culture, but through strategy and alignment. If you’ve ever dreamt of building long-term security, passive income, or generational wealth, Saturn and Neptune are saying “Now.” The only requirement is that you stop being shy about wanting abundance. You’re meant to have more.</p>



<p>The energy shifts dramatically in the second half of the year with Jupiter entering Leo on June 30th and the August 12th Solar Eclipse in Leo, both activating your spirituality, closure, and subconscious sector. This may seem confusing at first… just when you’re gaining confidence, the cosmos asks you to go inward again. But this is essential.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo illuminates where your ego, fear of judgment, or longing for external validation may have been steering your financial decisions. Are you pursuing something because it looks good on paper, or because your soul wants it? Are you chasing visibility, or peace? The Leo eclipse encourages a deep reinvention of your motivations. If your money goals are rooted in self-love rather than proving yourself, then the abundance that comes in the second half of 2026 will feel effortless. If they’re rooted in comparison or insecurity, the universe will gently redirect you back to your inner truth. This is a heart-centered recalibration.</p>



<p>And then comes the biggest plot twist: Uranus enters Gemini on July 7th, activating your career sector for more than seven years. If you’ve been craving change, creativity, or a career that feels alive… buckle up. Uranus brings unpredictability, yes, but also genius breakthroughs, unexpected opportunities, nonlinear trajectories, and reinventions you didn’t even know you wanted. You may get multiple offers at once, switch industries, take on roles you never imagined, or build a career path with no precedent. For a Virgo, this can feel like a nervous-system roller coaster, but in truth, it’s the liberation you’ve been quietly praying for. You’ve been bored. You’ve been ready for more. Now “more” arrives in the form of surprise. If you treat 2026 like an adventure instead of a test, you will discover new income avenues you never would’ve considered. This year is not about control, it’s about trust. And deep down, Virgo, you are more ready than you realize.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828726.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, 2026 is the year your relationships become your greatest financial portal. With Saturn and Neptune in Aries in your partnership, collaboration, and contract sector, you’re entering a long-term cycle where your abundance is directly tied to who you build with, who you trust, and who you choose to walk beside. Saturn will be here for two years, refining your standards, boundaries, and commitments. Neptune will remain for over a decade, helping you attract soul-aligned collaborators, clients, partners, and supporters.</p>



<p>Some Libras may literally <em>marry into wealth</em>, join forces with a romantic partner financially, start a business with someone, or find that the right professional ally completely transforms their income. Others will discover that setting boundaries in draining partnerships instantly shifts their money flow. You’re learning that relationships are not just emotional ecosystems… they’re also energetic and financial ones. When your partnerships are aligned, your wealth expands.</p>



<p>At the same time, Scorpio energy becomes a quiet but powerful money-making ally this year. Any Scorpio transit — Scorpio Moon days, Mercury in Scorpio, Venus in Scorpio, Mars in Scorpio, and of course Scorpio Season — activates your income and self-worth sector. Translation: Q4 may be your strongest financial quarter of the year, even if the first two or three feel more preparatory. But before the rewards arrive, you must move through the final initiation of Uranus in Taurus, which stays at 29 degrees until July 7th.</p>



<p>Uranus has been shaking your shared resources, inheritances, debt, grants, loans, investments, and generational wealth sector since 2018, bringing wild fluctuations, unexpected payments, unpredictable expenses, financial awakenings, and deep fears to the surface. These final months are the “exam” phase: releasing scarcity programming, renegotiating debt, restructuring financial agreements, letting go of survival mode, and stabilizing your money foundation. Once Uranus leaves Taurus, the turbulence stops. But you must consciously close the chapter.</p>



<p>On July 7th, Uranus enters Gemini, activating your expansion, publishing, travel, and higher learning sector, and suddenly, life becomes wide again. Uranus in Gemini is an Air sign blessing, giving you wings. After years of financial shadow work, you finally feel energized enough to travel, study, teach, write, publish, relocate, return to school, or broadcast your ideas. And here’s the magic: these expansion moves directly increase your wealth. Courses you take pay off. Content you publish brings opportunities.</p>



<p>Traveling puts you in rooms with people who hire or invest in you. Teaching, writing, lecturing, coaching, creating, or launching digital products becomes profitable. But there’s a shadow: Gemini energy can overwhelm you with options. You might say yes to too many opportunities, overbook yourself, take on too many subscriptions, or accidentally live beyond your means because life finally feels exciting again. You’ll have to practice discernment — something you’re capable of, but only when they slow down.</p>



<p>And then the glow arrives. Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th, followed by the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Leo on August 12th, activating your friendship, tech, and community sector for 13 months. This is one of the luckiest transit combos Libras have had in years. Your social circle expands, your online presence grows, and friendships bring financial opportunities. Networking becomes natural during this transit and your content is more likely to go viral.</p>



<p>The second half of 2026 is overflowing with invitations, ideas, and possibilities…almost too many. Your task is to choose the few that actually align with your values, bandwidth, budget, and long-term vision. Libra’s financial superpower this year is selectivity. The life hack: <em>sometimes less is more.</em> Ground yourself during the Earth seasons (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) to stay anchored while the Air and Fire energies sweep you into expansion. If you protect your peace, honor your limits, and trust your intuition, 2026 becomes the year your partnerships elevate you into a completely new income bracket.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828727.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Scorpio, 2026 is the year you come back to life with fire in your eyes. After Neptune and Saturn spent the past few years in Pisces activating your pleasure and romance sector, you were deep in emotional renovation mode: healing wounds, shedding karmic spending patterns, dissolving creative blocks, and confronting the extremes you sometimes swing between (either clutching onto every penny or impulse-spending like money grows on Pluto). But this year is a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and Saturn and Neptune move into Aries, activating your sector of work, routine, health, and daily mastery. Aries is ruled by Mars, your planetary ruler. This is a cosmic caffeine shot to your system.</p>



<p>Saturn gives discipline. Neptune gives vision. Together, they pull you out of your hibernation and say: <em>“It’s time.”</em> Time to work differently, lead differently, earn differently, and show up in a way that aligns with your highest self. Your financial growth this year comes directly from acting more like an Aries: bold, unapologetic, experimental, and willing to try again even if you change your mind. No more hiding.</p>



<p>No more waiting until you feel “ready.” The universe wants you moving — imperfectly, passionately, consistently. The year opens with a massive turning point: the March 3rd Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo, an ascension gateway occurring in your community, collaboration, and networking sector. This eclipse reveals how much wealth is tied not just to what you do, but who you do it <em>with</em>. Scorpio is often fiercely independent, but this eclipse makes it undeniable: community is currency. Digital workshops, in-person retreats, healing circles, online courses, speaking opportunities, group programs, co-led offerings — these are your gold mines. People want to learn from you and be guided by you.</p>



<p>People trust your insight, your leadership, your spiritual authority. As you invest in nurturing community, you’ll notice a direct increase in income. And only one week later, Jupiter stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, activating your expansion, entrepreneurship, media, and travel sector. From March through June 30th, entrepreneurial ventures stabilize. Educational projects gain traction. Publishing, teaching, writing, creating online content, or running your own business from home all become surprisingly lucrative.</p>



<p>The May 1st Full Moon in Scorpio is your personal wake-up call: a moment of “Okay…I’m done blocking my own blessings.” This full moon activates your identity and purpose, pushing you to embrace your brilliance instead of hiding it out of fear or perfectionism. Then, on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, and your career becomes the hottest, brightest zone of your chart. Jupiter in Leo demands visibility: public roles, leadership positions, creative projects, management responsibilities, bold new titles, and industry recognition.</p>



<p>And the August 12th New Moon Total Solar Eclipse in Leo only amplifies this. Within six months of this eclipse, many Scorpios hit a major milestone: launching a dream project, getting promoted, going viral, receiving funding, or reinventing their public identity entirely. It’s a fiery, high-stakes, high-reward era — and yes, it can feel overwhelming after years of softness and introspection. But you asked for transformation. You asked for momentum. And now the universe is delivering it at full force.</p>



<p>The final act of the year brings both shadow and reward. On October 3rd, Venus retrogrades in your sign, temporarily slowing your money flow so you can examine your deeper relationship with receiving. Scorpio is a master giver but can struggle with letting abundance in without suspicion, fear, or guilt. Venus retrograde helps you soften those defenses. Then, on November 13th, Venus shifts direct, just in time for Sag Season to activate your money sector. This is your harvest period. Everything you built during the first half of the year, everything you stabilized during Jupiter’s shift direct in Cancer, everything you dared to reveal under the Leo eclipse… comes back to you multiplied.</p>



<p>By the end of 2026, you understand that sustainable wealth is built like Scorpio magic itself: through devotion, depth, passion, and repeated practice. Saturn and Neptune in Aries remind you that showing up consistently is what creates prosperity. This isn’t the year you hide your power… this is the year you <em>own</em> it. The year your work becomes aligned, your confidence becomes unshakeable, and your abundance becomes inevitable.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828728.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Sagittarius, 2026 feels like finally running at full speed after years of feeling like you were jogging through molasses. Saturn and Neptune are joining forces in Aries — a Fire sign like you — during a Fire Horse year, a numerology 1 year, and you’re <em>literally</em> a centaur. This is cosmic power stacking. Saturn gives you the discipline to harness your fire, and Neptune gives you the vision to direct it with purpose. Aries energy ignites your creativity, courage, entrepreneurial sparks, and willingness to take action instead of waiting for “the perfect moment.” This is a year of unapologetic momentum for you. You’re thinking bigger, taking risks, and betting on yourself. And unlike the past few years when timing felt off or the universe seemed to slow you down, 2026 finally puts wind behind your arrows. You’re being pushed into your next era of financial mastery… not through force, but through fiery alignment.</p>



<p>Before the explosion of opportunity arrives, the first six months come with an intimate, profound money lesson. Your ruler Jupiter is in Cancer, activating your shared resources, intimacy, and generational wealth sector. This is about the inner healing that allows you to truly hold abundance. Jupiter here helps you release fears around inconsistency, past financial wounds, and patterns of overgiving or undercharging. You may restructure debt, renegotiate financial partnerships, or become more intentional with investing and long-term planning.</p>



<p>The year’s visionary turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your communication, ideas, voice, and values sector. This eclipse, combined with Pluto in Aquarius, is your radicalization era — in the best way. It asks you to stop watering down your truth in order to be palatable. Your money this year is tied to how boldly, honestly, and rebelliously you express your values.</p>



<p>Sagittarius is already known for truth-telling, but in 2026, your authenticity becomes your brand. Whether you’re pitching a business, creating content, speaking publicly, or negotiating your worth, the more you show up in your realness, the more the universe aligns opportunities that match who you <em>actually</em> are. This eclipse sets off a six-month storyline of breakthrough communication, but because the Aquarius eclipse cycle continues into 2027, the values you claim now will become the foundation of your long-term financial path. And the June 29th Full Moon in Capricorn — in your income sector — brings the mid-year payout you’ve been building toward quietly. Something slow, steady, and grown-up you’ve been working on finally pays off.</p>



<p>And when Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th for a 13-month cycle, everything changes. This activates your expansion, travel, entrepreneurship, and publishing sector — your home turf. Suddenly, the world opens up. You feel bolder, brighter, and more willing to put yourself out there. Asking for more money becomes easier. Accepting leadership roles becomes natural. You stop settling for anything that undervalues your skills, your brilliance, or your range. Jupiter in Leo turns you into the version of yourself who says:“If I desire it, why can’t I have it?”</p>



<p>The second half of the year is fiery and fast thanks to Jupiter in Leo, but with fire comes temptation: burnout, overcommitment, overspending, or chasing external validation disguised as success. Capricorn Season arrives like a grounded exhale. Starting in late December 2026 — after Venus retrograde shadow periods have cleared and eclipse intensity settles — you gain clarity on what truly matters. Capricorn energy helps you refine your systems, budget with intention, streamline your workload, and realize that you don’t need to do the absolute most to earn the absolute most. Sagittarius often equates “more effort” with “more outcome,” but 2026 teaches you the opposite: less is more. Rest is strategy. Alignment is efficiency. The universe is saying: <em>You can chill and still be blessed.</em> The end of the year is where you recognize that your abundance grows when your actions are values-led rather than validation-led. And that shift is what makes 2026 one of your most transformative financial years to date.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828729.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Capricorn… 2026 is a year of profound recalibration — the kind that only happens when your chart ruler shifts signs. Saturn, your cosmic boss and anchor, leaves Pisces and enters Aries, activating your sector of roots and values. Saturn stays here for two years, while Neptune joins for over a decade, blending practicality with visionary intuition. This is a major energetic shift: Pisces had you drifting, dissolving, dreaming, healing, grieving, and letting go. Aries puts fire back in your system. Suddenly there’s urgency, clarity, initiative, and a desire to rebuild your foundation with a different level of intentionality.</p>



<p>With Saturn in Aries, you stop procrastinating. You stop tolerating mediocrity (internally or externally). You begin building new habits that are actually sustainable. And Neptune helps you lead with inspiration rather than obligation. It’s a “reconstruct your life from the ground up” year — not from fear or scarcity, but because you’ve outgrown the old version of yourself.</p>



<p>The first major turning point arrives early: the February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius, activating your income sector — the start of a brand-new eclipse cycle that continues for the next two years. And with Pluto in Aquarius now settled in your money zone for nearly 20 years, your entire financial philosophy is transforming. This is the year you stop relying solely on traditional, linear, “safe” routes to wealth. Aquarius wants innovation, disruption, experimentation. Think: New currency, new tools, new industries, new ways of earning and thinking.</p>



<p>You may surprise yourself by wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, explore stocks and bonds, back someone’s startup, join an accelerator, pivot careers, learn coding, adopt AI tools, or build a digital asset you never thought you’d feel comfortable with. Aquarius energy activates your inner strategist <em>and</em> your inner rebel. And the eclipse may force your hand by dissolving an outdated income source or revealing something misaligned. The universe is saying: “The old structure won’t sustain you anymore — build the new one.”</p>



<p>Then comes the shift you’ve both dreaded and needed: Uranus leaves Taurus on July 7th, ending eight years of unpredictable, karmic lessons in love, pleasure, fate, and creative purpose. That transit shook your sense of identity, security, romantic patterns, and artistic voice. But when Uranus enters Gemini, it activates your work, service, and routine sector for the next 7-plus years. Your daily life becomes more flexible, surprising, unconventional, and mentally stimulating. Your income may come from multiple streams instead of one stable source. Work hours may shift, job roles evolve, and your relationship with consistency changes entirely. This can feel disorienting at first… as you love stability, but Uranus also opens your world. With Uranus in Gemini, you’re invited to align your money mindset with your curiosity instead of duty. It’s a cosmic permission slip to loosen your grip.</p>



<p>For the first six months, Jupiter is in Cancer — boosting your partnerships and professional alliances. Money comes through people, through agreements, through teamwork, through shared visions. Then on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo, lighting up your shared resources, investments, inheritance, loans, grant funding, venture capital, and generational wealth sector for 13 months. This is a wealth-generation portal, especially with the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse also activating this part of your chart. If you ask for money this year, people say yes. Investors say yes. Banks say yes. Clients say yes. Collaborators say yes.</p>



<p>This is the time to pitch yourself boldly, ask for raises, negotiate salaries, restructure debt, apply for funding, or strategically expand your financial ecosystem. But the  deeper spiritual lesson is trust. In 2026 you’re learning that controlling everything doesn’t create safety… <em>alignment does</em>. When you release your need to micromanage every outcome, synchronicities multiply. When you stop gripping, blessings land easily. 2026 is the year you learn that wealth is not just a plan, it’s a divine collaboration with the universe.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828730.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Aquarius, 2026 is the year the universe hands you the mic and says, <em>“Your era starts now.”</em> The February 17th New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign officially opens the Aquarius–Leo eclipse axis for the first time in nearly a decade, and because Pluto is in your sign for 19 more years, this isn’t just an eclipse… it’s a coronation. Your identity, your voice, your authenticity, your weirdness, your genius — <em>that</em> is your currency now. All you really have to do to attract more wealth this year is show up as yourself and keep exploring who that self is becoming.</p>



<p>But the New Moon will square Uranus in Taurus, your modern ruler, which may trigger a feeling of instability as you attempt to choose a financial path. You may not want to choose. You may want to reinvent. You may have sudden changes at work, sudden shifts in direction, sudden realizations about what no longer fits. That’s okay. This eclipse is clearing the slate so you can write a new, innovative financial script — one only an Aquarius could dream up.</p>



<p>But before the reinvention stabilizes, you must navigate the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus, which remains in your home, roots, and emotional foundation sector until July 7th. Uranus at 29° Taurus shakes the ground beneath your feet one last time: housing transitions, family dynamics shifting, unexpected changes in living arrangements, or emotional instability that makes it difficult to focus on money. The message? <em>Your home has to evolve for your wealth to evolve.</em> Create stability where you can: simplify your space, strengthen your routines, anchor your nervous system, because the external may continue to fluctuate. Once Uranus enters Gemini in July and activates your creativity, dating, and pleasure sector for 7+ years, everything changes. You stop trying to force stability through seriousness and realize your abundance is directly tied to joy. As you play more, you profit more. As you say yes to what excites your inner child, money flows in through the side door. Your ruler in a fellow Air sign feels like oxygen after eight years underwater.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Jupiter is doing major heavy lifting for your partnerships and your wealth. For the first half of the year, Jupiter in Cancer activates your work and service sector, which makes you more emotionally sensitive at work and easily overwhelmed by routines. But on June 30th, Jupiter enters Leo for 13 months, lighting up your partnership, collaboration, and connection sector. This is not a solo year. Your wealth increases when you align yourself with people who hype you up, empower you, challenge you, or amplify your voice. Whether romantic or professional, collaborations become gold mines.</p>



<p>Jupiter in Leo dissolves your lone-wolf tendencies and says, “Work with people who make you feel more confident, not less.” And the August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse seals this truth: you may meet a divine collaborator — a soulmate client, a creative partner, a romantic partner, or a benefactor — who boosts your wealth within six months. This is the first Leo eclipse in nine years, and it reactivates a deep destiny around who you share your energy, time, and resources with.</p>



<p>Then we reach the grand finale: the August 28th Pisces Full Moon Lunar Eclipse in your income sector. This is the last Pisces eclipse for years, and a culmination of intentions set around the March 18th Pisces New Moon earlier in the year, especially if you started or expanded a home-based business at that time. This eclipse could bring a major payout, your first large client, a viral moment, a grant, a raise, a royalty check, or an unexpected windfall. It’s not logical — it’s magical. Pisces eclipses bring blessings you dream of before they appear.</p>



<p>Your task in 2026 is to stop fixating on <em>how</em> money will come and start embodying the version of yourself who already has it. Wealth is not just currency; it is frequency. Gratitude, joy, ease, creativity, softness, imagination — these are your financial tools now. Make a mood board of your wealthiest self. Listen to the music they would love. Dress the way they would dress. Play the way they would play. The more you embody abundance, the more easily it finds you. 2026 is the beginning of your Pluto Era — and that means your power, your voice, and your wealth are only going up from here.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11828731.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Pisces, 2026 begins with a sacred exhale. For years, you’ve had both Saturn and Neptune in your sign — a once-in-a-lifetime transit that forced you to confront your identity, your boundaries, your purpose, your fears, your softness, and your sensitivity. From 2023 to early 2026 you were reshaped, rebuilt, rebirthed. And in January and early February, as Neptune leaves Pisces on January 26th and Saturn follows on February 13th, you integrate the <em>final degree lessons</em>: emotional maturity, energetic discernment, self-worth, and spiritual clarity. The first month of the year isn’t about money at all… it’s about shedding the old version of yourself. You’re clearing illusions, releasing martyr tendencies, and renouncing the idea that you have to suffer or sacrifice to be deserving. But then February arrives, and everything changes.</p>



<p>As soon as Saturn and Neptune enter Aries, your money, self-worth, and financial stability sector lights up like a switch being flipped. Suddenly, you stop seeing money as something “worldly” or “impure,” and start seeing it as a <em>spiritual ally</em>. Pisces realizes they can be abundant, ethical, generous, and powerful — all at once. Saturn brings structure so you don’t get swept away by unrealistic optimism; Neptune brings imagination, intuition, and a deep trust that the more aligned you become, the more supported you are.</p>



<p>This combo births a new financial identity: the Pisces who invests, who saves wisely, who builds systems, who negotiates confidently, who no longer undercharges, who believes they can be a benevolent billionaire if they choose. And when Jupiter, your planetary ruler, stations direct in Cancer on March 10th, your intuitive knowing around money decisions becomes crystal clear. What felt blocked for months now starts flowing again: creative income, entrepreneurial ideas, financial momentum, and self-trust.</p>



<p>The next major shift comes mid-year when Uranus leaves Taurus and enters Gemini on July 7th. For eight years, Uranus in Taurus activated your communication and erratic spending tendencies, sometimes scattering your focus or creating unexpected financial fluctuations. Now, Uranus moves into your home, family, and domestic sector, bringing surprises: moves, relocations, home renovations, family expansions, or sudden household expenses. This requires a budget, emotional boundaries, and clear financial planning, because your generous Pisces heart could easily be pulled into rescuing family or giving beyond your means during this transit.</p>



<p>At the same time, Jupiter enters Leo on June 30th and begins a 13-month journey through your health, routine, and service sector. This is when you realize <em>wealth without</em> <em>wellness isn’t worth it.</em> 2026 asks Pisces to take their physical health seriously — movement, rest, appointments, nutrition, grounding practices. Jupiter in Leo also encourages you to hire support: a money coach, a financial planner, a mentor, or someone who can teach you the systems you never learned. You don’t have to figure everything out alone.</p>



<p>And then comes your quantum leap. The August 12th Leo New Moon Solar Eclipse invites you to commit to a new era of financial responsibility and self-respect. Then, on August 28th, the year’s final eclipse — a Pisces Full Moon Partial Lunar Eclipse — becomes your liberation moment. This eclipse reveals how you’ve been standing in your own way: holding onto past money mistakes, believing outdated narratives about scarcity, letting fear slow you down, or waiting for perfect clarity before taking action. This is your release and rebirth. By the September 26th Full Moon in Aries, you feel ready to launch something major, claim opportunities you once felt unworthy of, or receive blessings you prayed for years ago. 2026 is your financial renaissance — not because you hustle harder, but because you believe in yourself more deeply than ever before. You’re no longer rebuilding your identity… you’re expressing it, confidently, abundantly, and unapologetically.</p>

In the age of streaming, appointment TV was back and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/love-island-usa-watch-parties-community"">watch parties were bigger</a> than ever. Whether it was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@loveislandusa/video/7520444252002848055?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolandria’s Soul Ties kiss</a> (IYKYK), the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11934118/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-finale-ending-explained-review-belly"">king of yearning Conrad Fisher</a> finally getting his happily ever after, or a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSe15yhDuu1/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">grand gesture from a gay hockey player</a> no one saw coming, TV lovers came together this year to obsess over their fave ‘ships and root for their beloved characters.

<p>In a year that felt endlessly chaotic and packed with horrific headlines, TV stepped up as our most reliable emotional support system. 2025 gave us shows that made us scream-text the group chat, cancel plans for<em> just one more episode</em>, and rethink everything from love, to friendship, to what counts as a satisfying finale. Whether you were into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/203712/best-2000s-shows-platinum-age"">prestige dramas</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cozy-christmas-movies"">comfort watches</a>, or genre shows that completely rewired the formula, this year’s best TV did not disappoint.

<p>These picks come straight from the watchlists (and our unhinged yet professional Slack chats) of Refinery29 editors. The criteria isn’t “high-brow only,” it’s <em>did this show fully consume us?</em> From series that demanded our full attention to reality TV that went from chaotic to comforting to culturally essential, we’re honoring the full spectrum of what great TV looks like. If it sparked a debate, delivered a meme, or made us feel something unexpectedly real, it earned its spot. </p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq8x47ky2Tw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt </a></em></strong></h2>







<p>For some reason, I was never into Grey’s Anatomy, Scrubs, ER, or any of the popular hospital dramas even during their streaming resurgences. But after everyone from family to strangers recommended watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date""> </a>(starring and executive-produced by ER’s very own Noah Wyle) and being bombarded with interviews of Wylie talking about how his nurse mom influenced the storyline for more accurate depictions of what it’s actually like to work in a hospital, I finally gave in. And wow, was I stunned. </p>



<p>Each of the 15 episodes represent one hour of a consecutive 15-hour emergency room shift. It’s fast-paced and chaotic but has moments of levity, and manages to dive deep into each of the doctors, nurses, and residents’ eccentricities and back stories. I found myself instantly hooked and invested into the core doctors and incoming patients, no matter how likeable, unlikeable, long, or short their storylines were. The heavy, high-strung, high-stakes series is a must-watch. But to warn you, it is certainly not a show to wind down to after a hectic day!<em> <strong>– Victoria Montalti, Senior Fashion Writer</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a> </em>Season 7 </strong></h2>







<p>When an Irish friend first introduced me to <em>Love Island </em>via the show’s original UK iteration in 2022, I was equally horrified and intrigued by the sheer logistics of it all. The idea of committing to a show that airs a new episode six nights a week for two and a half months straight — featuring a revolving door of 30-or-so contestants and their constantly recalibrating romances — was a lot to wrap my head around. But, as someone who deeply appreciates lowbrow reality TV both as a form of sociological fieldwork and, obviously, for pure eye candy, I was up for the task. </p>



<p>This year, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Love Island USA</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hZpwgKjOkY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> season 7</a> brought the country together in ways seldom seen before, becoming a full-blown cultural phenomenon that revived the glory days of participatory reality TV. My roommate and I grew closer as we watched and voted together each night (and shrieked in horror at the show’s absolutely unhinged challenges). My colleagues and I raced to our Slack channels each morning to share hot takes. Even in New York City, where people famously mind their business, I’d find myself talking about the show with a friend on the street or subway, only to have strangers jump in mid-conversation to share their opinions.</p>



<p>What ultimately made season 7 feel like a classic was (most of) the cast’s emotional vulnerability. It gave us a hero’s arc in Amaya Papaya (née Espinal), who brought a rare level of authenticity and sensitivity to reality TV, a friends-to-star-crossed-lovers romance in Olandria and Nic, healthy debates about what it really means to be “a girls girl,” and enough memes to last a lifetime (Mamacita, anyone?). <em><strong>– Lia Tabackman, Senior Social Media Manager </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@hbomax/video/7583017214677241119"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rivalry</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>I’m going to start with a quote from <em><a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/heated-rivalry-hbo-max-gay-drama-hockey-players-hit-women-1236456083/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Heated Rilvarly’s</a></em> creator, writer and showrunner, Jacob Tierney: “Putting queer sex on the screen in a celebratory and sexy way is not common at all… people were clearly craving that kind of thing,” <a href=""https://theankler.com/p/i-think-heated-rivalry-deserves-emmys"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tierney told The Ankler</a>. “They wanted to see sexually alive, queer people in a way that we kind of self-censor and don’t always do. I don’t think the show is popular despite the horniness; I think it’s popular because of the horniness.” Exactly. Recently, TV and film have been oddly sexless, seemingly scared to show erotism on screen and convinced audiences don’t want to see pretty people kissing. I beg to differ.</p>



<p>I’ve been pushing the horny TV agenda for years and finally, here comes a show to match my freak. But it’s not just about the beautifully tender, explicit, real, and <em>hot </em>sex scenes, <em>Heated Rivalry </em>contains some of the most heartfelt and romantic storytelling I’ve ever seen on TV. And that’s only after five episodes! I am already unhealthily obsessed with this show and I can’t wait for more. As someone who belongs to multiple romance book clubs, I’m so happy that a show based on a romance novel (written by Rachel Reid) is getting the love it deserves. Plus, a show about gay hockey players airing in 2025 — when male athletes would still face so much prejudice, homophobia, and an extremely hard time if they came out IRL — is not only bold and brave, it’s revolutionary. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p>I admittedly didn’t watch much TV this year, but there was one show that had me in a chokehold: Season 3 of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty.</em> To be honest, I didn’t particularly enjoy this season. As Team Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno), a lot of it was insufferable, mostly because Conrad (Christopher Briney) remains an unbearable character to watch. He’s going to talk down to Belly (Lola Tung) and make her feel crazy for years AND do his brother like that, and they still want me to believe he’s not the villain in this show? (You ain’t gaslighting me, Connie Baby!). I also couldn’t stand the way the writers seemed determined to assassinate Jeremiah’s character. Still, to paraphrase a Taylor Swift lyric, Jenny Han really puts narcotics into all of her episodes, because no matter how much I wanted to look away, I just couldn’t. <em>– <strong>Raquel Reichard, Director of Somos</strong></em></p>

<p>When I first started <em>The Hunting Wives</em>, I wasn’t prepared for what I signed up for. I assumed I would be watching a show about wives getting back at their cheating husbands. I was right, but also so wrong. I spent most of the time being mad at the main character Sophie (Brittany Snow), literally rolling my eyes at the screen at her antics. That said, I will be back for Season 2. –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/secretlivesonhulu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives </a></em></strong></h2>







<p><em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSky3regZqi/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives</a> </em>was my favorite TV show of 2025 because it didn’t just understand the assignment, it overdelivered. TWO seasons in one year? Bravo could never. By breaking the fourth wall and letting the off-screen drama (hello, Fruity Pebbles) bleed into the show, it captured the same raw magic as early Vanderpump Rules seasons, back when the cast wanted fame at any cost and didn’t know, or care, to hold anything back.</p>



<p>Season 3 was filmed before Season 2 even premiered, giving us something almost unheard of in reality TV: reunions being taped, press tours unfolding, and cast dynamics shifting in real time as they reacted to public opinion. The timeline was messy, but for reality fans, that level of transparency was all we’ve ever wanted.</p>



<p>We watched marriages implode, secret affairs surface, and learned way too much about their sex lives. Not every storyline worked (the sexual assault allegations were uncomfortable and difficult to watch), but the drama was balanced by something real: raw, unprocessed trauma shared in a way that genuinely resonated.</p>



<p>Taylor Frankie Paul becoming the Bachelorette only cemented the show’s chokehold on pop culture, while Whitney Leavitt started the year as the ultimate villain and ended it as the main character of<em> Dancing with the Stars </em>and getting cast as Roxie Hart on Broadway. The range! And all of this unfolded in the hyper-specific, endlessly fascinating playground of Swig sodas, Utah curls, and Mormon culture—proof that you don’t need alcohol for reality TV gold.<em> – <strong>Taylor Loren, Social Strategist </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81418639"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forever</a> </em></strong></h2>







<p>Mara Brock Akil’s <em>Forever</em> feels like it was made specifically for me — for the 16 year old version of me who needed to see herself, who longed for stories that reflected Black girlhood and humanity and the complexity of being a Black kid in a white space — and that’s only partially why I loved it so much. For the teenager in me who was messily figuring out her sexuality, Keisha and Justin would have been my fictional best friends. For the thirty-redacted grownup who needed an escape and just loves romance, <em>Forever</em> delivered in-depth, nuanced explorations of how sex can be absolutely everything and sometimes nothing at all. </p>



<p>Listen, I’m too grown to believe that representation will save us, but it does matter. And what this show represents (Black kids falling in love and finding themselves) is portrayed in such a caring, thoughtful way that as you fall in love with Keisha and Justin, as a Black person, you can’t help but love yourself more. This show loves us. It finds beauty in Blackness, in the nuances and flaws of youth. It lets Keisha be complicated and messy and Justin be introspective and vulnerable; two things that Black girls and boys aren’t typically allowed to be on TV. This show is my wildest dreams come true. It’s the show I wish I had when I was a teenager and I’m so grateful that Black teens get this show now. <strong>– </strong><em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em><br /></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10828529/abbott-elementary-show-review-quinta-brunson"">Abbott Elementary</a></em> is my comfort show when I want to just laugh and <em>not have to think</em>. I can usually jump into any episode in the season or binge several of the 22-minute episodes and still understand what’s happening. In the same style as cult-favorite comedies like<em> The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Rec,</em> this workplace “mockumentary” follows the staff of a Philadelphia elementary school and captures all the drama and antics you’d expect to happen during everyday life—in and out of school. The show is currently in the middle of season five and we see teachers Janine and Gregory’s relationship continue to develop. A few of the recent episodes have taken the setting out of the school, but my favorites are usually when the teachers and staff, especially Principal Ava Coleman and teacher Ms. Melissa Schementti, are just trying to get through the school day. For me, it’s easy sitcom watching. <strong>–</strong><em><strong> Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/81427733"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Beast In Me</a></em></strong></h2>







<p>If I were putting together a dream team of prestige TV, I would immediately call up Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys for my starting five. Danes proved in <em>Homeland</em>, and throughout her storied career, that she can do a chin quiver like no other, and that there is no emotion she can’t convey through the careful crumpling of her face. And Rhys, along with his real-life wife Keri Russell, showed on <em>The Americans</em> that he can make even the most ethically-questionable character someone you can’t help but be intrigued by. In <em>The Beast In Me</em>, these two heavyweights come together for some of the best TV of the year. </p>



<p>Both Danes and Rhys are so compelling in <em>The Beast In Me, </em>you won’t be able to look away for all eight episodes. Danes brings her signature emotional precision, playing every flicker of doubt and defiance like a controlled burn, while Rhys does what he does best: make moral ambiguity feel devastatingly human. Together, they create a push-pull dynamic that’s an unsettling dissertation on good versus evil and what happens when the lines between the two start to blue. Their chemistry isn’t flashy; it’s claustrophobic, simmering, and kind that makes silence feel louder than dialogue and turns every shared glance into a threat. It’s prestige acting without the self-importance, and it’s exactly why the show gets under your skin and stays there. – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>



<h2><strong><em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaDFty5ipEg"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Buccanneers</a> </em>Season 2</strong></h2>







<p>This past summer, I was indulging in some YA love-triangle drama and watching <em>TSITP</em> and<em> The Buccaneers</em> Season 2 on Apple TV. If you’re not familiar with The Buccaneers, it’s a period drama set in 1870s England following five gorgeous American women trying to find titled husbands and independence. Season 2 tries to resolve a love triangle set up in Season 1 between Nan, Guy, and Theo. New affairs and betrayals between the couples develop, and it’s guilty-pleasure watching, especially for period romance fans. Spoiler warning: season two ends in another cliffhanger but the show’s already been greenlit for a season three.<em> <strong>– Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director</strong></em></p>

<p>I know Tubi gets a bad rep for its content, but do NOT sleep on them. I loved everything about the Z Suite! The characters were fun. The plots were full of shenanigans. It fueled the Gen Z vs. Millennial fire in a way that leaves you with the idea, “we are more alike than different”. It had a sense of true comedic whimsy, while many other shows are just too serious. I am unsure if it will be renewed for another season, but I sure hope so! –<em> <strong>Dawnie Jefferson Production &amp; Editorial Coordinator</strong></em></p>

Brown about a secret service agent whose president is murdered and it’s so good, it got renewed for a <a href=""https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a64208545/paradise-season-2-news-date-cast-spoilers/"">second season</a> halfway into its first. So I’m just going to quote myself from March writing about <em>Paradise</em> just after it was renewed: “We’re in an age where a show with a Black lead gets written off by online trolls as ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11253627/woke-meaning-co-opted-politics"">too woke</a>’ or full of ‘<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/03/11844306/hollywood-dei-rollbacks-black-actors-cast-reboots-racism"">DEI hires</a>’ and anything that makes us feel our feelings gets denigrated as ‘silly.’ But the absurdity and sincerity of <em>Paradise</em> is its strength. And its hero? A Black man, the descendent of a Tuskegee airman and Black pilot, who took a bullet for the president, may feel a bit too nationalistic for the current moment, but it also harkens back to a time when that guy was the hero everyone welcomed, and the one TV wanted. Right now, Sterling K. Brown as Xavier Collins is the hero we need.” – <em><strong>Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Senior Content Director, Entertainment </strong></em></p>

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style and ring in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-years-eve-nail-art-designs"">the new year</a> with a trendy winter coat. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and look out for versatile coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. (And be sure to also look out for non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.)</p>

<p>It’s 2010. I’m 13 years old and I’m on my way to what I <em>know</em> will be one of the craziest nights of my life: <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Justin Bieber </a><em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My World 2.0</a></em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Tour.</a> As I crank my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-straightening-tools"">hair straightener</a> up way too high (RIP to my ends), I pause mid-section and wonder: <em>What am I missing? What would truly make Justin fall in love with me? </em>And then it hits me: my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/favorite-perfumes-editors-picks"">vanilla cupcake perfume</a> from Claire’s.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fragrance"">perfume is aggressively sugary</a> and smells like straight icing. All my mom could hear from downstairs was <em>sksksksksks</em> as I drowned myself in it, fully convinced that if Justin couldn’t see me from the stage, he would at least smell me. And well, not to spoil the ending, but… he did not fall in love with me that night. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2018/11/217863/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-marriage-confirmed"">Congrats, Hailey</a>!</p>



<p>What <em>did</em> happen, though, was far more consequential: that was the night I fell in love with gourmand fragrances, specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla</a>. I never cared what brand it was, as long as the bottle starts with <em>buttery</em>, <em>whipped</em>, or <em>sugar</em>, I was in.</p>



<p>Life was going great until one day, a coworker casually mentions that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-editor-favorites"">favorite fragrance</a> reminds her of what it smells like to be a child. Suddenly, I was overthinking everything. Was I still that 13-year-old hoping to be noticed by JB, or did my signature scent simply need a rebrand?</p>



<p>Turns out, it was both.</p>



<p>When I heard that <a href=""https://thesoapandglory.com/""><strong>Soap &amp; Glory</strong></a> dropped a brand-new, mood-boosting fragrance line, I was intrigued. It covers pretty much every palette. There’s <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-tropical-sunrise/ID=300462740-product""><strong>Tropical Sunrise</strong></a> with pineapple and coconut, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-orchid-bliss/ID=300462734-product""><strong>Orchid Bliss</strong></a> with orchid and sandalwood, <a href=""http://walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-radiant-rose/ID=300462747-product""><strong>Radiant Rose</strong></a> with florals and bergamot, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-watermelon-spritz/ID=300462746-product""><strong>Watermelon Spritz</strong></a> for something bright and juicy, and of course <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-vanilla-licious/ID=300462744-product""><strong>Vanilla-licious</strong></a> with warm caramel and vanilla notes. With a set with this much range, it’s perfect for mixing and matching. And with each fragrance under $20, it felt like the perfect chance to find my signature scent and actually play around with layering.</p>

<p>Since I hadn’t elevated my fragrance in nearly 20 years, I tapped the internet’s favorite fragrance guru, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@paulreactss?lang=en""><strong>Paul Fino</strong></a>, for advice on how to layer scents and whether I can keep being a vanilla girl at my big age. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>Unbothered: So talk to me about vanilla. Do you think it’s having a moment right now? And do you think it’s one of those scents that transcends seasons, like a year-round thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Fino:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Vanilla is year-round for me because there are so many vanilla-adjacent scents. You can find vanillas that lean super creamy, more floral, or even more powdery. That said, vanilla is definitely most popular in fall and winter. People love warm gourmands in colder months, and in summer they usually want something more tropical, fruity, or fresh. But vanilla is not going anywhere. It’s had its moment and it’s become one of those things that just sticks around.</p>



<p><strong>My coworker said vanilla is childish. So when you see something like Vanilla-licious, which feels more grown and sexy but still has that inner-child sweetness, how do you elevate it? How do you layer it so you don’t smell like cupcake perfume from Limited Too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> I 100% get that. A lot of gourmand vanillas can lean artificial or very young. When people say they want a “mature” vanilla, I get it, but “mature” doesn’t mean grandma. It can mean deeper, sexier, more attractive. One of my favorite ways to elevate Vanilla-licious is pairing it with Radiant Rose. Radiant Rose is basically their iconic signature scent, but repackaged and made a little newer and fresher. Rose is romantic, and it deepens the vanilla. The musk in both helps them blend really beautifully. That vanilla-rose combination is gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>I feel like layering fragrance is like cooking. You wouldn’t put mustard and jelly together. So how do you know what works? What’s the science of scent layering, especially for someone new who wants to smell unique but still wearable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> It’s all about understanding notes and scent families. I can usually predict how something will smell based on the notes and how many fragrances I’ve experienced, but a simple rule is to keep things in similar scent profiles if you want to play it safe. Sweets with sweets, gourmands with gourmands. For example, vanilla with pineapple and coconut makes sense because it’s tropical sweet. Vanilla and coconut always work together, so Vanilla-licious with Tropical Sunrise is an easy layering combo.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952222.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What about combinations that are risky?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Sometimes mixing two different ends of the spectrum can clash, but sometimes a clash is exactly what makes it interesting. That’s how you get people to ask, “What are you wearing?” Also, fragrance wears differently on everyone, so experimentation matters.</p>



<p><strong>Are these meant to be layered only with each other, or can you layer them with perfumes too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> You can absolutely layer these with perfumes. They’re body mists, but they have really good projection and longevity, especially for the price point. They’re great as base layers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a method for layering? Like an order you follow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong>Yes. I do heaviest to lightest. I start with my deepest scent first, like a heavy wood or musk, then layer lighter scents on top. It’s kind of like how fragrance is built, with base notes, heart notes, and top notes.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952224.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>If someone just wants one scent from the line for self-care, like a shower that makes you feel calm and relaxed, which one is it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Orchid Bliss. Hands down. If you want truly relaxing and calming, Orchid Bliss is the one. It’s slightly sweet, it has sandalwood, and there are also notes like vanilla and pistachio in there, but they feel more subtle and deeper in the background. It’s like a spa in a bottle.</p>



<p><strong>Why not Vanilla-licious for calm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Vanilla makes me feel confident. Like, super confident. Orchid Bliss gives more calm spa-night energy. If you’re tired, overworked, and want the most relaxing shower, I’d do scrub, wash, body butter, and spray in Orchid Bliss, then top it with your favorite perfume if you want extra oomph.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>After talking to Paul, I realized it was never really about retiring vanilla. It was about wearing it with intention. It was about keeping the sweetness but adding depth. It’s time to let my inner 13-year-old have her moment, while my grown self makes my scent feel polished. So yes, I’m still a vanilla girl. I’m just a vanilla girl with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-vanilla-perfume""><em>range</em></a> now.</p>

<p><em>Music journalist Kelly Washington travelled to the Playa Pacha at the FIVE LUXE JBR to profile <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a>, the queen of K-House and techno. </em></p>



<p>It is around midnight at the Playa Pacha Pool and Beach Club in the <a href=""https://luxejbr.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"">FIVE LUXE JBR in Dubai</a>. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gerdjansonofficial/?hl=en"">German DJ Gerd Janson</a> has just dropped a remix of Stevie Nick’s “Edge Of Seventeen” when <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/dj-peggy-gou-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a> appears next to him, diamond-clad in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/q_millinery/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Q Park Millinery</a> sparkly bandana, with a cat on the front reading “Mew Mew,” paired with a black two-piece. I am standing behind the decks, watching her slink into the space with her entourage, as the crowd reacts to her presence. Someone next to me breathlessly exclaims “queen”, in a way that seems involuntarily. As the crowd howls in unison and Gou clasps their hands, I am struck by how comfortable she looks.</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that once upon a time, Gou was just starting out in the underground scene; she seems as if she was plonked down on earth, already a successful 34-year-old, with her knowing, winning smile and covered in patchwork tattoos, cigarette in one hand, tending to the decks with the other. The ‘female DJ’ as an archetype has gone through many iterations, but never before has she propelled herself into mainstream stardom the way Peggy Gou has. In a short space of time, she achieved global fame, headlined major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, created global hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCz5y84dwuA"">(It Goes Like) Nanana,</a>” and became the first Korean to play the <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/berghain-linux"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">world-renowned legacy club Berghain.</a> </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952202.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The FIVE LUXE JBR is flooded with Brits escaping the December chill at home, as well as Americans, Russians, and other European clientele. Backed by the hotel’s luxury ecosystem project, the FIVE LUXE JBR has a “do more with less” ethos and is 100% solar powered, making it the world’s highest-rated 5-Star Hotel green building under LEED v4 (the international standard for high-performance green buildings). FIVE’s service is the best I’ve ever experienced (even my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-clothes-accessories-2025#slide-8"">battered Vagabond handbag</a> gets its own seat at every table), and I’m grateful I packed my <a href=""https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/swarovski"">Swarovski Loop ear plugs</a> (the only sparkly thing I own) so I just about fit in with the bold and flash crowd.</p>



<p>I ask Peggy to describe Dubai’s club scene in three words, to which she enthusiastically responds “energetic, diverse and growing!” Considering a huge 90% of the population are expats, she’s not wrong. <a href=""https://palmjumeirah.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FIVE Palm Jeremiah</a> (also in Dubai) even boasts its own recording studio and it’s clear the team has set their sights on Dubai as their next ultimate party destination. They have the cash, and they plan to spend it on the best talent money can buy; hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlcoxofficial/?hl=en"">Carl Cox</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marcocarola/?hl=en"">Marco Carola </a>and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/solomun/?hl=en"">Solomun</a> at Playa Pacha. </p>



<p>When she was 18, Peggy Gou went to study at the <a href=""https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/study-at-lcf?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332830344&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-G_q8pyDEQVeFZGpmfJ8Qdf3lAZE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82J0Y4h9qKJbh7cGoshAwRUZaq-07o72iJKm9Ca2eli2Uxv2PBe2o4sxoCvVEQAvD_BwE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London College of Fashion</a> with hopes of becoming a designer, then a photographer, then a stylist. But she’d always been passionate about music, and eventually found a way to use her skills in fashion promotion to fill a gap in electronic music. While most house and techno DJs dress understated, she knew her style would play a pivotal role in her success once she began producing music and cutting her teeth at small venues in London and Berlin. I ask her why these grassroots spaces are important right now, and her critical eye shines: “Club culture continues to influence many aspects of creative industries far beyond music. Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it,” Gou says. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it.</p><cite>dj peggy gou</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Above all, Gou is a strategic and smart producer, and is incredibly intentional about what she puts out and why. Back in July 2018, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Manchester in the UK, and a label called Defected Records reigned supreme among most of my friends who were into house music. It was on this label that Gou released a remix of Shakedown’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“At Night (Peggy Gou’s Acid Journey Remix)”</a> that defined the summer. As catchy, accessible and pop-fluent as the chorus was, it never seemed to get old, and hit #1 on the UK Official Dance Singles Chart. Everywhere you went, the At Night remix was playing. The pulsing vocal could be heard from Manchester, to London, to party island Ibiza, often heard in a rendition similar to that of a football chant. With this single, Gou propelled herself into the dance music world, then onto the global stage, and hasn’t slowed down since. </p>



<p>Blowing up in electronic music as a woman, can be your best and worst nightmare all at once. Overnight, you are successful, impressive, and adored. But six months later you are likely to fall victim to criticism for <em>something</em>, like being too commercial or having rich parents. Her haters will say that she sold out, that once Peggy Gou had everyone feeling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“much better… at night</a>”, she was no longer the underground DJ sensation who cut her teeth in clubs in London and Berlin – they’d lost her to A-list status. Charli XCX touched on this in <a href=""https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-death-of-cool"">her recent substack </a>titled “The Death of Cool.” XCX wrote, “I have always rejected the idea that art, film, persona or music becoming commercial means it cannot also be considered cool. The rejection of commerciality ‘just because’ is such a boring and immature argument that is perhaps more suited to some mediums than others but in general I find to be elitist in a way that does not thrill me whatsoever,” she continued. “Disliking something purely because of its widespread popularity or links to commercialism comes with a distinctly art school type energy that is super triggering to me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952204.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Charli XCX is right, artists can’t take this chatter personally – just because some fans in the electronic music space have a habit of tarnishing those who rise to success quickly, especially if you’re a woman. At the same time, it is not wholly uncommon to witness legends (often male), playing what can only be described as the worst set you’ve seen in your life, on no sleep, without consequence or fallout in the scene.</p>



<p>When cool points are gained on the basis of youth and niche references, mainstream success can become the enemy in certain circles. Once something transcends the underground, it transforms into something else entirely. But Peggy never forgot her roots; a genre-blending selector with range, she’s known for her energetic but composed sets. She often plays a combination of pulsing house, techno and break beats, dropping tunes from artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dj_seinfeld/"">DJ Seinfeld</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andrezimmer_/?hl=en"">Andre Zimmer,</a> as well as hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dmx_krew/?hl=en"">DMX Krew</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/regularfantasy/"">Regularfantasy</a> on her label. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>… this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world.</p><cite>peggy gou on mentoring other djs</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Sure, it’s inevitable that those who are successful will be criticized. Someone’s song blows up, they get big, and then we get bored until they do something else remarkable. But in this corner of entertainment, it’s silly to dismiss a DJ because of their accolades. To paint a picture, a Berlin-based journalist I met recently told me (with a straight face) that because Gou is never seen in the local pubs in Berlin, it must mean she doesn’t actually live there (she does). So let’s set the record straight, aside from electronic music’s swirling pool of cool that has a habit of eating the principles it so vehemently defends, I can confirm that Gou is touring the world, looking sensational, and most importantly very, very good at her job. </p>



<p>To get a broader picture of how she shaped her taste, I ask Gou to name an album, movie and a book that was essential in her cultural education. For her movie she selects cult classic <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (which tracks with her style), the book is Nietzsche’s <em>Ubermensch </em>(there’s that critical thinking), and a true music head, she sites Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-d-the-catalogue-live/1572506374"">3-D: The Catalogue (Live) </a>as the ultimate education. Gou explains how she still tries to make it down to grassroots venues, “not just as a DJ but more importantly as a raver, which I always find inspiring and cathartic.” Her dedication to a range of culture shows in the sets she plays, so I think we can forgive her for not sharing a pint with us at the local boozer.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952205.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>In March 2019, Gou realized she wanted to own her own music and uplift other artists on the rise, so she created <em>Gudu Records</em> and released her own album titled “Moment”. A few years ago, I interviewed the<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/matisa.dj/""> Italian DJ Matisa</a>, who has released music on Peggy Gou’s label. When I asked her about her experience as a woman in the industry, she credited Gou as a brilliant mentor to herself and others in the dance music community, adding that she’s very hard working and down to earth. I ask Gou about her mission to lift up other DJs like Matisa, and she stresses the importance of not only supporting new talent via <em>Gudu</em> but also including the newcomers on her line-ups IRL, “this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world”. </p>



<p>With rising costs for venues and AI music creation causing a stir, who knows where 2026 will take electronic music. I ask Gou if she’s optimistic about where the industry is heading, in terms of building a better future for those that follow her success and she leaves me with a gem of hope that mirrors the energy she brings to the industry: “I’m optimistic for sure, but as with anything growing as fast as our industry, it won’t be without its challenges.”<br /></p>

<p>Forget tortoiseshell, leopard, and cow prints for a second — deer print is about to steal their thunder. It’s also one of the easiest prints to recreate. Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season.

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional.

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFiwwTohOJ6/?hl=en"">Catherine Gibbs</a> is perfect.</p>

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated.

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson.

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>Gianettos says that there’s something so chic about a sharp bob that grazes the chin and that it can elevate any outfit. “It feels very confident, effortless, cool-girl,” says Giannetos. “It can be worn wavy for an everyday style or straight for a very sleek, edgy look,” — much like this cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DE3nIljNoix/?hl=en&amp;img_index=3"">Meredith Duxbury</a>. “I like to use <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fadvanced-hairstyle-sleek-it-iron-straight-heatspray-pimprod2046287%3Fsku%3D2629284"">L’Oreal Paris’ Sleek It Iron Straight Hairspray</a> to tame any frizz that distracts from the moment,” says Giannetos. </p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>

<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>



<p>Try layering <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcherry-ambition-eau-de-parfum-P508411"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition</a> (cherry, plum, vanilla marshmallow) with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP518376"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali Freedom Musk Latte Eau de Parfum</a> (latte, chocolate musk, and cinnamon).

<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>

Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>

<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>
