<p>Happy Halloween, everyone! The astrological vibe for the creepiest time of the year is nothing short of fa-boo-lous. The Moon enters Pisces in the morning of October 31st, harmonizing with the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sun in Scorpio</a> and squaring Uranus retrograde in Gemini. We’ll be in the mood for amusement and pleasure, making this spooky holiday bewitching. It’s a day you’ll want to sink your fangs into. Have a total scream, get wicked, and read your horror-scope below! <br /></p>



<h2>Aries </h2>



<p>It might take a lot of effort and coaxing to get you out and about, mainly because you’re thinking of having a low-key night carving pumpkins and baking pies. Rather than having a bunch of peeps over, you could invite one friend to enjoy your homemade desserts. They’ll relish the flavor and ask to take leftovers with them. When alone, you’ll indulge in a luxurious bath with Halloween-themed bubbles.</p>



<h2>Taurus </h2>



<p>There is enchantment and positivity in the air, urging you to use your power to help others. Your witchy ways can motivate those you care about to do better and change their lives significantly. Being the shoulder your pals cry and lean on, after several Spooky Spiders or Caramel Ales, allows you to offer insight on matters and advise them to evolve. Face the facts, you are their role model! </p>



<h2>Gemini </h2>



<p>Since you’re the charismatic storyteller of the zodiac, tell your pals a true-life scary hair-raiser about a haunting you experienced. After you’ve shocked your friends to the core, let one of them take over, then another, and so forth. The best way to connect is by sharing frightful narratives that bring chills, such as these. At the end of the evening, nominate the best terror-tale to take home a prize.</p>



<h2>Cancer </h2>



<p>Family is important to you, so use Halloween as a gateway to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10722191/venerate-ancestors-year-round"">connect with your ancestors</a> in another realm. Cleanse your altar with copal incense and declutter the area. Place pictures of deceased loved ones on the stand with flowers (marigolds call in the deceased) and a few of their favorite foods or items. Talk to them and celebrate their life. Lean into your shared pasts to honor their memory. </p>



<h2>Leo</h2>



<p>Your intuition is peaking, allowing you to receive psychic downloads from the universe. Take note of what you’re seeing in your journal for the future. These visions could help you make decisions when you come to a crossroads, so pay attention. You’re being told about specific events and situations for a reason and you should use the information to your advantage. Listen with an open heart and mind, Leo!</p>



<h2>Virgo </h2>



<p>The soulful Moon in Pisces is getting cozy in your seventh house of partnerships this Halloween. If you’re in a ‘ship, cuddle up with your boo on the couch and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">watch a horror movie</a>. If you’re unattached, invite friends or your crush over and play a game that builds intimacy — no, the Ouija board isn’t advisable because it can awaken spirits, perhaps “Never Have I Ever” will be fun. </p>



<h2>Libra </h2>



<p>Although you’re known for your tender temper, this Halloween, your besties will have a chance to see that you are a wolf in sheep’s clothing. You might decide to dress as a character that allows everybody to see that you have at least two sides. No matter what you wear, your rizz will make a grand impression. Don’t fear, your look will be killer!</p>



<h2>Scorpio </h2>



<p>Slay the social scene! Mingle and party with your crew. You may even hit up a few events with everyone. Fortunately, Halloween is on a Friday, which means you can sleep in the following day if the gathering lasts until the wee hours of Saturday morning. Apple bobbing and the Monster Mash will be exhausting, so dance your heart out to Bloody Mary, knowing you can rest and relax all weekend. </p>



<h2>Sagittarius </h2>



<p>Opting to stay in and hand out treats to trick-or-treaters doesn’t mean you’re basic and boring. The opposite rings true. You’re bringing joy to children everywhere by handing out lollipops or other cool goodies they might like. If you want to embrace your inner child, throw on a mask and ask your neighbor to fill your bucket with sweets. Don’t be too shy to knock on their door.</p>



<h2>Capricorn </h2>



<p>For once, you’re not being a tryhard when hosting a soirée. You’re going with the flow and being chill — as long as no one spills red wine on your white carpet or copies your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/halloween-costumes-ideas-pop-culture"">Halloween costume</a>. Regardless, the drinks are flowing, and no one is going, indicating you know how to throw an awesome Halloween shindig. This is a fantastic step towards adulting, so totally own it and cut loose!</p>



<h2>Aquarius </h2>



<p>Looking for a ghoulish time? A bunch of your colleagues want to team up and prank your boss. At first, you might be unsure if you wish to partake in the hijinks, but once your employer lets it be known that they’re down to clown (as long as no one takes it too far), it’s on. This activity helps you to bond with coworkers in ways you never thought possible. </p>



<h2>Pisces</h2>



<p>Pisces Since the transiting Moon in Pisces syncs up with your Sun by sign, this is a time of new beginnings for you. Use the magical time to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">set an intention that brings you luck</a> and makes your dreams a reality. You can manifest anything in your heart if it aligns with your path. Meditate on your goals, light a white candle, and bring your vision to life.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, the sky is still rippling with the emotional, existential echoes of last week’s Jupiter–Chiron square, and many of us are noticing which parts of our inner child still feel exposed, reactive, or defensive. Jupiter in Cancer wants to nurture and expand whatever it’s touching — but squaring Chiron in Aries can feel like an overwhelming magnifying glass on the sore spots we’ve tried to outgrow. You may notice themes around independence vs. support, overfunctioning vs. receiving, or childhood family roles vs. your current adult boundaries. The key? Don’t try to “fix” yourself… move with yourself. Let your body release some of the internal pressure. Dance, cry, write, scream, walk barefoot in the grass. You’re allowed to <em>feel</em> and <em>heal</em> at the same time.<br /><br />And here comes a bit of lightness: Mercury, Planet of Communication, enters Sagittarius on October 29th, helping the collective release some of that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio heaviness we’ve been marinating in</a>. Mercury in Scorpio had us speaking in riddles, keeping secrets, obsessing over the unsaid, or analyzing every look and silence. We’ve been reading between the lines for weeks — not just in others, but in ourselves too. There’s beauty in that depth, but also a risk of becoming paranoid, withdrawn, or overly cynical. Now, Mercury in Sagittarius swings open the windows. It doesn’t whisper; it shouts joyfully from the rooftop. This is your permission slip to share what you’ve learned, even if it’s still messy or raw. Say it with humor, with honesty, with heart.</p>



<p>Also: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is in its final degrees of Scorpio</a> this week. If you trace back to September 22nd, when Mars first entered the sign of the phoenix, you might notice that you’ve been undergoing some sort of personal mission — a deep, unflinching investigation of power, passion, and purpose. As Mars approaches 29° of Scorpio, it becomes a culmination moment. A final test. A last temptation. Or, a moment of confirmation that yes, you’ve changed — even if no one else knows how much. The shift becomes clear as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, but this week is your last chance to harvest the lessons of your own underworld journey.You may find yourself asking: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-equinox-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects""><em>What did I begin around the equinox</em></a><em> that’s reaching its climax now? What am I finally ready to release — or claim?</em> This week doesn’t rush you to answer, but it will keep nudging you toward clarity.<br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, just because it looks like stillness doesn’t mean it’s not power. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, your ruling planet, is finishing its six-week trek through Scorpio</a> — your sector of intimacy, control, transformation, and energetic merging. But unlike some of the more dramatic Mars moments, this finale doesn’t scream. It simmers. You’ve been slowly, maybe even secretly, building momentum around something deeply personal. Whether it’s a financial entanglement, a physical craving, or an emotional reckoning, this week could reveal just how much you’ve outgrown the need to “win” at all costs. Do you really need to dominate, or are you just scared of disappearing if you don’t? Mars in Scorpio has been showing you how to reclaim your power without losing your soul. Now’s the time to integrate what you’ve learned about vulnerability, pleasure, and restraint.<br /><br />The week ends with a mic drop — or at least a one-liner. Mercury enters Sagittarius on the 29th, launching you into a more playful, philosophical headspace. Suddenly, you’re inspired to sign up for that course, book that spontaneous trip, or tell a story that’s 80% true but 100% entertaining. And honestly? We need that from you. Just be mindful that not everyone’s as down for blunt jokes or semi-accurate monologues as you are. Mercury here wants you to express your belief systems, but do it like a good stand-up set: hit ‘em with the truth and the punchline.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, you can’t carry someone else’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-closure-ex-meaning"">relationship baggage</a> and call it love. Mars is wrapping up its journey through your sector of partnership, and if it’s been exposing some passive-aggressive tension or behind-the-scenes resentment, you’re not imagining things. But this final stretch isn’t about confrontation… it’s about clarity. You’ve likely realized that your energy has limits, and the desire to merge has to be mutual. This week, ask yourself: <em>What does it look like to stay connected while still protecting your peace?</em> Mars in Scorpio didn’t just reveal others’ patterns; it showed you your own default settings in connection, especially the ways you overextend or under-express. Let this week be an energetic recalibration in love, business, and even your relationship with your own reflection.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your “let’s talk about the money” zone. Starting October 29th, you may find yourself talking about loans, inheritances, taxes, or even kink. Mercury in Sagittarius isn’t subtle, and when it activates your sector of shared resources and taboo topics, you’re basically in your <em>Succession</em> era — equal parts honest and unhinged. Don’t be surprised if a conversation gets way deeper than expected. Or way weirder. You’re learning to speak your truths even when they’re not pretty — and laugh about them when you’re done.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, you don’t always need to optimize yourself. Sometimes you just need to rest. Mars has been powering through your sector of routine, health, and responsibility since September, and now it’s almost out. This week, instead of trying to finish everything on your to-do list like you’re being filmed for a productivity documentary, check in with your body. Where are you pushing too hard? What are you avoiding by staying “busy”? Mars in Scorpio taught you how to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">confront burnout patterns</a> and perfectionist tendencies. Let yourself integrate. It’s not weakness to pause — it’s strategy. Your real power move this week is listening to your body when it whispers, not waiting until it screams.<br /><br />On a lighter note, your crush might start texting in full paragraphs again. Mercury (your ruler!) enters your opposite sign of Sagittarius on the 29th, lighting up your one-on-one connection zone. This means: more banter, bolder flirting, and possibly deeper conversations with someone who’s actually emotionally available (what a concept). It’s cuffing season, but with memes. You’re feeling more honest, and so are they — even if it’s oversharing in a “sorry-not-sorry” way. Don’t overanalyze the vibe. Lean in. Say what you mean. And maybe download Hinge again… but only if your last message wasn’t left on read.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, not all passion is sustainable… but some of it is worth the mess. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio is finishing its slow burn</a> through your romance, creativity, and pleasure zone, and this week is your chance to reflect on what, or who, lit you up since late September. Maybe you’ve taken bigger risks with your art, your heart, or your bed sheets. Maybe you’ve confused chaos with chemistry once or twice (hey, it’s a learning curve). But this final stretch of Mars in Scorpio isn’t about shaming yourself for what you wanted… <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-are-responsive-spontaneous-desire-styles"">it’s about refining your desires</a>. Who turns you on intellectually, spiritually, creatively? That’s your real type. And no, they don’t have to be perfect, just emotionally literate and occasionally funny.<br /><br />Speaking of funny… Mercury’s got jokes now. As of October 29th, Mercury enters Sagittarius and turns your everyday life into a sitcom. You’ll find humor in the absurdity of routines, and honestly? It’s medicine. Your health, work, or to-do list may have felt heavy under Mercury in Scorpio, but now you’re allowed to laugh at the chaos. Expect random inspiration to hit while brushing your teeth or running errands. Talk to your coworkers like they’re your podcast co-hosts. Say the weird joke. Eat the protein bar. Mercury in this part of your chart is a reminder: healing isn’t always solemn — sometimes it’s hilarious.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, your power doesn’t need an audience — but that hasn’t stopped you from delivering a performance anyway. Mars is in its final stretch through your home, family, and foundations sector, and even if you didn’t mean to stir things up… you did. But here’s the twist: it was necessary. Since September 22nd, you’ve been privately unpacking your relationship with roots, rest, and responsibility. Some Leos have moved, redecorated, cut ties, or cried in the bathtub — all valid. Now as Mars approaches 29°, the question is: <em>What emotional habitat are you building for yourself?</em> This week is less about dramatic change and more about internal integration. You’ve grown, but have you <em>noticed</em> how differently you respond to old triggers? That’s your Mars work, right there.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury enters your joy sector like a chaotic but loveable bestie. Starting October 29th, Mercury in Sag lights up your romance, play, and passion zone. Translation: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/flirty-text-messages-examples"">your texts might get flirty</a>, your jokes land louder, and you may be tempted to post a thirst trap just to feel something. Mercury in Sag wants you to remember what it’s like to fall in love with your own damn mind — and maybe someone else’s too. Say yes to the spontaneous invite. Go on that “just for fun” date. Make something dumb and beautiful. You’re in your comedic rom-com era, and even if it gets messy, it’ll be entertaining as hell.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, you’re not here to be a spreadsheet… you’re here to be the whole story. Mars in Scorpio has spent the past six weeks in your communication and expression sector, and it’s been a <em>lot</em>. You’ve probably had to have difficult conversations, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communication-style-mercury-sign-meaning-astrology"">revisit the way you communicate boundaries</a>, or even learn how to stop over-explaining when someone clearly isn’t listening. But now, as Mars prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you’re being asked to <em>trust your voice</em>. Not the polished, PR-ready version — the messy, tender, weirdly specific one. That’s the one that hits. This week, stop editing yourself in real-time. Mars has taught you that speaking up doesn’t always mean yelling… sometimes it means whispering the truth and letting it echo.<br /><br />Now Mercury, your ruling planet, is in full Sagittarian chaos. On October 29th, Mercury enters your home and emotional roots sector, and let’s just say… your inner child is taking the wheel. Expect random family stories to surface, nostalgia to hit during a random song, and for your jokes to get more dark-humor-meets-toddler-energy. You might also feel inspired to say things to family members (chosen or blood) that you’ve held in too long. Mercury here can heal old wounds — but only if you’re willing to talk about the awkward stuff. Say it clumsily if you must. Say it while laughing. Just don’t swallow it anymore.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, you’ve spent enough time calculating your worth… now it’s time to feel it. Mars is finishing its journey through your money and values zone, and chances are your relationship with resources — physical <em>and</em> energetic — has gone through a few plot twists. Maybe you’ve been investing more, spending less, or just noticing where your energy leaks. Mars in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level; it wants you to understand your <em>emotional</em> relationship to currency. What’s your price for peace? What are you no longer willing to sell out for? This week is about remembering that your value doesn’t require validation. Let the final flare of Mars give you permission to invest in yourself like you’d invest in your dream. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s entering your chatty, curious, slightly unhinged phase. On October 29th, the planet of communication enters your learning and local community zone. Expect a surge of texts, new ideas, and the occasional accidental overshare on IG stories. You’re talking faster, thinking bigger, and possibly planning three projects at once. But don’t forget: not everything needs to be monetized or turned into a brand. Mercury in Sag is here to help you <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9602100/online-learning-websites-classes"">rediscover the joy of learning something</a> <em>just because</em>. Be curious, not calculating. Read a weird book. Ask a question you already know the answer to. Let wonder replace your inner critic, just for a while.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’ve burned it all down and you’ve rebuilt it from scratch. Now this week, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">your mission is to breathe</a>. Mars, your traditional ruler, has been in your sign for the past five weeks — and it’s been both a revival and a reckoning. You may have felt hyper-aware of your desires, more impulsive than usual, and somehow both exhausted and energized. As Mars prepares to exit your sign and enter Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a phase of integration. What did this version of you fight for? What did it finally walk away from? This isn’t about constant transformation anymore — it’s about ownership. Mars at the final degrees of Scorpio is like the silent samurai: calm, dangerous, and done with drama. You’ve grown in ways you don’t need to prove. Trust that your actions speak loud enough now.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Mercury’s ready to spend your money or make you laugh about it. On October 29th, Mercury exits your sign and enters your income and values zone. Suddenly, your inner voice shifts from existential philosopher to impulsive travel agent. Expect a mix of financial epiphanies and random purchases — a tarot deck here, a pair of platform boots there. But deeper than that, you’re learning to speak about your worth more directly. Mercury in Sag gives you the gift of comedic timing and financial clarity… use both. Talk about your rates. Joke about capitalism. Buy the expensive oat milk if it makes your inner child giggle.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re already feeling the buzz, Sagittarius — Mercury enters your sign this week (on the 29th), and suddenly your inner monologue sounds like a TED Talk, stand-up set, and motivational speech all in one. But before you go launching into a thousand new projects, take a moment to reflect on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the final full week of Mars in Scorpio</a> lighting up your spiritual sector. How have your subconscious patterns, intuitive nudges, and quiet obsessions shaped your motivations lately? This Mars transit has pulled you deep into your own psyche — not to make you spiral, but to help you break through. Notice what fears you’ve confronted, what secrets have surfaced, and what taboos you’re learning to reclaim. There’s strength in your shadows.<br /><br />With Mercury in your sign and a full moon in Taurus coming up next week, you’re entering a period where your words have weight — and your jokes could accidentally become spells. Use your voice with care. You might be more impulsive, excitable, or brutally honest now, and while that’s part of your charm, Sagittarius, don’t use it as a shield. Be curious rather than combative. The best breakthroughs this week come when you speak your truth <em>and</em> stay open to being surprised by others’.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, if you’ve been lowkey exhausted the past few weeks, Mars in Scorpio may be to blame — but also, thank. As this transit wraps up, you’re getting one last push to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ending-friendship-emotional-wellbeing"">reassess the dynamics of your friendships</a>, community, and long-term goals. Maybe someone in your circle showed their true colors, or maybe you realized you’ve outgrown certain group projects. Mars has been pruning your social garden, Capricorn, and now you get to decide what, and who, is worth watering. Make space for the relationships that feel reciprocal, collaborative, and inspiring.<br /><br />Mercury’s shift into Sagittarius on October 29 helps you loosen up and laugh again. This transit lands in your house of closure and healing, so your humor may lean toward the dry, surreal, or even absurd… but it’s cathartic. You might find yourself journaling more, reconnecting with spirituality, or speaking to a therapist (or your dream journal) with newfound honesty. Don’t underestimate the power of being funny <em>and</em> vulnerable. Your dreams may be extra vivid now, so keep track of them. They’re sending you clues. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re wrapping up a powerful chapter in your career life, Aquarius, as Mars in Scorpio spends its final days in your public image sector. Since September, this has been a time of bold moves, boundary-setting, and behind-the-scenes ambition. Maybe you’ve been wrestling with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-be-successful"">what “success” even means to you</a>, and whether it still fits the version of you you’re becoming. This week, instead of forcing momentum, try to integrate the lessons you’ve already learned. What motivates you to create? Who do you want to impact? Let your intuition be the driver now, not your ego.<br /><br />When Mercury moves into fellow fire sign Sagittarius on the 29th, your social life lights up with new connections, ideas, and invitations. You’re thinking big picture, brainstorming wild solutions, and probably texting five group chats at once. Let yourself flirt with possibility. This is the week to say yes to spontaneous convos, brainstorms, or even signing up for an online class you forgot you bookmarked. Some of the best collaborations ahead will come from unexpected DMs and late-night debates with your fellow weirdos. Say what you believe, then evolve it in real time.</p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Mars, Planet of Action, has spent the last month stirring your desire for truth, travel, and transformation — and now, as it prepares to exit Scorpio next week, you get a final chance to process what it’s really taught you. Maybe you’ve been craving adventure, questioning old belief systems, or feeling itchy in your comfort zone. But before you jet off or burn it all down, Pisces, take stock. What ideas or philosophies have truly sustained you? Where have you gotten lost in the sauce of someone else’s worldview, and where are you ready to claim your own? This final week is a portal for recalibration.<br /><br />With Mercury entering Sagittarius on October 29, your career house lights up, and suddenly everyone wants a piece of you. Your words hold power now, so use them intentionally. Whether you’re pitching yourself, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/resume-tips"">updating your résumé</a>, or just posting something meaningful online, trust that the right people are listening. And don’t be afraid to bring your whole self — messy, mystical, hilarious — to the table. You’re allowed to be multidimensional (you are a Mutable Water sign after all).

At least not when it comes to the<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> scariest movies</a> of all time.<br /><br />In our opinion, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11534610/angelica-ross-emma-roberts-black-trans-women-hollywood"">horror movies</a> are best consumed as a group activity. Go to the theaters in packs. Jolt at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">the jump scares</a>. Emerge with your heart beating a <em>bit </em>too fast. Pretend, for a while, that you won't have to face the darkness alone. Inevitably, of course, you will. At some point after the movie, you'll separate from your friends and find yourself alone in your bedroom to sleep. Scenes from the movie might nip at your memory, reminding you of its<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11255896/m3gan-movie-fashion-costume-design""> creepiest moments</a> and that the horrors might just exist outside of the movie theater, too. That's when the fun of the horror movie <em>really</em> begins.<br /><br />So, if you’re looking for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">a spooky flick to watch</a> with friends and then keep you up all night, here are our picks for the 30 scariest movies ever — if you dare.<figure><figcaption><h2><em>Sinners (2025)</em></h2>From Ryan Coogler (the visionary behind <em>Black Panther </em>and <em>Creed</em>) and starring Michael B. Jordan, <em>Sinners</em> is about twin brothers Smoke and Stack (bth played by Jordan) who are trying to leave their troubled lives behind by returning to their hometown, but they discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back. As the tagline goes: “You keep dancing with the devil, one day he’s gonna follow you home.” Also starring Wunmi Mosaku,  Hailee Steinfeld, Jack O’Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller and Delroy Lindo. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Weapons (2025)</em></h2>Written and directed by <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1199107/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zach Cregger</a>, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11926872/weapons-movie-julia-garner-review-spoilers"">Weapons</a></em> focuses on the disappearance of nearly an entire classroom except for one boy, Alex (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9816029/?ref_=fn_all_nme_1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cary Christopher</a>). When parents review the security footage in their homes, they realize that all of the missing kids woke up and ran out the door into the darkness at 2:17am on the same night. With a community searching for answers, fingers point to their teacher Justine (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/juliagarnerofficial/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Julia Garner</a>) as the culprit responsible for a mystery local police can’t even begin to solve. And as you watch, you’ll be searching for answers, too. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Nosferatu</em></h2>A Dracula tale, Robert Eggers’ <em>Nosferatu</em> is tackles the age-old story of an obsession between a haunted young woman (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lilyrose_depp/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lily-Rose Depp)</a> and the terrifying vampire (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/billskarsgard_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bill Skarsgård</a>) infatuated with her. As it does, horror unfolds.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Fresh (2022)</em></h2>Like most good horror movies, <em>Fresh</em> starts like a fairytale: a woman named Noa (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/where-the-crawdads-sing-movie-interview"">Daisy Edgar Jones</a>) quitting dating apps and subsequently meets the supposedly perfect man, Steve (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/04/10427343/sebastian-stan-denise-gough-sex-scenes-monday-movie-interview"">Sebastian Stan</a>). When she accepts his invitation to a romantic weekend getaway, she finds out their love story isn't the happily ever after she was hoping for: her new man has been hiding some, ahem, unusual appetites.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Longlegs</em> (2024)<br /></h2><br />A little bit goofy and a whole lot of scary, <em>Longlegs</em> follows FBI agent Lee Harker (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) as she takes on the trials and tribulations of an unsolved serial killer case. Things take a twisted turn when she encounters a connection to the killer and has to race against time (almost as fast as your beating heart) before he mercilessly claims another family as victims.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Talk To Me </em>(2023) </h2><br />Perhaps the best horror movie to come out of Australia since <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2321549/""><em>The Babadook</em></a><em> </em>(more on that one later), <em>Talk To Me </em>combines A24 film style with a skin-crawlingly twisted story. The premise is that a group of childhood friends discover an embalmed hand that lets them communicate with spirits, which they then turn into a thrilling party game. However, things take a dark turn when the high-stakes game goes too far.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Witch </em>(2015)</h2><br />The debut film by now-notable horror director <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3211470/"">Robert Eggers</a>, <em>The Witch</em> tells the story of a family in 1600s New England whose youngest son suddenly disappears. Since the eldest daughter, Thomasin (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-anya-taylor-joy-movies-tv-shows"">Anya Taylor-Joy</a>), was the last person with the baby, the family blames her and suspicions<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/modern-witch-tarot-deck-reviews""> of witchcraft</a> begin to swirl. Slowly, paranoia ensues and the family unravels.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Midsommar</em> (2019)</h2><br />From the horror genius mind of Ari Aster, <em>Midsommar</em> follows the story of Dani (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11108027/florence-pugh-makeup-venice-film-festival"">Florence Pugh</a>) as she journeys to a rural village in Sweden with her boyfriend and his friends. What starts off as a picturesque trip to take part in a midsummer festival turns into a freaky hellscape run by a violent cult. Perhaps the most unsettling part of this movie is the mix of the sunny, idyllic setting with truly terrifying, dark scenes.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (1968)</h2><br /><br />Rosemary (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001201/"">Mia Farrow</a>), a pregnant newlywed living in a Manhattan brownstone, has a feeling that something isn't right with her baby — or with her neighbors. Though she's told not to take those suspicions seriously by the more ""rational"" people in her life, aka her husband (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001023/"">John Cassavetes</a>), Rosemary should listen to her gut, call her mom, and get out of that apartment. Alas. Instead, she's impregnated by the devil, and her baby is to be used in a Satanic ritual. <em>Rosemary's Baby </em>conjures up an unforgettable atmosphere of second-guessing that bleeds into outright fear.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Psycho</em> (1960)</h2><br />After stealing money from her boss, Marion Crane (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001463/"">Janet Leigh</a>) leaves town. After a day of traveling, she seeks refuge in a decrepit motel — but danger she encounters at this hotel is far worse than law enforcement. Marion never could've guessed the secrets the hotel's innocuous-seeming manager, Norman Bates (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000578/"">Anthony Perkins</a>), was hiding. <em>Psycho </em>manages to be one of the scariest movies ever without <em>any </em>gore whatsoever. Instead, the movie will make you question where all of your casual decisions might be leading you.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Don't Look Now</em> (1973)</h2><br />John Baxter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000661/"">Donald Sutherland</a>) and his wife Laura (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001046/"">Julie Christie</a>) are devastated when their daughter dies. In the aftermath, John takes a job restoring a church in Venice. There, they meet two strange old women who claim to see their daughter. <em>Don't Look Now </em>is a stunning work of psychological horror adapted from a story by Daphne du Maurier, the author of <em>Rebecca</em>. It's light on gore but big on scares.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hush</em> (2016) </h2><em>Hush </em>is a creative entry into the horror genre. The movie follows an intense cat-and-mouse game between a stalker and his unwilling victim. Maddie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2318089/"">Kate Siegel</a>) is a deaf author who lives alone. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302330/"">John Gallagher Jr.</a> is the masked killer who thinks she's going to be an easy target. He's wrong.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Exorcist </em>(1973)</h2><br />Good luck getting Regan's (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000304/"">Linda Blair</a>) ravings out of your mind after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>. Over the course of this horror classic, Regan goes from being a sweet elementary-schooler to a foul-mouth demon. And no, puberty isn't to blame. The devil is.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>28 Days Later </em>(2002)</h2><br />What would<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/01/11257325/the-last-of-us-hbo-premiere-everything-to-know""> the zombie apocalypse</a> actually look like? How would it reshape the world? After a virus contaminates the population, civilization quickly crumbles. <em>28 Days Later </em>is a movie about the flimsiness of our institutions, and how susceptible we are to something like the rage virus. Oh, and it stars a young <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0614165/"">Cillian Murphy</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>It Follows </em>(2014)</h2><br /><br />So many horror movies are structured around the idea that <em>something </em>is coming for the main characters. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/"">In <em>Alien</em>,</a> it's the xenomorph. In <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087800/""><em>A</em> <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em></a>, it's Freddy Krueger. <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/""><em>It Follows</em></a><em> </em>cleverly updates the tropes seen in these movies. After Jay (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2140860/"">Maika Monroe</a>) sleeps with her boyfriend Hugh (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1621032/"">Jake Weary</a>) for the first time, she contracts a terrible STD: Death is following her, until she passes it on to someone else. If it kills Jay, it kills everyone who came before her, too.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Omen </em>(1976)</h2><br />Ever babysit a kid and just<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11159487/black-latina-ghost-hunters""> get the shivers</a>? <em>The Omen</em> will confirm that, indeed, some children are just bad eggs — and of that set, Damien (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827032/"">Harvey Spencer Stephens</a>) is the baddest egg of all. After Katherine (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001665/"">Lee Remick</a>) gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, her husband Robert (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/"">Gregory Peck</a>) and doctor conspire to replace him with an orphan — and not tell Katherine. Soon, everyone around baby Damien starts dying. That’s right: Robert may have accidentally adopted the antichrist.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (1974)</h2><br /><br />What begins as a road trip turns into a nightmare after Sally (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122782/"">Marilyn Burns</a>), her brother, and two of their friends encounter a group of outcasts living in a barn — one of whom is a serial killer. In this movie, you can catch Leatherface at the beginning of his long franchise life. Horrifyingly, <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> is based on the true story of Ed Gein, who made masks from the skins of his victims.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Conjuring </em>(2013)</h2><br /><br />Taking place in Rhode Island in the ‘70s, <em>The Conjuring</em> details the events of real-life paranormal investigators and demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren as they are called upon to investigate a family being terrorized in their new<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/10/126422/haunted-houses-vacation-rentals""> haunted house</a>. Plus, this movie is a gateway into the entire <em>Conjuring </em>film universe, which includes <em>Annabelle</em>, <em>The Nun</em> and <em>The Conjuring</em> sequels, all of which are based on the Warrens' supposed exploits.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Hereditary</em> (2018)</h2><br /><br />If only a movie could come with a seatbelt. In the case of <em>Hereditary</em>, we’d want one. The movie begins with the death of the Graham family matriarch. As the family grieves, they’re haunted by a malevolent presence. Get ready for a jolting, shocking ride. This is the aforementioned Ari Aster’s first film — and it will certainly keep you up at night.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Carrie</em> (1976)</h2><br /><br /><em>Carrie </em>takes the inherent horrors of high school seriously. For Carrie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/"">Sissy Spacek</a>), high school is a waking nightmare. She’s relentlessly bullied at school. At home, her uber-religious mother punishes her constantly. Carrie’s head is a swirling mess of repression. Eventually, she finds release at the high school prom, where she’s christened Prom Queen in an outpouring of pig’s blood. The movie culminates in one of the most memorable, horrifying climaxes in cinematic history.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Halloween</em> (1978)</h2><br /><br />The original <em>Halloween</em>, released 50 years ago, is a stalwart in the slasher genre. Michael Myers, recently freed from a mental institution, runs amok in the town of Haddonfield, IL targeting teenagers especially. Laurie (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000130/"">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>) is a babysitter who manages to outsmart (or maybe just outrun) him. Watch it so you can have a whole <em>Halloween</em> marathon that includes the final entry from 2022 in the recent reboot trilogy, which takes place when Laurie is older, waiting for the return of her tormentor. The final girl lives on.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Alien</em> (1979)</h2><br />The game: survival. The players: the hapless human crew of the spaceship Nostromo and the xenomorph, a slimy alien with rows of fangs for teeth. <em>Alien </em>is a gore-fest, reminding us that death could (literally) be around any corner. The movie also introduced one of the most iconic woman heroes and final girls of all time: Ellen Ripley (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/"">Sigourney Weaver</a>).<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Shining</em> (1980)</h2><br /><br />Where art house cinema meets horror meets psychological thriller, that’s where you’ll find <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"">Stanley Kubrick’s</a> <em>The Shining. </em>Writer Jack Torrance (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000197/"">Jack Nicholson</a>) relocates his wife Wendy (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001167/"">Shelley Duvall</a>) and his psychic son, Danny (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0515950/"">Danny Lloyd</a>), to Colorado’s Overlook Hotel for the winter. They think they’re alone, but they're not. Ghosts populate the Overlook Hotel. And soon, so does madness.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Get Out</em> (2017)</h2><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/"">Jordan Peele's</a> Oscar-nominated directorial debut is certainly scary because of the jump scares and unexpected twists. But what sets <em>Get Out </em>apart from every other horror movie is its incisive — and terrifying — commentary about race in America. Chris (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2257207/"">Daniel Kaluuya</a>) goes with his white girlfriend, Rose (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4129745/"">Alison Williams</a>), to meet her family in their upstate mansion. He can't shake the feeling that something's <em>off </em>with her family. He's incredibly right. If you like Peele’s work, then you also need to watch <em>Us</em> (2019) and<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11058789/jordan-peele-nope-ending-explainer""> <em>Nope</em> (2022)</a>.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Paranormal Activity</em> (2007)</h2><br /><br />By introducing the concept of ""found footage,"" <em>The Blair Witch Project </em>reshaped the entire horror movie genre. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>brought the found footage feeling right to your living room. CCTV catches each creepy haunting that preys on the Sloat family in their new house.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (1984)</h2><br /><br />Sleep is where we go to retreat from the world. Except in <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>, sleep is where you're most susceptible to Freddy Krueger (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/"">Robert Englund</a>), a demon who kills teenagers in their dreams — and then ensures their death in reality.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Silence Of The Lambs</em> (1991)</h2><br /><br />In <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, FBI investigators realize the only way they can catch the serial killer Buffalo Bill (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505971/"">Ted Levine</a>) is by consulting someone who knows the killer mind intimately: Dr. Hannibal Lecter (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000164/"">Anthony Hopkins</a>), a convicted cannibalistic serial killer already locked up. Clarice Starling (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149/"">Jodie Foster</a>) is forced to get close to the masked, smooth-talking Dr. Lecter who could — and does — eat a human as casually as he eats a lamb chop.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Ring</em> (1998)</h2><br /><br />Good luck staring at a TV set after watching<em> Ring</em>. The premise of this Japanese movie — which was later turned into the 2002 American movie <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298130/""><em>The Ring</em></a><em> </em>— is terrifying: Watch a cursed video tape, and have seven days to live, unless you make a copy of the tape and pass it on. In that case, you’ve cursed someone else. In<em> Ring</em>, the boundaries between<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/10/11788325/best-new-streaming-movies-tv-shows-october""> what we watch</a> and our fate is tied together inherently. Fortunately that’s not normally the case<em> </em>— otherwise fans of serial killer shows would be in trouble.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Orphanage </em>(2007)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Orphanage </em>is a thought-provoking and thrilling entry into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/04/147031/best-netflix-horror-movies"">the horror genre</a> which will appeal to <em>all</em> movie buffs. At the start of the movie, Laura (Belén Rueda), her husband (Fernando Cayo), and adoptive son (Roger Princep) return to the orphanage where she was raised. She hopes to convert the orphanage into a home for disabled children. Instead, she stumbles upon the orphanage's dark history, which manifests in ghost form.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Babadook</em> (2014)</h2><br /><br />“If it's in a word, or it's in a look, you can't get rid of the Babadook.” So goes the rhyme which repeats, like an unforgettable motif, throughout this Australian movie. In <em>The Babadook</em>, a single mother (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0204583/"">Essie Davis</a>) and her son (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5231168/"">Noah Wiseman</a>) live together in an old house that is <em>already </em>scary — and then becomes <em>super </em>scary when a long-limbed monster called the Babadook makes his presence known. <em>The Babadook </em>is a chilling story about loss and trauma nestled inside a conventional horror movie format.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>(1999)</h2><br /><br /><em>The Blair Witch Project </em>could be the scariest movie on this list, simply because of how <em>real </em>it seems. Typically, while watching a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-horror-movies""> horror movie</a>, you can rationalize some of the fears away by reminding yourself of its fictional nature. But that's harder to do when watching a movie like <em>Blair Witch</em>. The movie depicts three film students (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0931321/"">Michael Williams</a>, Joshua Leonard, and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0231946/"">Heather Donohue</a>) who supposedly set forth to find the Blair Witch in 1994; the movie is the footage they left behind. When it premiered at Sundance in 1999, some viewers really did think it was a documentary.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Audition</em> (1999)</h2><br /><br />You haven't seen a<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/10/11138345/do-revenge-drea-camila-mendes-video""> revenge movie</a> until you've seen <em>Audition</em>. In this Japanese movie, a widowed film producer sets about finding a wife very methodically. He'll interview women for a nonexistent movie part. When he finds a properly submissive woman, he'll ask her out on a date. But he wasn't prepared for Asami (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793402/"">Eihi Shiina</a>), the 28th auditionee of the day with a gruesome plan of her own.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Open Water </em>(2003)</h2><br /><br />Some might say that <em>Open Water </em>is the scariest movie on this list, but not because it’s a classic horror movie. A couple goes on a scuba diving expedition during a beach vacation. Then, the boat leaves them in the middle of the ocean. On the surface of the water, they panic and bicker. Beneath them, sharks start to circle. No movie will inspire more existential dread than this one, watching people face the inevitability of their death. On a final note: <em>Open Water </em>is based on a true story, which makes it all the more scary.<br /><br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>IT </em>(2017)</h2><br /><br />Every 27 years, the children of Derry are preyed on by a shape-shifting force of evil who typically takes the form of a painted clown (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0803889/"">Bill Skarsgård</a>). The year IT comes back, a group of misfits called the Loser's Club decides to take the monster on. <em>IT </em>is set in a world in which no one can protect kids but themselves.<br /><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2><em>Suspiria </em>(2018)</h2><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0345174/"">Luca Guadagnino's</a> remake of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000783/"">Dario Argento's</a> classic horror film is a deeply unsettling tale of witchcraft, ballet, and violence. Warning: There is one particularly gruesome scene that some viewers found so repulsing they actually got physically ill. It involves a dancer's bones breaking as a dancer in a second room inadvertently controls her grotesque movements. If you’re prone to squeamishness, maybe steer clear of this movie. <br /><br /></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p><em>Welcome to “</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><em>What’s Good</em></a><em>,” a column where we break down what’s soothing, distracting, or just plain good in the streaming world with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy.

<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is good because <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-10-23/nia-dacosta-tessa-thompson-hedda-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nia DaCosta</a> is great. And <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/04/230130/is-little-woods-realistic-interview-tessa-thompson"">Tessa Thompson</a> is even better. The DaCosta-directed adaptation of Henrik Ibsen’s classic play stars Thompson in the titular role as Hedda Gabler, an ambitious, repressed housewife still hung up on her prodigious ex-lover, Eileen (played by an enthralling <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/nina-hoss-hedda-interview-1235156752/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Hoss</a>) and bored by her prosaic husband, George (a delightfully aloof and banal <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a65454630/who-is-tom-bateman-daisy-ridley-husband/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Bateman</a>). Hedda’s disenchantment comes to a head at a dinner party where Eileen shows up with her new girlfriend, Thea (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/impoots/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Imogen Poots</a> playing frantic and overwrought perfectly), as she’s vying for the same job as George. Throw in Hedda’s other sometimes-lover Judge Roland Brack (a mischievous and menacing <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicholaspinnock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Pinnock</a>) in the mix and you’ve got a night of mayhem and manipulation. </p>



<p>Set in 1950s England, as the party devolves into shambles — mostly orchestrated by Hedda herself — <em>Hedda</em> goes from a simmering conversation about what happens to a woman bound by her circumstances to a sexy psychological thriller about class, power, and ambition. As the events of the evening unfold, Hedda becomes more and more quietly unhinged and Thompson is so magnetic, oozing with charisma, that you can’t look away and you can’t help but root for one of the messiest women in cinematic history. I like to think of this column as my own Oscars. The Academy is going to deem their own “best of the best” come March 2026, and while Tessa Thompson’s name should definitely be on that ballot, in this space, I get to say what’s the best of the year and I am telling you — unequivocally — that <em>Hedda</em> is one of the best films and performances of the past year. Period. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For (spoilers ahead): </strong>I’m probably supposed to say that Hedda is good because it shows you a complex female character we haven’t seen onscreen before but I don’t think that’s true. We’ve seen many complex female characters onscreen — some were played by Thompson. What makes <em>Hedda</em> so great and unique is that the complex female character that we’re seeing is not only Black, she’s also queer, and she’s one of the most <em>infuriating</em> characters I’ve ever watched. Complimentary! Hedda is frustrating because even when you disagree with her choices on a fundamental level, you understand every single one of her motivations for being a manipulative, conniving, chaos monster. She does all of these things — like (spoiler!) burn Eileen’s manuscript — because she is handcuffed by the confines of her surroundings. In order to break free of those constraints, Hedda acts out and becomes an architect of destruction. The thing this movie says so boldly is not only is Hedda’s acting out OK, it’s fucking fun to watch. As Hedda blows up her own world and unravels the life she has carefully crafted while desperately trying to hold onto it, the audience is watching her fight for freedom. And that’s relatable to any woman, but it’s also liberating to watch a Black woman push to define herself, even if her methods are questionable. </p>



<p>The question at the center of <em>Hedda</em>, according to DaCosta, is “What does freedom look like?” she tells me over Zoom from New York, sitting beside Thompson. “Especially when it comes to how we represent ourselves, how we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?” It’s not. I think true freedom for Black characters to be able to be <em>whatever they are</em> in all of their complicated, messy, frustrating, contradicting ways, just like human beings are, and just like their white counterparts so often get to be.</p>



<p>“I understand historically that we have to make sure that we’re not going to invite literal violence, by showing a negative portrayal of Blackness. I’m really empathetic to that attempt, but I also think it does limit us,” DaCosta continues. “For me, what’s been so important is seeing dynamic, human, Black women on screen in my life. I think that’s really what builds empathy, not making a small box for ourselves that we have to fit into. It was really exciting for me, but I also knew that people might get a little upset.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to.</p><cite>tessa thompson</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I didn’t find it upsetting to watch Hedda elegantly stomping around her party looking stunning (seriously, has anyone ever looked better onscreen than Thompson in this role?) and actively dismantling the lives of everyone around her. I found it fascinating. And because Thompson plays Hedda with nuance and depth, it never feels like her manipulation is simply incidental. Even when Hedda is at her absolute worst — like trying to convince Eileen to end her own life (diabolical!) — you can see that her judgement is clouded by self preservation, heartbreak, and desperation. It’s in those moments of inner turmoil where Hedda, and Thompson, shine. “Over the course of my career, I’ve somehow gotten very, very lucky to play women that are complicated and interesting and aren’t always completely digestible or perfect. It’s just always been what I’ve been attracted to,” Thompson says. “And I think the thing that felt particularly exciting about this piece is Ibsen, in the head of Gabler, wrote the prototypical first, way-ahead-of-her-time complicated, messy woman. I think what felt really exciting is to turn that on its head and to reimagine it and to repurpose it and to reconstruct it in all the beautiful ways that Nia was able to.” </p>



<p>If you’re familiar with Ibsen’s play, you’ll love <em>Hedda</em>. And if you’re not, you’ll be in awe of how timely the text still is, and you’ll — in spite of yourself — fall in love with a character who may or may not love herself and is intent on challenging everyone around her to face their own inner demons. There’s a method to her menace.</p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It? </strong><em>Hedda</em> is so good, I’ve seen it four times – twice at the <a href=""https://tiff.net/films/in-conversation-with-tessa-thompson-and-nia-dacosta"">Toronto International Film Festival</a> because I went to the premiere and hosted an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE1ZaBKR5IY"">In Conversation with Thompson and DaCosta</a>, and twice again to prep for our interview. Each time, I found something new to fixate on. The last time, I found myself connecting Hedda’s plight as a queer 1950s housewife without the freedom to live as she desires to the current <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11161942/tiktok-black-tradwives-burnout-marriage-capitalism"">tradwife resurgence</a>. I ask DaCosta about the connection: “I find the tradwife thing super interesting because I can totally see that being a valid economic choice, considering the shit show that is our current climate, economy, world,” DaCosta says. “And also, you see it happen a lot where women choose to give up parts of their freedom so that they can feel safe, even though I don’t think that actually makes you safe.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>How we represent ourselves as Black women, is it freedom to limit ourselves to just these stereotypically positive traits, like being elegant or strong or noble? Is that freedom?”</p><cite>nia dacosta</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I think Hedda is someone who’s wrestling with that. Actually, she’s wrestling with [the thoughts that] these things make me safe, or they’re supposed to make me safe, but they’re also killing me,” DaCosta continues. “That battle is where so much of her frustration and her violence comes from, not just the violence she directs outwards, but also towards herself. But I think that’s so complicated for her to unpick and what we’re watching is someone unpick that in whatever way she can.”</p>



<p>As Hedda battles with herself, there’s a rage simmering underneath every smirk and every one of her bleak and destructive actions. Whether that rage makes Hedda suicidal is up for debate up until the final frame. When I ask Thompson about female rage, she says she was able to say so much about the topic through <em>Hedda</em>. “I think there is a tremendous amount of rage that gets started inside of us as humans full stop, but particularly related to moving through the world as a woman,” Thompson says. “I’ve spoken about my grandmothers on this press tour, because I started with them [in preparing for <em>Hedda</em>]. I started to imagine the rage that they must have felt that never got to be expressed. For my father’s mother, she immigrated to this country as a young woman of color in working spaces, managing the whole house. And her life revolved around her family, and she happily made that choice.”</p>



<p>“But I look at photographs of her before she immigrated, [she’s] free on a beach with her friends. I think there was a certain kind of freedom that she had before she came to America and was suddenly a Black American,” Thompson continues. “I just imagine all of the things that she must have felt, all of the private rage that she must have suppressed, and the same for my maternal grandmother. It felt like getting to play this character, to unleash that rage, maybe not in the kindest ways, as Hedda, but it felt like getting to exorcize that for all of the women in my life, for the woman I have been in the past that had secret, private rage at the violence sometimes that you can experience as a young girl moving through the world. It felt good to put it on screen and I hope that in some private ways, it can help people who see the film, and particularly women, to just engage with that. It doesn’t mean you need to cause harm because of it, but don’t deny that you might feel [rage]. Allow yourself the space.”</p>



<p>And that’s ultimately what Thompson and DaCosta have done: provided a space where female rage, complexity, and messiness can coexist. It’s work that I imagine would make Thompson’s grandmothers very proud. Often when we talk about artists on the margins — the ones who aren’t white or straight or male or all three — we talk about the past or about how much they still have to achieve, how excellent they have to be in order to be worthy enough to earn their place. Tessa Thompson and Nia DaCosta are already there, and more importantly, they do work that makes us look forward with hope and endless possibility. That’s how I felt watching <em>Hedda</em>.</p>



<p>Turning Henrik Ibsen’s play into a sensual Black, queer, romp for modern audiences was risky. But Thompson and DaCosta have proven time and time again that they take big swings. From blockbusters (both have dabbled in the Marvel universe, Thompson is the star of the <em>Creed</em> franchise and DaCosta is about to direct the next instalment of  the <em>28 Years Later</em> series), to daring adaptations, to small original ideas (they first collaborated on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/04/229875/little-woods-movie-review-lily-james-tessa-thompson""><em>Little Woods</em></a>), this director-actor duo do all the things we’re being told can’t exist in Hollywood anymore. And their latest collaboration is their best yet. Ultimately, <em>Hedda</em> is a stunning reimagining that painstakingly and purposefully builds towards an astonishing climax. It’s gorgeous and bold and just another entry into the canon of both DaCosta and Thompson’s work about complicated, brilliant, and infuriating women. </p>

And while rest is essential for staying in tip-top shape both mentally and physically, it’s also when your skin gets to work.</p>



<p>That’s right: When you’re enjoying your trip to snoozeland, that’s when your skin gets hard to work — which is what inspired Nocturnal’s hero serum.</p>



<p>“If you’re not getting the proper sleep your body needs, cortisol levels remain high, interfering with cellular activities like wound healing, and even skin hydration,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, tells Refinery29. “This even can contribute to acne breakouts.” Founded by beauty industry veterans Katey Hassan and Daniel Kiyoi, Nocturnal’s <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a> is smart, luxurious skincare in a bottle — and it’s definitely not your everyday night serum. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a>, $178</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938218.jpg?width=910&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=455%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Packed with peptides, niacinamide, oat-derived lipids, and evening primrose, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night</a> is made to brighten, hydrate, and address signs of aging. However, the most notable innovation IMO lies in a patent-pending delivery system — which actually matters so the potent ingredients you’re paying for get readily absorbed by your skin. But at the end of the day, all of the fancy technology in the world doesn’t matter if my skincare doesn’t yield results.</p>



<p>I may not have wrinkles and fine lines yet (I’m 32, but still get routinely asked if I’m still in college — a slight annoyance that I will one day love, I’m sure), so I can’t speak much to the fine line-reducing ability of Polar Night, but I will say that my overall bounciness and texture have vastly improved since incorporating this into my PM routine. (I even keep it on my nightstand to reapply right before bed.) In the morning, I wake up with soft, smooth skin that isn’t screaming for moisture.</p>



<p>And here’s the thing: Is it expensive? Yes. However, I always recommend investing in your serum or moisturizer (as opposed to cleansers) since they tend to be more concentrated in actives and stay on your skin for a longer period of time. The 30mL full size lasted me a few months with nightly use, and I just replaced it with a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum-refill?variant=43293817143484"">refill pod</a>. (Which, when the packaging is as gorgeous as Nocturnal’s, it genuinely makes me want to reuse it forever.) And since I’ve been using Polar Night, I’ve haven’t wanted to book a facial or invest in richer moisturizers since my skin is already happy and hydrated. Serums that work smarter <em>and </em>harder? Here for it.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939024.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We’re now in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">middle of fall</a>. The onset of Scorpio season lands in the depths of fall for the Northern Hemisphere. As we dive into the simmering waters of Scorpio, we’ll feel more connected to others because our hearts and minds will be open. We have the opportunity to realize our dreams and we will be lucky enough to be happy with the outcome. Read on to discover the spooky and sweet vibes that will be coming in the month ahead.<br /><br />As a fixed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">water sign</a>, Scorpio is known for devotion and loyalty. The scorpion, who will sting with their poisonous venom when hurt, is extremely intuitive and highly aware of their surroundings. Scorpios wear their hearts close to their chest and suss people out before letting them in. In the days ahead we are going to decide who and what is worth investing our energy into. Being cautious will lead to us being comfortable around the people we trust. </p>



<p>The decaying leaves dropping off the trees remind us of our own mortality. Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, taxes, and evolution and we will be monitoring our personal advancementł. This is a time to make the shifts that have been on our minds. The winds of change are having a profound effect on us. We hold the power to our success and joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">Manifesting our goals</a> will be easier. Like the crops being picked, our visions will soon be a reality. With two retrogrades (Mercury and Jupiter) and a potent Super Full Harvest Moon, we’ll contemplate our next moves and reflect on the past. </p>



<p>The feeling to watch out for is jealousy. On October 24th, when the Sun squares Pluto, we may be consumed by the green-eyed monster. This feeling might be projected onto others, or we could be the victims of it. Scorpio energy can bring out our dark side. We need to make peace with shadowy emotions by embracing our inner child and recognizing these our feelings for what they are. We should love these parts of ourselves in an effort to temper and heal them. By using our innate strength and stamina, we can create a better state of being for ourselves. Be gentle and sympathetic to others and yourself as you float through the enigmatic waves of Scorpio season.</p>



<p>Key Astrological Dates For Scorpio Season: <br /><br /><strong>October 22nd:</strong> The Sun enters Scorpio, starting a month of transformation. Our emotions will get deep, urging us to commit.<br /><br /><strong>October 29th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, making communication direct and upfront — no more mincing words.<br /><br /><strong>November 4th:</strong> Mars glides into Sagittarius, pushing us to chase our independence and embrace adventure. <br /><br /><strong>November 5th:</strong> The magical Super Full Moon in Taurus illuminates the sky and highlights our sensual desires.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939013.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /></figure></div>



<p>Let me start by saying this: I am <em>not</em> a sports girl. Never have been. I danced as a kid, I work out, but anything that involves a ball and coordination? Count me out. So when <a href=""https://usapickleball.org/"">USA Pickleball </a>invited me to <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/south-coast/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=104221446&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4_U5AhxrctAUMq2uzoLE8kEywU5&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6bfHBhDNARIsAIGsqLjkljtYkno35KSzZW5OFnvIzuxguWYbDOHKgW_w-WY_uOvjewusxnwaAqYXEALw_wcB"">Sandals South Coast</a> in Jamaica for World Pickleball Day, I was equally excited and terrified.</p>



<p>But after one week of sun, sweat, and intense fun, I get it. I finally understand why everyone’s obsessed with pickleball.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Sandals was named <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/pickleball/"">USA Pickleball’s Official All-Inclusive Resort,</a> and we were there to celebrate the partnership and test out their brand-new courts. From the moment we arrived, they rolled out the red carpet: new rackets, balls, and enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pickleball-gifts"">pickleball merch</a> to fill a carry-on. Jamaica is already my favorite island so getting to play my first-ever game in paradise was an unreal experience.</p>



<p>Before we jumped into games, our coach gave us a crash course in Pickleball 101. We started with the basics: how to hold the paddle, how to serve, how <em>not</em> to send the ball flying into another court (which I may or may not have done). My biggest struggle? Figuring out how hard to hit. My brain kept wanting to play tennis, I was reminded over and over: <em>no wrist flicks, no power swings, just a light tap.</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939014.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>If I’m being honest, I was almost more excited about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488863/pickleball-fashion-outfits"">pickleball fits </a>than the actual sport. On day one, I wore a cute tan set that immediately betrayed me. I had visible sweat marks all over my body and let’s just say I was no longer the girl with the cute fit on the court. I was drenched in sweat, and my cute court outfit was a distant memory. But by day two, I came back strong in a white cropped tee, white tennis skirt, bucket hat, and sunnies. Looking cute on the court was an instant confidence boost. I actually started getting the hang of it.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939015.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>By the end of the week, I was into it — like, “maybe I’ll join a pickleball league” level of into it. It’s social, easy to learn, and doesn’t leave you feeling like you just survived bootcamp. I totally get why everyone from your parents to your favorite celebs can’t stop talking about it.</p>



<p>I also have to give Sandals its flowers. I’m usually not an all-inclusive resort girl, but this trip changed my mind. Between the food, the vibes, and the fact that they have everything you need to pick up a new hobby (paddles, balls, courts, and lessons), it’s the perfect setup for both chill and play.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939016.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>I went to Jamaica thinking I’d sip cocktails by the pool and maybe try this pickleball thing once. Instead, I got my cardio in, made new friends, and found a sport I actually like. So yeah, consider me a convert.</p>



<p>If you’ve been side-eyeing the pickleball hype like I was, take this as your sign: grab a paddle, find a court, and try it for yourself. Just… don’t wear tan.<br /></p>
