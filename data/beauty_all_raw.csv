<p>After more than 10 years in beauty, I’m usually the go-to for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare recommendations</a> in my friendship circle. But if the past few months are anything to go by, they’ve been the ones schooling me, because lately, there’s only one brand on their lips — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fbrand%2Fmedicube"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">and it’s Medicube</a>. </p>



<p>Skincare enthusiasts — or anyone whose thumbs are never far from their TikTok feed — probably already know (and love) the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean skincare brand</a>, which launched in South Korea in 2017. But it’s managed to cut through the noise (read: the tens of other brilliant <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aestura-atobarrier-365-cream-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korean brands</a> that have also made their way into <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ulta Beauty</a> and <a href=""https://amzn.to/4rFMdiR"">on Amazon</a>) to become one of the most talked-about and exciting names in the space. No, really. At a recent Medicube event, I’ve never seen my fellow editors more intrigued by a brand — specifically the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED Booster</a>. (They didn’t care that they were wearing makeup; the handy red-light tool went straight on their faces.) </p>



<p>With spring right around the corner, my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> was in need of a complete overhaul, so I swapped everything out for a full collection from Medicube. Here are all the products I’d recommend. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore Pad, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961481.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is one of Medicube’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-pad-pimprod2053434"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top-reviewed products at Ulta</a> and the one I was most excited to try. First off, I love that it comes with a handy pair of tweezers, which makes light work of picking up each pad — a very helpful addition if you have long nails like I do. The pads themselves — 70 of them, by the way — are soaked in two exfoliating acids. </p>



<p>First up, 4.5% lactic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that exfoliates the top layer of skin. This gentle acid makes skin smoother and brighter over time by chipping away at dead skin cells and fading hyperpigmentation. Besides exfoliating, it also boosts hydration. Then there’s 0.45% salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). While also gentle, it seeps deeper into pores, breaking up the paste-like mix of oil and dead skin that contributes to pimples. One side of the pad is smooth, while the other is slightly rougher for manual exfoliation.</p>



<p>Happily, because the acids are relatively low in concentration, the pads don’t sting, even on my reactive skin, and they can be used daily. I’ve been using them for over three weeks at night, and I realized they really worked magic on my skin when I caught myself in my apartment mirror one evening and saw my skin literally glinting under the warm light. It’s a lot clearer and smoother, too. One thing I’m not sold on is the name. Pores are completely normal — you can’t shrink them or get rid of them. </p>

<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961478.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>These masks spotlight one of K-beauty’s most promising ingredients: PDRN. Without turning this into a biology lesson, it stands for polydeoxyribonucleotide — essentially DNA derived from salmon. Research suggests PDRN can <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11994882/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">help regenerate skin tissue</a>, promoting healing, reducing inflammation, and increasing collagen, the protein that keeps skin strong and supple. </p>



<p>I’ve been using one mask a week for a month, and the main difference I’ve noticed is how much more hydrated and juicy my skin looks afterwards — so much so that I don’t feel the need to follow with any other skincare. If you’re after that “glass” effect, this will definitely help you get there. I also love watching the mask shift from pink to transparent, a sign that your skin has drunk up all the goodness. Beyond the hydration boost, it’s simply a nice, relaxing ritual. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fcollagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream, $22</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961507.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>This is my new favorite AM and PM moisturizer. As for the texture, the clue is in the name — it’s a transparent jelly rather than a gel-cream. I underestimated it, convinced it wouldn’t be enough to quench my thirsty cheeks and occasionally flaky forehead, plus keep pimples at bay, but my skin always feels smooth, hydrated, and comfortable. </p>



<p>It takes a second to stop feeling tacky, but the finish is matte, and it makes the perfect makeup primer. While I don’t necessarily believe topical collagen can boost your own supply, I do know it’s a fantastic hydrator — especially alongside moisturizing squalane and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-skin-care-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oil-reducing niacinamide</a>. </p>



<p>I use this everywhere: under my eyes like eye cream, down my neck, and on the backs of my hands. I’m also really impressed by how much you get for the price. The tub houses an impressive 110ml of product. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fzero-pore-sa-clear-capsule-facial-deep-cleanser-pimprod2054911%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Zero Pore SA Clear Capsule Facial Deep Cleanser, $16.90</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961480.jpg?width=996&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=249%3A256"" /></figure>



<p>I’ve gone through two of these cleansers in recent months, and I’m almost certain my skin is clearer because of it. Like the Zero Pore Pads, it contains exfoliating acids — salicylic and mandelic — both of which help unclog pores and gradually fade post-acne marks. While it also contains tiny exfoliating particles, they’re very soft, and I barely notice them.</p>



<p>Happily, the second ingredient on the list is glycerin, a deeply moisturizing humectant, so it doesn’t leave my skin feeling tight. Since it’s a foaming face wash, I only use it in the evening after removing makeup with micellar water. In the morning, I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prefer something creamy and gentle</a> to avoid stripping my skin. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpdrn-pink-peptide-serum-pimprod2053536"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $21</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961508.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>If you really want to maximize the benefits of PDRN, this gentle daily serum is your best bet over a one-and-done face mask (though the mask is undeniably fun). Alongside PDRN, it contains no fewer than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">five peptides</a> — short chains of amino acids that form the building blocks of proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep skin bouncy. </p>



<p>The inclusion of palmitoyl tripeptide-1 and palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is what makes it stand out. Together, they’re often dubbed “Botox in a bottle” and can help smooth skin texture over time. Since slotting it into my routine, I’m convinced my forehead lines look less obvious — at least to my eye. The matte finish helps, too, and means makeup glides on like a dream. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbooster-pro-pimprod2053433%3Fsku%3D2645355"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube Booster Pro, $220</a> </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961503.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This tool has all my beauty editor peers talking. There are four modes in total. First up, Booster Mode, which gently vibrates to help your skin better absorb your chosen moisturizer or serum. Second, MC Mode, which uses low-level microcurrent technology to stimulate facial muscles, giving skin a temporary “lift.” Third, Derma Shot Mode, which uses red <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED light</a> to encourage healing and support elasticity. Lastly, Air Shot Mode is designed to refine texture and pores. Personally, I don’t think it’s strong enough to actually exfoliate, but it does feel like a refreshing cool shot — especially nice if your skin gets inflamed or red after cleansing. </p>



<p>The catch? Consistency is key. You’ll only see results if you stick with it. I like to use the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-wand-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red and blue light modes</a> for five to 10 minutes at a time when I have large hormonal pimples. I’m convinced it helps reduce their size and ease the soreness. </p>

<p>We’re diving into the biggest handbag trends that we’re seeing translate from the runways to our favorite stores and the streets.<br /><br />Looking to both the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">Spring/Summer 2026</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Fall/Winter 2026 collections</a> that debuted across global fashion weeks, we’ve narrowed down the most prominent handbag styles on showcase. For the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hilary-duff-nostalgia-concert-tour"">nostalgia lovers</a>, 2016-esque chain bags are having a major moment. For the those with traditional-with-a-twist aesthetics, undone-yet-ladylike bags are in. And for those who could never understand how people carry mini bags, spacious bowling bags are a popular choice.<br /><br />All of these trends build on our up-to-the-minute dispatch on the runway trends that we saw at Winter 2026 New York Fashion Week, as well as our forecasting of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">top 2026 color trends</a>, best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/denim-trends-2026"">denim silhouettes</a>, and emerging <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shoe-trends-2026"">shoe styles</a> to step into throughout the year.<br /><br />Ahead, see the purse shapes, fabrics, hardware, and colorways that some of our favorite designers have sent down their runways — cementing them as the handbag trends we’ll be seeing (and wearing) all year long.  </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>2016 Is Back &amp; So Are Chain-Strap Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960941.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The mass nostalgia for 2016 is also infiltrating today’s fashion scene, and quickly. “Crossbody bags defined this era,” creative director and celebrity stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/scotlouie/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scot Louie</a> tells Refinery29. “Think: The Gucci Marmont and Dionysus, the Chanel Boy Bag, Valentino Rockstud… Bags from this era are tied to a moment when fashion felt expressive, visible, and communal, which is why they resonate again now.”<br /><br />Also of note? These bags all feature chain straps. And while chain-strap handbags have never really left Chanel’s runway (yes, they were prominent at the <a href=""https://wwd.com/fashion-news/shows-reviews/gallery/chanel-spring-2026-couture-1238526043/chanel-spring-2026-couture-56/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2026 Spring Couture show</a> just weeks ago), more brands are embracing the old-school style, too. From Valentino’s chunky shoulder bags and Chloe’s frilly leather pouches to Stella McCartney’s XL totes and Ferragamo’s oblong clutches, chain straps are popping up across your favorite brands and on all types of bags.<br /><br />Why the nostalgia push? Self-declared Chief Bag Officer and creator of the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/y2kbags/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@y2kbags Instagram account</a>, Alejandro V has a simple explanation: “All of us who once aspired to wear those designer pieces now actually have the means to purchase them — hence why the 2016 aesthetic has come roaring back in rapid-fire fashion!” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Under-Arm Candy: Oversized Clutches</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960945.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Keep your shoulders free from the weight of your belongings and instead opt for an oversized clutch that can comfortably nestle under your arm. Many models carried these bags during the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, though the details varied. Designers are leveraging luxe leather, feathers and fringe, and belted and buckled silhouettes to update your typical <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">wedding guest</a> clutch. In other words, they aren’t exclusively meant for eveningwear attire.<br /><br />“Holding onto something so precious just feels fabulous and chic,” says Alejandro V. “I truly believe clutches are forever and should never go out of style — but I’m very happy they’re having a major comeback moment.” </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Woven Leather Bags (All Year Long) </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960948.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/woven-bag-baskets"">Woven leather bags</a> seem to peek out of people’s wardrobes in the spring and summer, so there’s no doubt that they’ll be everywhere again when the weather gets warmer. The most recent Fashion Month, however, has made a case for the versatility and timelessness of this high-quality style.<br /><br />“The Bottega Veneta influence here is undeniable,” notes Alejandro V. “From Daniel Lee to Matthieu Blazy, they did an incredible job reintroducing this silhouette and reminding people how timeless it really is. We’re at a point where consumers understand that great design can live forever.” <br /><br />Louie agrees — though he notes that the target market is shifting slightly, too. “There will also be more emphasis on men wearing bags, which continues to shift how these silhouettes are styled and perceived,” he said, giving a particular shoutout to a certain movie star and noted Bottega Veneta lover. “Thank you Jacob Elordi.”<br /><br />A woven bag — whether finished in leather or suede, and shaped as an oversized shoulder bag, utilitarian tote, or a trend-forward bucket bags — can tag along for nearly any activity. (I personally wear a woven suede tote as my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-work-bags-for-women"">work bag</a> throughout the year!) “You can dress it up or down, and there’s even the idea of passing it on someday as a family heirloom,” Alejandro V suggests. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Unzipped “Ladylike” Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960943.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>While the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2025"">“ladylike” trend</a> as a whole re-emerged in 2025, the ladylike bag specifically will shine in 2026, top handles and all. There’s a crucially modern update at play, however: The traditionally dainty style (typically featuring a single strap or handle) is now being reimagined with unzipped, unclasped, and undone details.<br /><br />“I think this ties back to the [Hermès] Kelly being such an eternal icon — the ultimate single-strap, ladylike bag,” explains Alejandro V. More signature styles like the Dior Lady Bag have new interpretations too, like the <a href=""https://www.dior.com/en_us/fashion/news-fashion-shows/folder-news-and-events/dior-cigale-bag"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cigale bag</a>. You’ll also find the unfastened, single-strap style across Loewe, Fendi, and Toteme’s collections.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>(Non-Leopard) Animal Print Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960940.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">Animal prints</a> will likely never go out of style, but there are points when they’re especially in vogue. Such patterns have been all over the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter 2026 runways, most frequently presented through handbags. Even more interestingly, leopard print isn’t the most popular choice Instead, zebra and tiger prints, snakeskin, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cowhide</a> dotted several designers’ collections — and they’re far more versatile than you may think.<br /><br />“Most animal prints are basically neutrals,” Alejandro V notes. “You can wear tiger and zebra print with almost anything! Cheetah, obviously. Or giraffe print à la early Dooney &amp; Bourke.” Typically available in neutral color palettes, these prints can be paired with your favorite wardrobe stapes to add a pop to any outfit.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>From The Office To The Alley: Doctor &amp; Bowling Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960942.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Spacious and structured handbags have solidified themselves as the trend of all trends to carry around. On the runways, they’ve predominately popped up in leather, suede, and even snakeskin variations, and silhouettes ranging from the professional-looking house <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-summer-2025"">doctor style</a> to the sportier <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/handbag-trends-spring-2025"">bowling bag</a>.<br /><br />These boxy and/or bulbous bags are perfect for all-day wear, though they’re particularly useful as your work bag. “These bags fit everything—and then some,” says Alejandro V. “A book, an iPad, a Hydro Flask… it’s truly the perfect chic little schlep bag without feeling overwhelmingly massive.” In other words, gone are the days of mini bags (though we’re sure that won’t last very long). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Playful Pastel Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960946.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>There isn’t just one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-color-trends-2026"">trending color</a> that will cement itself as a 2026 handbag must-have. Instead, a rainbow of pretty pastels will be taking over. Expect to find <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellows</a>, baby pinks, mint greens, lilac purples, and frosted blues across every handbag category (including in some of the trending styles seen above ). See: The pale yellow cylindrical shoulder bags at Coach; the pink, purple, and blue pouches at Prada; as well as the pink lady bags and yellow quilted chain bags at Dior.<br /><br />Pastel purses will no doubt make their biggest presence during <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-roller-rabbit-collaboration-lookbook-shop"">the spring months</a>, but they can also add unexpected brightness to fall and winter outfits that need a bit of cheering up. </p>

<p>One of the most popular topics of discussion on the internet is the “<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-kaleidescope/202507/is-male-loneliness-a-new-epidemic-or-an-age-old-struggle"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Male Loneliness Epidemic.</a>”  Many refer to it as the reason we have  <a href=""https://www.bupipedream.com/opinions/alpha-male-podcast-bros-and-their-grip-on-young-minds/163897/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Alpha male” podcasts</a> and an increasing number of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/oct/21/why-the-manosphere-clicked-for-young-men-a-visual-deep-dive"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red pill-type content targeted towards Gen Z</a> and Gen Alpha young boys. Women are noticing that the men they date are participating in and exhibiting behaviors that make them very unlikeable and undatable. Loneliness is a serious subject, but when paired with misogyny and contempt towards women, it has become a punchline. When a woman posts about a bad dating experience or a <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/i-love-my-husband-who-hates-me.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wife posts about</a> her careless and clueless husband, the jokes ensue. After each of these instances, I think the same thing:<em> straight men are simply not lonely enough. </em>The bar is on the floor, and these men can’t even meet that low standard. Maybe loneliness is what they deserve. </p>



<p>Watching this season of<em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/02/11854927/love-is-blind-season-8-diversity"">Love is Blind</a>,</em> I am beginning to understand the male loneliness epidemic more and more. In the last batch of episodes of the dating reality series, I watched these men unravel and say things to their fiancées that were deeply concerning. The humiliation ritual masquerading as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-is-blind-couples"">reality show</a> that we all binge-watch with glee is back with <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/love-is-blind-season-10-cast-instagrams"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Season 10, set in Ohio.</a> As <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2023/04/11340331/love-is-blind-4-couples-therapy"">Love Is Blind</a> </em>grows, there is always the question: “Are these people here for the right reasons?” I think there are better questions like, “are these men ready for commitment at all?”, “are they truly ready to let another person into their lives?”, and “are they willing to actually do the work it takes in a relationship?” For all of the aforementioned questions, the answer is giving a glaring no. Don’t they know this show is supposed to end in marriage?  </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/love-is-blind-season-10-keya-kevan-tyler-love-triangle-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kevan is a great example</a> of someone who is not ready for the commitment that this experiment requires. His indecisiveness puts him in a love triangle with Tyler and Keya. In Episode 4 during the pods (the part of the series where couples are not allowed to see each others’ faces yet), Kevan says that he needs to “do the mature decision,” because he wants the “best for everybody” and “doesn’t want to let anybody down,” which made me roll my eyes and wish he would make up his mind. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Overall, the men on this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In an interview on the <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">podcast </a><em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">What’s the Reality</a></em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/1cj7hCtiIOKh8a1fExWfCf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">? </a>with<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ad-love-is-blind-red-flags""> LIB Season 6 contestant AD</a>, Tyler revealed that what we didn’t see was Kevan’s admission that he was not ready to be married, and saying that if he were her, he would run. So, she did. All of Kevan’s flakiness led both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vDBrw6KIgE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tyler and Keya to leave him</a> in the pods. Throughout those episodes, Kevan seemed like he just didn’t want to lose the game he was playing. </p>



<p>In the pods, Emma was very vocal about <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/love-is-blinds-emma-addresses-awkward-kid-talk-with-mikes-parents-excl/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">not wanting kids</a>, but her fiancé, Mike, kept trying to convince her she would be a great mom. He even explained this to her family by using the nonsensical analogy that if she can take care of a puppy, she can take care of a baby. This man should be alone until he can listen to a woman’s choices and respect them.  It was baffling when, in the same scene, Mike said he was open to what Emma wants, then backtracked and said having kids was non-negotiable. If it was so important to him, he should not have proposed to Emma. Mike said he was really banking on Emma her changing her mind and that he thought he could be the one to change it, if she could just see his “passion for wanting kids.” This is disrespectful to her wishes and a waste of both of their time.  <strong>  </strong></p>



<p>In true <em>Love Is Blind </em>fashion, many couples are having issues revolving around their physical appearances and the men feeling disappointed that the women they chose are not their “type.” We’ve seen this before on <em>Love is Blind</em>. We saw it in Season 2 with Shake &amp; Deepti and in Season 3 with Bartise &amp; Nancy. Of course, we know that people are human and physical attractiveness does matter in a relationship, but the show is called LOVE IS <em>BLIND</em>. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961368.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. Alex Henderson in episode 1008 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>This season, this dilemma plagues three couples: Brittany and Devonta, Ashley and Alex, and Jessica and Chris. Brittany consistently told Devonta she didn’t feel secure in their relationship because he was not physically and verbally affectionate. He excused the distance by saying he was dealing with the death of his grandfather (who <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427931/love-is-blind-season-10-why-devonta-broke-no-phones-rule-in-pods"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">passed while the show was being filmed</a>). But Devonta also revealed that Brittany is not his physical “type” and that he has never dated a woman of color. Brittany is Black and Latina. When I interviewed Brittany, I asked how she felt watching the episodes back and hearing how Devonta felt about her and she said that in the back of her mind she felt Devonte’s distaste towards her.  Don’t worry girl, we could all feel it too. Devonta seems to be a self-hating mess and should be in therapy, not on reality TV. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The worst man of all is Chris. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Ohio, Ashley told <a href=""https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/02/25/love-is-blind-alex-henderson-donald-trump-vote/88707804007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">self-proclaimed Trump supporter</a> and alleged<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindNetflix/comments/1r8bj6t/i_think_alex_is_a_con_man/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> scammer Alex</a> that their intimacy was lacking. She brought up that they had not been intimate since arriving home from Mexico. He told her he was the one who initiated physical intimacy in Cabo and that now it was her turn. He then went on to say he was unaware that he could initiate sex with her while she is on her period. AGAIN, MEN AREN’T LONELY ENOUGH. Alex spends a majority of Episode 10 gaslighting Ashley because he can’t keep his story about his past exes straight. While Alex reassured Ashley that he is attracted to her, he told her to her face that she is not his typical “type” which is a horrible thing to repeatedly tell your partner. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961381.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Love is Blind. (L to R) Chris Fusco, Jessica Barrett in episode 1009 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix © 2026</figcaption></figure>



<p>The worst man of all is Chris. By now, you’ve probably seen <a href=""https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/tv-and-film/love-is-blind-chris-fusco-crossfit/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the scene that has gone viral</a>. It shows Chris sitting across from his partner Jessica, a doctor, and telling her that he is not attracted to her because <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/chris-tells-jessica-hes-used-to-dating-women-who-work-out-all-the-time/1393006055935790/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she doesn’t work out enough</a>. The audacity of this man. In the scene, Chris says to Jessica that he is not enjoying their sex life because he’s, “used to girls who do Pilates every day.” Mind you, in my opinion, Chris is a short five (and that’s being generous) with tiny hands, and Jessica is a hot doctor. </p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Chris also tells Jessica that he might be happier with Bri because he is more attracted to her. The more he explains himself as the episode goes on, the more openly disrespectful he becomes toward Jessica. He even loudly confesses to Bri and the other girls that Jessica was the worst sex he has ever had. Later in the evening, Chris even makes a sad attempt at reconciling with Jessica. He continously tries to get her to know he wasn’t trying to be mean all the while not understanding why what he said was so hurtful. Chris deserves worse than loneliness.  </p>



<p>Overall, the men in this season of <em>Love Is Blind</em> put their own lust over love repeatedly and show a complete lack of care or respect towards their fiancées. The <em>Love Is Blind </em>casting directors need to find men who actually <em>like</em> women. We live in a time when <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/05/07/trump-spurs-global-rollback-rights-women-and-girls"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">women’s rights are being stripped </a>away, when <a href=""https://counciloncj.org/new-analysis-shows-8-increase-in-u-s-domestic-violence-incidents-following-pandemic-stay-at-home-orders/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">domestic violence is on the rise</a>, and when even in our highest moments, we <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/25/distasteful-joke-us-hockey-star-hilary-knight-responds-to-trump-comments-on-womens-team"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">become the butt of the joke</a>. At the very least, we want to be able to enjoy our silly dating reality show without having to watch men degrade and disrespect the women they supposedly love.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Watching this season, it feels as though the men would rather treat the women more like experiments than human beings. They expect the women to bend, break, and mold themselves into who they want them to be, instead of seeing them for who they are and accepting the women they spent time getting to know in the pods. These men don’t want wives; they want unopinionated robots to put up with them. I would rather all of them just tell the truth and say, “This is not for me. I have some work to do.”   </p>



<p>At the end of these episodes, it is clear these men are not ready for marriage, for falling in love at all, or for considering their partners’ needs and wants. We have one more week before the wedding episodes and I hope Emma, Ashley, and Brittany follow Jessica, Keya, and Tyler’s lead and run for the hills!  There may be a male loneliness epidemic, but Season 10 of <em>Love Is Blind</em> is proving that maybe men are not nearly lonely enough. </p>

<p>March opens like a dream you’re half-awake inside. Mars enters Pisces, and suddenly motivation doesn’t look like grinding harder, it looks like following a feeling, a nudge, a quiet “this way.” <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-in-pisces-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">With Mercury retrograde</a> and Venus finishing her time in Pisces, the pace of life may feel slow, foggy, or oddly emotional. Plans drift, conversations may get blurry, and your energy comes in waves. Instead of forcing clarity, March begins by asking you to move differently… the vibe is softer, more intuitive, a little less obsessed with productivity and a little more curious about what your energy is actually trying to tell you.</p>



<p>Then comes March 3rd, when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> delivers a reality check with a highlighter and a to-do list. Virgo energy doesn’t care about the aesthetic of your life, it cares about what’s sustainable. This eclipse may expose burnout, perfectionism, control habits, or the quiet anxiety that comes from trying to hold everything together alone. Think of it less as chaos and more as a cosmic edit. Something inefficient, draining, or overcomplicated is ready to be simplified. If emotions spike, it’s probably because something in your life has been running on “I’ll deal with it later” for way too long.</p>



<p>The energy shifts noticeably after March 6th, when Venus enters Aries, bringing heat back into a very watery sky. Desire gets louder. Confidence comes back online. People start saying what they actually want instead of hinting. And on March 10th, momentum returns for real as Jupiter turns direct in Cancer after nearly five months retrograde. This is timeline acceleration energy. Opportunities that stalled begin moving. Emotional growth you’ve been doing quietly starts showing tangible results. If the first part of the year felt like therapy, this is where the plot starts moving again.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the New Moon in Pisces closes the eclipse chapter on a much gentler note. Where February’s Aquarius eclipse felt like a sudden break or shock (especially with its tense square to Uranus), this Pisces New Moon forms a harmonious connection to Uranus. Translation: the change sticks, but it feels supportive now. Less disruption, more alignment. Many people will notice emotional closure, creative clarity, or a quiet realization of how much they’ve actually grown. This new moon sets the tone for the next six months, and it carries a rare kind of hope… the grounded kind, not the delusional kind.</p>



<p>Then the real reset arrives. On March 20th at 10:46 a.m. EST, the sun enters Aries, marking the equinox and the start of the astrological new year. Even better? Mercury stations direct at 3:33 p.m. EST (yes, the numerology is doing the most). If the Fire Horse year that began in February felt like it hadn’t fully kicked in yet, this is the ignition. Energy moves forward. As the month closes, Saturn in Aries forms a supportive sextile to Pluto in Aquarius, signaling structural change behind the scenes… the kind that fuels real-world revolution. From immigration justice to protecting children from abuse to collective movements demanding accountability, this is slow power organizing itself. March ends on a softer note, though: Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, where she thrives. Comfort, stability, pleasure, and tangible love return. And honestly? After the emotional marathon of eclipse season, that kind of beauty feels earned.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, if you’ve been trying to push through exhaustion, anxiety, or that low-level feeling of being “on edge for no reason,” March is the month your body calls a meeting.

Something about your daily rhythm, workload, or mental health habits has reached its limit. You might realize you’ve been running on adrenaline instead of alignment. This isn’t a failure moment, it’s a recalibration. What needs to be simplified? What actually supports you instead of just making you feel productive? <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Eclipse season is peaking</a>, and for you, the real power move is choosing sustainability over burnout.</p>



<p>By March 18th, the Pisces New Moon deepens a story that’s been building all month, especially with Mars moving through Pisces, your spiritual and healing zone. Translation: your energy isn’t meant for constant output right now, it’s meant for emotional processing, closure, and quiet breakthroughs that nobody else sees. You may feel more sensitive, more reflective, maybe even a little nostalgic. Lean into it… rest is productive. Therapy, journaling, long walks, random crying that actually feels good after… all valid. This new moon helps you release old emotional weight so you’re not dragging it into your next chapter.</p>



<p>And that next chapter? It arrives loud and clear. When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, it’s your solar return, your personal new year, and honestly, a full rebirth moment. After weeks of slowing down, clarity starts to click. Your energy comes back online, your confidence returns, and people notice you again.

This time, you’re not just starting over, you’re starting wiser.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this month is asking you to get honest about where your joy has started to feel like pressure.

Something may culminate in your dating life, a creative project, or even your relationship with your inner child. If you’ve been performing happiness instead of actually feeling it, the eclipse will make that impossible to ignore. The lesson isn’t to control the outcome. It’s to release the need for things to look perfect and let your joy evolve into something more real, even if that means closing a chapter you once loved.</p>



<p>As the month unfolds, the emotional tone deepens. The March 18th Pisces new moon, amplified by Mars moving through Pisces all month, activates your friendship and community zone. You’re rethinking who you want around you, what spaces feel aligned, and where your energy actually grows instead of gets drained. Some Taurus placements may feel pulled to step back from certain social circles, take a quiet social media break, or reconnect with people who feel safe and inspiring. This isn’t isolation, it’s refinement. And because this new moon forms a supportive sextile to Uranus in Taurus, the changes you make now can feel surprisingly liberating, helping you step more confidently into a version of yourself that feels authentic, future-oriented, and unapologetically different.</p>



<p>When the sun enters Aries on March 20th, the energy turns inward, beginning a deeply restorative period for you.

And as the month closes, Venus enters Taurus on March 30th, bringing your ruler home and turning the spotlight back on your magnetism, confidence, and capacity to attract what you’ve been quietly preparing yourself to receive.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, March is less about moving faster and more about realizing which direction is actually worth your energy. The March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse in Virgo</a> lands in your home and emotional foundation zone, bringing a turning point around living situations, family dynamics, or your inner sense of stability. Something may culminate, shift, or simply become impossible to ignore. If you’ve been pushing through without tending to your emotional needs, this eclipse calls a timeout.

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, March opens with a reality check that’s less dramatic than you expected and more empowering than you realized you needed.

Something becomes very clear: where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or tying your worth to external validation.

<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this month’s March 3rd <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Total Lunar Eclipse</a> in your sign is personal, powerful, and, if we’re being honest, a little exhausting. You’ve been part of the Virgo–Pisces eclipse storyline for nearly two years, and this moment feels like a turning point in how you see yourself. Something about your identity, your habits, or the version of you that’s been operating on overdrive is ready to be released. For many Virgos, the hardest part isn’t the change itself, it’s letting go of the need to control the outcome. This eclipse asks you to loosen your grip, to trust that not everything needs to be optimized or analyzed before it unfolds. What feels like disruption is actually liberation. You’re not losing control, you’re outgrowing the pressure to carry everything alone.</p>

If you’re used to being the reliable one, the fixer, the emotionally organized person in the room, this lunation asks you to name your needs and let someone meet you there. This is one of the most powerful resets for love, connection, and mutual care that you’ve had in years, but only if you allow vulnerability to be part of the equation.</p>

You may feel less interested in surface-level dynamics and more drawn to honesty, intimacy, and energetic alignment in every area of your life. This season pushes you to release what drains you, financially, emotionally, or energetically, and invest your time where there’s real reciprocity. The version of you emerging now isn’t the one who manages<br />everything perfectly. It’s the one who trusts their timing, their intuition, and their worth enough to stop carrying what was never theirs to hold in the first place.</p>

<p>By the time Aries Season begins on March 20th, marking the astrological new year, your attention turns fully toward relationships. This is your partnership zone lighting up, and after the emotional clearing you’ve been doing, the dynamic between you and others may start to look different.

The version of you stepping into this next cycle isn’t here to keep the peace at your own expense, it’s here to create relationships that feel peaceful for you too.</p>

This is one of the best new moons of the year for opening your heart, but the real magic happens when you stop waiting for the “right time” and let yourself be seen as you are.</p>



<p>When Aries Season begins on March 20th and the astrological new year kicks in, your focus shifts toward your daily life, work rhythms, and physical energy. The question becomes: <em>how do you build a lifestyle that supports the version of you that’s emerging? </em>This is where inspiration meets structure. You may feel motivated to change your schedule, set stronger boundaries around your time, or commit to habits that protect your energy instead of draining it. Just be mindful of the shadow here, trying to do everything at once and burning out in the process. This season isn’t about proving your strength.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831469.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, March begins by widening your perspective, whether you asked for that expansion or not.

This next chapter isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about making sure the life you’re building has space for you inside it.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>

A connection may deepen, shift, or reach a moment of truth where the balance between giving and receiving becomes impossible to ignore. This isn’t necessarily about endings, but it is about clarity.

<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead</em></strong>: There’s a moment in <em>56 Days</em> when the show’s central con is revealed: Ciara (Dove Cameron) didn’t meet Oliver (Avan Jogia) by chance at the supermarket. She planned it. She’d been watching him, taking <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bring-back-physical-photo-albums"">photos</a>, keeping notes. She orchestrated the entire encounter to get close to a man she had reason to hate. By any definition, this is manipulation. This is the setup for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/what-is-love-bombing"">love bombing</a> scenario, or worse. And yet, by the end of the show, we’re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together. To build a life and to have their happy ending.</p>



<p>Dove Cameron is aware of this contradiction. When asked directly if audiences will excuse the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/green-flags-not-red-flags-dating-relationships"">red flags</a> both characters exhibit, she doesn’t hesitate: “I don’t think they’ll excuse any of it. They shouldn’t.” But then she pauses, because she knows what actually happens.</p>



<h3>The attractiveness loophole</h3>



<p>There’s this recurring theme in <em>56 Days</em>: one where Oliver does something genuinely alarming, or Ciara reveals another layer of her deception, and the camera lingers on their faces. Both of them are beautiful, the tension is unbearable, and somewhere in that moment, the audience’s moral objections start to soften.</p>



<p>“I don’t think the audience will completely brush it off,” Cameron says when asked about whether attractiveness gives characters a pass. She’s repeating herself because she knows it’s not true. Or rather, she knows the nuance: audiences <em>shouldn’t</em> excuse it, but they will. “But I do think they’ll start to excuse it more and more as it is clear that they’re both exhibiting red flags,” she continues. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I think when the playing field gets more levelled, it’ll be like, oh, so these two are just fucked up. They’re perfect for each other.</p><cite>DOVE CAMERON</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This is the moment the show wins; the psychological shift happens for the audience when both people are compromised equally. When neither one is the victim, and neither one is the villain, audiences stop trying to pick a side. And in that refusal to judge, they actually end up rooting for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/dating-trends-tinder-2026"">relationship</a>, not despite the red flags, but because of them.</p>



<h3>The con works because we want it to</h3>



<p>Ciara’s plan to get revenge on Oliver, the man she believes destroyed her family, doesn’t survive first contact with reality. She falls for him, or she decides to love him anyway. The show intentionally leaves this deliberately ambiguous. But what’s not ambiguous is what happens next: she kills his abusive therapist to protect him and then she chooses him and they run. Oliver, meanwhile, carries his own devastating secret: he killed someone in high school and let his best friend take the fall. Oliver’s been living a lie his entire life, with his abusive therapist weaponising that secret to control him.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961024.png?width=1024&amp;height=538&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A269"" /></figure>



<p>Neither of them is redeemable in any conventional sense; both have done deeply unforgivable things. And yet the show ends with them together, with a child, living in hiding. Not because they’ve been punished or because they’ve atoned, but because they’ve chosen each other.</p>



<p>That confusion in that inability to pin down who’s hurting whom, who’s the predator and who’s the prey, is precisely where the audience’s judgment collapses. We’re not meant to figure it out; we’re meant to accept the ambiguity, and we do. Because they’re beautiful and they’re damaged in interesting ways, where we as the audience almost want to save them. But to be blunt, that’s because they’re hot and the chemistry between them is undeniable.</p>



<h3>The moral we’re actually learning</h3>



<p>The uncomfortable truth <em>56 Days</em> presents is this: we say we want to identify red flags and that we want to protect ourselves from manipulation. But when presented with two attractive, deeply flawed people who are essentially destroying each other and everyone around them, we don’t actually want to look away, and we don’t necessarily want them to be held accountable.</p>



<p>Cameron’s honesty about this is refreshing. She doesn’t pretend the show is teaching us something virtuous. She doesn’t argue that we <em>should</em> root for these characters. She just acknowledges what’s actually happening: “I think that’s when we’ll get into a zone of more, like, I have no idea who’s got the upper hand here.” Jogia agrees and goes further. “You can have all the red flags in the world, but sometimes it doesn’t matter who they are,” he says. “In some cases, they usually go hand in hand with a real connection.”</p>



<p>Jogia points out that he’s not saying to ignore the flags, he’s highlighting that the presence of red flags doesn’t automatically disqualify a relationship from being real. That genuine feeling can coexist with genuine danger, and that when both people are compromised, when both are beautiful and broken in the same ways, the red flags become almost irrelevant to whether we believe in the connection. We reach a point where the question of who’s manipulating whom stops mattering. And at that point of moral surrender, the show achieves something genuinely dark: it makes us complicit in the fiction that love, real, genuine love, can exist in a space of pure mutual corruption.</p>



<p>Maybe it can. Maybe that’s even true in real life, sometimes. But <em>56 Days</em> doesn’t let us off easy by pretending it’s beautiful. It just shows us that we’ll accept it anyway. As long as everyone involved is attractive enough.</p>

Its star ingredient is deeply moisturizing 1% colloidal oatmeal, which soothes, heals, and protects the skin. Most dermatologists I know often recommend this ingredient for dry, flaky patches.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961059.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Hearing about your friends’ <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/relationships"">dating lives</a> can be juicy and exciting, whether you’re a teenager in your first blush of romance or a grown woman reminding your group chat about what they deserve. It can also be heartbreaking, discouraging — and particularly if you’re a Latina who lives at several intersections of identity — terrifying. </p>



<p>That’s how I felt in 2002, when at the age of 16, I had just learned about the brutal murder of a 17-year-old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11434832/transgender-latina-beauty-pageant-contestants"">trans Latina</a> named <a href=""https://abc7news.com/post/who-is-gwen-araujo-timeline-documentary-transgender-murder/12451079/"">Gwen Araujo</a>. Reading the gruesome details of how young cis men with whom she’d been sexually active with killed her because she was trans shook me to my core forever. I often imagined her fate would inevitably be my future — that not only being a Boricua, not only being a woman, but also being a trans woman would prove itself to be perilous as I navigated the still-new-to-me world of dating and the cisgender men who populate it. </p>



<p>Why would I put myself out there when the stakes are so high? But then again, wouldn’t you do the same in the effort to find the love you’ve always felt you deserved?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Multiple studies have found that <a href=""https://illumin.usc.edu/swipe-by-color-the-pitfalls-of-online-dating-for-women-of-color/"">online dating is statistically worse for women of color</a>. And dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges. The stereotypes abound: that we’re all sex workers; that we’re little more than a fetish for closeted, cisgender men; that we’re not seeking love or partnership, or, just as hurtful, that we’re not worth it. I’ve downloaded <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">dating apps</a> with a full heart and hope that I could find love in a truly hopeless place, but cisgender men have taken it upon themselves to degrade and demoralize me at every turn. Rather than offering me a simple, “Hello, how are you?” I’m often met with, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CCHHNEgn791/?img_index=1"">“How much?”</a></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961089.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=628&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A157"" /></figure></div>



<p>When putting myself out there in the dating pool, I run the constant risk of exposing myself to prejudice (such as being labeled the “spicy” Latina), misogyny, and transmisia that runs rampant on dating apps. I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure. It’s daunting and exhaustive, to put it mildly, and I’m sure you understand why I delete the apps as quickly as I download them.</p>



<p>Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person, just as all Latinas do. And it begins with our communities dismantling the assumptions it makes and perpetuates about me and my sisters — and with holding Latino men to a higher standard, one that holds them accountable to the harm they cause and the inner work they need to do.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To be clear, I recognize that cis women have it bad on dating apps, too. Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent. Our hair, our bodies, and our skin tones are sacred, representative of the diversity of our Latinidad, and should be treated as such. Yet there’s an added layer of exploitation that trans women are forced to endure — and it’s utterly violating.</p>



<p>I’ve sifted through hundreds of messages from complete strangers who feel comfortable enough expressing that they’d like to “try me for their ‘first time,’” as if I’m a chemistry set to be experimented with rather than the human being that I am. Forget “Hi, how are you?” or “What are you up to?” as predictable, if boring, openers. I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires. The number of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DIQUENauYxl/?img_index=7"">unsolicited nudes</a> I’ve received truly cannot be counted, despite clear warnings in my bio and in messages to not send such photos. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961090.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=978&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A489"" /></figure>



<p>It’s a problem the apps are aware of: A new law in the U.K. mandates that <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/bulletin/news/cyberflashing-law-dating-apps-social-media-b2896534.html"">dating apps have to block these photos</a> and Bumble <a href=""https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-unsolicited-lewd-nude-images-virginia-texas"">has published advocacy work </a>about such sexual harassment, but am I hopeful that things will change? Not particularly. The LGBTQ-focused dating app Grindr also <a href=""https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008783953-Consent?_gl=1*guunkc*_ga*MTMwMTY0MDkxOS4xNzcwNTM0MTc1*_ga_3ZJKH4GWHP*czE3NzA1MzQxNzQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA1MzQzMTYkajU0JGwwJGgw"">boasts about the importance of consent</a> and highlights the predatory nature of <a href=""https://www.grindr.com/blog/unsolicited-dick-pic"">unsolicited nudes</a>, yet <a href=""https://www.attitude.co.uk/uncategorised/grindr-must-to-do-more-to-crack-down-on-illegal-unsolicited-nudes-404274/"">the app is still rife</a> with cis men preying upon users seeking deeper connections than just the physical. I’m often left feeling as though there are no safe spaces for me to seek out a monogamous relationship without the risk of being sexually harassed, which can feel extraordinarily lonely.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that’s only the latest layer of anti-transness I’ve been subjected to throughout my life, particularly given that I grew up as a hyper-feminine child with a penchant for Disney princess films and pop divas like my idol, Christina Aguilera. Both my Puerto Rican household and the broader neighborhood I grew up in — a low-income, primarily Black and brown corner of East Harlem in New York City — prioritized <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11487974/hulu-film-miguel-wants-to-fight-challenges-machismo"">machismo</a> over all else. I never felt the safety or permission to embrace my most authentic self, not in my neighborhood, neither in school, and certainly not in my own home. I cried, prayed, begged, and pleaded for acceptance, but, instead, I was met with denial and physical abuse.</p>



<p>It’s the sort of machismo that has historically shamed young Latine men and boys when they express human emotions. The kind that pressures Black and brown boys to be hyper-masculine, hardened, and brimming with toxicity while demanding that women and girls  “know their place.” The kind that expects women to prioritize having children and cooking for the man of the house above all else, fully ignoring the reality that some cisgender <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/josh-hawley-senate-hearing-abortion-pills-men-pregnant/88198354007/"">women aren’t able to have children</a>, and some simply don’t want to. </p>



<p>It’s a stereotype that is as damaging to men as it is to women. Men and boys of color are never given permission to cry, to be soft, to embrace the divine feminine. It’s the sort of harm that informs and impacts the way cis men treat women. It’s the kind of violence that is deadly to both trans and cis women.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also, hopefully, on the way out: A survey published by the Pew Research Center in 2024<a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/12/17/what-u-s-latinos-say-about-machismo/""> found</a> that 73% of respondents don’t like machismo. They overwhelmingly said that the concept is a bad thing. The intersection of machismo and anti-trans sentiment is less studied, but the overwhelming emphasis that machismo is related to masculinity and gender-based roles is plenty damning. That only one in five people who are aware of machismo and admit to operating among those guidelines is all the proof you need that this isn’t a trait to uphold or celebrate.</p>



<p>Still, it’s a factor that likely contributed to some of the worst encounters of my life — of the man who asked me out when I was 17, only to sexually assault me several times. Of the messages I received on early online dating sites like TSDating and Craigslist’s romance section, where my inboxes were inundated with propositions for sex, unsolicited nude photos, and graphic details of what these men wanted to subject to me. Of the dates gone sour, like the man who later admitted to fetishizing my transness and the complete prince who was scared of what other people thought.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961091.jpg?width=769&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=769%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>No doubt some of these men are emboldened by the current political climate and U.S. President Donald Trump, a <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/anniversary-hush-money-conviction-trump-continues-fight-criminal/story?id=122325361"">convicted felon</a> who was also found <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">liable of sexual abuse</a>. No doubt the current administration’s single-minded efforts to <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-transgender-laws-asylum-persecution-canada-b2832107.html"">demonize and</a> <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/trump-admin-fbi-trans-nihilistic-violent-extremists-terrorist"">criminalize</a> trans, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, two-spirit, and other queer human beings only furthers a catastrophe of blatant hatred and violence toward us. (Trump’s re-election campaign spent <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5188573/transgender-gender-affirming-care-trump-abortion-hyde-amendment?utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawPt8_BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFYZ2lmS1pOM1Q4R0lBN0lDc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHu3jGKzjebu4QuanTFV1ik114RUc3G0N_v96b4xZy7mFt968nLIvnZUz3SQI_aem_7dHoE05RaW_kuMDBc0Pxwg"">$222 million on anti-trans ads</a> during the 2024 election cycle, which sadly resonated with Americans on all sides.) And no doubt the constant efforts to smear us as “groomers,” or as the cause of societal moral unraveling is meaningfully and irreparably violent. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Add all of this to the fact that, statistically, <a href=""https://chprc.org/publications/fatal-violence-against-black-transgender-women-in-the-united-states/"">Black trans women</a> and other trans women of color are impacted by violence and murder at staggering rates. We’re brutally targeted on a daily basis by the same cis men and women who oversexualize us, as proven by Pornhub’s 2025 Year in Review: Trans porn was rated <a href=""https://www.pornhub.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1_pornhub-insights-2025-year-in-review-most-viewed-categories-worldwide.png"">the second-most viewed category</a> on their website.</p>



<p>For most of my life, I’ve longed for connection, intimacy, romance, and kindness from potential partners. Far too often, I’ve watched longingly as my friends and chosen family have found love in the most unlikely places, only to feel left behind myself. I’ve dreamed of finding my príncipe azul, my ride-or-die guy, my person. I’ve fantasized about what a dream date would look like — a lovely candlelight dinner paired with a glass of wine and effortless conversation  — and about traveling to far-off destinations. I’d love nothing more than to have a partner that buys me flowers just because it’s Sunday, and a relationship built on trust and intimacy. I long to be courted, romanced, and perhaps even married someday.</p>



<p>What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse. I deserve someone who sees me for more than the oversexualized stigmas and preconceived notions that follow trans women, Latinas, and those of us who live at the intersection like a plague. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person. That I will find the kind of love that heals generational wounds, the kind where machismo cannot bloom.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As an activist and advocate with a platform, my life’s work is rooted in fighting for trans rights. We’re human beings deserving of love, care, and compassion. That extends beyond politics, to community care and romantic relationships. Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person. My sisters and I deserve safety and trust. We deserve the kind of love that lasts a lifetime. And it begins with our communities dismantling the false assumptions it makes and perpetuates about us. It requires holding the older generations to account when they make an offhand remark, and challenging the men in our lives when they say bigoted things. We are not anyone’s teachers, therapists, or sex workers. The deeper, inner work of healing and being better men is yours to address and yours alone. We should demand more action from the dating apps, and we need to hold politicians to account for the hate they perpetuate.</p>



<p>Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person. That I will find the kind of love that heals generational wounds, the kind where machismo cannot bloom.<br /></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cara-delevingne"">Cara Delevingne</a> just told me I have “fantastic brows,” and I’m not okay. Well, that’s not entirely true: I’m genuinely overwhelmed with joy at the compliment, and not only because Cara Delevingne is <em>my </em>brow icon — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eyebrows"">brows</a> are her ultimate beauty signature. (In my mind, this is akin to if Michaelangelo complimented me at a Paint &amp; Sip.)  </p>



<p>The L’Oréal ambassador and multi-hyphenate has had a packed schedule as of late, including attending the recent <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-margot-robbie-alison-oliver-interview""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> premiere to support her friend Margot Robbie. “I’ve seen it twice,” she gushes, adding that while she doesn’t typically love period films, the beauty moments were nothing short of mesmerizing. “Margot’s skin and freckles are so gorgeous, and that dewy kind of half-sweat, half-fog from the moors kind of thing, was just so incredible.” (No disagreement there.)  </p>



<p>Ahead, Refinery29 chats with Delevingne about her current makeup and skincare must-haves, beauty philosophy, and why sisterhood is more important than ever. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>Her back-to-basics skincare routine </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne has been a runway mainstay since the 2010s, and has been public about her own skin journey, ranging from <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/cara-delevingne-psoriasis-met-gala"">psoriasis flareups</a> to adult acne. These days, she says, less is much more — a sort of pendulum effect of years of a “really intense way of doing things,” earlier in her career, as she puts it, with elaborate, multi-step skincare routines: “Now, I just wash my face and use the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/revitalift-15-pure-hyaluronic-acid-serum-pimprod2001763?sku=2534685"">[L’Oréal] Revitalift serum</a>, give myself a little lymphatic massage, and drain all that nonsense out my face.” Cut to us both on Zoom, demonstrating our favorite techniques; I’m partial to using my fingertips to glide from between the brows down to the cheekbones, and sweeping along jawline to relieve tension and temporarily depuff. </p>



<h2><strong>Her ultimate brow styling hack </strong></h2>



<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been genuinely floored by a beauty hack, but Delevingne’s takes the cake, IMO. “For a long time — way before I even worked with L’Oréal — I would always use <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elnett-extra-strong-unscented-hairspray-xlsImpprod4180679?sku=2241495"">Elnett</a> [hairspray] on my brows because it reminded me of my granny,” she tells me. “I’d just get a little mascara wand and put it on [the bristles].” (Editor’s note: I can confirm this indeed, works like a charm.) However, if you prefer to stick to <em>actual </em>gels Delevingne and I both swear by <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/infallible-up-24h-brow-lamination-pimprod2045478?sku=2625593"">L’Oréal’s Infallible Brow Lamination gel</a>. It’s especially great for naturally thick brows since it delivers all-day hold but doesn’t feel crunchy, nor does it leave visible, dandruff-like residue that shows up in darker brows like mine. And it seems Delevingne agrees: “I think if I laminated my brows, they would look crazy since I already trim them a lot, but I love the lamination gel.” </p>



<h2><strong>What “I’m Worth It” means to her </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne is refreshingly candid about discussing her career, but absolutely lights up when speaking about the philanthropic work she gets to witness as part of <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/women-of-worth"">L’Oréal’s Women of Worth</a> — a mission-driven initiative inspired by the brand’s iconic tagline. “I think especially right now when gender equality and women’s rights are being taken away and stripped back so much, [it’s inspiring] to be able to bring something that isn’t fear and bad news,” she says of the program, which awards ten monetary grants of $25,000 to non-profits grounded in female empowerment. “I remember going to my first [Women of Worth] event back in 2024, and I can’t tell you how inspired and blown away I was by all of them,” she says. “And [when] people asked me, ‘Which one touched you the most?<em>”</em><em>’</em> I was like, ‘Which one didn’t?’” (Facts!) </p>



<h2><strong>Discovering beauty on her own terms </strong></h2>



<p>In typical Delevingne fashion, the model is having more fun than ever when it comes to beauty — and making it her own. “Growing up as a girl that didn’t love very feminine things like clothes and makeup, I didn’t have an appreciation for it when I was modeling in the same way that I do now,” she says. “When I had space to explore and figure out my own style, my own way of doing makeup, it’s like I’ve experienced what most girls go through as a teenager in my 20s and 30s — it’s that second coming of being a woman.” </p>



<h2><strong>Her role as a L’Oréal ambassador </strong></h2>



<p>Having walked countless runways around the world, Delevingne is right at home at a fashion show — but nothing compared to the experience of being in <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/loreal-paris-x-paris-fashion-week"">L’Oréal’s Le Défile</a>, which has taken place at Paris Fashion Week for two years in a row. “When I was doing fashion shows, I definitely felt nervous and alone, but in that lineup, you have other people lift you up and do the same for others,” she says. “I’m in the lineup next to Jane Fonda talking about the things that scare us most, about lessons that we’ve learned and how important female friendship is.” </p>



<h2><strong>How beauty plays a role when acting (and her love of liquid liner) </strong></h2>



<p>From <em>Paper Towns</em> to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10649938/only-murders-in-the-building-cast-cameos"">Only Murders In The Building</a></em> (in addition to several other projects currently in the works), Delevingne has been busy honing her craft as an actor and utilizing beauty in her process. “When you’re playing a character, I try to think of what scent that person would wear or what little makeup thing that they are really tied to,” she says. “For me as a person, I love doing a cat eye with liquid eyeliner, because I’m good at drawing. So being able to think about that for a character is always so fun, and I think it’s such a good tool to get into that [mindset].” </p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes — both my mom and dad have degrees. I remember my dad studying for his bachelor’s degree when I was a kid, so he could make more money for our family. They always told us we needed to go to college and would help as much as they could. I loved science in school, so after graduating high school, I enrolled in engineering. Everyone always gave me advice to make “practical choices”, so I chose the school that gave me the most scholarships even though it wasn’t exciting. It worked out because COVID happened half way through my college experience, so going to an expensive out-of-state school would have felt like a waste. My parents helped me by sending me money when I needed it, but I took on the bulk of the expenses. I also received some Pell grants after my dad passed away during my junior year of college. <br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />They always stressed the importance of saving money and the difference between wants and needs. There was definitely some fighting behind closed doors and stressors, but they never let it affect my brother and me too much. I didn’t really learn anything about retirement savings or investing until I graduated college, which was a mix of teaching myself and advice from my mom. My mom was an educator at a private elementary school so she was criminally underpaid. My dad was the primary breadwinner for our family and would get stressed by finances, so my mom handled them.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I did some babysitting/dog sitting from age 13. But my first “on the books” job was when I was 16, working for minimum wage at the mall. It was mainly for buying myself “trendy clothes”, to do things with friends and gas money. <br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />No, if they did, they hid it from us. There was one time my dad got laid off but it didn’t last long because they hired him back two weeks later. We were comfortably middle class and my brother and I never went without our needs being met. We didn’t get most of our wants unless it was Christmas or our birthday. We could afford luxuries like family vacations but they were always on the frugal side, like camping and road trips. <br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes and no. Yes, as in I used to be a lot more disciplined in savings/investing, but after I went through a messy breakup with a long-term boyfriend I have entered my chaotic spending era. I have been more conscious about my spending lately and have been ramping it down. No, as in I know I am very lucky to have a decently paying tech job in this job market, and I have a lot of time in the future to save and invest. These days, I’m trying to balance my ‘fun spending’ with saving for the future. They’ve had a lot of layoffs at my company but my position is pretty secure as my work is a high priority — but you never know what can happen. <br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />At 24, when I got my first ‘big girl job’ and moved out of my mom’s house. I have my emergency fund that I contribute to every month that I would use if I lost my job. I know I could always move back in with my mom if necessary but I’d never ask her for money. In unfortunate events, she received a large sum of money when my dad passed from his life insurance policy. I’m so grateful she has that to rely on for retirement even though we would all rather have my dad here.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />When I was 18, my parents gave me the used car my dad drove. When I got in an accident I used the insurance payout for a downpayment on my new car. My mom has told me she has $10k saved for me that she would give me to help pay for a wedding or buy a house, but I have done neither of those things yet.</p>

<h3><strong>Day One</strong>: Monday</h3>



<p>9:00 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I had a busy weekend so I’m very drained. I scroll in bed until 9:25 when I go to log in for my iteration planning meeting, and run a comb through my hair so I don’t look like a mess on camera.</p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — Meeting done. Go make my bed/start some laundry and let the cats out on their catio. I eat my cookie dough overnight oats that I prepped the night before and make some black vanilla tea.  </p>



<p>12 p.m. — My friends are texting me about the <em>Love Island Reunion</em> watch parties tonight. I send them some places that look good and we agree on one. I go wash my face/brush my teeth (I have gotten in the horrible habit of doing this at noon — don’t judge). The cats get their lunch of wet food and I put some bacon in the oven for sandwiches. The catio gets closed for the day because it is too hot to have it open past noon during the Texas summer. </p>



<p>1:05 p.m. — I make a turkey club sandwich and eat while continuing to work. I see a mandatory meeting at 10 p.m. that pops up and I audibly sigh. I never have meetings this late, but we are pushing something to prod that I have been assisting on that is not part of my usual work. Luckily, the place we decided on for the watch party is 10 minutes from me.</p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I get a text from my mom about the total from a lamp making workshop we did this past weekend. I send her my half. <strong>$140</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I finish up my work for the day and the preparations for the prod deployment tonight. I go to my apartment gym for a quick leg day.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Done with the gym. Once home I make a protein smoothie and shower. I do my makeup and blow-dry my hair. Trying to fit with the <em>Love Island</em> theme, I wear a tropical print skirt and a tube top with my Doc Marten sandals. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I get to the place with my friend S. We meet our other friend M. there. We order Happy Hour drinks and $7 quesadillas. I feel bad for the bartender because he’s the only one working and seems very unprepared to serve the hoards of women coming in. I leave a $5 tip. $<strong>19.04</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Unfortunately, the reunion is two hours long so I have to dip out early. S. says she will get a ride from M. I feel kinda meh about the whole reunion and am burnt out of <em>Love Island</em> news. I will definitely still be tuning into some social media discourse later, though. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — I get on my work call, which goes very smoothly. It ends in 20 minutes, which I’m happy about. I get comfy on my couch and finish the last 30 minutes of the reunion and then scroll X/Reddit for too long to read discourse. </p>



<p>11:30 p.m. — I get up to go shower (I can not get into bed without showering right before) and do my nighttime routine. I read my book, <em>The Writing Retreat</em> by Julia Bartz. I just started and I’m getting very invested in it. I try to go to bed at midnight but my messed-up sleep schedule doesn’t let me fall asleep until 1:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $159.04</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Two</strong>: Tuesday </h3>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I feel pretty well rested, despite the late bedtime. I log in to work and answer some emails. After my daily team standup, I go make some scrambled eggs and a yogurt bowl with raspberries and chocolate chips. I try a new brand of chocolate chips from Aldi and I’m not a fan. I guess it’s back to the seven dollar bags of Ghirardelli chips. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — My cats are staring at me like they are being starved, so take a break to feed them. I fold my clean clothes from yesterday and get my life in order.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — After being trapped in a Teams exchange for too long, I go make a turkey club. It’s not brutally hot, so the cats are happily snoozing in their catio. I envy them.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — I go to my apartment’s coworking area because I need a change of scenery. It’s pretty empty and quiet, so I hunker down to do some testing.</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I finish up and decide to call it a day. I go to the mall near me to hunt for a new swimsuit. I have been wearing the same two I already have, so I want something new for a few pool-related events I’m attending. I end up in Dillard’s and find several good options that are 65% off. I finally decide on a green floral print one and two tops from the clearance rack. $<strong>69.17</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — After walking around the mall, I end up back in Dillard’s shoe section. I find a super cute pair of chunky black fisherman sandals for $<strong>56.84</strong> in the clearance section. My emo heart can’t resist, so I get them.</p>



<p>6:10 p.m — Once home I eat some leftover baked black bean tacos with avocado and sour cream on the side. I do the brain-rotting combo of scrolling TikTok with the TV playing YouTube videos in the background. I do this until I have to leave for my pole classes. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — Arrive at the pole studio and greet a few friends. I’m doing a flexibility class and then a Russian exotic class. The studio I go to is a bit of a drive, so I justify it by doing back-to-back classes. </p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — Finish up the second class and have a convo with a friend about our relationship/life woes. I also find our Russian exotic teacher is probably going to move next year and am very sad. At least we get one more year!</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Home. I make a protein smoothie and some popcorn and watch an episode of <em>Dandandan</em> while snacking. I shower and do my night routine. I continue reading my book until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $126.01</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>9 a.m — My alarm goes off and I log into my workspace. I join our quarterly connections meeting with the whole department. I let it play in the background while I make some scrambled eggs and frozen waffles. I also make a green tea. </p>



<p>11:20 a.m. — I order a 48-pack of wet food off Chewy for my older cat. Unfortunately, she is bougie and only eats one specific type, unlike my younger cat, who will eat anything. They both get half wet food and half dry food from their automatic feeder. $<strong>68.17</strong></p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — We have a vendor meeting about one of our applications we manage. The meeting goes well, but we have an end-of-month deadline for this, which seems like it will be easy to finish by. </p>



<p>11:50 a.m. — My younger cat catches a cicada and brings it inside to try to eat. I rescue it from her and throw it back outside where it lives to see another day. She seems very disappointed that she didn’t get to enjoy her disgusting snack.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I eat the last of my black bean tacos and have a Waterloo Cherry Limeade, too. I put on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> for background noise while I eat/work. My friend shared her Peacock account with me on the condition that I watch <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — Log off for the day. Get changed for my pole class and leave.</p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">7 p.m. — I’m done with the first class, which was a cardio dance class. I always feel a little cringe during this class but it is fun. I have an hour and a half to kill before my second class, so I head over to my mom’s house — she lives five minutes away.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Eat dinner with my mom and her boyfriend. He made a delicious Mediterranean salmon with a strawberry salad and it feels nice to have someone make me a meal. My mom and I take her dog on a walk.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back to the studio for my second class. On the way back, I stop to fill up my car. Everyone says not to pole after eating but I’m the opposite; I can’t pole on an empty stomach. <strong>$36.27</strong></p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — Get home and I’m super beat. I shower and make some herbal tea plus a Greek yogurt dessert bowl. I play on my Nintendo Switch for a bit before switching to my book. I get a little too invested and read for too long. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $104.44</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Four</strong>: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:05 a.m. — I wake up to my younger cat having a huge fit. She beefs with any cat she sees outside and doesn’t understand they can’t get to her. I let her out of my bedroom and try to go back to sleep. </p>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I can’t tell if I actually fell asleep again or not. My shoulders feel like they’ve been hit by a bus; today is definitely a rest day. I get up and log on. I take some Advil along with my morning supplements. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Join my daily team standup and send out a few Teams messages. We have to meet with the vendor again for an issue and luckily they responded with a meeting time for today. After the meeting, I grab my double chocolate overnight oats I prepped and add raspberries. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Join the vendor call and they don’t know what to do either. Great lol. I jinxed myself saying this would be easy to finish.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — Eat a turkey club and get ready to leave for my doctor’s appointment.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — On the way to my doctor’s appointment, I need a pick-me-up, so I get a half-and-half tea with peach from Sonic.<strong> $3</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — Done with my doctor’s appointment and I have a small balancer leftover from last time. I pay it with my HSA card. $<strong>17.06</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get home and hop back online. Answer a few missed messages and leave comments on all my stories on the agility board. We switched to a weekly sprints template a month ago and I really like it, my work gets done faster and more efficiently. </p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m feeling beat from the doctor/flu shot I got. I lay down and take a nap.</p>



<p>6:20 p.m. — It starts storming and I get texts from my friends that the floating sound bath at our apartment pool is cancelled. I am lowkey happy as I want to veg out tonight. I get a refund of $19.32 for my ticket. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I heat up some pre-made chicken tikka masala for dinner and eat it with rice. I have a self-care/craft night complete with dying my roots (I refuse to pay $200 plus at the salon for hair dye), and grouting the lamp I made over the weekend. I also play on my Nintendo Switch a bit.</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Stretch and read my book. I pop a melatonin for some undisturbed sleep. I am asleep in 30 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $20.06</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — I wake up early for a vendor meeting just to see it got moved to 9 a.m. I go back to bed and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — Log in for the meeting. Nothing gets resolved and it turns out to be a waste of an hour. </p>



<p>10:20 a.m. — Make some scrambled eggs and two frozen waffles. I also have a kiwi and make a strawberry matcha.</p>



<p>10:40 a.m. — I’m pretty much done with my work this sprint, so I do some chores around the apartment and vacuum. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I respond back and forth with the engineer I have been collaborating with. I try not to be annoyed as I put in a work order for this assignment a month ago, and he has waited for the last possible second to fulfill it. Typical. </p>



<p>1:25 p.m. — Eat a turkey club. Take two Advil as I have a waxing appointment in 30 minutes.</p>



<p>2:20 p.m. — Get a wax. This is my first time seeing my waxing lady at her private studio versus at the big box chain I met her at. She gives me a discount for being a loyal customer but I tip 20%. </p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — On the way home I return something to Ulta Beauty and Amazon. I get back $57.54 from my returns, which basically means my wax was free. </p>



<p>2:50 p.m — I stop by CVS for a new claw clip because I stepped on my old one and broke it. I have eight dollars in extra bucks, plus a $10 off $25 coupon, so I get a lipstick, lipliner, and claw clip all for $8.61. Thanks, TikTok couponing. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — I take a long walk.</p>



<p>6 p.m. — My friend with benefits, K., comes over. He found out a month into us seeing each other that he has to move back to his home country in a year’s time. We get along really well, so we just keep seeing each other and it doesn’t hurt that the sex is good. I refuse to call it a situationship because I hate that term lol. We go get Pho and he pays.</p>



<p>8 p.m. — On the way back from Pho, we stop at a grocery store because I want a sweet treat. One of his friends calls him and invites him out with his friend group and we decide to join. I get some ice cream, turkey bacon, and a kombucha. <strong>$15.20</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m — After fooling around, I change into something better and do some quick makeup. We head to his place because he’s also dressed very casually and wants to change. </p>



<p>11 p.m. — We get to the place. It’s kinda dead so we hop to another place that’s more lively, but we have to wait in line for a bit. Once we get inside K. buys our drinks. </p>



<p>1:30 a.m — We decide to leave and I’m very tipsy but K. is sober and drives me home. We fool around again. I air-fry some Korean corndogs for a post-drinking snack.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — He leaves, which is perfect. I hate sleeping next to a man and would rather have my bed to myself. I shower quickly and promptly pass out. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: </strong>$77.81</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>10:30 a.m. — Wake up. I want to go back to sleep but my brain won’t let me. Both cats are cuddling with me, so I enjoy the cuddles and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Get up and make some banana pancakes and turkey bacon. A few friends and I were going to my apartment’s Labor Day pool party but it’s raining. So we decide we’ll go on Monday instead since we have the day off. </p>



<p>3 p.m. — After being lazy/playing video games for a while, I get ready to meet some other friends C. and F. at a board game store. I lowkey want to stay home but know if I lay around all day I will feel depressed. They are going to be playing their own games, but I have some life admin stuff I want to do, so I tag along. On the way there, I stop at the grocery store and get a snack box and an onigiri for lunch. <strong>$13.51</strong></p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — The tiredness finally hits me. I head home to chill.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — I eat my leftover chicken tikka masala and commence my rotting session.</p>



<p>9 p.m. — K. comes over again and we go see <em>Caught Stealing</em>. I get my ticket free with my AMC A-List subscription. K. buys us popcorn. I enjoy the movie a lot — I would recommend! </p>



<p>12 p.m. — Get home from the movie and say our goodbyes. I shower and go to sleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13.51</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Seven</strong>: Sunday</h3>



<p>10 a.m. — Wake up and scroll in bed. The cats cuddle with me for a bit.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Heat up some frozen Kimbap. I also make a yogurt bowl with kiwi and honey. It’s still raining so I enjoy the chill morning.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I go to Aldi. I get hash brown patties, sparkling water, various fruits, a cucumber, peeled garlic, cherry tomatoes, white cheddar, salami, hummus, Greek yogurt, eggs, English muffins, granola, rice, pasta, olives, and chickpeas. <strong>$52.68</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I head out for the pole studio and drink my kombucha on the way. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I finish up with both of my classes. The first one was another cardio dancing class, and second was level three pole. I eat a protein bar in between classes. The tricks we were learning were very shoulder heavy, so I already foresee the pain I will be in the next day. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — On the way home, I stop by Raising Cane’s. What’s the point of working out if you can’t indulge in some guilty pleasures? I get a three-finger combo with a Diet Coke. <strong>$10.38</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After showering and doing some very dark makeup, I uber to a friend’s house to chill before going out to the alternative/goth club. <strong>$12.89</strong></p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — After hanging out for a bit, we head out. </p>



<p>1 a.m — I head out early because I’m tired of socializing and dancing. I ended up not buying any drinks. I get a ride home with a sober friend. Once home, I heat up some frozen pizza. I start feeling sad and call my ex (we are on speaking terms). We talk about life and I cry some.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — I pass out and look forward to sleeping in for the holiday. <br /><br /><strong>Daily Total: $75.95</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I need to fix my sleep schedule LOL. And stop being sad about my ex. Other than that, I don’t think I did too badly this week. The shopping I did is very out of the ordinary for me — I usually don’t impulse buy clothes.”</p>
