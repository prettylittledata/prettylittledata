<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937971.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>POV: You slept just <em>okay</em>, and it was one of those mornings where you hit snooze and begrudgingly forced yourself out of bed. As much as I prioritize sleep — and it has been documented that I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nighttime-sleep-routine-editors-picks"">very much do</a> — sometimes, you can’t help feeling tired. And for me, my eyes are an undeniable tell; when I’m low on <em>zzz</em>‘s, my undereye area is puffy and purplish (I am not genetically prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-under-eye-cream"">dark circles</a>, so I know it’s bad when I need to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/color-correcting-makeup-review"">color-correct</a>). I’ve consciously uncoupled from eye creams, but still love a lightweight <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-peptide-eye-serum-review"">eye serum</a> or better yet – an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/under-eye-mask"">undereye patch</a>.</p>



<p>At first look, eye masks more or less seem the same across the board: Usually made from a hydrogel or lyocell and/or bio-cellulose material, saturated with a serum-like goo to help soothe, brighten, and hydrate under the eyes. Well, not only are they very much not created equal (many that I’ve tried simply feel nice, but that’s about it), but I’m here to report that I’ve found an unlikely favorite in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/07/11039889/rhode-skin-care-products-review"">Rhode</a>‘s new <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937967.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Remember what I said earlier about a lot of patches just feeling nice but not actually doing much? Not these. Hailey did her big one with these, because <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">Peptide Eye Prep</a> doesn’t only contain peptides (somewhat of a hero ingredient for Rhode), but also caffeine, sodium PCA (an amino acid that works similarly to hyaluronic acid to trap and lock in moisture), and glycerin to visibly depuff, brighten, and moisturize under the eyes. After a night of too many cocktails and not enough sleep, I put these on while walking my dog the following morning. Right away, these felt instantly cool and refreshing (even without putting them in the fridge), and the symmetrical bean shape meant that I didn’t have to play a guessing game of how to properly place them. (There is somewhat of a hotly contested debate over the Nike <em>swoosh</em>-shaped ones, and whether the tapered end should face your inner or outer end of the orbital area.) </p>





<p>When I got back to my apartment about 10 minutes later, I removed them and inspected the results. To my surprise and delight, my puffiness was nearly gone, and my dark circles visibly less noticeable. But perhaps most noteworthy is that I actually felt like my overall eye area was perked up and <em>felt </em>awake. I’ve liked most Rhode products that I’ve tried, and admit that at first, I thought these logo-printed patches were just a viral beauty moment — and a clever one at that. But after trying these out a few times, I have to say that I’m impressed. Peptide Eye Prep definitely earned its spot in my airplane beauty routine as well as my makeup bag before getting ready for a night out. Are they a bit pricey at <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/peptide-eye-prep-r-icon"">$25 for six</a> (or <a href=""https://www.rhodeskin.com/products/the-peptide-eye-prep-set"">$47 for 12</a>)? Well, yes — but not at all unheard of for premium eye masks. (My other fave, <a href=""https://www.wanderbeauty.com/products/baggage-claim-eye-masks"">Wander Beauty’s Baggage Claim</a>, are similarly priced at $26 for a set of six.) The individual packaging adds to the cost, but makes them infinitely more travel-friendly in my opinion — which I personally am willing to pay more for. And the Rhode-club selfies you’ll post while wearing ’em? Priceless.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937924.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>At first, Sandra Campos hesitated about joining the TikTok trend taking over her feed. In the five years since immigration officers had dropped her off at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-border-stories-art-joy"">the Mexican border</a>, she had chosen to keep her life-altering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">deportation story</a> off of her social media page, fearing rejection. </p>



<p>But as deportation videos multiplied across social media platforms under President Donald Trump’s second administration, she found that deportees, like herself, were picking up their phones and telling their side of the story. In May, she joined the trend with a playful, 6-second clip.</p>



<p><a href=""https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSUrXrQBx/"">In the video</a>, Campos whips her long hair in disbelief. The on-screen text reads: “When you get deported after living in the U.S. for 20+ years and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10971837/no-sabo-kid-meaning-new-definition"">barely know Spanish</a>.” </p>



<p>To her surprise, the response was massive. The video quickly went viral, racking up more than 14 million views and 12,000 comments. While some messages were negative, most were supportive, wishing her luck or sharing that their own loved ones had been deported, too.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page. But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I was a little skeptical at first about talking about my deportation on my page,” 28-year-old Campos told Refinery29 Somos during a video call from Guanajuato, a colorful city nestled in the mountains of central Mexico. “But after I saw that it was well received, my doubts went away.”</p>



<p>Campos is part of a growing wave of deportees using TikTok to reclaim their stories and shed light on a side of immigration rarely seen: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11180964/undocumented-daca-immigrants-leaving-us"">what happens after<em> </em>deportation</a>. Through hashtags such as #LifeAfterDeportation, creators share clips about finding work, struggling with Spanish, enrolling their kids in school, and other challenges of rebuilding a life in an unfamiliar place.</p>



<p>“ When I got deported, it wasn’t really big,” said Campos. “Now, everybody’s talking about it.” </p>



<p>For Campos, who was deported in 2020 under the first Trump administration, opening up about such a traumatic event wasn’t easy. “I feel like I was a bit embarrassed about what happened,” she explained. That year, police stopped her for a traffic violation and handed her over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p>



<p>Despite qualifying for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/09/10003291/daca-trump-supreme-court-immigrant-experience"">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA), the program that allows for deportation protection and work permits for immigrants who were brought over as children, Campos said that her lawyer had advised her not to renew her permit, which she now regrets. Although Campos fought her case, she was deported to Mexico after having lived in Missouri since the age of two.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do.”</p><cite>Sandra Campos</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Thinking about it now is just crazy, but I hated my life so much [after deportation],” Campos said. “I missed everything about the U.S. I didn’t wanna be here for another minute.”</p>



<p>After spending almost a year with distant relatives in Mexico City, she moved to Guanajuato, found a job as a server, and pursued social media more seriously. Earlier this year, she discovered that what people most resonated with on TikTok was her deportation story. Since her first post in May, she has gained 23,000 followers and received an outpouring of support.</p>



<p>“They say things like, ‘I’m really glad you put your story out there.’ And I’m like, ‘Dang!’ I didn’t realize that so many people are going through the same things I went through about not being able to speak Spanish, coming to a whole new place and not knowing what to do,” she said.</p>



<p>Anna Garcia, a 35-year-old mother of five, knows that feeling well. In 2018, she was arrested at a custody hearing in Utah and deported to Mexico, with $40 in her pocket. Forced to restart her life far from her children felt “like a death sentence,” she told Somos. “I felt like my life was over.” </p>



<p>But over the next year, she pieced her life together in Puerto Vallarta, a city on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, with the goal of regaining custody of her kids. She began <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx"">documenting her journey</a> on TikTok, gaining half a million followers and becoming a prominent voice for deportees.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions.”</p><cite>Denise Serrato</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""http://tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7200468260947578154?_t=ZS-90Qzv7ESaRR&amp;_r=1"">One of her most viral videos</a> captures her reunion with her kids, with a teary-eyed Garcia embracing her children in the Puerto Vallarta International Airport. It’s a moment that might have otherwise gone unnoticed offline, but on TikTok, it allowed for thousands of followers to hold space for her.</p>



<p>One user responded: “So happy for you…I wish you and your babies the best!”</p>



<p>Another said: “My kid’s dad got deported when they were 2 and 6 mo. They are now 6 &amp; 8. I pray they get to reunite with their father one day.”<br /></p>



<p>Denise Serrato, a mental health clinician who often works with immigrant clients, says it’s unsurprising that people who have been affected by deportation are connecting with these stories. “When someone sees deportation stories online, it can trigger a sense of ‘I’m not alone.’ Social media gives visibility to experiences that are often silenced or stigmatized,” she said.</p>



<p>“It helps people realize that what they’re feeling — fear, anger, grief — is shared by others, which normalizes those emotions,” she added.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p><cite>Anna Garcia</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>While Garcia has used the #LifeAfterDeportation hashtag for years, she said that interest has picked up in recent months as more deportations make headlines and anti-immigrant rhetoric intensifies. “ I’ve seen a huge influx of the same type of content,” she said.</p>



<p>For Garcia, who experienced backlash when she first shared her story, seeing more deportation stories online feels like a breakthrough. “It was kind of shameful back then. I have seen a lot of people more comfortable with talking about it now and being empathetic hearing these stories.” </p>



<p>Garcia said that some followers are also reaching out seeking legal advice for loved ones facing deportation. While she tries to offer individual support, she now shares videos offering useful resources for deportees, such as how to access immigration records from the U.S. government or how to seek assistance from Mexican authorities following deportation.</p>



<p>Wanting to help immigrants has motivated Garcia to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney. In August, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@annigrcxxx/video/7538154075041352990?_r=1&amp;_t=ZS-90Q7KhU9lm1"">posted a video</a> celebrating the completion of her first year as a law student. The text read: “Watch me turn pain into purpose and grow into a law student in my home country.”</p>



<p>Her message, she said, is simple: life doesn’t end with deportation.</p>



<p>“I want my content to embody that there is life — and a lot of it — after deportation.”</p>

<p>Cosmic crew, welcome to a week that feels like the rom-com scene after the messy breakup montage. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-virgo-horoscope-september-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, the planet of love</a>, beauty, and “let’s just vibe in harmony,” is officially back home in Libra on October 13th, and the energy is immaculate. After weeks of Virgo nitpicking (“does this person spark joy <em>and </em>meet my 17-point checklist?”), Venus in Libra is like, “girl, relax. Flirt, paint, wear the glitter eyeliner, text them back.” This is us <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">hard-launching</a> joy again in Q4. We’re still intentional, but now the assignment is to let life be a little lighter, a little sexier, a little <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/witchy-gifts-halloween-magic"">more about connection</a>. <br /><br />And Venus doesn’t come alone. Five hours after she steps into Libra, Pluto, the planet of transformation, obsession, and revolution, wakes up from its five-month retrograde nap in Aquarius. And not just any nap: Pluto basically took an ancestral vision quest and came back like, “okay, I’ve got the blueprint for liberation.” The kicker? Venus immediately trines Pluto. Babe, that’s cosmic exhibitionism. This <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air trine</a> is basically the equivalent of them cosmically making out in public, combining forces to remind us how to love harder, freer, and more honestly — both in our own reflections and in the ways we see each other. It’s giving: make love, start revolutions, repeat. </p>



<p>Of course, Mama Luna’s got her own flavor shifts to keep us on our toes. We kick off with the Cancer Moon, which squares Venus in Libra. Translation: tenderness meets tension. You may feel misunderstood in love, or you might over-extend yourself financially/emotionally trying to “keep the peace.” Don’t fall for every sob story, and don’t let someone guilt-trip you out of your boundaries. Midweek, the Moon strides into Leo (Oct 14–16), where it opposes Pluto in Aquarius. Expect collective drama — headlines about power struggles, group accountability, and maybe some performative flexing. On a personal level, check if your pride is clashing with someone else’s truth. </p>



<p>By the weekend, the Moon slides into Virgo (Oct 16–18), syncing beautifully with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio</a>. That’s our cosmic reset: after all the emotional highs, fiery declarations, and power showdowns, we’re reminded to get back to basics. Clean the space, re-organize the notes app, and actually implement the downloads from last week’s Aries Full Moon. Virgo Moon energy is like a Sunday ritual stretched across the weekend — grounding, practical, but still deeply healing. By the end of this week, we’re collectively learning that love, revolution, and liberation don’t have to be abstract. They can show up in small, consistent choices that build a freer, softer life. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week kicks off with Venus sliding into Libra on the 13th, activating your partnership sector, and it feels like a cosmic reset button for your relationships. If Venus in Virgo had you second-guessing every little thing about compatibility, Venus in Libra is like, “hey, love can be graceful too.” This transit reminds you that you don’t have to white-knuckle your way through intimacy. It’s about balance, sweetness, laughter, and finding joy in the <em>togetherness </em>of it all. For you, this could mean softer conversations, magnetic new connections, or simply remembering that healthy love feels easy, not heavy. <br /><br />Then comes Pluto, freshly direct in Aquarius, activating your friendship and community sector. Pluto’s been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">retrograde for five months</a>, digging through the basement of your social world, and now it emerges with clarity. This is about owning your power in groups, knowing which collectives actually feed your growth, and realizing where you’ve been silencing yourself to “fit in.” Pluto direct is also about revolution in the digital/tech space for you — maybe you’re stepping into a new online platform, finding your voice on social media, or joining a movement that feels too aligned to ignore. Whatever the form, it’s liberation time. </p>



<p>Here’s the kicker: Venus and Pluto, both in Air signs, are trining each other this week. That’s harmony between your partnerships and your friendships, your one-on-one bonds and your wider circles. Gorgeous energy, but remember: even too much harmony can get dizzying. The shadow here could be projecting ideals onto people or chasing the rush of connection without grounding it in reality. Because Venus in Libra still opposes your Aries placements, this week may bring both attraction and tension: what feels sweet could also stretch you outside your comfort zone. The key is balance. Let yourself be inspired by the vision of love and community this trine opens… but don’t forget to keep your feet on the ground and your boundaries intact. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Venus entering Libra on the 13th is basically your ruling planet coming home and tossing you the keys to the wellness suite. This lights up your sector of health, routines, and daily balance. Where Venus in Virgo had you micro-analyzing who or what was draining your joy, Venus in Libra is here to restore harmony, but in practical, embodied ways. This is about making your body feel like a temple again: cooking meals that are both nourishing <em>and </em>aesthetic, finding beauty in your workspace, or bringing more play into your exercise routines. Love doesn’t have to stay in the bedroom this week — it can live in your rituals, your self-care, and how you treat your day-to-day as sacred. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, turning the lights back on in your career and long-term vision sector. For the past five months, you may have been privately rethinking what success really means to you, and now the Universe says it’s time to own it out loud. Pluto direct here can feel like an unveiling: a role you’re meant to step into, a professional project that suddenly has momentum, or an inner voice that refuses to let you play small in public anymore. It’s not about overnight fame — it’s about stepping into authority and knowing your voice can shift systems, even subtly. </p>



<p>Now here’s where it gets juicy: Venus in Libra trines Pluto in Aquarius, weaving together your health sector with your career sector. This is cosmic support for aligning what you do daily with the bigger mission you’re building — basically the “habits meet legacy” moment. The high road: designing routines that fuel your professional glow. The shadow? Romanticizing your future vision so much that you forget to show up in the present, or over-committing to roles that drain your body. Remember: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-taurus-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus is your ruler</a>, so its harmony with Pluto is powerful for you, but grounding is key. This is the week to let your self-care and your calling be on the same team, not fighting for your attention. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Venus enters Libra on the 13th and beams straight into your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. This is cosmic permission to flirt with life again. After Venus in Virgo had you stress-testing every detail, Libra says: lighten up. Lean into play, beauty, and love that feels like art. Whether it’s someone you’re crushing on, a passion project you’ve been circling, or just the act of letting yourself <em>enjoy, </em>Venus here reminds you that pleasure is a form of medicine. The more you indulge your inner artist or lover, the more the world mirrors that joy back to you. <br /><br />Then Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, illuminating your expansion sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reflecting on what freedom really means: what you want to study, where you want to travel, how you want to push past the limits of your current story. Pluto waking up here is like a lightbulb moment — you suddenly see where you’ve been conditioned to think too small, and you’re ready to stretch. This isn’t about reckless leaps; it’s about claiming your right to live bigger, wiser, and braver. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your creativity and joy align seamlessly with your expansion and growth. This is the Air-sign magic you thrive on: ideas, art, and experiences flowing like oxygen. The high vibe? Love that teaches you something new, creative projects that expand your worldview, travel or studies that spark romance. The shadow? Chasing ideals so fast you forget to ground them, or projecting fantasies onto people who can’t deliver. Venus in Libra does oppose your Gemini placements by modality (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardinal-mutable-fixed-signs"">cardinal vs. mutable</a>), so pacing matters. Let yourself be enchanted by the possibilities, but also anchor them — sketch the dream, but also build the frame to hold it. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, are you ready for some necessary shake-ups at home? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, highlighting your sector of family, roots, and emotional foundation. This isn’t about surface-level décor changes (though you may feel called to rearrange your space); it’s about bringing harmony where there’s been tension. Venus here wants you to ask: does my living environment feel like love? Does it reflect balance, beauty, and peace — or just clutter and compromise? Shadows could show up if you’ve been people-pleasing with relatives or ignoring your own needs in order to “keep the peace.” Venus in Libra pushes you to re-center yourself as much as you care for others. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, is stationing direct in Aquarius in your intimacy and shared resources sector. For the past five months, you’ve likely been reflecting on power dynamics — financially, emotionally, or sexually — and Pluto direct brings all of that into sharper focus. This isn’t light energy; it’s about transformation through vulnerability. Maybe you’re renegotiating financial commitments, maybe you’re deepening a bond, or maybe you’re finally letting go of an entanglement that’s been too heavy. Pluto asks: where have you been afraid to surrender, and what would true liberation feel like? </p>



<p>Now, Venus and Pluto are trining each other — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10715197/air-signs-meaning-gemini-libra-aquarius"">Air-sign</a> magic — connecting your domestic world with your deeper bonds. This is gorgeous energy for building a home life that actually supports the intimacy you crave. It could feel like a breath of fresh air in relationships, or like the courage to merge resources in a way that uplifts both of you. But here’s the caution: trines can get intoxicating. Don’t get swept away in fantasies of the “perfect” partner or the “ideal” home setup without checking in on reality. The sweet spot for you this week is grounding… finding the balance between dreamy upgrades and tangible foundations. If you can do that, you’re stepping into a new level of security that feeds both your heart and your future. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you ready for your words to turn heads? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your communication sector and making your voice magnetic. This is the week where conversations turn flirty, your writing or content pops off, and even casual chats feel charged with charm. Venus here wants you to find beauty in the exchange — to say what you mean, but also to say it with grace. On the shadow side, you could be tempted to smooth things over with pretty words instead of being real. Remember: harmony is cute, but honesty is what sustains connections. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your partnership sector. After five months of retrograde review, the dynamics in your closest bonds are about to shift. This could look like a deeper level of intimacy in a romantic relationship, a business alliance leveling up, or a friendship where truth finally surfaces. Pluto in Aquarius isn’t casual — it’s about collective liberation through personal honesty. You’ll feel the push to show up fully as yourself in relationships, even if that means releasing dynamics that no longer honor your growth. </p>



<p>Here’s the magic: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining each other, harmonizing your communication with your partnerships. Translation: your words have the power to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11877498/dreamville-festival-2025-north-carolina-travel-diary"">transform your connections</a> right now. The high road? Conversations that bring clarity, confessions that strengthen bonds, agreements that feel like fresh air. The shadow? Getting swept up in love-bombing, saying yes too quickly, or over romanticizing what someone <em>could </em>be. Balance your fire with discernment. When you stay grounded in your truth, this trine helps you build relationships that are both magnetic and sustainable. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to rethink your money moves? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of income, values, and self-worth. After weeks of Virgo-Venus energy that had you hyper-analyzing every detail, this shift feels like a sigh of relief. Venus in Libra asks: how can you bring more balance to your finances and more beauty to your relationship with abundance? Maybe that looks like investing in something that uplifts you, or finally realizing that wealth isn’t just about numbers — it’s about alignment with what you truly value. Shadow side? Spending just to “keep up appearances” or ignoring the deeper work of budgeting because it feels less glamorous. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, shaking awake your health, work, and routine sector. For the past five months, you’ve been reconsidering how you pour your energy into daily tasks — and who benefits from it. Pluto direct here says: no more leaking your power through endless to-dos or toxic workplace dynamics. This is transformation at the ground level of your life — how you move through your mornings, how you care for your body, how you decide what <em>really </em>deserves your focus. The changes might feel subtle at first, but they’re foundational. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your money and values sector aligns with your work and wellness sector. Translation: it’s time to let your values <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/human-design-astrology-skincare-routine"">shape your routines</a> and your routines support your values. Gorgeous synergy, but it comes with a caution: don’t over-idealize quick fixes or chase shiny purchases as a substitute for deeper discipline. The beauty here is in building harmony that lasts. If you commit to balance — financially, physically, spiritually — this trine helps you create systems that feel like love in action. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready for your cosmic glow-up? Venus, your ruling planet, enters your sign on the 13th and suddenly the spotlight is squarely on you. This is the start of a season where your aura feels magnetic, your style feels on point, and people can’t help but orbit closer. Venus here is like, “remember that you are the art.” It’s a call to celebrate yourself — not in a shallow way, but by honoring your beauty, your charm, and your ability to create harmony just by being present. The shadow side? Over focusing on external validation or smoothing over conflicts so much that you erase your own needs. <br /><br />Pluto, meanwhile, stations direct in Aquarius, activating your sector of creativity, romance, and joy. For the past five months, you’ve been internally processing what sparks passion and what feels stale. Now, Pluto’s direct turn invites you to step fully into your desires: to reclaim the parts of yourself that crave fun, artistry, and intimacy without shame. This isn’t about casual thrills — it’s about digging into what actually transforms you. You may feel pulled toward lovers or projects that change the way you see yourself forever. </p>



<p>And here’s where it all clicks: Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius are trining, weaving your sense of self with your creative and romantic fire. This is cosmic electricity, making you irresistible to opportunities that reflect who you truly are. The high road? Using this magnetism to create, connect, and inspire. The shadow? Getting swept away in the rush of attraction, or romanticizing people/projects that look shiny but lack depth. With all this air energy, stay grounded. When you center your authentic self, this week can feel like the start of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">new personal era</a> — bold, beautiful, and deeply true to you. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to face what’s been lurking in the background? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of rest, healing, and the subconscious. This is a tender placement for Venus — it asks you to soften, retreat, and reconnect with the unseen parts of yourself. Think: more solitude, more journaling, more dreaming. Instead of chasing external validation, Venus here helps you rediscover harmony inside. The shadow? Escaping into fantasies or romanticizing unavailable people just because it feels safe at a distance. Venus in Libra reminds you: intimacy with yourself is the foundation for intimacy with anyone else. <br /><br />At the same time, Pluto, your second planetary ruler, stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your sector of home, family, and roots. For the past five months, you’ve been excavating the stories you inherited from your past — the patterns around safety, power, and belonging. Pluto’s direct turn can feel like a breakthrough: suddenly you see clearly which ancestral cycles you’re meant to break, or how to reclaim control in your domestic life. This could manifest as literal home changes or as emotional clarity about where (and with whom) you truly feel at home. </p>



<p>When Venus and Pluto trine, your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">inner healing</a> sector links with your home and family sector. This is potent for mending old wounds, repairing family dynamics, or finally creating a sanctuary that actually reflects your soul. But remember: too much air-trine harmony can feel intoxicating, like you’ve already transcended the work. Don’t get carried away by the idea of a “perfect” healing breakthrough — keep showing up for the daily practices that anchor it. If you do, this week can feel like a deep exhale: the merging of inner peace and outer stability in ways you’ve been craving for years.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, are you ready to shake up your circle? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, lighting up your sector of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/age-gap-friendship-benefits-different-generations"">friendships, community</a>, and collective vision. Suddenly, you’re the connector — introducing people, sparking collaborations, and feeling the love in your wider networks. Venus here is about harmony in your social world, reminding you that the right community feels like art: balanced, supportive, and fun. The shadow? Getting caught up in popularity contests or trying to keep the peace when deeper truths need to be addressed. Venus in Libra asks: which relationships are worth the effort, and which are just background noise? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, electrifying your communication and learning sector. For the past five months, you’ve been digging deeper into how you speak, teach, and share your ideas — maybe even confronting fears around being misunderstood. Now Pluto’s direct, your words carry weight. This is a season where your voice can catalyze change, whether that’s through content, conversations, or speaking up in rooms that used to intimidate you. Your mind feels sharper, braver, and ready to break through outdated narratives. </p>



<p>Together, Venus in Libra and Pluto in Aquarius form a trine, linking your friendships with your communication. Translation: your voice has the power to rally your community, and your community has the power to amplify your voice. The high road? Building movements, friendships, or projects that feel revolutionary <em>and </em>joyful. The shadow? Getting swept away in the echo chamber — mistaking group hype for true alignment, or chasing ideals without grounding them. This week, stay rooted in your truth. When you combine your natural optimism with Pluto’s intensity and Venus’s charm, your words can spark the kind of connections that change everything. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you ready to step into the spotlight? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your career and public recognition sector. This is your cue to shine professionally, whether that means your work finally gets the applause it deserves or you simply feel more magnetic in public spaces. Venus transiting Libra smooths over authority dynamics, helps you attract collaborators, and gives you the charisma to pitch, present, or lead with ease. The shadow? Over-polishing your image to the point where you hide your real self. Venus in Libra reminds you: true success is when your outer reputation matches your inner alignment. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, waking up your money and values sector. For the past five months, you’ve been rethinking your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/05/10960772/building-generational-wealth-latinx-experts"">relationship with wealth</a> and worth — what you spend on, what you save, and what you expect in return for your efforts. Pluto direct here can feel like a breakthrough: maybe a new financial opportunity, a deeper awareness of your value in professional settings, or the courage to say no when something doesn’t align with your standards. This is empowerment through resources, not just survival. </p>



<p>Now, with Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your career sector aligns beautifully with your money and values. The high vibe? Work that feels rewarding <em>and </em>pays accordingly, opportunities to negotiate your worth with ease, or finding harmony between your ambitions and your bank account. The shadow? Getting carried away by external validation — chasing titles, applause, or financial wins at the expense of your deeper purpose. This week is about grounding your ambition in authenticity. When you lead from that place, the recognition and the resources flow naturally. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to feel like you’ve woken up from a five-month dream? Pluto stations direct in your sign on the 13th, and it’s like the lights come back on. For months, you’ve been internally dissecting your identity, power, and long-term vision. Now Pluto’s direct turn says: it’s time to embody what you’ve been processing. This could feel liberating — like a fresh layer of skin — but also intense, as you recognize just how much <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/let-them-theory-tiktok-relationships-dating"">you’ve changed</a>. The shadow? Clinging to outdated versions of yourself because it feels safer than stepping into the radical transformation that’s calling you. <br /><br />At the same time, Venus enters Libra and blesses your sector of expansion, travel, education, and big-picture dreams. This is a beautiful transit for saying yes to adventures, whether that means booking a trip, signing up for a class, or diving into a philosophy that lights you up. Venus in Libra says, “make it beautiful, make it joyful,” reminding you that expansion doesn’t have to feel like pressure; it can feel like pleasure. The shadow here would be chasing escapism… running off to find harmony somewhere else instead of tending to what’s right in front of you. </p>



<p>Together, Venus and Pluto form a trine, linking your sense of self with your growth sector. Translation: this is cosmic support for becoming a more expansive, liberated version of you — one who knows their worth and isn’t afraid to explore new horizons. The high road? Aligning with people, projects, or studies that stretch you in ways that feel inspiring. The caution? Getting carried away with ideals and forgetting to ground your progress in the present. This week is about marrying transformation with adventure, liberation with joy. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to go deep? Venus enters Libra on the 13th, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and deep trust. This is a week where your closest bonds could feel sweeter, deeper, and more harmonious — whether financially, emotionally, or romantically. Venus here invites you to explore what reciprocity feels like when it’s balanced and beautiful. The shadow? Romanticizing unavailable people or ignoring red flags just to preserve the illusion of peace. Venus in Libra wants you to ask: does this connection truly feel mutual, or am I just playing nice? <br /><br />Meanwhile, Pluto stations direct in Aquarius, lighting up your subconscious and healing sector. For <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pluto-retrograde-in-aquarius-may-2025-meaning-effects"">the past five months</a>, you’ve been moving through shadow work quietly, processing fears, dreams, and old conditioning that shape your present. Pluto direct here is a revelation: suddenly, what’s been hidden becomes undeniable. This can feel intense, but it’s also freeing, because you can’t heal what you don’t see. Pay attention to dreams, intuitive nudges, and subtle patterns this week — they hold the keys to liberation. </p>



<p>With Venus and Pluto forming a trine, your intimacy sector links with your subconscious. Translation: deep healing and transformation are possible through love, trust, and vulnerability. The high vibe? Relationships that feel like medicine, money moves that free you from old limitations, or breakthroughs in therapy or spiritual practice. The shadow? Getting lost in fantasies of merging so fully with others that you forget yourself. Balance is key. This week, intimacy is powerful, but it works best when you bring your full, sovereign self into the connection.</p>

<p>Just like its subject matter, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8R6DMlDtxk""><em>After The Hunt</em></a> is polarizing. The <a href=""https://www.gq.com/story/luca-guadagnino-wants-to-run-a-film-festival"">Luca Guadagnino</a>-directed and <a href=""https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/after-the-hunt-screenwriter-nora-garrett-interview-1235154652/"">Nora Garrett</a>-written psychological thriller is being met with mixed reviews. In one camp, you have those who think the film (starring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11504839/ayo-edebiri-bottoms-sag-aftra-strike"">Ayo Edebiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/andrew-garfield"">Andrew Garfield</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/julia-roberts-hair-stylist-interview"">Julia Roberts</a>), which wades into the treacherous waters of depicting the aftermath of a sexual assault on campus, is <a href=""https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-the-hunt-film-review-2025"">“sharp”, “well-calibrated” and “provocative”</a> and in the other, you’ve got those who have written the film off as <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/hunt-review-julia-roberts-stars-173419042.html"">“wasted potential” full of “unlikeable characters.”</a> <em>The New Yorker</em> called <em>After The Hunt </em>“<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">a pleasurably ludicrous house of cards</a>” while the <em>New York Times</em> pegged the film as “<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/movies/after-the-hunt-review.html"">uncomfortable, for the wrong reasons</a>.” The opposing responses are inevitable when you’re plunging headlong into a <a href=""https://metoomvmt.org/get-to-know-us/tarana-burke-founder/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">topic like #MeToo</a>, a movement turned hashtag turned buzzword that stirs passionate defenses or ardent attacks at its mere mention, usually depending on your political leanings. There’s never going to be a general consensus on cancel culture, racism, sexism, and feminism, or overwhelming unity on how to approach the zeitgeist’s most hotly-debated subjects. The inconsistency is the point. That’s not to say that <em>After The Hunt</em> doesn’t take a clear stance on these issues by its end — it does — but it deftly captures the push-and-pull (and cringe) of where these discussions have landed in the past five years, sometimes clumsily but with nuance, complexity, and self-awareness. </p>



<p>And it’s in that audacity to let its waters stay murky, to allow its characters to be unreliable and unlikeable, and to live in the grey, where I think <em>After The Hunt</em> shines. Roberts plays Alma Imhoff, a Yale professor whose star student, Maggie (Edebiri), accuses her colleague and best friend, Hank (Garfield), of sexual assault. From pretentious pseudo-intellectual debates over whisky to hard-to-watch faceoffs between two women from different generations and races who throw jabs about pronouns and intersectionality at each other to the unfairly messy politics of consent, <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCC7iIMHq2U"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">After The Hunt</a> </em>dares to capture the frustration, hypocrisy and absurdity of the past five to six years (the movie is set from 2019-2025). It doesn’t deliver answers necessarily, but neither does that white dude in your Ethics 101 class — or your timeline — trying to debate you about your humanity. Mostly, these topics shouldn’t be up for debate at all. <em>After The Hunt</em> asks you to confront your own participation in making sexual assault a punchline and complicity in twisting the push for victims into fodder for the culture wars. The movie’s biggest flaw is that the racial dynamic between Maggie and Alma isn’t mined enough, but thanks to stellar performances by Roberts (her best in years) and Edebiri (consistently proving she’s a <em>star</em>), the gaps in the script are filled in with subtext and loaded stares. Throw in a live wire Garfield (he’s riveting and infuriating) and you’ve got a film that grabs hold and doesn’t let go until its final frame. Plus, it’s just a good movie that’s propulsively watchable, albeit unnerving. </p>

<p>The week I saw <em>After The Hunt </em>was the same week news broke that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple TV was shelving </a><em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/24/arts/television/the-savant-apple-tv-plus.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Savant</a></em>, a series in which <a href=""https://time.com/7320232/the-savant-apple-tv-jessica-chastain/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Chastain</a> plays an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups to take down violent extremists, in the aftermath of the murder of <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/charlie-kirk-ezra-klein-tanehisi-coates?srsltid=AfmBOoqCp4lcrSX-2nZEsCKOrppLRX-Blw6tyBZrPK9fVFiDIjEhU8Mq"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">right wing podcaster Charlie Kirk</a> reportedly because its subject matter was too sensitive and too close to real life. To me, that’s exactly <em>why</em> that series should have been released. <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/09/jessica-chastain-does-not-agree-apple-the-savant-postponed-1236554606/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chastain agreed</a>. I’m tired of Hollywood’s fear of tackling relevant topics, I’m tired of films that don’t try to say anything at all. I’m tired of movies that seem built by an algorithm designed to garner the least backlash. At least <em>After The Hunt </em>has a backbone. Throughout the film, Guadagnino delivers a “<a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/10/13/after-the-hunt-movie-review"">borderline trollish act of homage</a>” to famously “cancelled” Woody Allen, and it’s a rare, bold confrontation of the real-life controversies <em>After The Hunt</em> is trying to satirize. It was a big swing, and whether you like it or not, the film is an accurate snapshot of the #MeToo era. </p>

<p><em>After The Hunt </em>documents a moment in time — a disturbing, delicate, and awkward moment in time, one that we are still navigating. And for better or worse, shouldn’t we have art that reflects these times? Sometimes, I think I can tell when a movie is going to outlive its discourse. With time, <em>After The Hunt</em> may hold up as a page to be read in the chapter of this so-called cultural reckoning. Think of it as a sleek and uncomfortable time capsule of the past half decade of #MeToo discourse, or as a character study of flawed intellectuals desperately attempting to perform their values while clinging to the facade of their respective identities. Or, as Edebiri told me, <em>After The Hunt </em>is a “<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-2795806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rorschach test</a>” that interrogates your discomfort. </p>



<p>Refinery29 spoke to Edebiri and her co-star Garfield over video chat during the film’s press junket in New York City and the duo discussed everything from their hesitation to play these parts, the psyches of their divisive characters, and the more lighthearted generational debates that dominate our timelines. <em>Mild spoilers ahead.</em></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: One of the biggest things I was thinking when I was watching<em> After The Hunt </em></strong><strong>was,<em> wow, they really went there. </em></strong><strong>The movie thrives in the discomfort of some of these big cultural conversations. Did either of you have any apprehension or hesitation when it came to tackling such lightning rod issues?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ayo Edebiri: </strong>Yes, definitely, definitely. But I think part of that was the reason that drew me to this [film] and interrogating within myself: <em>what are my apprehensions? Why am I self censoring my thoughts about these conversations? </em>It’s proof in a lot of these spaces that the reason why we’re not done is because we don’t want to touch certain areas — on all sides. So being able to then go here’s this amazing, intentional, thoughtful, caring group of people and we all want to dig into this thing with each other. It was an honor to get to dive in.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937718.png?width=1024&amp;height=640&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=8%3A5"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Andrew, do you feel the same way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Andrew Garfield: </strong>I do, and I think we’re in a moment in time right now where artists can feel fearful around what they’re allowed to express or explore. And we’re all looking to survive out here in this life. We want to make sure that our work gets sponsored and we rely on sponsorship. We rely on studios, on institutions, on people with paychecks to get projects made, to get our work into people’s hearts, and that can be costly to our own integrity sometimes. And with this [film], it was like, <em>Oh, we get to explore a very, very tender arena of subjects, and we get to really do it. </em>And I’ve said this before, but when Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal, because not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a very, very caring, sensitive position of humility and care. Obviously, this is a series of subjects that require that kind of care. </p>



<p><strong>I think that care came through. And I think it’s also just important for films to reflect a snapshot of what the cultural conversation is, especially in the last five years. But much as it is about these big topics, it’s really just a character study that digs into complicated people and the ways in which they are selfish, manipulative, and not always the most moral people. There’s no clear hero or villain throughout most of the movie. Can you both talk about the importance of those moral grey areas and characters who aren’t necessarily likable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>It’s been interesting and honestly really cool listening to people who have watched the film, and sometimes more than once, saying how they felt the day they saw it, versus a week later, when you’ve had more time to marinate on it. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937773.jpeg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p>All of these characters have their own context, their own histories, their own baggage, that they’re walking around with — however conscious or unconscious. And I think in the same vein, when you’re a moviegoer, that’s happening too. You’re thinking like,<em> Oh, here’s what I’m gonna expect out of a Luca Guadagnino film, or out of a Julia Roberts performance.</em> These are the characters. And this one is the Black girl. So this is what she’s going to do in the story engine. We’re walking around with all these things. And you can watch the movie one way and get what you want out of it, or you can realize something is being subverted, both in the film and in yourself. I think it’s like this really cool, tricky, layered Rorschach Test that Luca put together, and it’s very intentional. </p>

<p>The more that I watch the movie, or the more I sit with it, I’m like<em>, Oh my God, there’s this thing that I didn’t notice</em>, even though I was fully there. I think that act of conversation is what’s really important to me. If we can, in this type of work and play, get to lead people to these conversations, that’s pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>Ayo, I keep thinking about the first time we see Maggie, and she’s looking at this African artifact in Alma’s house. To me it told me a lot about this character and her discomfort in this predominantly white space. I know you went to NYU, a predominantly white institution. What were the ways in which you related to Maggie and do you have any advice for Black women navigating those spaces? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>What’s interesting to me about Maggie is that I feel we have very different ethoses and in places I think there’s discomfort. We’ve been talking a lot about the subconscious versus the conscious. I don’t know if Maggie would describe herself as uncomfortable in that moment.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting! </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t know if she would, to be honest, and that’s its own very loaded thing. And I don’t know how much she’s aware of that, but it is operating outside of her. There’s also a scene where she hugs Julia [playing Alma] and she looks up at a statue. That statue is one of Yale’s founders. That man was a slave owner. The movie ends on the shot of money. Who is the President on the money? These sorts of things are just operating all the time underneath us, while we’re also engaged in these person-to-person interactions day-to-day where we’re maybe forgetting them or ignoring them. That’s what I have to say about the Maggie of it all. </p>



<p>As for advice, yes, I went to a PWI for college. That’s not an uncommon experience. I think finding your people, finding your safe space, whatever that looks like, and making space for connection and sanity — where you need it —  is important. I don’t know if that’s advice, but that’s just what I would say.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11937728.jpg?ssl=1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>That’s good advice. Andrew, Hank is so sure he is a good guy but proves by things he says and his actions that he is not. How did you approach that nice guy facade he puts up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, I think he believes he is. He really does believe he’s a good person. I think he feels victimized, and that’s interesting. I just play it as it lays, you play it as it is. And he’s someone that feels like he’s worked very, very hard to get to where he’s got to, that he’s come from a less privileged background, even as a white male, and that he’s had to put in extra hours, extra time, extra energy, and he thinks he’s on the receiving end of an unfair kind of witch hunt. And it’s a really fascinating place to experience, particularly as Hank in the sense of<em> oh yeah, but there’s no way that anyone else is going to see it like this. </em></p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>When Luca told me that Ayo was gonna be playing this part, that reassured me a great deal.. not only is she a great actress, but she’s someone who really considers these things in a caring, sensitive position of humility and care.</p><cite>andrew garfield</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The isolation of it is really interesting. The loneliness is really interesting. And the comprehension of that loneliness, the awareness of, <em>well, I’m fucked and there’s nowhere to go. </em>I think what’s interesting mostly is the very brief moment that he gets to have of self reckoning at the end of his journey in the film where he maybe gets a glimpse of a part of himself that he had been trying to avoid throughout the story, a part of himself that is able to behave in ways that he would rather not look at. And I think that’s in every scene, whether he knows it or not, that’s in every single time we see him, that ability, that capacity, that entitlement.</p>



<p><strong>Entitlement is a good word for Hank. The idea of generational divides is a big theme in the movie so we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions about millennials versus Gen Z. Ayo, you are technically Gen Z, but I heard you spiritually identify as a millennial, right? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I’m not technically Gen Z. I’m technically a millennial! I’m literally turning 30. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> And I’m a geriatric millennial. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> Everyone kept calling me Gen Z. And Luca I kept being like, “Stop saying you’re about to be 30. People need to think you’re Gen Z.” And they do that to me and Rachel [Sennott]. They’re like ‘these girls, who you think are young, are actually turning so old? Can you believe [these girls] are about to die at the end of this year, because they’re so old?’<em> [laughs] </em></p>

<p><strong>OK, settle these online debates once and for all. Gen Z prefers TikTok and millennials prefer Instagram. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>Neither. Burn it all. <br /><strong>AG: </strong>Neither, kill it! Burn it! </p>



<p><strong>Gen Z prefer staying home and millennials prefer going to the club. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE: </strong>In between. <br /><strong>AG:</strong> Let it be. Let everyone be what they want to be, man. I like being at home. </p>



<p><strong>Millennials value stability while Gen Z puts more of an emphasis on finding their dream job. Who are you with: Gen Z or Millennials?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>We need to have a foot in both worlds. <br /><strong>AE:</strong> General strike! <br /><strong>AG:</strong> We gotta survive.<br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! <br /><strong>AG: </strong>But we also have our souls. <br /><strong>AE: </strong>General strike! </p>

<p>Get whisked away from mundane days and adult responsibilities, even if just for a moment, with the upcoming <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gap x Sandy Liang collaboration</a>. </p>



<p>Announced via an <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPjJRG-DUkg/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">animated short film</a> created by Annie Choi, Liang’s childhood in New York is reimagined through a nostalgic lens. We see her sketching before her own “dream closet” comes to life with new clothes that empower her before she captures a shooting star. The aesthetic and playfulness perfectly captures Liang’s signature whimsical designs. </p>



<p>“‘Sandy’s Dream Closet’ illustrates how wearing Gap made me feel growing up as I imagined being an adult one day and who I could be,” Liang said in a press release. “I wanted to take the pieces that meant something to me as a kid and reimagine them through my lens today — celebrating girlhood in all its forms, while honoring the iconic styles that make Gap so timeless.”</p>



<p>And with Gap’s portfolio of collaborations, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-beis-luggage-collaboration-2025"">with Béis</a> (and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-studio-summer-new-arrivals"">GapStudio</a>’s recent <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/new/gapstudio?cid=3045197&amp;mlink=5058,1,HP_MERCH_BANNER_GAPSTUDIO_LAUNCH_W_ShopCollection"">partnership with Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and Apple Martin), we know that this on-point designer collab will be another sought-after and successful one.</p>







<p>Known for her feminine aesthetic via pastels, ruffles, and bows, Liang is bringing her style to Gap via a trench coat with an oversized bow, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ballet-sneaker-shoe-trend"">Mary Jane ballet flat</a>-printed sweater, and a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=853294002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">denim baseball cap with “star”</a> written in Gap’s logo font. You’ll also find Gap essentials, like hoodies and low-rise jeans with the Liang treatment (AKA bow stitching, vegan fur, and the designer’s first name). And don’t forget about the children (not just your inner child) — there will be <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/gapx/gap-sandy-liang?cid=3050683&amp;mlink=3044135,1,HP_GAPX_BANNER_Sandy_C_ExploreGapX#department=165"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">online-exclusive baby and toddler styles</a>, like a onesie, sweatsuit, and spotted fur jacket (which matches the womenswear style lower down). </p>



<p>“Sandy Liang has cultivated both an engaged community and an iconic design perspective, which has allowed her to reimagine our heritage pieces into something entirely new, yet familiar,” said President and CEO of Gap, Mark Breitbard, in the release.</p>







<p>The apparel collection will range between a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864523002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">$15 clear tote bag</a> to a <a href=""https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=853540002&amp;vid=1&amp;pcid=3050683&amp;cid=3050683#pdp-page-content"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">$268 reversible leather-sherpa jacket</a>, available in select stores and online on <strong>October 10 and 9 a.m. EST</strong>.

<p>I’ve never been much of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11876654/best-festivals-to-attend-2025"">festival girlie</a>. It’s not because I don’t love live music (I do); Between big crowds (I’m barely 5’2 and main stage GA is not the most short-girl-friendly situation), prolonged time in the sun, and expensive food and drinks (in this economy?!), I always resolved to a life of catching the action on social media from the safety of my couch. However, when <a href=""https://www.t-mobile.com/"">T-Mobile</a> invited me to experience Austin City Limits the magenta way, I jumped at the chance. It felt like kismet: I’ve been a T-Mobile girlie for years, and as a newly-minted Texan (I moved to Dallas during the summer), what could be more fun that getting to channel my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tecovas-cowboy-boots-new-arrivals"">inner cowgirl</a> at the state’s biggest music festival?</p>



<p>Ahead, join me as I document three days of discovering my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/festival-fashion-trends-2025"">festival style</a>, and how to try the look out for yourself.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day One: Floral Frontier</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937352.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The first thing I kept in mind when packing for ACL was that it was going to be hot. As in, 90-degrees-in-direct-sunlight hot. In general, I love to “shop” my closet — I’m a proud outfit repeater — and found an old Reformation dress I bought at a sample sale ages ago but never worn. (<a href=""https://www.thereformation.com/products/everett-mini-linen-dress/1318183TRU.html"">Here</a>‘s a similar one in linen.) Paired with my favorite <a href=""https://www.tecovas.com/products/the-annie?color=fawn-suede"">Tecovas cowboy boots</a> (also from my closet, a gift from when I moved to Dallas), I decided to lean into the yee-haw vibes with a chocolate bandana I got at <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/bridgette-bandana-hair-scarf/?color=025"">Free People</a>. And with a backdrop of side-stage access (an extra-special perk that fans could also experience via gumball machine at <a href=""https://www.t-mobile.com/benefits"">T-Mobile’s Club Magenta</a>). It was truly a next-level festival experience.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Two: Lace &amp; Leather</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937516.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>For day two, I decided to go for an off-duty cowgirl look featuring a romantic <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/how-sweet-is-it-cami/?color=011"">lace tank</a> and faux suede <a href=""https://www.freepeople.com/shop/nova-fringe-shorts/?color=020"">fringe micro shorts</a>, both from Free People. (This is not an #ad, I just genuinely love the brand!) I recently found the cutest cowboy hat ever at Anthropologie — it works as a neutral but has teeny-tiny sequins sewn throughout for a hint of sparkle. It was a total compliment magnet, and also helped keep me cool during a day of truly incredible sets from the T-Mobile stage. (Also keeping me cool: The AC, fans, and drink stations at Club Magenta — in the club, we’re all fam!) </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Day Three: Midnight Rodeo</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937351.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>My last festival outfit was a bit of a departure from my usual jeans-and-a-tee everyday style, but when at ACL right? This look was vaguely inspired by <a href=""https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/all-about-lainey-wilsons-signature-outfits-at-the-2023-cma-awards/"">Lainey Wilson’s 2023 CMA outfit</a>, a black Carolina Herrera strapless jumpsuit with dramatic bell-bottom flares. I found (or rather, they found me via Instagram ad) these <a href=""https://amzn.to/4h1riCp"">lace wide-leg pants</a> on Amazon, which ended up being a perfect choice since they were airy and breathable. I styled it with a DKNY corset top in black satin — another old closet find, but Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has a <a href=""https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/lace-and-satin-balconette-corset-52554319"">similar style</a> I love. I wore the same <a href=""https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/sparkle-cowboy-rancher-hat?color=024&amp;quantity=1&amp;size=0000&amp;type=STANDARD"">Anthropologie cowboy hat</a> from the previous day, plus a black silk bandana tied around my wrist to tie (heh) everything together. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>All in all, I left my first Austin City Limits feeling more confident in incorporating Western and Americana elements in my outfits, and can’t wait to continue experimenting with my personal style in my new city. And as much as I enjoy shopping for an upcoming trip/date/event, I also loved repurposing what I already had, and figuring out new ways to style existing pieces in my closet. Same time next year?</p>

Lola Tung has been serving immaculate press looks for <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-to-watch-after-summer-i-turned-pretty"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> Season 3</em>, and with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">the movie</a> on the way, we can expect more Y2K-inspired dreamy updos in the future. The star landed her breakout role in <em>TSITP </em>when she was just 18. She has since gone on to make her Broadway debut in Hadestown and has two other films, <em><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30691214/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Forbidden Fruits</a></em> and <em>The Young People</em>, yet to be released.<br /><br />There's plenty of beauty inspiration to take from Tung's gorgeous looks, so if you need something to take to the hairdresser or an idea of what hair accessories to try next, look no further. From a sleek blowout at the Paris finale celebration to her 60s-inspired pony at Paris Fashion Week, here's a look at all of <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7535217274479824159?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lola Tung's</a> best hairstyles over the years. <figure><img height=""2999"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935191.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2999&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2000:2999"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><h2>Lola Tung's sleek blowout at <em>TSITP</em>'s Paris celebration<br /></h2><br />For <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty's</em> Season 3 finale celebration in Paris, the actor opted for a middle part with a sleek blowout.

While she was game to chop her hair off for the show, due to scenes being shot out of order, it was faked slightly with a wig. So, if you want to sport a bob but don't want to commit, a wig could be an option for you.

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla perfume trend</a> isn’t going anywhere soon — if anything, perfume’s favorite gourmand has only gotten more ubiquitous these days. And when it comes to vanilla scents, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/"">Noyz</a> is down bad. The Los Angeles-based perfume label has multiple interpretations of the popular note, including editor-favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/noyz-detour-vanilla-perfume-review"">Detour</a>, which debuted earlier this year.</p>



<p>But we’re here to talk about the brand’s latest launch, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>. The vanilla-forward scent combines the warm, cozy appeal of gourmands with the intoxicating vibe of another major fragrance trend: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-skin-scents"">Skin scents</a>.</p>



<p>Notes of vanilla bean, ambroxan, and cedarwood blend with invigorating pink pepper, bergamot, and lily to create a scent that’s complex, addictive, and perfect for fall. Combining vanilla with woody notes isn’t unheard of (Case in point: Another editor-beloved scent, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">7 Virtues’ Vanilla Woods</a>.) But as the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a> is all about tapping into the sensual alchemy of two people connecting — per the brand, it’s rumored to smell a bit different on everyone, <em>à la </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-glossier-you-perfume-new-formula"">Glossier You</a>.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Noyz Only Human 50ML</a>, $85 </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937307.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>I personally think that <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">Only Human</a>‘s magic lies in its tightrope-like balance of sweet vanilla, spicy pink pepper, citrusy bergamot, and floral waterlily. At first spritz, the vanilla definitely comes through. But throughout the day, it dries down, leaving room for the floral and ambrox notes to emerge. As with all Noyz creations, you can choose (or indulge in all) from a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human"">50mL full size</a>, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/only-human?variant=50542921122075"">15mL travel spray</a>, and twist-up <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/EIINKLDH/products/the-solid-fragrance-only-human"">solid fragrance balm</a>. To say that I’ve found my favorite fall fragrance isn’t just fun alliteration — it’s a fact, thanks to Noyz.</p>
