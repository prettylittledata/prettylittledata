<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-wedding-guest-dresses-summer"">""Wedding season”</a> is often associated with summer, but the most popular months to say “I do” <a href=""https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings"">actually fall later in the year. </a>Maybe it’s the foliage or the welcome relief from the heat, but fall weddings are definitely a <em>thing</em>. While the colorful leaves make for stunning wedding photos, finding fall wedding guest dresses can be tricky. The goal: something elevated, seasonally appropriate, and comfortable enough to carry you through hours of celebrating (and dancing).<br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up 24 statement-making fall wedding guest dresses that work for dipping temperatures (think: maxi lengths, long sleeves, and rich fabrics) and every kind of venue (think: luxe halls, breweries, or lakeside). Expect autumnal florals, sweet puff sleeves, and slinky satin picks. Whether you need an elegant gown for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-tie-wedding-guest-dress"">black-tie affair</a> or are craving a trendy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/arrange-asos-brand-plus-size-review"">plus-size dress</a> for a casual ceremony, your perfect look is just a click away.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve never been a big fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-mask-conditioner-trend"">hair masks</a>. For starters, I don’t have the patience to wait for a mask to sit for anywhere from five to 15 minutes. But mostly, I’ve never found one that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fable-and-mane-shine-hair-mask-review"">hydrates my hair</a> without weighing it down. I have extremely thick, long hair that is prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-conditioners-for-frizzy-hair"">frizz</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10655215/dyson-supersonic-flyaway-attachment-review"">flyaways</a>, and I rely on hair oil and dry oil mists to help add shine and moisture. But when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/igk-mistress-hydrating-hair-balm-review"">IGK</a> — one of my most <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/smoky-brunette-hair-color-trend"">tried-and-true hair brands</a> —announced a limited-edition version of its <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-dry-hair-mask?pr_prod_strat=jac&amp;pr_rec_id=d095e4954&amp;pr_rec_pid=7125454651436&amp;pr_ref_pid=7903988809772&amp;pr_seq=uniform"">Antisocial Dry Hair Mask</a>, I was immediately intrigued.</p>



<p>A <em>dry</em> hair mask? Sounds like a beauty juxtaposition to me — but I’ll admit that the concept was genius: Weightless, shine-boosting hydration that works overnight? Sign me up.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/antisocial-midnight-silk-mask-P517733"">Antisocial Midnight Silk Dry Hair Mask</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11934808.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Taking inspiration from another overnight beauty sleep MVP — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silk-pillowcase-hair-skin-benefits"">silk pillowcases</a> — <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-midnight-silk-time-release-bond-building-dry-mask"">IGK’s Midnight Silk</a> version of Antisocial features extra-special packaging and a light, subtly sweet scent. Per the instructions, I tried it on clean, dry hair and brushed it throughout before securing in a loose braid – my preferred bedtime hairstyle. The next morning, I woke up with loose waves and touchably soft, smooth hair. I still had some rogue flyaways at the top — nothing I couldn’t fix with a little hairspray — and my hair looked visibly shinier and my highlights brighter, somehow. And best of all, I loved not having to rinse anything out — just spray, brush, and wake up to silky, shiny hair.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Ingredients like vegan silk protein (another nod to the name), plus a bond-building peptide complex mean that this stuff doesn’t just hydrate on a surface level to temporarily tame frizz; with continued use (including mid-day refreshes or even on second-day hair), I actually could see and feel a difference in my hair health. </p>



<p>Much like skincare, the best hair care is the kind you’ll actually use regularly — and now that I no longer have to deal with the inconvenience and heaviness of traditional hair masks, taking care of my length has never been easier. (Also, I finally get the hype surrounding Antisocial — she’s sold out eight times ever since launching. NBD!) At $38, it’s a luxury product, but the rare one that is worth every penny, in my opinion. (Also, I have a <em>lot</em> of hair, and I’m still on my first one after nearly a month of use.) Antisocial may be her name, but this is one beauty product I’m happily sharing with anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>This past summer, I was presented with an amazing opportunity to tour New York’s Garment District, and what I saw as a Black creative wasn’t just beautiful or innovative — it was affirming. I witnessed other Black creatives who are not only at the forefront of technological advancement, but using that to completely reshape the fashion landscape. </p>



<p>Our first stop was the New York Embroidery Studio — a nondescript building from the outside, but on the inside, houses one of the most ​​​​​advanced ​​​​​tools ​​​​​in ​​​​​fashion ​​​​​tech ​​​​​right ​​​​​now: the ​​​​​Stratasys ​​​​​J850, ​​​​​a ​​​​​​printer ​​​​​that ​​​​​uses ​​​​​lenticular ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​or ​​​​​a ​​​​​type ​​​​​of ​​​​​3D ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​to ​​​​​apply ​​​​​holographic, ​​​​​raised, ​​​​​or ​​​​​shifting ​​​​​visuals ​​​​​directly ​​​​​onto ​​​​​fabric (think ​​​​​layers, ​​​​​gradient, ​​​​​photo ​​​​​realism, ​​​​​or ​​​​​textures ​​​​​that ​​​​​appear ​​​​​to ​​​​​move ​​​​​when ​​​​​you ​​​​​do). This is ​​​​​how ​​​​​sketches ​​​​​become ​​​​​sculpture, ​​​​​and ​​​​​fabric ​​​​​becomes ​​​​​an ​​​​​engaging ​​​​​and ​​​​​fun interactive ​​​​​experience.</p>



<p>This ​​​​​tour, which was led by Lenese Griffin, a seasoned apparel production manager with a wealth of experience in product development, opened my eyes to the massive, complicated world of fashion. The industry is so much more than aesthetics and seasonal trends — it’s an intricate system that’s evolving into something ​​​​​more ​​​​​intelligent, inclusive, ​​​​​immersive, ​​​​​and ​​​​​intentional. ​​​​​And we’re at the intersection ​​​​​between ​​​​​high ​​​​​design ​​​​​and ​​​​​high ​​​​​tech, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Black ​​​​​designers ​​​​​like ​​​​​LaQuan ​​​​​Smith, ​​​​​Anifa ​​​​​Mvuemba, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Madison ​​​​​Maxey ​​​​​are ​​​​​leading ​​​​​some ​​​​​of ​​​​​the ​​​​​boldest ​​​​​work ​​​​​in ​​​​​that ​​​​​space. ​​​​​</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>LaQuan Smith</h2>



<p><a href=""https://laquansmith.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LaQuan ​Smith</a>’s ​spring/summer 2025 ​show ​featured ​a ​sleepwear ​capsule “Lucid Dream,” ​co-created ​with ​Samsung, that drew design inspiration from the sleekness of the ​Galaxy ​Ring. ​The ​sleepwear ​arrived ​in ​vivid ​chartreuse ​silk ​organza and it served as a contrast against other designs, like ​trench ​coats ​made ​of ​a ​new ​material ​Smith ​calls ​“transparent ​horse,” ​made ​by ​his ​Italian ​mills. He described the look as perfect for when “a ​woman, ​on ​a ​rainy ​night, ​goes ​to ​her ​man’s ​house ​to ​have ​makeup ​sex.” It’s sensual luxury with a futuristic edge. </p>



<p>The New York-based designer used “AI Atelier” on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, where AI tools like sketch-to-image helped with the design process, and “Now Brief,” which supported things like organizing fabrics, scheduling fittings, and making communication with his team more efficient. </p>



<h2>Anifa Mvuemba </h2>



<p>Congolese born and DMV-based Anifa Mvuemba is the designer behind <a href=""https://hanifa.co/?srsltid=AfmBOopY2D4vaIZ-GhEgvdx1nxq3Sa7oHvPrTZDNcdsW6bG5g0pqANK_"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hanifa</a>, a brand that draws on her cultural background, resulting in bold silhouettes and inclusive sizing. In May 2020, she presented Pink Label Congo, a collection that honored her Congolese roots while raising awareness about issues like the exploitation that’s tied to coltan mining, as a digital runway show using invisible 3D avatars on Instagram Live. It was immediately celebrated for its innovation and cultural commentary, proving that technology can be used to amplify a message and unite the community instead of diluting it. </p>



<p>Since then, Hanifa has continued to evolve, balancing innovation with intentional craft. Mvuemba uses digital tools, like CLO, Procreate, and Blender in her design process, reducing waste while refining her vision of how clothes should move on the body. Her philosophy is clear: Fashion should be inclusive, technologically forward, and deeply connected to heritage. </p>



<h2>Madison Maxey </h2>



<p>Imagine buying a jacket that not only keeps you warm, but also senses how often you wear it, keeps track of how many times it’s been washed, and even helps a brand understand how its product moves through your life. That’s what <a href=""https://www.loomia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loomia</a> is doing right now. The tech — Loomia Electronic Layer (LEL) — is a flexible circuit sheet that bends, sketches, and survives in fabrics while carrying functions such as heating, lighting, or pressure detection. And yes, the layer holds up when stretched or handled; its electrical performance stays stable, unlike older “smart fabrics.” </p>



<p>And the woman behind Loomia is: Madison Maxey, who started it out of a desire to make electronics disappear into clothing, so the fabric does the work without feeling like gear. Before Loomia, she experimented with conductive inks, computational design, and patterning electronics with designers and engineers. LEL is now mostly used in medical, outdoor, automotive, and wellness fields, proving that wearable tech can be something that’s used, lived in, and trusted every day, by everyone. Case in point: A recent collaboration with L.L. Bean, where LEL was sewn or attached inside of outdoor gear to report wear behavior: temperature, wash, count, and usage patterns. The versatility of the technology shows how seamlessly it can be folded into existing brand identities and products. Loomia isn’t just for Loomia —  it’s scalable and transferable, and that’s its real strength.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>These designers are writing the next chapter of what fashion looks like. ​​​​​They’re ​​​​​building ​​​​​new ​​​​​systems, ​​​​​new ​​​​​fabrics, ​​​​​new ​​​​​languages, and ​​​​​doing ​​​​​it ​​​​​on ​​​​​their ​​​​​terms. We ​​​​’re ​​​​​entering ​​​​​a ​​​​​new ​​​​​era ​​​​​of ​​​​​fashion, ​​​​​and it ​​​​​values ​​​​​identity, ​​​​​innovation, ​​​​​and ​​​​​equality that leaves an impact — and ​​​​​I ​​​​​can’t ​​​​​wait ​​​​​to ​​​​​see ​​​​​what’s ​​​​​next.</p>

<p>When I received my flights and itinerary for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendship-milestone-anniversary-trip"">besties’ trip</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-nomad-full-time-traveler-chiang-mai-thailand-money-diary"">Thailand</a>, I immediately called my other half to go over the plan. As <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/232968/long-distance-friendship-tips"">long-distance BFFs</a>, we wanted to make every moment together count. On the phone, we revised the schedule, slotting in activities during our six-hour layover at Changi Airport in Singapore and any free days we had in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FHotel-Search%3Fdestination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26regionId%3D6035013%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26flexibility%3D0_DAY%26d1%3D2025-10-08%26startDate%3D2025-10-08%26d2%3D2025-10-09%26endDate%3D2025-10-09%26adults%3D2%26rooms%3D1%26pwaDialog%3Dfee-inclusive-pricing-sheet"">Koh Samui</a>, an island on the southeastern coastline of the Gulf of Thailand that Expedia recently named “Best for Affordable Luxury” on its <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/see/islandhotlist"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2025 Island Hot List</a>. It was the first time either of us was headed to Asia, and we wanted to see as much as we could and do as much as possible. We had five days — 120 hours — and we were determined not to waste a single minute.</p>



<p>But as the first several hours of our adventure together failed to go according to plan, I began to learn an important lesson about time: that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10332829/why-does-time-feel-weird-covid-pandemic"">idea of time</a> as something we can structure and control is an illusion, mostly because time, itself, doesn’t actually exist in the way I thought it did.</p>



<p><strong>Day 1 — We Can’t Control Time</strong></p>



<p>Twenty-four hours into our travels, when we made it from Orlando, to San Francisco, to Changi Airport — where we had scheduled a free tour of the city, waterfall gazing at the Rain Vortex, a photoshoot at the Sunflower Garden, a playful walk along Canopy Park, and, of course, a meal at the Michelin-starred Kam’s Roast — we ended up adjusting our overambitious schedule by finding a comfortable place to rest before grabbing a quick bite. What felt like an hour somehow turned into five, and we ultimately jetted to our Bangkok Airways flight to Koh Samui without crossing off a single item from the list we’d meticulously built.</p>



<p>About an hour and a half later, when we arrived at our final destination, we were still spooked by the mysterious speed of time. But we laughed it off and were determined to return to scheduled programming. It was morningtime in Koh Samui, and we were ready to dip into the pale jade waters of Chaweng Beach and take photos in flowy dresses at the jungle-themed Songbird Lounge at our resort, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FKoh-Samui-Hotels-Anantara-Lawana-Koh-Samui-Resort.h3131654.Hotel-Information%3Fchkin%3D2025-10-08%26chkout%3D2025-10-09%26x_pwa%3D1%26rfrr%3DHSR%26pwa_ts%3D1758721984916%26referrerUrl%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwZWRpYS5jb20vSG90ZWwtU2VhcmNo%26useRewards%3Dtrue%26rm1%3Da2%26regionId%3D6035013%26destination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26destType%3DMARKET%26selected%3D3131654%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26sort%3DRECOMMENDED%26top_dp%3D268%26top_cur%3DUSD%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB%26semcid%3DUS.UB.GOOGLE.PT-c-EN.HOTEL%26semdtl%3Da115095931062.b1128773544346.g1kwd-297287725106.e1c.m1Cj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB.r155ea443aba8fb20a6b16868a6f0ab3ce1aca4e3140cc92f6afa62889c1fbd11b.c1.j19011784.k1.d1558748078076.h1p.i1.l1.n1.o1.p1.q1.s1anantara%2520lawana%2520koh%2520samui%2520resort.t1.x1.f1.u1.v1.w1%26userIntent%3D%26selectedRoomType%3D448130%26selectedRatePlan%3D382653233%26searchId%3D8e57e978-cc7a-4345-89b8-cd5f1b021a07"">Anantara Lawana Koh Samui</a>, where scenes from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>White Lotus</em></a> Season 3 were filmed. Except my friend’s checked luggage didn’t make it with us. Apparently, her suitcase was stuck somewhere in Singapore and we were told it would be located and delivered to our resort by the end of the day. But by then, we’d have lost the sunlight for the beach and the photos. </p>



<p>Once again, our first few hours in Asia — the precious, never-to-return time — would be “wasted,” or so we thought. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value.

<p>Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value. So, like money, I spent my time “wisely:” Every hour had a purpose and every day took me closer to a goal. At the time of my besties’ trip, I had already been feeling like I had mispent my time. That summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solo-midlife-birthday-trip-mexico"">I turned 35 years old</a>, and I realized my life was not where I had thought it would be. Sure, I had crossed most items off of my adulthood to-do list, but I had never been able to scratch off motherhood, and it started to feel like time for this milestone was running out. And unlike cash, there was no way I’d get that currency back. On this trip, I was beginning to feel that anxiety again, the feeling that days spent off schedule were days missed and misused. </p>



<p>When we finally arrived at our resort, anxious and exhausted, my thoughts about time began to shift. In Thailand, time doesn’t necessarily move according to the clock. Things begin when they’re meant to. The focus is more on readiness and less on the actual minute hand. This idea showed up from the moment we stepped into our resort. The concierge staff welcomed us with a smile, walked us over to a large ceremonial gong, and invited us to strike it three times. It was a symbolic way of marking our arrival and the beginning of our stay. But it also made something click: whatever time we’d “lost” stressing about luggage or sleeping through layovers didn’t matter. That time had passed, and in that sense, it no longer existed. And now we had time to do what our bodies actually needed us to: freshen up, relax on the king-sized bed in our villa, and beat jet lag so we could actually enjoy the days ahead of us.</p>



<p><strong>Day 2 — We All Experience Time Differently</strong></p>



<p>On the second day, once my friend finally had her suitcase of essentials, we jumped back into our itinerary, which was still patiently waiting for us. It didn’t matter which day we did what, just that we were doing it. Over breakfast at Ocean Kiss, the resort’s breezy beachfront buffet restaurant, we had fresh watermelon juice, Thai iced coffee, tropical fruit, noodles, pastries, and made-to-order omelets. Afterwards, we wandered the resort for some light cardio, passing koi ponds, checking out the tree house restaurant, <a href=""https://www.treetopsrestaurantsamui.com/"">Tree Tops,</a> we’d booked for later in the week, and stumbling into a rooftop boxing gym with the most stunning island views. Back at our villa, we cooled off in our private pool, enjoying deep catch-ups and hilarious photoshoots. That evening, we also watched a traditional Thai light show on the beach. The performer, barefoot and dressed in a bright red and gold costume, danced ram Thai, a slow movement that’s hundreds of years old and was originally performed in royal courts and religious ceremonies.</p>



<p>That night, I noticed my phone said the year was 2568. The month and day were correct, but the year was 543 years ahead. I was confused, so, naturally, I looked into it. I learned that Thailand uses the Buddhist calendar, which is five centuries ahead of the Gregorian calendar most of the world uses. What we call 2025 is 2568 in Thailand. That’s because their year zero is tied to the death of the Buddha rather than the birth of Christ. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Time isn’t fixed. It’s cultural and, thus, made up.

<p>While I joked to my family back home that I was both 12 hours ahead of them and hundreds of years in the future, it also reminded me that time isn’t fixed. It’s cultural and, thus, made up. We mark it based on what we value, whether that’s religious figures, harvest seasons, fiscal years, school schedules, or birthdays. But it’s still just a framework. The calendar we use, the milestones we aim for, and the pace we’re told to keep aren’t universal. It’s just one way to move through life, meaning there must also be other ways to do so. </p>



<p><strong>Day 3 — Time Is Cyclical, Not Linear, So It Can’t Run Out</strong></p>



<p>The next morning, we went on a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fnull.a1460577.detalles-actividades%3Frid%3D6307515%26location%3DMuelle%2520Haad%2520Rin%26swp%3Doff%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08"">“Best of Samui” city tour</a> with a local guide who drove us to several cultural and spiritual sites around the island. Our first stop was Wat Plai Laem, a colorful, modern temple that blends Thai, Chinese, and Hindu iconography. We saw a striking statue of Guanyin, the 18-armed goddess of compassion; a Laughing Buddha representing abundance and joy; and intricate depictions of Hindu deities like Ganesha, the remover of obstacles.</p>



<p>After that, we headed to Wat Phra Yai, better known as the Big Buddha Temple. We climbed 73 steps to reach the massive seated Buddha, which stands about 40 feet tall and overlooks the island from a raised platform. After paying our respects, praying, and taking in the gold-plated statue surrounded by lotus blossoms and prayer bells, our guide struck up a conversation about the Thai calendar, noting that it was the year 2568 and that, for many Thai people, especially practicing Buddhists, time is seen as cyclical instead of linear. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935020.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>He explained that in Western culture, time is often thought of as a straight line: you’re born, you grow up, you hit certain milestones, and eventually you die. It’s forward-moving and goal-oriented. But in Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress. Basically, you don’t have to accomplish everything in one lifetime, so there’s no sense of being “too late” or “running out of time.” There’s just where you are now and where you’re headed, eventually. As two women in our mid-30s who had been feeling the pressure of time, this concept felt both comforting and freeing.</p>



<p>Next, we visited Hin Ta and Hin Yai Rocks, famous for looking like male and female genitalia (yes, really). It was a quick stop and a very popular photo op, but our guide told us that the rocks had taken on these shapes naturally and slowly by wind and sea erosion over thousands of years. It was another reminder that time, when left alone, unrushed, and without a deadline, creates its own beautiful and worthy story. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“In Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress. Basically, you don’t have to accomplish everything in one lifetime, so there’s no sense of being ‘too late’ or ‘running out of time.'”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Finally, our last stop was Wat Khunaram, where the body of a mummified monk named Loung Pordaeng is displayed in the same seated meditation position he died in decades ago. His body has barely decayed, and his hair and teeth are still intact. For Buddhists, death isn’t an endpoint. It’s just another phase. The emphasis is on how you live rather than on how long you lived. According to our guide, the monk had told his followers that if his body remained preserved, it would be a sign that he had reached enlightenment, the Buddhist state of Nirvana, where suffering ends and the cycle of rebirth breaks, leaving behind only clarity, compassion, and spiritual liberation. I appreciated seeing death presented as something still unfolding rather than an end.</p>



<p><strong>Day 4 — I Am Exactly Where I Need To Be at This Time in My Life</strong></p>



<p>The next day, we learned that the full-day snorkeling trip we had planned for Koh Tao and Koh Nangyuan had been canceled due to an incoming storm. Normally, this would’ve felt like a wasted day. But by then, after three days in Thailand both learning and witnessing how differently time is experienced, I didn’t panic. Instead, my friend and I had a long breakfast and then walked down to Chaweng Beach. </p>



<p>She hiked along the rocks, and I stayed behind to meditate in the still waters. Around me, tourists enjoyed each other’s company: a British family of three played “Marco Polo” and a large group of Arab relatives laughed during what seemed like a family reunion. At one point, I noticed a little girl drifting too far into the water and waded in to carry her back to her father. He thanked me for being at the “right place at the right time.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There was that word again. For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then. If something doesn’t happen when I thought it would — whether it’s a trip, a relationship, or a phase of life — it’s not that time is running out but that it just wasn’t time yet. </p>



<p><strong>Day 5 — Time Is Meant to Be Experienced, Not Rushed Through</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935022.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our last day, my friend and I participated in <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/thai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details?location=Koh+Samui%2C+Surat+Thani+Province%2C+Thailand&amp;startDate=2025-09-24&amp;endDate=2025-10-08&amp;rid=6035013&amp;AID=11552045&amp;PID=100062354&amp;SID=30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fthai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details%3Flocation%3DKoh%2520Samui%2C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%2C%2520Thailand%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08%26rid%3D6035013&amp;affcid=network.cj.100062354&amp;cjevent=78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c&amp;affdtl=CJ.78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c.11552045.30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;button_referral_source=other"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chef Lat’s Island Organic Farm Thai Cooking Class</a>, the first farm-to-table cooking class on Koh Samui. The four-hour experience started with a guided tour of Chef Lat’s lush organic micro‑farm, where she cultivates more than 70 varieties of Thai herbs, vegetables, and fruits, including galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, and moringa. With freshly picked produce in hand, we moved to our stations in the open‑air Thai cookery kitchen and got to work. We started with a refreshing butterfly pea flower herbal drink, followed by four classic Thai dishes: Pad Thai Prawn, Tom Yum Prawn, Penang Chicken, and Som Tum (papaya salad).</p>



<p>Even in the comically high-pressure kitchen, there was another lesson about time. As Chef Lat reminded us, we wouldn’t rush the layering of flavors in the curry or speed up the pounding of herbs in the mortar and pestle. Thai cooking, like much of Thai life, demands time and presence. It’s not about finishing quickly but rather about being deliberate, staying focused, and honoring each step in the process. Just like in life, slowness isn’t inefficiency. It’s care, presence, and intention. It’s less about squeezing as much as we can into an hour and more about actually being in the hour.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“If time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>With that, my bestie and I returned to our resort for a 60-minute full-body massage followed by a 30-minute Indian head massage. We locked our phones in a safe, leaving the 24-hour clock behind with them. A gong was struck when we began and again when we were finished. But for the time in between — when our therapists used warm coconut oil to smooth out the tension in our shoulders, backs, and scalps — we were fully present.</p>



<p>I grew up believing time was linear, fixed, and constantly slipping away. It was something I had to beat, never fall behind from, or catch up to. But Thailand reminded me that time is a human invention. It’s experienced differently across cultures and even across seasons of life. But if time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out. With that, maybe I haven’t missed anything. Maybe I’m not behind at all. Maybe, like everything else on this trip, I can trust that I will arrive exactly when I’m meant to.</p>

<p>When the person <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-coach-single-women-find-love-relationship"">I’d been dating</a> for a few months told me that he was getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, effectively <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/situationships-dating-fulfilling-2"">ending our situationship</a>, I went a bit light-headed. It did not help that it was at my favorite bar on a Saturday night, I hadn’t had much sleep and we’d had six double G&amp;Ts between us. Passersby stubbed their cigarettes out in the ashtray on our table as he emphasized how gutted he was because I had been “so much fun<em>“</em>. He told me I was so cool, so pretty, so smart, so funny. “You’re sexy,” he added for good measure, “I really rate you.” To my brain, the subtext was obnoxiously clear: <em>I like fucking you</em> <em>but I don’t like YOU</em>. If the ground had split in two and swallowed me up in that exact moment, I would’ve been thankful. </p>



<p>After I broke up with my boyfriend of four and a half years, I convinced myself that nothing could rival that discomfort, especially not something that by its very nature was intended to be fleeting. Somehow, this pain eclipsed it. With the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10772596/sad-girl-autumn-adele-taylor-swift-mitski"">relationship breakup</a>, I felt an ache for almost a year. It would flare occasionally. This pain was red-hot and restless. I tried my best to put it aside but it was constantly on my mind, even days later. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The spontaneous, undefined nature of a situationship can mean that you go quickly from speaking to each other every day to being unfollowed, ghosted or blocked without another word.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>When I went out onto the balcony of my new apartment, I found myself glaring at the limp cheese plant he’d bought me and debating whether to toss it onto the driveway below. It all came to a head a week later, when my flatmate chirpily relayed the details of her own similar situationship and to my surprise (and embarrassment) I burst into tears – howling, hyperventilating, headache-inducing tears. I was mortified. I knew I didn’t love this person, even care for them the way I’d cared for my ex, so how could this hurt so much? The next day I relayed my confusion to my best friend, who nodded understandingly and said: “I’ve seen a TikTok about this.”</p>



<p>In the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@robbiesmoonmusic/video/7155899687747489070?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;item_id=7155899687747489070&amp;web_id=7158040017917560326"">TikTok in question</a>, a woman asks the camera if anyone can explain why the breakdown of her three-month situationship hurt more than getting out of her five-year relationship. It was a question that seemed to come up time and time again, in comment sections, Twitter threads and conversations among friends. I was reassured to know it wasn’t quite the phenomenon I first thought it was but, like many others, I was desperate to know the answer.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/oloni/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oloni, sex and relationships expert</a> and author of <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/oloni-the-big-o-talking-about-masturbation"">The Big O</a>, </em>explains that the reason why a situationship breakup can hurt more than a relationship breakup is because usually, one person doesn’t see it coming. “With situationships, it’s fun, it’s full of fireworks – you never really know what’s gonna come from it,” she says. “You never know if it’s gonna turn into a relationship or if it’s just something that’s for the now. With relationships, you kind of know where it’s heading.” The unpredictability is part of the situationship appeal. Oloni explains that with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/getting-comfortable-in-relationship"">long-term relationship</a>, typically there is an awareness, even if it’s subconscious, when it’s coming to an end. There could be a discussion (or several) before the breakup actually happens. You might even get back together several times before you definitively call it quits. “Because you have that preparation, it doesn’t hurt as much… It’s a bit more of a slower burn.” </p>



<p>The spontaneous, undefined nature of a situationship can mean that you go quickly from speaking to each other every day to being unfollowed, ghosted or blocked without another word. Spotify Blend playlist removed; iMessage thread deleted. There’s a natural desire to know exactly why they didn’t choose you, what you did wrong and what you could’ve done better. Simultaneously, there is a belief that you aren’t within your rights to ask because that person was never officially yours. “I feel like we’re in this culture, if I can’t call you my boyfriend or girlfriend, you don’t really have a right to question my feelings or question my authenticity or question where I [saw] this relationship going,” says Oloni. </p>



<p>After he broke the news, the person I was in a situationship with asked tentatively if I had any questions but I, worried about appearing too bothered (pedantic, crazy even), especially in a public setting, said no. In reality I had several. He eventually admitted that he had been seeing his ex-girlfriend the whole time he was seeing me. Was I simply a placeholder until she was ready to take him back? Did he ever actually like me? Without warning and without clarification, the dissolution of the situationship fed into my insecurities. Even though he insisted that it was nothing to do with me, I still had a lurking feeling that my actions had caused this. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>For people who lack a secure attachment style, a situationship breakup can feel especially painful because it confirms a fear that is developed during early childhood: that someone they care about might unexpectedly one day abandon them, or cannot be depended on.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>There are ways to try and mitigate this kind of spiralling, which is all too common when it feels like any semblance of control has been yanked from our hands. “I suggest creating a pie chart. What are all the reasons why it hasn’t worked out?” says clinical psychologist <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/counselling/lola-olukotun-london-eng/926883"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr Omolola Olukotun</a>. “People probably put 80% of themselves in there, [the rest] might be because something hasn’t worked out for some other reason. Then we would say take yourself out and actually, by taking themselves out, they can think of more reasons why it might have ended.”</p>



<p>Dr Olukotun also explains that for people who lack a secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-anxious-avoidant-attachment-style-switch"">attachment style</a>, a situationship breakup can feel especially painful because it confirms a fear that is developed during early childhood: that someone they care about might unexpectedly one day abandon them, or cannot be depended on. Long-term relationships that were once secure don’t typically evoke the same level of anxiety. “If you were with someone for a longer time and you’ve both identified that I am yours and you are mine, [breaking up] doesn’t activate that sense of abandonment or the sense of fear of dependence per se.” </p>



<p>Having an attachment style that is not secure can mean you are instinctively attracted to the insecure nature of a situationship and the person who comes with it, even if it leaves us perpetually anxious. Dr Olukotun encourages people who find themselves in these situationships to examine what makes them feel safe and comfortable. “So working out actually, what do I want? And is the person I keep trying to go for, do they make me feel safe? Or do they remind me of early life experiences?” Once you know what you need to feel comfortable in a situationship, communicate this and establish clear boundaries so that you aren’t taking the situationship further than either of you are prepared for. “Opening up [outside of these established boundaries] can run the risk of emotional dependency which is not what a situationship is actually for,” says Dr Olukotun.</p>



<p>For it to stop hurting, I needed to forgive myself for being so upset that it ended. I had to (albeit reluctantly) admit that I had genuinely liked this person and that I had simply not anticipated that he would choose someone else, even though he was entitled to do so. I had to speak to my own therapist about it, get into my best friend’s bed and cry about it, write about it. </p>



<p>Are situationships always bad, relationships always good? No. A situationship can be a lot of fun and allow you to discover what you can tolerate in a potential partner or relationship. But it’s important to remember that while you might not want to label it a ‘real’ relationship, the people who enter it are real and so are the emotions that come with them. </p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">The Summer I Turned Pretty</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie""> </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-movie"">(TSITP)</a></em> fever has swept across the world, and viewers of all ages are incredibly <em>invested</em> in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/09/11934126/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-ending"">Jenny Han’s YA drama</a>. There’s something about a combination of dreamy summer Cousins Beach and extreme teenage angst that becomes irresistible. But why do fictional characters draw us in so much? For some people, they may not understand why fans get to the point where they’re fighting over pomegranate margaritas about whether <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-conrad-jeremiah"">Team Conrad or Team Jeremiah</a> is the right choice <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/tsitp-belly-engagement-ring-wedding-trends"">for Belly</a>.</p>



<p>Carly Dober, principal psychologist at <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Enriching Lives Psychology</a>, tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> that teenage stories can evoke emotions that we love to cling to. “Most people can clearly recall their teenage years where the highs were very high and the lows were very low due to the hormonal peaks and troughs of adolescence and early adulthood,” Dober says. “It also makes us feel nostalgic for when things felt easier, as for some, retrospectively, their lives became far more complex in their adult years.”</p>



<p>The love triangle and heavily character-driven plot of <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> also prove addictive, as fans drink up the drama and intrigue. “A love triangle [may leave] us deeply curious and rooting for particular people. Often, people find that who they are rooting for in the love triangle may change throughout a series,” Dober notes. “People can become heavily invested in characters, their stories, and what this represents to them. Maybe someone has been in the character’s shoes before, and we also align our identities with how we want to be seen, and what traits or behaviours we find permissible.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We also align our identities wtih how we want to be seen, and what traits or behaviours we find permissible.</p><cite>Carly Dober, Psychologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Karen-Dill-Shackleford, PhD, a media psychologist based in Santa Barbara, CA, also says it’s natural to find these characters important. She explains that because storytelling is a way to touch on ideas that are important to us, connecting to a story and its characters is important — and often, we might even feel more empathy for a story than we do for things and people in our daily lives.</p>



<p>Dr. Dill-Shackleford describes our relationships to characters as parasocial relationships, or one-sided relationships that we have with the media that we consume. Even if a character can’t talk back to you or otherwise engage with you, it makes sense that if you get home at night and spend an hour or two (or more, we don’t judge) watching a TV show, you might get really attached to them because they bring you joy or cheer you up after a rough day. And feeling so much affection for these characters could be a sign that you’re capable of a lot of empathy. “You have to engage in a real human way in order to feel that connection,” Dr. Dill-Shackleford says. “That’s probably a sign that you are capable of certain social things that you are willing to let yourself go and really feel something in the story.”</p>



<p>There’s not a lot of hard science out there to explain why some people tend to be incredibly passionate fans while others are more casual (i.e., <em>Westworld</em> Reddit theorists vs. people who prefer to just watch the show and let it unfold), but Debra Kissen, PhD, a member of the <a href=""https://adaa.org/"">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>, says it might have something to do with how deeply we probe into things in our lives in <em>general</em>.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>You have to engage in a real human way in order to feel that connection.</p><cite>Karen Dill-Shackleford, PhD</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“People who have more of a tendency to dive deep into things might have more of a tendency to be specialists and dive deep while others take more of a wide view,” she says. “Part of that would then show up in <em>anything</em> you do — you do it fully and thoroughly.” But even if you’re not the all-or-nothing type, Dr. Dill-Shackleford says that characters are often avatars for us, and we let ourselves feel feelings through them even if we can’t relate to <em>everything</em> they’re going through.</p>



<p>That attachment and parasocial relationship can also happen with celebrities, who, in a way, are arguably fictional characters to us: We know the image they present in public, which may or may not 100% align with who they really are, and we guess at the rest. “[With] someone who you’ve followed over a career or long periods of your life, you <em>do</em> feel like you know them,” Dr. Dill-Shackleford says. “You see them in these intimate situations and they’re probably already a beautiful person because they’re an actor, and they’re compelling.”</p>



<p>And, well, the power of attraction is strong. “You can’t underestimate the fact that these stars are very attractive,” she adds. “Most people, unless you live in Hollywood or something, you don’t see that level of physical attractiveness. Like Chris Hemsworth, he’s like a <em>god</em>. So of course it’s a biological cue to us, we’re supposed to find someone to mate with, and it’s a message to us that this person is really valuable because they’re that attractive.”</p>



<p>So it’s normal to be extremely attached to a fictional character or celebrity, so long as it doesn’t become an obsession that takes over your life. If, say, you spend so long thinking about Chris Hemsworth that you’re not dating anyone else because of that attraction, that’s when it might be unhealthy. For the most part, though, Dr. Dill-Shackleford says that most people probably aren’t obsessed to that degree.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> </em>Money Diaries</a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’re asking real people how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period — and we’re tracking every last dollar.<br /><br />Today: a freelance writer who is currently unemployed and who spends some of her money this week on a bunch of flights within Europe at one time.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Editor’s Note:</em></strong><em> Prices converted from GBP to USD; conversion rates correct at time of writing.</em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Freelance writer (formerly a social media manager).<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Media<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 30<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Portland, Oregon<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $0 (previously $74,649). My maximum amount payable on unemployment is $13,104.<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> I do not have a joint income, but my long-distance boyfriend T. does support me with little things when needed, such as Uber rides, gym memberships, and groceries. This has worked for us. He is a generous partner, especially when I lost my main source of income. I know he can pick up the slack and is happy to do so.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> I have two high-yield savings accounts. One has $26,637 and the other has $64,218. I also have a brokerage account that fluctuates but is currently roughly $3,000, a Roth IRA ($6,061), a rollover 401(k) ($34,829), and an HSA ($1,258). I contribute to the emergency fund when possible and don’t fully touch all of my unemployment money, moving $100 to my higher savings account. When I got laid off in June, I took all the steps necessary to go through my subscriptions and any unnecessary spending.<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $1,073 (credit card); $7,539 (student loan). <br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (Weekly):</strong> $453 net on unemployment (previously $1,751 net, biweekly).<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses<br /><br />Housing Costs:</strong> $935. I rent a one-bedroom in a duplex. I don’t have any roommates.<br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $91.35 for student loans. I don’t have a car or any car payments. <br /><strong>Everything Else: </strong>When I got laid off, my boyfriend and I went through all my expenses and shifted as much as possible to what he could cover or what we could share. I also contacted my internet provider and signed up for a cheaper plan ($60 a month). I also paid off the remaining $130 on my phone to lower my monthly bills. I pay $40 a month for my phone bill (I’m on my dad’s phone plan). For utilities, I pay $30-$100 (depending on the season). My landlord pays for water and gas. I also pay $10 for Disney+. When I was working full time, I used to contribute around $600 a month to my savings. Now, I contribute about $100 a month when possible and let it earn interest.</p>



<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Growing up, there was always an expectation that I would go to university. While my mom encouraged me to consider the community college down the street, I wanted to study out of state. I had thought about taking a gap year but ultimately went straight to university. Thankfully, I received both housing and academic scholarships, which helped with the costs. My parents split part of the tuition through loans, and I took out a loan to cover my final year. During the pandemic, I paid off more than $4,000 of my student loans, but later requested a refund in hopes that student loan debt would eventually be canceled, so I could use the money for other emergencies I had at the time.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>I didn’t really understand the importance of money until high school. My parents never talked much about it, though I could tell we didn’t have a huge amount. We were comfortable. My mom especially didn’t want me to worry and even discouraged me from getting a job as a teenager. We never discussed things like investing or ways to earn money beyond a traditional salary. It wasn’t until I took a finance class in high school that I learned the basics, like how to balance a checkbook and create a budget.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was in a bridal shop when I was 17. I worked as a sales associate, helping girls shop for prom dresses and brides find their wedding gowns. I also stocked dresses and ran errands on the floor. I earned minimum wage, which was about $8.25 an hour in Illinois at the time, and mostly worked weekends since my weekdays were packed with high school commitments. I stayed there through the end of high school. My mom didn’t want me to have a job, but I insisted so I could earn my own money.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>I’m sure my parents did struggle, but I didn’t feel it directly. I grew up in a single-parent household and wasn’t the type of kid who asked for much. I noticed it more when I joined activities in high school and needed funds for competition, Secret Santa parties, equipment, etc. My mom always found a way to cover them, but I could tell she was caught off guard at first. That said, I never felt like I didn’t know where my next meal would come from or that I wouldn’t have a place to live. And when it came to big-ticket items, like a phone or computer, she would surprise me on Christmas or my birthday.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>Yes. I’ve always had a survivalist, frugal mentality, and especially so since being laid off. I often struggle with the feeling that I don’t deserve to spend the money I earn. I’ve spent so much time saving that when I need those funds, I don’t want to touch them. Even when I have the money and want to use it to invest in myself or take a vacation, it takes me a long time to decide. I’ve been working on shifting that mindset, reminding myself that money is always available in some form, and that if it’s not, I have an incredible community of friends and family who would support me if I needed it. Freelancing hasn’t helped those nerves — most days, I’m unsure when the next paycheck will arrive. Still, whenever I’ve needed money, it has found its way to me through a project, a friend, or an unexpected check. I do worry about whether I’ll ever be able to retire or if my money will last in the long run. I’m naturally spontaneous and love to disappear off the grid for weeks “for the plot”, but I can just as easily go an entire week spending only $20. Often, spending money feels wrong — what if something happens? — but I know that mindset comes at the expense of enjoying life and truly investing in myself.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>As soon as I graduated from college, I became financially independent. During school, I worked two on-campus jobs, at the library and in security, and used my student loan refunds to help cover living expenses. After graduation, I left home, took an unpaid internship, found a part-time job, and rented my first apartment. From time to time, if money was especially tight, I’d ask my mom or dad for help — never more than $500. I cover all my own bills, but it brings me comfort knowing that even in a worst-case scenario, I’d have a safety net and wouldn’t end up on the street.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Starting my junior year of high school, my aunt rewarded me with money for every A and B I earned. By the time I graduated from college, I had saved $1,425.38 to use however I wished. Aside from that, I haven’t received any inherited income.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm and lie in bed a bit. I’m not much of a morning person and have no huge plans for the day. I answer some potential work emails from my bed and finally get up around 10 a.m. I wash my face, brush my teeth, and eat a kiwi in the living room. It’s a sunny day and not as gloomy as the past couple, so I decide to go to a coffee shop to do some more personal work. It’s nice to have a change of scenery, and it makes me more productive. I hop on the local streetcar into downtown Portland.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I arrive at Never Coffee and order an iced vanilla matcha, settling at one of their outdoor tables. I love that it’s so close to home, and the sunshine makes it the perfect spot to work for a bit. I pull out my laptop to answer emails and create social media posts on Canva about a recent trip to Brazil. With my trip to London coming up in a few days, I spend some time working on an itinerary of things to do there and even make a quick video on UK visa applications to share online. <strong>$5.75</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — A friend of mine sends me a text and asks if I want to go to happy hour. I suggest Solo Club, a cocktail bar in northwest Portland. I haven’t eaten much and am starving. I jump on the streetcar to head straight over to the bar. </p>



<p><br />5:30 p.m. — I give my mother a quick call. She’s stuck in Atlanta trying to get back to Chicago. I arrive at Solo Club at the same time as my friend. We find a seat right away outdoors and spend time talking over a non-alcoholic drink and a glass of orange wine. We order a bunch of food to share, from crab Rangoon to Parmesan truffle fries. We split the bill down the middle ($47.50 for my share, including tip) and head next door to Fifty Licks to get some ice cream. I settle on the mini scoop of the lavender salted caramel, which is so delicious, I wish I had gotten a bigger size ($4). I walk with her for about 30 minutes, eating our ice cream, before our walking paths split up, and I continue for another 15 minutes on my own to home. <strong>$51.50</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I arrive home and immediately get into comfortable clothes and turn on the TV to watch <em>Bridgerton</em>, my favorite comfort show, and make myself a passionfruit and lychee tea to wind down for the evening. <br />10 p.m. — My partner T. lives in London and calls me during his morning. We spend time talking about my day and his morning as he is on his way to work, while I brush my teeth, wash my face, and get into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.25</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>1 a.m. — I’m still awake thinking about a solo travel idea I want to create for social media. I quickly put it together on Canva. While working, I’m also thinking about my upcoming vacation to Malta and Italy in a few weeks that I’ve had planned for months. I notice that the flight prices have dropped, so I decide to take advantage and book three out of the four flights I need, using my money from my savings, before finally going to sleep. It feels good to check off such an important part of my trip. <strong>$520</strong></p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — I have a bit of a late start, but I jump right out of bed knowing I have a meeting with a public relations firm representative at 10 a.m. to discuss potential client work for stories and content. I’m terrible at eating breakfast, so I fast-forward to lunch, making myself a smoothie and some japchae I picked up from Trader Joe’s. I also take the time to get dressed for the day. <br />10:30 a.m. — The meeting goes really well. The representative is excited to connect me with a client in London, giving me a new opportunity to explore while I’m in town.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I leave the house and head across town for my nail appointment, a 30-minute bus ride to the salon. I get magenta gel nails and a pedicure in preparation for my trip to London in two days. I pick the color to transition slightly into fall tones while still holding on to the last hints of summer. T. is sweet enough to cover the cost as a little self-care treat. <strong>$2.80</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — Nails are done, and I’m feeling a little thirsty, so I decide to treat myself. I walk down to Ding Tea and grab a lavender boba. Refreshed, I hop on the bus to head back home. <strong>$6</strong></p>



<p>3:50 p.m. — I get off the bus and make my way to the park on the Portland State University campus. I love spending time here on a sunny day, basking in the warmth while diving into a good book. I have 100 pages left of <em>The Life Impossible</em> by Matt Haig and am determined to make progress before the evening. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — After a couple of hours of reading, I’ve made a dent in the book and now have 60 pages left. Feeling accomplished, I pack up my things and walk back home.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — For dinner, I decide to keep things simple and make a margarita pizza from Trader Joe’s. I settle in on the couch, watch <em>Bridgerton</em>, and let the comfort of the show and the warm pizza close out the day.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $528.80</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>10 a.m. — I start my day pretty late, after a night of drifting in and out of sleep, occasionally answering emails with one eye half-open. I finally muster the energy to get out of bed and make a small breakfast of a kiwi and some water with Liquid IV for extra hydration. Feeling a bit more awake, I set up my tripod in the living room, preparing to film a TikTok video I plan to post later in the week.</p>



<p>11:50 a.m. — I leave the house and hop on the streetcar to my Barre3 class. This is the last session on my current membership, which feels a little bittersweet. It’s a signature 45-minute class that always leaves me feeling strong and centered, and I’ve really come to love the routine. Normally, I’d renew my membership, but since I’ll be traveling soon, I decide not to.</p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — Class is over, and I feel grounded and grateful for the morning. I set up my tripod near the gym to film a quick video, taking advantage of the perfect lighting, before walking across the street to my favorite boba shop for a little treat. I go for a vanilla rose boba, savoring each sip as a small reward for the morning’s effort. Before heading home, I make a quick stop at the central library to pick up a new book I’ve been wanting to read, <em>Only for the Week</em> by Natasha Bishop. <strong>$7.50</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — My friend comes to pick me up, and we head to Kaya Bar, a Black-owned spot in the city known for its delicious cocktails. We both travel frequently, so it’s rare to get a proper catchup, and tonight feels like the perfect opportunity to reconnect and share months’ worth of life updates. We settle in with shrimp tacos, margaritas, and fries, laughing and talking over the food and drinks. The music sets a great vibe, and it feels good to just be present with a friend after a busy day. <strong>$31.86</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — My friend drives me home, and I spend the next little while cleaning up my apartment in preparation for my upcoming trip. I start with the bathroom, then tackle the last bit of laundry I have left. Finally, I vacuum the entire apartment, leaving it feeling refreshed and ready for my absence. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — T. has an early start tomorrow, so we don’t get a chance to talk on the phone. I curl up with my book and read the last 40 pages (verdict: It was good!) before going to sleep. The book explores finding joy in life despite discomfort and embracing change and the uncertainty that life brings, which honestly made it the perfect book for me to read at this point in my life.<br /></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $39.36</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>10 a.m. — Wake up to the sound of my phone ringing. One of my best friends was calling to check in on me before my flight to London tonight. She’s also going to London, and we found out we’d be landing at a similar time to each other. After lying around for a little bit, I get up and use the last of the food in the fridge. I make a smoothie and cook some scrambled eggs.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I spend some time checking my suitcase over and over again, taking out some pieces of clothes that I don’t think I’ll get to wear. I also answer some emails and schedule some emails for later in the day. I talk to T. before the flight since he will be asleep while I’m flying. He tells me he will be waiting at the airport to pick emem up.</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I call an Uber to come pick me up to head to the Portland International Airport. I’m normally not a person who goes to the airport very early, but I don’t normally check a bag and I don’t want any issues. Plus, traffic has gotten worse in the city, and they were previously doing construction by the airport. I pay for the Uber ($50) but T. generously pays me back for the ride, which makes the start of this trip feel a little easier and more relaxed.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I arrive at the airport and drop off my bags with British Airways. I have about an hour until boarding, so I go upstairs to Loyal Legion, where they have a speakeasy cocktail bar called Aurora. It’s a colorful bar behind a coded door. I order a Silver Ceiling that had a rum blend, passionfruit, and lime. <strong>$17</strong></p>



<p>7:25 p.m. — I arrive at the gate just as boarding starts. I settle into my seat on the plane to London, relieved to finally have a moment to breathe. However, our flight ends up being delayed until 8:25 p.m., and we aren’t given any explanation for the holdup. I end up watching 50 minutes worth of <em>Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy</em> before we finally take off.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $17</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I land in London about 30 minutes later than originally planned, which honestly isn’t too bad considering how unpredictable flights can be. As soon as I get off the plane, I brace myself for long lines at customs, but surprisingly, it’s a total breeze, I’m through in what feels like no time. The only real wait comes at baggage claim: My checked bag seems to take forever to appear, and I find myself glancing at my phone and people-watching to pass the time.</p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — As soon as I step out into the arrivals hall, I spot T. waiting for me. We walk toward each other and immediately hug. With my luggage in tow, we make our way outside toward the taxi area so we can call an Uber back to his place. The ride takes us through a mix of London neighborhoods, some new to me and others that stir up memories of the last time I was here. T. covers the Uber, and I just settle back waiting to arrive.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — We finally make it to T.’s house, and I can’t wait to shake off the plane. I immediately jump into the shower. We decide to head out to Aldi to pick up some groceries and anything I felt like having for the next few days. The store is fairly quiet, and I wander the aisles, picking out fresh fruit, snacks, and a few treats I’d been craving, including a bottle of wine. T. covers the groceries.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — The jet lag is really hitting me now, and I’m fighting to keep my eyes open. After a long day of travel, grocery shopping, and settling back in, I finally decide there’s no point in resisting. I brush my teeth, slip into comfortable pajamas, and crawl into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>5 a.m. — I wake up super early thanks to jet lag and, no matter how hard I try, I can’t fall back asleep. I scroll on my phone for a bit, check some emails, and let myself just lounge under the covers while the sun slowly brightens the room. Eventually, T. gets up and heads to the kitchen. I can hear the blender going, and soon enough, he brings me a smoothie along with some eggs.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — T. and I head out to All Points East Festival in east London. The sun is shining, and the energy is electric. We decide to take an Uber to the festival grounds in Victoria Park, and T. covers the ride. We immediately get a drink once arriving and head to the VIP area to meet with a few of his friends. As soon as we arrive, we can hear the music pulsing from inside the park, and we’re greeted by a wave of energy. We waste no time and grab a drink right at the entrance. With drinks in hand, we make our way over to the VIP area, where there’s more space to relax, shorter lines, and a slightly calmer vibe. We met up with a few of T.’s friends who are already there, lounging at one of the picnic tables. Everyone is in high spirits, and we catch up quickly before getting pulled right back into the music to listen to Cat Burns.</p>



<p>6:25 p.m. — We can’t find the Casamigos tent that we loved last time, so after wandering around for a bit we give in and head to the regular bar. The lines aren’t too bad, and I decide to grab the drinks this round (two raspberry daiquiris). With drinks in hand, we make our way back into the growing crowd, buzzing with anticipation as everyone waits for Nao’s set to begin. Nao appears, unexpectedly, right in the middle of the crowd, only a few steps away from us, performing her first song. The entire section erupts in excitement, people raising their phones, screaming, singing along. Somehow, in the middle of it all, we catch ourselves on the big screen flashing across the side of the stage. <strong>$23.71</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — Back at the main stage, we’re watching Raye perform the most amazing set, but I start getting really, really tired, so we leave the festival in the middle of her set. The air is thick with dust kicked up from thousands of feet, people streaming in every direction, the festival lights glowing in the distance behind us. We walk for what felt like forever, weaving through streets packed with other festivalgoers, before finally finding a spot to call an Uber. T. covers the ride.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $23.71</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>12 p.m. — I wake up feeling a little groggy and spend some time just lying in bed, trying to catch up on the sleep I missed earlier in the week. The sunlight is streaming through the window, and it feels nice to have a slow start for once. T. is already in the kitchen and makes me a smoothie with banana, strawberry, cherry, and coconut water, along with scrambled eggs on the side. We sit at the table, sipping and chatting, not in a rush at all. It’s one of those mornings where the day feels wide open, and I actually have time to enjoy it.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — It’s my first time at Notting Hill Carnival, and I can already feel the buzz from the moment we leave the coffee shop. We grab a couple of iced matchas to keep us refreshed on the way ($5), and I sip mine slowly as we wait for the train. The ride to London Bridge takes about 30 minutes. At London Bridge, we switch to another tube line heading straight for Notting Hill ($5.42). The carriage is packed with people carrying flags, wearing colorful costumes, and blasting music from portable speakers. It’s loud, chaotic, and electric all at once. I can smell the mix of street food from nearby stalls as the train pulls into each station, making my stomach rumble with anticipation. <strong>$10.42</strong></p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — T. and I haven’t eaten all day. We find a Caribbean food stand in the middle of carnival and order jerk chicken. The jerk chicken is quite good, but there isn’t a lot of meat, mostly skin. I also run into one of my best friends and she stays with us while we finish eating. We see a stall that’s selling alcoholic slushies and order a few flavors. I had an orange and passionfruit one with rum. The music is lively and we spend time walking around and dancing to the beat. <strong>$12</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — After the festivities start winding down, we begin the trek to the nearest open tube station. The streets are still buzzing with energy, but it’s calmer now compared to earlier. On the way, I spot an Asian market and I head inside, hoping they might have my favorite drink, lychee juice, that I usually can only find overseas. The shelves are stocked, and I grab six cans to stock up for the week. We head back to the tube station and navigate the crowds to head home. By the time we get home, I’m ready to drop into comfortable clothes and unwind. <strong>$11.12</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — I realize I have one more flight to book for my upcoming Europe trip. I notice the price has gone up since I last checked, so I scramble to find a deal. I spot the previous fare on a third-party site and decide to snag it before going to bed. Ticket secured, I finally let myself relax. <strong>$130</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $163.54</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I think I did pretty well this week. Recording my spending made me really aware of where my money is going and highlighted a few little leaks I hadn’t noticed before. The process was surprisingly fun. It felt like keeping a mini diary of my life choices. In the future, I might be a bit more intentional about categorizing purchases as ‘needs’ versus ‘wants’, and maybe set aside a small daily treat budget so I don’t feel guilty about enjoying myself.”</p>

<p>At 20 years old, California-based beauty influencer Daus Mendoza has already appeared in campaigns for Patrick Starrr’s <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CvBFDACPw2j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=3"">ONE/SIZE</a> brand as well as alongside Selena Gomez for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFGLSXnyU97/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rare Beauty</a>. Last year, Mendoza appeared in <a href=""https://glaad.org/20-under-20/2024/"">GLAAD’s 2024 20 Under 20 class</a> of LGBTQ+ tastemakers and has over six million followers across his social platforms. And he’s just getting started.</p>



<p>With an inaugural makeup collection made <a href=""https://glamlite.com/collections/daus-x-glamlite"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">in collaboration with Glamlite, </a>Mendoza is adding “creative director” to his already impressive resumé.

Below, we chatted with Mendoza to learn all about his first-ever makeup collection, beauty philosophy, and more.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>What inspired the collection, and why was Glamlite the right brand to bring this to life?</strong><br /><br />The inspiration behind the collection really came from me – my personality, my love for makeup, and what I felt the beauty community was missing. I’ve always gravitated toward bold, colorful looks, and I wanted to create something that truly reflected that energy. Glamlite was the perfect partner because they not only understood that vision, but they also gave me complete creative freedom to do whatever I wanted. That trust and flexibility allowed the collection to become something authentic to me, while also aligning with Glamlite’s reputation for vibrant, playful products.</p>

<p><strong>What was the process of bringing the collection to life?</strong><br /><br />The process took more than two years from start to finish. It was meticulous, and honestly, at times, really challenging because I’m incredibly picky when it comes to the details – from the exact shade of a color, to the texture and formula, to how it looked when applied, and even how long it lasted. Every single element had to feel perfect. One of the biggest surprises we faced was when our manufacturer suddenly cancelled on us a year into the process, which forced us to essentially start over. That pushed the launch back by another year, but in the end, I think it made the collection stronger, because I had even more time to refine every detail.</p>

<p><strong>What do you hope people feel when using the collection?</strong><br /><br />More than anything, I hope this collection makes people feel confident and inspired. I want to encourage everyone to play with makeup, experiment with color, and have fun with beauty – without any rules. Whether you’re a girl, a boy, or you don’t fit into either category, this collection is for you! My hope is that when people use it, they not only look amazing, but also feel more comfortable expressing who they are.</p>
