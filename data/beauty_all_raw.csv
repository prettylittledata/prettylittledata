When it comes to gifting us, skip the default candles and bath sets. We want things that make our lives easier, elevate our look, or fund our next <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/08/11078465/go-off-sis-soft-girl-summer"">soft-life</a> chapter. No matter what our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-are-5-love-languages-meaning"">love language</a>, here are the gifts that the Black women in your life will love. You’re welcome. <br /><br /><em>All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication.

Bundles aren’t just a treat, they’re a strategy.

Whether she’s planning a girls’ getaway or a spontaneous reset, this gift literally opens the door to outside. -<em> Sandy Pierre, Branded Partnerships Lead</em><br /><br /><strong>Delta</strong> Delta Gift Card, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delta.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fgift-cards%2Foverview"">Delta</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1350"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947711.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1350&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=4:5"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2><em>Honey &amp; Spice</em> and <em>Sweet Heat</em> by Bolu Babalola </h2><br />Some people might not put romance novels in the “necessity” category when it comes to gift giving but that person ain’t me. Books are always a great gift and if you’ve got a friend whose love language is physical touch but they haven’t exactly cuffed this cuffing season yet, I’ve got the steamy literature that’s going to keep them warm. These two books by Nigerian-British <a href=""https://www.bolubabalola.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">author Bolu Babalola</a> are hot and spicy and go together like fried yam, plantain and eggs (Nigerian fam, did I get that food combo, right?). Both novels follow the on-again, off-again love story of Kiki and Malakai. -<em> Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Sr. Content Director of Entertainment</em><br /><br /><strong>Rep Club</strong> Honey &amp; Spice and Sweet Heat, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frep.club%2Fproducts%2Fhoney-and-spice%3F_pos%3D2%26_psq%3Dbolu%2Bb%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"">Rep Club</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2048"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947741.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=1536&amp;height=2048&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=3:4"" width=""1536"" /><figcaption><h2>Yellow Picnic Meal Prep Subscription </h2><br />Because cooking after a long day? Yeah… sometimes the answer is absolutely not. A Yellow Picnic meal prep subscription is the perfect life support system. Fresh, flavorful meals delivered right to her door so she can stop pretending she’s going to “meal prep on Sunday. Give her one less thing to worry about. -<em> Sandy Pierre, Branded Partnerships Lead</em><br /><br /><strong>Yellow Picnic</strong> Yellow Picnic Meals, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyellowpicnic.com%2Flife-style-plans%2F"">Yellow Picnic</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""600"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947640.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=600&amp;height=600&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""600"" /><figcaption><h2>Shark FlexStyle® Air Styling &amp; Drying System with Storage Case Bundle</h2><br />A blowdryer and flat iron in ONE?! This product has single-handedly saved my wash days. I get the most effortless blowouts with it, perfect for braid-outs or right before I get my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11435610/knotless-goddess-braids-black-hair-trend"">knotless braids</a> done. The flat iron attachment is the perfect follow-up for the best silk press of my life. However, even though this tool claims to be “heat-damage free,” I’ve definitely noticed my curls loosen if I don’t apply enough heat protectant, so proceed with caution. -<em> Jessika Hardy, Social Video Producer</em><br /><br /><br /><strong>SharkNinja</strong> Shark FlexStyle Air Styling &amp; Drying System, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD400B2.html"">Shark</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""321"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947641.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=662&amp;height=321&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=662:321"" width=""662"" /><figcaption><h2>Spotify Premium Gift Membership</h2><br />Music is therapy, mood-setting, and a daily ritual. A Spotify Premium membership is the gift that truly upgrades her entire life. No ads interrupting her deep-condition-and-clean-up playlist. And let’s be serious, Spotify Wrapped is basically our personal Super Bowl. I look forward to it <em>every</em> year, and this year their celebration event had Clipse performing live. If that isn’t a sign to give someone a Premium subscription, I don’t know what is. -<em> Sandy Pierre, Branded Partnerships Lead</em><br /><br /><strong>Spotify</strong> Spotify Gift Card, $, available at <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Spotify-Premium-month-Subscription-eGift/dp/B0F59PLX59/ref=sr_1_4?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.88E6e2-SYUo3WCTit8L1MEOPuzwuhO0QkgQcg8nmMwvdwvAR-pQwoHAcTYy-I5ah.teJaXXW3_ELb9hHLs2OSDRso17-y4Ipk29S14mf9QRQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Spotify&amp;qid=1764949519&amp;s=gift-cards&amp;sr=1-4&amp;th=1"">Amazon</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1340"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947645.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1258&amp;height=1340&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=629:670"" width=""1258"" /><figcaption><h2>Brandon Blackwood Bag<br /></h2><br />Who doesn’t need a new designer handbag? This is for the stylish woman in your life who likes to show up and <em>out </em>to the function, without sacrificing quality and practicality. Brandon Blackwood bags are affordable, durable and can go with just about anything. It’s the brand’s 10-year anniversary so they’ve got even more styles (and sales!) to satisfy even the pickiest fashionista. -<em> Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Sr. Content Director of Entertainment</em><br /><br /><strong>Brandon Blackwood</strong> Brandon Blackwood Bag, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrandonblackwood.com%2Fproducts%2Fclick-bag-leopard-ponyhair"">Brandon Blackwood</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1252"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947642.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1248&amp;height=1252&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=312:313"" width=""1248"" /><figcaption><h2>Gwen Beloti Jewelry Set</h2><br />Jewelry is the universal “I get you” gift and Gwen Beloti makes pieces that feel luxe without trying too hard. Think everyday gold, clean lines, and instant heirloom energy. It’s the kind of gift she wears daily and tells everyone you gave her. -<em> Sandy Pierre, Branded Partnerships Lead</em><br /><br /><strong>Gwen Beloti</strong> Everyday Linked Necklace, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgwenbeloti.com%2Fproducts%2Feveryday-linked%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorO0wWI77AQ_WFR4XaQYQE8K2hkTStwnLVsCd7vTt_QKOq9lVmX"">Nordstom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""840"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947649.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1252&amp;height=840&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=313:210"" width=""1252"" /><figcaption><h2>Ray-Ban Meta Glasses (Gen 2)</h2><br />These glasses are for the girl who stays capturing a moment. This gift will make her feel like she’s low-key in her tech era. They’re stylish, futuristic, and let her live her life without constantly holding her phone in the air like she’s filming a documentary. -<em> Sandy Pierre, Branded Partnerships Lead</em><br /><br /><br /><strong>Meta, RAY BAN</strong> Ray-Ban | Meta Headliner, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ray-ban.com%2Fusa%2Felectronics%2FRW4013ray-ban%2520%257C%2520meta%2520headliner%2520-%2520gen%25202-black%2F8056262721322"">Ray Ban</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""756"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947646.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1010&amp;height=756&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=505:378"" width=""1010"" /><figcaption><h2>Pattern Body Juicy Hydration Duo</h2><br />Will all my Amber Musk girls please rise?!

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/areaware-gift-guide"">self-proclaimed homebody</a> of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and cozy Outdoor Fellow candles. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up olive oil dipping sets, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart.

<p>It’s a Sunday afternoon. I’m sitting in a quiet Queens cafe, stirring my coffee across from the man I love when he says, calmly and rehearsed, <em>“I’ve never truly loved you. And I don’t think I ever will.”</em></p>



<p><em>Ouch. </em>Safe to say, blueberry pancakes will never taste the same again. </p>



<p>What followed was every <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/11/8894605/stages-of-breakup"">stage of heartbreak</a> you can imagine. Remorse, regret, rumination. I was moving through the world carrying the weight of loving someone who, if I’m being honest, didn’t even like me most days. Crying on the subway became a routine and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0l8zYqoUeBYg47Gmevq9HZ?si=zWdALid9QeaRFRvp2IB-JQ"">Olivia Dean’s <em>The Art of Loving</em></a> became my lifeline. </p>



<p>Just when I thought the world had shrunk to the size of my grief, life threw me a bone — a random, unexpected invitation to Club Med in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dominican-republic-adventures"">Dominican Republic.</a> I didn’t know it yet, but this was the plot twist my heart so desperately needed.</p>



<p>A few days later, I was on a plane to the DR with five nights ahead at the all-inclusive <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwp8yNRnmlZJS6fLh022jduivzrsivPRIKjdz7kmlzNfD-LCZ53IUUBoCK8AQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Punta Cana</a> and <a href=""http://utm_source"">Club Med Michès</a>. I’d never been to the Dominican, but after hours of Googling, I was convinced I’d found the perfect escape. After all, nothing heals a heartbreak faster than an open bar, right?<br /><br />Not quite.</p>



<p>To no one’s surprise, I spent the first few nights at the resort broken. As Black women, we don’t always feel held in our relationships. The breakup felt like a generational curse. Most days, I felt like I was screaming into the void to be truly seen, accepting half-hearted apologies, and enduring comments meant to make me feel small. Somebody call Madea and tell her to get <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jellydivinti/video/7258625800293862699?lang=en"">the grits ready!</a></p>



<p>Then it clicked. Black women deserve luxury. We deserve softness. And dammit, we deserve an all-inclusive resort! So, I would become my ancestors’ wildest dreams. I was going to have a love story worth writing, even if the prince charming was me. </p>



<p>So the next day, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on my swimsuit, and decided I was going to become the best boyfriend I ever had.</p>



<p><strong>Spa Time: Luxury Lifts The Soul</strong></p>



<p>My first few days were spent at<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/punta-cana/y""> Club Med Spa: Punta Cana</a>, where I discovered just how much luxury can lift the soul. Mornings started with an Aperol Spritz overlooking the Atlantic from the Buena Vista Lounge. The sun wrapped around me, giving me the warmth I’d been craving for weeks. The lounge also offered a buffet selection from every corner of the globe, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, you name it. And did I mention I’m an emotional eater? I shut that buffet down.</p>



<p>Every evening, I attended one of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMiH_bZIpfN/"">Club Med’s classic parties</a>. Their iconic all-white party gave me the perfect excuse to put on heels and feel like myself again. Live bands and circus shows pulled me out of my head and I ended up meeting women who spanned across multiple generations each sharing their own chaotic stories about men. And suddenly, I didn’t feel so alone. </p>

<p><strong>Self-care As The Ultimate Breakup Cure</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the self-care didn’t stop there. I dove into<a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/l/wellness-fusion""> Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program</a>, attending yoga classes and guided meditation led by resident experts. I realized reclaiming my peace of mind wasn’t just about escaping heartbreak. It was about actively choosing to nurture myself in every way possible.</p>



<p>The last couple of days were spent at <a href=""https://www.clubmed.us/r/miches-playa-esmeralda/y?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SEA_BR_ALL_Google_US_EN_Multi-Product_LH_Multi-resort&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19311535181&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD5uxODXrDAIWhxBxghEmlVF6ni1O&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAlrXJBhBAEiwA-5pgwleHQUK6O-JvQBLBM1YN1ErnyPfAbI4camT0OkMvB9I0XW5SrRTL5RoCZNAQAvD_BwE"">Club Med Michès</a>, and let me tell you, this resort was a dream. The two resorts aren’t close to each other, Michès is about a two-hour drive east, tucked away in the El Seibo province, surrounded by lush palm groves, rugged mountains, and secluded beaches. The property stretches across 93 acres, offering everything from treetop yoga to Zen pools, making it feel like its own private world.</p>



<p>The buffet at Michès felt gourmet and fresh and I happily sampled everything, for research purposes, of course. </p>



<p><strong>Dancing It Out &amp; Letting The Sun Set On Heartbreak</strong></p>



<p>And then there was Miches’ all-white party. I drank with new friends from all over the globe, screamed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4"">Justin Bieber’s “Baby”</a> at the top of my lungs. It was a moment of pure, chaotic joy and a reminder of how big the world really is.</p>



<p>And last but not least, the beach. This was my favorite part. The sun danced across the turquoise waves and to no one’s surprise, I cried. Not from sadness, but appreciation for being alive. To be able to love and to feel. Honestly, I could have stayed there forever. </p>



<p>With sunsets on horseback, spa treatments, and yoga flows as part of Club Med’s Wellness Fusion program, I realized Michès wasn’t just a vacation, it was a masterclass in reclaiming peace, indulgence, and joy.</p>

<p>Listen, men suck. And they have since the beginning of time. The trip didn’t completely erase my heartbreak, but it reminded me there’s so much more to life than one person’s opinion. There’s joy, connection, and peace waiting to be found. You don’t need an all-inclusive resort to heal, but sometimes it helps to step away, tend to your spirit, and let the world slow down. As I continue this journey of self-discovery, I hope to carry this sense of wonder and ease wherever I go.</p>

<p>As a major fan of the original <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/110716/best-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-episodes""><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</em></a>, I was hesitant but eager to see what its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/07/11752424/adrian-holmes-bel-air-season-3-uncle-phil-interview"">reboot <em>Bel Air</em> </a>would bring to the characters I hold very dear to my heart. In 2022 when the show premiered, I loved it instantly. Recently, we’ve seen so many reboots come and go, but <a href=""https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/bel-air"">Peacock’s <em>Bel Air</em></a><em> </em>has succeeded where others have failed . By taking a beloved 30-minute sitcom and turning it into a compelling &amp; layered one-hour drama, <em>Bel-Air</em> brought something fresh and exciting to the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10874708/bel-air-carlton-fresh-prince-reboot-backlash""><em>Fresh Prince </em>franchise</a>. The storylines and character arcs were so detailed and nuanced that it felt similar but brand new. While the show is indeed a drama that gets the heart pumping — looking at you, Geoffrey — it still has the warm feeling of a family truly showing what it means to show up for one another. For three seasons, I’ve laughed and even cried while watching <em>Bel Air</em>, and trust me, Season 4 will continue to take us on a rollercoaster of emotions. I was heartbroken when it was announced that this would be<em> Bel-Air’s</em> last season, </p>



<p>What started as a concept on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAfJpyBgcgA"">six years ago by Morgan Cooper</a> has since flourished into Peacock’s longest running <em>and</em> most streamed original series. The execution of this show from start to finish is a testament to Black ingenuity and a reminder that art is for <em>all</em> of us. As <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cassiedamsel/"">Cassandra Freeman</a>, who plays Aunt Viv told me over Zoom, “Your vision is not trite, it is worthy.” She continued: “The greatest artistic expression is [that] you were born to change other people’s lives with your vision..” A word.</p>



<p>Ahead of the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@peacock/video/7576291076558851341"">Season 4 premiere</a>, I was able to share some laughs and get insight from <em>Bel-Air’s</em> cast on how they feel about the series’ final season, the growth of  their characters,  and the legacy they think <em>Bel Air </em>will leave.</p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Congrats on the final season!  How do you feel about the growth of your characters over four seasons?</strong></p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10869393/coco-jones-bel-air-hilary-colorism""><strong>Coco Jones</strong></a><strong> (Hilary Banks): </strong>I feel pretty satisfied with my growth. I think that Hilary started off [more] surface.  She’s this influencer, this cute girl with sickening outfits. It was very lighthearted at the beginning and then you get to unravel the plights that she goes through and it’s real life. [Now, she’s] feeling like she doesn’t have a seat at the table and wanting to be the chef and people wanting to downplay her recipes, like they’re too spicy. This girl comes from this zip code, this net worth, but it didn’t buy her this easy life. It doesn’t buy her self-discovery. She still has to go through the highs and lows to figure out who she is. I’ve enjoyed really playing her, her arcs and her peaks and valleys.</p>



<p><strong>Akira Akbar (Ashley Banks):</strong> I feel really satisfied with Ashley’s growth among these seasons. We really got to see a teenage girl and what she goes through. When I was a younger teenager, I fully didn’t know who I was. I was still trying to figure out myself. I was exactly like Ashley. I think the writers really did a great job of portraying that on screen.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947337.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “Soulmates” Episode 407 — Pictured: (l-r) Akira Akbar as Ashley, Coco Jones as Hilary — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cassandra Freeman (Aunt Viv):</strong> [Viv] started off as a politician’s wife, and by the end of this, she becomes a self-expressed artist. It’s been an amazing journey to play her. She’s trying to figure out how to speak her truth and take care of other people and [she] realizes the best way to take care of other people is to take care of yourself first. Take care of your passions first. Tell people the truth first. It’s been an honor to play her storyline.</p>



<p><strong>Olly Sholotan (Carlton Banks):</strong> I’ve never been happier. I think that the beautiful thing that these writers have done is they’ve taken such good care of our characters’ journeys, and I just know that by the time you get to the very end, fans are gonna be so proud of Carlton’s growth.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari Banks (Will Smith):</strong> I was gonna say proud. Proud of the people that our characters have become. Proud of their journeys and proud of where they’re going next. </p>



<p><strong>Jimmy Akingbola (Geoffrey Thompson):</strong>  We started very gentle with Geoffrey. It was a lot of sitting in a mystery and not resting on the wave of nostalgia. I’m an actor that loves to get my hands dirty. [I’ll roll] up my sleeves, gimme the ball, let me play. So I was very happy when we got into Season 3, where we got to see behind the layers of Geoffrey. I think Season 4 is the perfect way to sort of wrap things up because again, his past comes through the door. My key word for this season for Geoffrey is fracture. He fractures everything that he built with the Banks family. And I think it teaches you that there are consequences to every action you do in life. And this is the first time that Geoffrey is not in control… He’s under pressure. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan L. Jones (Jazz):</strong> Just the growth of my character in general has just been a blessing because when we first get the roles, it’s like you’re just cool with whatever. I’m playing Jazz. I’m not a part of the family, but my character has layers and layers and layers and layers. Coming up to Season 4, I think one of the main themes is about Jazz’s evolution [and] unconditional love. And just being strong enough to tell your significant other, or the person that you love, how you actually feel no matter what the circumstances are. As men too, we need to do that more often instead of trying to be hard all the time. That’s one thing that my character definitely has taught me. Some of the things that sound weak or feel weak or seem like what you shouldn’t do, [aren’t like that at all]. It feels like don’t express your feelings this way, but no, actually, instead of thinking <em>that’s weak</em>, I think that it actually takes a very strong person to do that.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Holmes [Uncle Phil]:</strong> Philip Banks started out being that pillar for the family and over time, we start to see cracks in that pillar and just how  life has weighed on him and the pressures of being perfect. I think that the theme for him is legacy and building legacy is not what we leave behind for the next generation. It’s what we leave within the next generation — the impact, the lives we change, you know. I think that Philip has done a great job over the arc of this series in just empowering Will, empowering Carlton, and the family, and just letting them know that they are enough and they have all the tools they need and just really building them up to be the best versions of themselves. Also just embracing the simple things in life and inner peace. I think he’s just been so busy outside, looking outside that he hasn’t been able to really focus on the inside and over the time where we see him in this season, he starts to really look within more and appreciate the little things.</p>



<p><strong>What mark or message do you think<em> Bel Air </em></strong><strong>will leave once it is over?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco: </strong>If I had to say it would be to stay close to the people who love you back. You know, at the end of the day, they will be your support system. And you can have great accomplishments, but don’t forget the people who love you back and who really, truly know you because there’s always seasons and things change. And you wanna have the people that will always support you as close to you as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra: </strong> Titles change, positions fade, great successes get forgotten. But family is why they say charity starts at home.That’s the first one. And then the second thing is outside of the show, just the birth of it. I hope people realize if you have a great idea, you too can be Morgan Cooper and drop your thesis for an idea on YouTube. And your platform is how many people agree with you. And you not only will change your life, you’ll change everyone else’s life. That’s the greatest artistic expression. You were born to change other people’s lives with your vision. Your vision is not trite, it is worthy. </p>



<p>​​<strong>Akira:</strong> I think the biggest takeaway from <em>Bel Air</em> is family over everything. You can have all the friends in the world. They can come and go, but your family is always there</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947339.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>BEL-AIR — “The Maybes” Episode 401 — Pictured: (l-r) Adrian Holmes as Philip, Cassandra Freeman as Vivian — (Photo by: Anne Marie Fox/PEACOCK)</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Simone Jones:</strong> I feel like it’s the ability to reinvent yourself and love yourself while you do it. And, also to really take care of your community because we’re gonna mess up. I feel like relationships now have become very temporary and very fragile. And so to watch,even just as a cast, we go through like our teens together in LA and something you’ve never seen before, and watching these characters kind of mirror a similar turbulent time. I think I want people to leave with, like, your community is really important to yourself and also everybody else.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Man, Simone really took the words just kind of right outta my mouth. So everything she said, but put it in a slightly deeper voice.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> She said something that  really stuck me there too. The reinvention, uh, you know, reinvention and, not being afraid to reinvent yourself. Not being afraid to reinvent in general. You know we’ve shown the world that just ’cause you know, you reinvent something doesn’t mean that it has to be corny or it doesn’t mean that it has to, you know what I’m saying? It can be a totally different thing, you know?  We are the living proof of that. </p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong>  I think for me, I think for our theme has been constant throughout four seasons, where like we’re just showing, all aspects of the Black experience. What I love about our show is that each one of our characters is going through a different black experience. We got me like the hustler. That’s like, I’m not broke, but I ain’t, I ain’t Uncle Phil, you know? Uncle Phil’s like the leader of the household. And then we, then we got Geoffery, who’s black 007. We got Will fish outta water. We got Carlton, who is very privileged. So it’s like I can, I can go down the line, but we’re showing that the black experience, </p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> We’re not a monolith.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> The black experience is not just one experience, like, come over here we’re black this is what we do. It’s not like that, you know? </p>



<p><strong>Adrian: </strong>Absolutely. We’re not defined by our trauma or our struggle.  You know, our joy is something to be celebrated. Our joy is our superpower. It’s our fuel, and that’s what keeps us resilient. I always say, we can bend, but don’t break. Our black joy is what prevents us from, from breaking and always surviving no matter how difficult the situations are. The issue is we always find a way to prevail. Our show, Bel Air has done a fantastic job of really showcasing that, you know?. We’re not a monolith. We are redefining what the black experience looks like on television.We need more of that narrative moving forward.  And hopefully there’s not a huge void after our show. </p>



<p><strong>All right, we’re going to end on a game called Bothered or Unbothered. I’m gonna throw you some rapid-fires questions and your answer is either Bothered or Unbothered. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Keeping family secrets. Bothered or Unbothered?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Coco:</strong> Hmm. Bothered. I [like to] get everything out in the open. I really love therapy and I can’t with a secret. It’s like mold. It’s just going to get everywhere.  Plus, I can’t remember everything I done said. Now I gotta keep up with the lies. I don’t know what I just said to you.</p>



<p><strong>Cassandra:</strong> I’m kind of unbothered because I’m starting to realize that if I am interested in what you’re cooking up all the time and in your pot, it just steals my joy. You can live your whole life knowing everybody’s secrets and never even deal with your own. So if it’s my secrets, I’m bothered. I’m gonna get it out. If it ain’t bothering me in my house, listen, you go over there. I ain’t got time for that. It’s too much, I’m unbothered.  </p>



<p><strong>Akira:</strong> My secret, I feel like I’ll be bothered and I’ll be like, I need to tell somebody, but someone else’s I don’t care.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Unbothered by that.</p>



<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong> Unbothered!</p>



<p><strong>Adrian:</strong> Unbothered.</p>



<p><strong>Jordan: </strong>Everybody don’t have to know what your family is going through.</p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> It depends on the secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> Yeah. Like keeping family [secrets] in the family? Bothered. But I’m OK with keeping family secrets from outside people. I ain’t trying to tell our business. </p>



<p><strong>Jabari:</strong> Sometimes you gotta keep a little secret. Sometimes you have to. It’s best for the family. Mom don’t need to know that. Mom don’t need to know what Cuzzo did when we went out. Mom don’t need to know that. Keep it secret.</p>



<p><strong>Olly:</strong> I think what’s in the dark will always come to the light, so I don’t know about this one.</p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Oh no. I feel I’m a big fan of everybody having all the information and then doing what you will with it.</p>

<p>As a beauty director for 10 years, I’ve tried enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">Charlotte Tilbury products</a> to conclude that if all makeup production stopped and it were the only brand left, I’d be perfectly happy. I’m not the only one — my beauty editor peers and fellow R29 staffers praise the brand for its inclusive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-unreal-skin-sheer-glow-tint-review"">foundation shades</a> and campaigns featuring people of all skin tones and ages, Instagram-worthy packaging, dreamy textures, top-notch quality, and that you’re never left wanting. From blush to skincare and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-perfume-fragrance-collection-of-emotions"">even fragrance</a>, there isn’t a product that Charlotte Tilbury hasn’t put her name on.</p>



<p>But with so many in the range, how do you know which ones are worth your hard-earned money? Luckily, I’ve been wearing a full face of Charlotte Tilbury for months, putting everything through its paces at weddings, during workouts, and at work. Here’s everything I’d recommend if you’re looking to expand your makeup collection.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>

<p>So many brands use the word “airbrush” to describe their products, but few actually live up to the hype. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-foundation-shade-4-neutral"">This one does</a>. I vividly remember applying it for the first time and being blown away by how well it blurred my large pores, hid leftover acne marks, and minimized my dark circles — and that was just one pump. It’s so packed with pigment that one pump is really all you need to cover your entire face. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbeautiful-skin-foundation-2-neutral"">Unlike Charlotte’s Beautiful Skin Foundation</a>, which has a dewy finish, this one is matte, but it eliminates the need for powder. I’m always impressed by how well it lasts without sliding off or settling into creases, and even with its impressive staying power, it still feels comfortable and skin-like. That’s thanks to the clever “Aircool” technology, which the brand says helps it withstand sweat and humidity. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s unlikely to cause breakouts. Here, I’m wearing shade 5 Cool, but there are 44 shades to choose from.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fairbrush-flawless-setting-spray"">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray, $38</a></h2>

<p>As you can tell, I use this setting spray religiously. Even on days when I’m just wearing a tap of blush and a tinted moisturizer, it keeps everything in place for so much longer — and I’m constantly touching my face. Other setting sprays make my face and brows feel rock-hard, like my skin might crack, but not this one. It lets your face move and doesn’t leave behind any chalky residue. I also love that the nozzle is wide, so it covers your whole face in one or two spritzes — no waiting around for droplets to dry. It keeps my makeup looking and feeling fresh all day, but if you have very oily skin, you might prefer upgrading to the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmini-airbrush-flawless-matte-setting-spray"">Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray Matte</a>.</p>

<p>This is the only matte lipstick that doesn’t leave my lips parched — and trust me, I’ve tried my fair share. Instead, it’s comfortably creamy without skimping on pigment. One swipe on my bottom lip, then pressing my lips together, is enough for me. The square-shaped bullet makes application so crisp and precise you could skip lip liner altogether. The nude shades don’t last as long as the bolder reds, obviously, but they still hold up surprisingly well. I can drink multiple cups of tea, eat a full meal, and still find it hanging on. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fmatte-revolution-lipstick-pillowtalk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Original</a>, but the Pillow Talk collection is also available in shades Medium, Deep, and Fair. </p>

<p>This might be one of the pricier lip pencils out there, but I can honestly say it’s the best. I’ve never known one to last as long as this does. Often, my lipstick disappears by the end of the day, but the ghost of this liner is still visible. I love that the texture is equal parts creamy and waxy — you can blur it with your fingers, yet it won’t budge once you’re done.</p>

<p>This is the best mascara in Charlotte Tilbury’s collection, easily trumping <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fpillow-talk-push-up-lashes-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pillow Talk Push Up Lashes</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Flegendary-lashes-vol2-volumising-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Legendary Lashes</a>. It’s all thanks to the exceptionally large, curved brush, which beefs up even the tiniest lashes in the inner and outer corners. Though it’s bigger than your average brush, it’s surprisingly easy to maneuver. I’m always pleasantly surprised by how much volume I get from just one coat, and I’ve never received so many compliments. Even better, it doesn’t smudge or run — and I have very oily skin, so that’s usually a given for me. And when it’s time to take it off, it melts away with a cream cleanser. No scrubbing required.</p>

<p>While there are a handful of palettes in Charlotte’s collection, I’m not exactly a dab hand with eyeshadow — but this quad makes building an eye look from scratch ridiculously easy. In fact, it’s the palette Charlotte’s bridal makeup artists always reach for because it’s so foolproof. Two mattes, one shimmer, and one extra-metallic shade make up the foursome, and each quad (there are 16 of them, by the way) is color-coded so you don’t have to stress about what goes with what. Want a smoky eye? Sweep the darkest shade through your crease and tap the metallic shade onto the center of your lid. I like using my fingers for the shimmers and metallics, and every shade blends together beautifully. It’s my go-to for nights out and weddings.</p>

<p>Allow me to introduce you to my favorite blush right now — it’s been in my makeup bag since it launched earlier this year. This stick makes application effortless thanks to its ultra-creamy base (a dream to blend) and buildable pigment. A couple of swipes bring my light olive skin to life, giving it a rosy sheen with ultra-fine shimmer flecks. It really does make your skin look like it’s glowing from the inside out. Some days, I even skip foundation and tap this onto my cheekbones and nose to pep up my complexion. Since it’s a cream, the staying power isn’t as long as Charlotte’s powder blushes, but it’s simple to top up on the go with your fingers. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Funreal-blush-stick-pinky-glow"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pinky Glow</a>, but it’s available in five more shades to suit all skin tones.</p>

<p>This unassuming eyeshadow pot is my secret weapon for creating a compliment-worthy eye look in seconds. The cream-to-powder formula is like an oyster shell of metallics and shimmers that catch the light from every angle, giving the effect of a painstaking, multi-step eyeshadow routine. I just swipe it on with my ring finger and blend the edges with a soft brush. It grips even my oily eyelids without creasing or separating — and a little goes a very long way. Here, I’m wearing <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Feyes-to-mesmerise-rose-gold"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rose Gold</a>, but there are nine others to choose from.</p>

<p>I love the thin doe-foot applicator on this concealer — you can be really precise with placement rather than wiping out your features by going overboard. I have dry under-eyes, but this feels nicely moisturizing, which means it’s far less likely to settle obviously into fine lines and accentuate them. It also has brightening powers thanks to tiny, natural mica-based pearls that disperse across the skin and act like a built-in ring light for dark circles. And it’s not just a concealer: hydrating niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, skin-strengthening peptides, and antioxidant vitamin C make it basically skincare in disguise.</p>

<p>I’m not usually a fan of plumping glosses, but this one is built differently. First off, it doesn’t make my lips feel like they’re on fire. Instead, it has a cooling effect thanks to methyl diisopropyl propionamide, which I’m sure gets my blood pumping to the surface. If that doesn’t give your lips a lift, the light-reflecting pigments will. Like crushed diamonds, they create a 3D effect, giving the illusion of fuller, rounder lips. On top of that, it feels more like a comfortable lip oil than a sticky, hair-trapping gloss, so I actually want to keep applying it. A Charlotte Tilbury makeup artist recommended lining my lips, applying Pillow Talk lipstick, and then slicking this on top for a wedding-ready look.</p>

<p>This is one of the few pressed powders I’ve tried that genuinely feels like you’re not wearing anything. Many leave skin chalky or exaggerate texture, but this one gives just the right level of matte, taking down shine without making skin look flat. Plus, it lasts <em>forever</em>. </p>

<p>I much prefer Charlotte’s Glowgasm wands — essentially highlighter-blush hybrids — over the matte blushes because they add dimension and make my makeup look effortless, like I haven’t even tried. I always reach for Pinkgasm, though there are several shades to suit all skin tones. That gorgeous glow you see all over the brand’s Instagram? It’s almost always thanks to these. The formula melts into the skin, and the shimmer looks like a natural gloss rather than chunky glitter. Just make sure to twist the cap to “off” when closing the applicator, or be prepared for a messy spill.</p>

<p>I was gutted to hear that the brand’s Airbrush Bronzer is being discontinued, but this is the next best thing — and I think it lasts even longer on the skin than powder bronzers. One dot is all I need to define my cheekbones and add warmth to my complexion, and unlike other cream bronzers, it never looks muddy or gets stuck in my hairline. It blends effortlessly thanks to moisturizing ingredients like glycerin and skin-smoothing dimethicone. Again, be sure to turn the cap to “off” before putting it back inside your makeup bag.</p>

<p>Brow Lift is a bit too chunky for my liking, but <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fbrow-cheat-eyebrow-pencil-natural-brown"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brow Cheat</a> is just right. The angled nib is smaller, letting you mimic fine brow hairs, and the pencil is creamy enough to fill in sparse patches quickly. It never fades or smudges on me, and I love the spoolie on the end for feathering out the pigment and creating natural-looking brows. I’ll admit, I’m not the biggest fan of the brand’s ultra-thin Brow Fix brow gel for my wiry brows — but if your brow hairs are finer, you’ll probably love it, as it’s totally inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Move over, Victoria Beckham Beauty. This is, in my opinion, the best eyeliner pencil out there right now. It’s creamy enough to create a smudgy, smoky eye, yet long-lasting enough for a sharp, block-winged look. I trick I’ve learned is to use the edge of my nail to sharpen things up, and I’m always so impressed with how well it lasts at the end of a night out.</p>

<p>I recently replaced all my tired, scratchy makeup brushes with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fthe-complete-brush-set"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury’s complete set</a>, and I won’t go back. I’ve never used brushes this soft, but don’t underestimate them. They’re plush and dense, making blending cream and powder products an absolute dream. My most-used brush is the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Fhollywood-complexion-contour-brush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Complexion Brush</a>, which I reach for with foundation, blush, and concealer.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946768.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>There are several reasons why finding the right dry shampoo is a tricky feat. For starters, it’s not guaranteed that it will actually help your hair feel cleaner and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"">absorb excess oil </a>— and that’s not even taking into consideration whether or not it’ll leave a chalky cast in its wake. And if there’s one person who feels uniquely primed to put the stuff through its paces, it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chloe-kim-snowboarder-mental-health-interview"">Chloe Kim</a>.</p>



<p>The Olympic snowboarder — who the world met in the 2018 Winter Games as a bleached blonde — has recently returned to her brunette roots. Given that her job requires more time in a snug, sweat-trapping helmet than the average person, when she says she swears by Batiste to keep her roots feeling and looking fresh, I — a fellow dark brunette — am inclined to believe her.</p>



<p>“I remember using Batiste for the first time and being like, <em>oh my gosh, this works</em>,” she tells Refinery29, days before going to intensive training ahead of the upcoming 2026 Olympics in Italy. “Especially with my travel and training, it’s one of those necessities that I need on the go.” Her favorite formula? The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a>, which uses rice starch to mop up excess oil and has a refreshing chamomile, green tea, and sandalwood scent.</p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her favorite skincare of the moment </h2>



<p>“My skincare routine these days consists of Medicube,” Kim tells me — and it makes total sense considering the brand’s toner pads have become a cult staple among K-beauty obsessives and R29 staffers alike. “I love their toner pads and face masks, especially the collagen masks,” adds Kim.  For her, that reliability becomes essential when she’s travelling: “When I’m on the road, especially for snowboarding, where I’m in very dry climates, it’s all about moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.” We love <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/collagen-niacinamide-jelly-cream-pimprod2053650?sku=2645369"">Medicube’s Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream</a> for its glass skin-bestowing ingredients like collagen, squalane, and niacinamide.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On returning to her brunette roots</h2>



<p>While Kim might be known for her incredible hair today, the journey getting there wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. “Bleaching was rough for my hair, I’m not going to lie. I had to chop it when it was bleached, which was sad, but when I went back to brunette, I was able to grow it out, and I started caring more about my hair when I saw that it was growing back very healthy.” Kim says that it’s about having a consistent routine, but mainly, taking care of your scalp. “My scalp was always so oily and congested, and I would wash it all the time. And then that’s when I discovered Batiste dry shampoo,” she says. The <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/zen-matcha-light-dry-shampoo-pimprod2049243?sku=2633384"">Zen Matcha Light Dry Shampoo</a> buys you more time between washes — ideal if you’re as busy as Kim — thanks to oil-absorbing rice starch. It’s also packed with moisturizing glycerin and calming plant extracts to keep your scalp healthy and comfortable.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her Olympics hair routine</h2>



<p>Kim’s secret to excellent hair is practice — and then some. “Honestly, it’s like muscle memory at this point. I just know where to pull from,” she says of her accidentally perfect strands. “I will say when I sleep with heatless curls in, I get a really cute wave. So when I pull my strands out, they’re perfect.” To make the most of your beauty sleep, try <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/satin-heatless-curling-set-pimprod2031918?sku=2592934"">Kitsch’s Satin Heatless Curling Set</a>, which cuts down on frizz and breakage while delivering bouncy, defined ringlets.</p>



<p>Kim laughs as she thinks back to her early snowboarding days, when bigger always felt better. “I used to like [my waves] really thick,” she adds, “so I’d pull out a pretty big chunk, but then it started obstructing my vision when I was doing tricks, so I had to tone it back a bit.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>On her experimenting with beauty</h2>



<p>Looking back on her beauty routine throughout the years, Kim — whose signature look is a matte nude lip and feathered brows — says she’s switched things up so many times. “I got into makeup when I was young, and then hair came shortly after. I wanted to dye it all these crazy colors and do all of that fun stuff — I’m all about it. When I first started doing makeup, I always had to have eyeliner, usually a little wing. I also loved mascara and got into BB cushions too.” (One of her go-to’s is the <a href=""https://global.oliveyoung.com/product/detail?prdtNo=GA230518794"">Laneige Neo Cushion</a>, which packs hydrating properties and sheer coverage in a light-as-air formula].</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/december-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">December opens</a> a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></h2></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Pisces: 3 of Swords</h2></strong><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Aries: King of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></h2></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></h2></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Virgo: Judgement<br /></h2></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></h2></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></h2></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong><h2>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></h2></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946447.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /><figcaption>04 November 2025, Brandenburg, Biegen: The moon, which is about 99 percent visible and waxing, shines in the sky. On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>



<p>Even though things may seem grim before the Full Moon, the energy will give us the motivation to tap into the power within ourselves. This is an opportunity for us to make things better — especially for ourselves and those we care about.</p>

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>
