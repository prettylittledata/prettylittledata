<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943891.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/horoscope"">December opens with a spark</a>… and it’s not subtle. Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30th, and suddenly the collective mood shifts from Scorpio’s  shadowy introspection to something brighter, bolder, more curious, and admittedly  more chaotic. Venus in Sagittarius wants us to flirt with life again: say yes to adventure,  follow the spark, romanticize the journey, book the flight, flirt with the stranger at the café, and let our hearts stretch wider than our comfort zones. But the shadow side of Venus in Sag is real: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">burnout, overbooking ourselves</a>, saying yes to too many  invitations, and then remembering (sometimes too late) that we still live in human bodies with human limits. Water signs and Earth signs in particular may feel the social  pressure rising, so move with intention: joy doesn’t have to mean depletion. </p>



<p>The week also begins with the Moon in Aries, forming a fiery trine to Venus in Sagittarius. This combo is pure superhero energy for the collective: confidence, momentum, fresh starts, bold declarations, and an “I can do anything” vibe that’s both empowering and a little dangerous. Aries fire plus Sagittarius fire equals fast decisions, big feelings, impulsive confessions, and the urge to start ten new things at once. You should absolutely use the momentum, but remember that fire needs direction or it  becomes a wildfire. If you’re feeling scattered or overstimulated, breathe, center yourself, and slow down before you sprint. </p>



<p>From December 2nd to 3rd, the moon settles into Taurus, offering a stabilizing, grounding pause before the cosmic plot twist: the Gemini Full Moon strikes December 4th at 6:14 p.m. EST. This lunation is information-heavy, and could lead to breaking news, big reveals, sudden clarity, misunderstood texts, resurfaced conversations, and plot twists in communication. Geminis in your life may act differently this week, more  honest or more unfiltered. Because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury just ended its retrograde</a> (and is still  moving through its post-shadow), this full moon may bring echoes or loose ends from the retrograde cycle: the truth behind something you misread, the person who ghosted suddenly reappearing, unfinished conversations resurfacing. Flexibility is your best friend. Stay curious, not reactive. </p>



<p>And then, as if the cosmos knew we’d need a moment to process, the moon enters Cancer late on December 5th, softening the edges of all the stimulation. This Cancer Moon weekend invites us to retreat gently into ourselves: rest more, feel more, listen to our intuition more closely. After the fiery open to the week and the airy full moon peak, Cancer reminds us that integration happens in silence. This is the weekend to trust your inner tides, not the noise of the world. December wants momentum, but it wants  emotional wisdom, too. The question is: can you honor both? </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, start the week with a spark, not a sprint. The moon’s in your sign, harmonizing  with Venus, which has freshly entered Sagittarius. It’s giving “inspired momentum,” not  “burnout hustle.” You may feel the urge to dive headfirst into new ventures,  conversations, or crushes, but let your fire simmer rather than explode. Venus in  Sagittarius is lighting up your expansion and travel sector for the next few weeks, encouraging you to think bigger about love, passion, and creative collaborations — and to not settle for lukewarm. This is the kind of energy that asks: what would your life look like if you actually believed it could feel like an adventure? </p>



<p>By December 4th, the Full Moon in Gemini hits your communication sector, bringing a six-month story to a head. Think back to the ideas you had or seeds you planted around the Gemini New Moon in early June — what’s blossomed? What needs pruning? This lunation’s about reclaiming your voice, refining your message, and letting curiosity lead you closer to truth. If your opinions have changed, let them. If your truth  has evolved, speak it. Your identity is expanding, and so is your power to influence. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your planetary ruler Venus enters Sagittarius this week, activating your sector  of intimacy, shared resources, and transformation, and it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sugar-daddy-relationship-financial-benefits"">giving </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sugar-daddy-relationship-financial-benefits"">spiritual sugar daddy</a>, </em>but make it emotional alchemy. You’re being asked to trust more deeply, not just in  others, but in your ability to evolve through the unknown. The Aries Moon earlier this  week stirs your subconscious, surfacing long-lost dreams, old fears, and buried  passion projects that still deserve a seat at your table. Let those messages rise without judgment. This is a week to check in with yourself: have you been overgiving or underreceiving? </p>



<p>By the time the Full Moon in Gemini arrives on December 4th, your value systems, income streams, and confidence levels get a cosmic spotlight. You’re invited to  celebrate how far you’ve come since June while also being real about what needs  rebalancing. Financially, you might be tying up loose ends or finally getting a payoff. Emotionally, it’s about owning your worth and no longer letting guilt or comparison dim  your light. Say yes to aligned abundance, Taurus. And say no with your whole chest to anything that drains your joy. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to reintroduce yourself? This is <em>your </em>annual Full Moon week,  peaking December 4th, and it’s giving radiant reinvention, emotional release, and main  character spotlight. But before we get there, Venus slides into Sagittarius and lights up  your sector of relationships, partnerships, and soulmate contracts. People from your past may resurface, but so might visions of the kind of love, support, and collaboration you’ve long craved. The key? Don’t settle for half-hearted connections… not when the universe is offering you soul-deep mirrors. </p>



<p>With the moon shining brightly in your sign on the 4th, the spotlight is undeniably on you. This lunation wraps up a six-month cycle that began with the Gemini new moon in June, and it’s showing you just how much you’ve grown in your identity, your self expression, and your capacity to communicate your truth, even when it’s messy or uncertain. This is a week to reintroduce yourself, not because you’ve changed who you are, but because you’re finally ready to own who you’ve always been. Let your inner twins dance it out. People are watching and your life is accelerating in the direction of your brightest dreams. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/healed-too-much-self-work-romantic-relationships"">your healing era</a> has officially begun. Venus enters Sagittarius this week, activating your sector of wellness, rituals, and routines, and it’s reminding you that self care doesn’t have to be boring. Whether it’s journaling in your robe, a mid-morning dance break, or meal-prepping with incense and a playlist, you’re being encouraged to re-enchant your day-to-day. Love, pleasure, and creativity can all thrive when you feel  grounded and well-nourished. You may attract partners or collaborators who genuinely want to help you glow — don’t push them away out of pride. Venus in Sag invites you to loosen your grip on perfection and welcome a more easeful rhythm. And with Mercury no longer retrograde in your sector of health and service, it’s easier to set boundaries, ask for support, and find new systems that actually serve your peace. </p>



<p>But it’s the Gemini Full Moon on December 4th that tugs most deeply at your spirit. Lighting up your sector of closure, healing, and dreams, this lunation is a soul cleanse. Since the Gemini New Moon in June, you’ve been quietly shedding subconscious patterns that were never yours to carry… especially in your relationship to work, rest, and being needed. This is a powerful moment to retreat, unplug, and reflect. You’re ruled by the moon so you’ll likely feel this one viscerally. Let yourself cry, laugh, sleep,  scream, or do all four in one hour. Release with grace. There’s a version of you that’s  trying to emerge, and this full moon is clearing the path. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Venus has entered your fellow Fire sign of Sagittarius, lighting up your creativity,  romance, and joy sector like a sparkler on a summer’s night. After a period of deep  emotional excavations during Venus in Scorpio — perhaps tied to your home, family, or  even inner child wounds — you’re ready to remember that love can be playful, not just  profound. This transit reminds you that not every muse has to be a twin flame; sometimes the best art and affection comes from those who make you laugh. Your magnetism is magnetic (yes, we meant that twice), and your heart is craving  movement, beauty, and fresh flirtations. If love has felt like a to-do list lately, Venus in Sag is here to toss that list in the bonfire and dance with you instead. </p>



<p>Then comes the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th, activating your community and collaboration sector. It’s asking: who’s in your corner, really? You’ve been reflecting on the difference between friends and fans, between acquaintances and soul kin. This full moon brings clarity and possibly closure to a social chapter that began around the Gemini New Moon six months ago. Whether you’re stepping into leadership, launching a new project with friends, or letting go of social obligations that feel fake, trust the shifts. As a Fixed sign, change isn’t always comfy, but this one is necessary. Celebrate the connections that feel soul-deep and peacefully release the ones that are draining. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Venus in Sagittarius lights a fire in your home, roots, and emotional foundation sector this week, Virgo, and it might stir up some beautifully chaotic feelings in the process. You’re being asked to soften, to laugh more at the messiness of  life, and to stop trying to spreadsheet your healing. Whether it’s love blooming under your roof or creativity sparked through nesting, this transit is inviting you to romanticize your inner world again. After the intensity of Venus in Scorpio sharpening your thoughts and deepening conversations, now’s the time to tend to your space, physical, emotional, and energetic, with warmth and joy. Fall in love with your corner of the universe. </p>



<p>The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th hits your career and legacy sector, marking a  moment of recognition, realignment, or both. A goal you’ve been quietly working toward since June might now come to fruition, or you may realize that a certain  path no longer resonates. Either way, clarity is the gift of this lunation. As a Mercury-ruled sign, you’ll appreciate the full moon’s ability to illuminate what’s real and what’s not in your professional life. Just don’t get so caught up in  proving your worth that you forget you’re already worthy. This week, lead with grounded confidence, and let the results speak for themselves. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, your days are asking for devotion, not perfection. Venus, your planetary  ruler, has moved into Sagittarius and is lighting up your communication sector. That means love notes, passion projects, and big ideas are flowing with ease — especially when you stop overthinking and speak straight from your heart. This is a great time to pitch your work, submit that manuscript, or flirt your way through a meaningful DM exchange. Conversations feel more abundant, playful, and less stuck in their usual spirals. You’re still integrating the lessons from Venus in Scorpio, which asked you to get serious about your worth. Now it’s time to expand romantically, creatively, financially.  </p>



<p>Later in the week the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th activates your expansion zone and brings major clarity around your long-term vision. A seed you planted six months ago — maybe an online course, travel plan, spiritual practice, or even a shift in mindset — is now blooming in a way that surprises you. You’re being invited to believe in your future self, not just in theory, but through consistent rituals and courageous choices. Give yourself permission to dream again… The  world hasn’t seen all your magic yet. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, if it feels like a test, you’re probably passing. This week begins with Venus exiting your sign and entering Sagittarius, activating your finance and self-worth zone for the next four weeks. You may feel a sudden shift from  introspection to action, such as suddenly feeling ready to monetize your magic… or at least stop second-guessing it. Your relationship with money is transforming, and so is your sense of what you truly deserve. Opportunities to attract more (whether clients, resources, or love) are magnetized when you stay  rooted in your values. Even small wins like paying off a bill or receiving an unexpected gift are proof that you’re expanding. You’ve done the inner work. Let the outer abundance meet you halfway. </p>



<p>On the 4th, the Gemini Full Moon lands in your intimacy and transformation sector, helping you release old attachments or debts from the past six months, both emotional and energetic. A story that’s been unfolding since June is reaching its next chapter, especially in terms of trust, sex, or shared resources. This is deep water, but you’re a Scorpio: you were made for this. Swim through it — not alone, but with someone who’s shown they can hold your hand in the dark. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, are you ready for all eyes to be on you? Venus enters your sign this week and you’re on top of your game — socially, financially, and creatively. There’s a glow up happening, not just in how you look but how you love, but  how you attract abundance, and how you carry yourself through the world. This is your magnetic reset. Don’t be surprised if exes come knocking or new admirers start orbiting… you’re radiating warmth and people are taking note. Professionally, this is also a great time to pitch or relaunch something, especially if it involves personal branding. View yourself as both the muse and the mogul. </p>



<p>But underneath all this shine, the Gemini Full Moon on the 4th turns your  attention to your relationships. Whether romantic, platonic, or business-related, you’re seeing a dynamic more clearly now — maybe one that’s been foggy or undefined since June. You might decide to commit deeper, renegotiate terms, or lovingly let go. Either way, you’re craving real reciprocity. Are your connections mirroring your growth, or have you outgrown some dynamics you once clung to? Full moons can feel like emotional crescendos, and this one reminds you that the version of love you accept is also the version of love you believe you deserve. Choose yourself first, and watch the rest align. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the softer you become with your inner world, the stronger your outer world  gets. Venus enters your sector of solitude, healing, and closure this week, encouraging  you to unplug, reset, and nourish your body and spirit. This is a cosmic reminder that the richest creativity and wealth often arise in moments of rest, not hustle. If you’ve been moving at full speed recently, Venus in Sagittarius offers permission to pause and realign your routines with your deeper values. You’re allowed to take breaks. You’re allowed to do less and still be deeply worthy. Quiet luxuries like journaling in bed, saying no without explanation, and choosing pleasure over performance are your medicine now. </p>



<p>As the Gemini Full Moon peaks midweek, your sector of wellness, work, and daily structure is illuminated, revealing what needs to shift in how you manage your time and energy. Maybe you’ve been doing too much for too many, or maybe you’ve been stuck in patterns that drain you more than they serve you. This lunation helps you draw  clearer boundaries, especially now that Mercury is no longer retrograde. You can finally  see where you’ve been overextending and where life is inviting more ease. Let go of  the need to prove your worth through productivity. It’s time to reorganize your priorities so that they reflect your actual dreams… not just your obligations. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you finally ready to let the group chat know what you’re up to? Venus in  Sagittarius is activating your sector of social networks, friendships, and visibility for the  next four weeks, encouraging you to step out of hermit mode and into the mix. You may find yourself craving more authentic connection with people who reflect your values and dreams, especially the ones you’ve met online, across oceans, or through shared intellectual passions. If you’ve been holding off on launching a project, selling a digital product, or seeking support for a community-based idea, this is the green light you’ve been waiting for. Venus here brings charm, optimism, and abundance when you lead with joy and collaboration. Don’t underestimate the power of your presence; your  people are watching, rooting, and ready to support. </p>



<p>The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th lights up your sector of creative expression, romance, and inner child healing — and it’s a powerful moment to reclaim your right to play. What have you been quietly dreaming of creating, birthing, or sharing with the world since June’s new moon? This lunation wants to remind you that you are not too weird, too different, or too far ahead… you are <em>exactly </em>what’s needed. Pour yourself into your  poetry, your crushes, your late-night brainstorms. Even if it’s messy or unfinished or doesn’t “convert,” the process itself is sacred. Let art and flirtation become your medicine. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, it’s time to stop hiding your brilliance. Venus enters Sagittarius at the start of the week and lights up your career and legacy sector, helping you bring more magnetism, style, and abundance to your professional life. You may find yourself offered an opportunity that feels both expansive and slightly intimidating… trust that you’ve already done the inner work to be ready. People are noticing your gifts in rooms you don’t even know you’re in yet. Venus here softens your self-doubt and reminds you that grace, creativity, and intuition are your leadership superpowers. If you’ve been waiting to pitch an idea, publish something major, or relaunch your personal brand, do it now. It’s time to let your name be known. </p>



<p>Then on the 4th, the Gemini Full Moon peaks in your sector of home, ancestry, and emotional foundations, asking you to slow down and reflect on how much you’ve changed since June. This lunation might feel more sensitive than usual, not in a bad way, but in a way that encourages you to root deeper into what feels nourishing and real. Tears may come, memories may return, and your inner child may speak louder than usual. Let it all be data, be guidance, be sacred. It’s okay to want more safety, softness, and clarity at the same time as you reach for your goals. You’re allowed to  want it all Pisces, and with Saturn now direct in your sign for one final stretch, you’re getting closer. </p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: Black Friday is the biggest day of the year for can’t-miss deals.</p>



<p>With the big day finally here, it’s finally time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p>Last year, I decided I’d finally had enough of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/12/11823303/bob-haircut-trends-2025"">bob haircut</a>. Not in general — (have you seen how good it looks on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgIcc7D_an/?hl=en"">Julianne Hough?</a>) — just on me. While hairstylists insist it’s low-maintenance <em>and</em> easy to grow out, my experience was the opposite. Every morning, I’d smooth out the bumps that popped up overnight, but straightening them gave me more <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"">split ends</a> than I could shake a bottle of Dream Lengths at. And so began the long slog of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-grow-long-healthy-hair"">growing my hair long again</a>.</p>



<p>Thanks to a few clever hair-growth products (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/typebea-hair-growth-products-review"">shoutout to Typebea</a>), it didn’t take too long for my hair to reach Rapunzel-level lengths, but I hadn’t given any thought to the style I’d like once it got there. My first stop was Pinterest, of course, and as if the app knew exactly what I wanted, it served up a handful of long, swishy, and intentionally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">layered cuts</a>. I knew right away I had to take the photos to my hairstylist, <a href=""https://larrykinghair.com/products/steve-braithwaite?srsltid=AfmBOooaYEVmGAQYqYE6qNe8KC5C_WUVPWFzJs57Bgx24m7BJwqUDZ5b"">Steve Braithwaite</a>, at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/larrykinglondon/?hl=en"">Larry King</a> in London.</p>

<p>Braithwaite’s approach is collaborative — as all good haircuts should be. Before reaching for the scissors, he hit me with a bunch of important questions: Do I like a clean, blunt finish on the ends, or some separation? (I went with clean.) Do I want layers in the back as well as the front? (Yes, for extra volume, as a recent keratin treatment left my hair feeling flat.) Do I wear my hair up? (No, so the face-framing pieces could be as short and swishy as possible.)</p>



<p>“Let’s aim to bring the feathered vibe through the internal shape,” Braithwaite said, adding, “Not too many layers, but enough if you want a little volume — a touch of something messy and textured. It’s nice to have options.” For the face-framing layers, he wanted to make them “a bit more connected through the front,” so they “flow” into one another instead of looking disjointed or fluffy.</p>



<h2>What is the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945912.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945918.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Braithwaite started by sectioning my hair and cutting the layers at an angle to create a curve, so the first layer cupped my bottom lip, and the last ended at the center of my chest. When I took a closer look in the mirror, I noticed that those perfectly cut layers formed a soft “J” shape. If traditional layered cuts swish outward, the J-shape curves inward, gently cupping the face. It’s much looser than the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/c-shape-haircut-trend"">C-shape haircut</a> that recently took salons by storm — and lower-maintenance as a result. Of course, the J-shape cut has been dominating salons long before any of us gave it a playful name, but the visual cue certainly makes it easier to request (especially if your stylist likes to take creative license).</p>



<h2>How do you style the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Braithwaite removed as much moisture as possible by rough-drying with a blowdryer on medium heat, then used a medium barrel brush and the dryer to smooth everything out, curving the ends under (rather than outward) to create that effortless J-shape.</p>



<p>Styling this haircut at home is even easier with a hot brush. After rough-drying my hair to about 80% dry, I section it and use my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsmoothstyle-heated-comb-blow-dryer-brush%2F7591576"">Shark SmoothStyle Heated Comb &amp; Blow Dryer Brush</a> to smooth each piece under, creating that loose, face-framing shape. On days when I want to refresh the style, I reach for a flatiron — it’s just as good at curving each layer inward, especially when I’m in a rush. You might also like the <a href=""https://www.nordstrom.com/s/special-edition-airstrait-straightener-in-amber-silk/8482558"">Dyson Airstrait Straightener</a>, which takes hair from wet to dry quickly and easily. </p>



<p>Of course, heat protection is a must. I love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517767"">K18 HeatBounce Conditioning Heat Protectant</a>, which acts like a shield against high temperatures and leaves my thick hair feeling soft and manageable. </p>

<h2>How do you ask for the J-shape haircut?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945920.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945921.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Asking for the J-shape haircut is simple. Braithwaite suggests requesting “connected” layers throughout the lengths and back, with face-framing layers to finish that sweep toward the face. Thanks to the swishy finish, these layers look best when blow-dried straight and tend to suit medium to long hair. Layers like these are also a great way to take some of the weight out of thick hair like mine, but if TikTok is anything to go by, they work equally well on fine hair, as the feathering lends the illusion of volume and fullness.</p>



<p>I can safely say that the J-shape haircut is a compliment magnet. As Braithwaite finished up — working a bit of <a href=""https://www.selfridges.com/AE/en/product/larry-king-haircare-a-social-life-for-your-hair-cream-100ml_R04161273/"">A Social Life For Your Hair</a> cream through my roots and ends for extra polish — a few of the salon’s stylists came over to check out the final look and admire his handiwork. </p>



<p>Happily, I no longer dread styling my thick hair post-shower, and even if I wear it natural, I find that the relaxed J-shape layers work with my wavy texture rather than against it, giving my hair dimension and movement. It’s taken a few haircuts over the years, but with this one, I’m convinced I’ve found my forever style.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We’ve made it to month 12 of 12, cosmic beings, and it’s starting off with a whirlwind. The Gemini Full Moon on the 4th wants us to say everything, do everything, schedule five coffee dates, and buy twelve books we’ll only read three pages of. Gemini’s curious, chatty, and chaotic energy can be fun — or overwhelming — especially  because it’s ruled by Mercury in Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">still in its retroshade</a> until the first week of the  month. Translation? Be careful not to spill your tea before it’s fully steeped. You don’t have to post every realization. Mind your business <em>and </em>your bandwidth. It’s okay to love variety and still be discerning. Sometimes your mind just wants to spin… That doesn’t mean you have to follow it down every rabbit hole. </p>



<p>Then, something rare and quietly miraculous starts building: on December 10th, Neptune stations direct in Pisces, joining Saturn, who just did the same a few weeks prior. This is the <em>last time in our lifetimes </em>that both of these outer planets will be moving forward together in their shared home sign. Neptune is dreams and illusions. Saturn is structure and discipline. Together, they ask: what do you want to build, and is it real enough to last, but dreamy enough to still make you weep a little? This is spiritual architecture. Soul strategy, sacred boundaries. It’s rare to feel this mystical and grounded at once. You don’t have to “figure it out.” But you <em>do </em>have to listen, especially when the guidance comes through silence, or tears, or poetry. </p>



<p>One day later, on the 11th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mercury enters Sagittarius</a>, and things brighten. You’re encouraged to laugh again, to tell a story out loud, to say what you believe without over-explaining it. That playful Sag energy only intensifies as the sun and Mars continue moving through the sign all month, but on December 15th, Mars trades the fire for earth, entering Capricorn for a six-week stay. The vibe shifts: still motivated, still active, but more focused and grounded. And if you’re tempted to sprint toward the  finish line of the year, ask yourself why.  </p>



<p>2025 is a 9 year in numerology and we are in the Year of the Snake, and these both represent cycles of endings, surrender, and preparation. You don’t have to prove anything right now. Mars in Capricorn wants your <em>integrity</em>, not your overexertion. Ending the year strong might just mean getting enough sleep, finishing your personal projects, or walking away from what you know doesn’t align anymore. </p>



<p>The New Moon in Sagittarius arrives on December 19th, and it’s a beautiful reminder that even if this year didn’t unfold the way you expected, hope is still alive. Sagittarius teaches us how to zoom out. How to trust our own resilience. How to envision six months from now and still smile. The astro new year doesn’t begin until March 21st,  2026, so this is not a “wrap it all up” kind of month — it’s a <em>what could grow next </em>kind of moment.  </p>



<p>And when the Winter Solstice hits on December 21st, ushering in Capricorn Season, the energy pivots fully toward sustainability, maturity, and alignment. By the time Venus (Dec 24th) and Juno (Dec 29th) enter Capricorn too, many of us will be craving clarity in our relationships, our finances, our commitments. Not for control, but for peace. We want to <em>want what we’re building</em>. And that’s what the end of this year is really about. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, December begins with your voice returning: stronger, bolder, and maybe even  louder than you remember it. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your  communication sector with insight and closure. Conversations that have been circling for months may finally land. A pitch that sat in your notes app since June? Suddenly  sharp. A truth you’ve been avoiding? It wants out. But with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow until December 7th, pace yourself. Just because you <em>can </em>say something doesn’t mean you have to say it all at once. This is a great time to write, teach, or start recording that podcast you’ve been procrastinating on. But be mindful not to info-dump or overshare just because the mic is hot again. Full moons are  culminations — don’t forget to pause and see what’s already come full circle before rushing into more. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a quiet but cosmic transition is taking place behind the scenes: Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, who did the same just weeks prior, in your sector of solitude, endings, and deep spiritual healing. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two karmic giants will be moving forward together in this realm — the basement of your subconscious, the attic of your past lives. Neptune’s been here since 2011. Saturn since 2023. That’s over a decade of spiritual unlearning, grief  processing, and karmic re-patterning finally preparing to complete. If you’ve felt foggy, withdrawn, or like you’ve been carrying the weight of something ancient without knowing why… this is why. But now, the energy is shifting. The past is still there, but it’s behind you, not breathing down your neck. You may find yourself dreaming more vividly, forgiving more deeply, and craving more solitude before big decisions. Honor that pull inward, because in a few months, Neptune enters Aries, and you’ll begin a  whole new soul cycle. For now? Breathe. Reflect. You’re almost through the tunnel. </p>



<p>Then comes December 19th’s New Moon in Sagittarius, landing in your sector of  adventure, wisdom, and future planning. Suddenly, a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/solo-trip-maldives-luxury-destination"">new long-distance trip</a>, course of  study, or leap of faith starts calling your name. And you’re so close to saying yes. But  just four days earlier, Mars, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, launching a six-week  journey through your career and public life zone. That’s where the tension begins. This Sag new moon says <em>go wide</em>. Mars in Capricorn says <em>go deep</em>. One wants the bird’s eye view. The other wants the blueprint. You may feel pulled between freedom and responsibility, spontaneity and strategy, vision and execution. That’s okay. Don’t make it either/or. Let this be the season where you ask yourself: what’s worth building, and  what’s just distracting me from my real power?  </p>



<p>Capricorn Season kicks in on December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno joining the party, and you may feel a slow, steady pressure to be more structured, even if your Aries fire would rather blaze. This isn’t about restriction. It’s about <em>direction</em>. Don’t fight the focus. Let it guide your fire where it can actually <em>last</em>. </p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>December starts with a mirror held up to your self-worth. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-manage-your-money"">illuminates your money</a>, value systems, and energetic exchange. If you’ve been undercharging, over-giving, or stuck in a pattern of “I’ll receive after I prove myself,” this lunation cracks something open. It’s not just about finances, it’s about where your time, presence, and power have been leaking without you noticing.  Something from the last six months might culminate now: a contract wrapping, a debt paid off, or a realization that you’re finally done tolerating breadcrumbs. But with Mercury still in Scorpio (aka your relationship zone), keep communication grounded. You don’t have to perform your boundaries — just <em>honor </em>them. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, a subtler, long-range transformation is clicking into place. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your sector of community, long-term goals, and collective belonging. This is the <em>last time in your lifetime </em>these two planets will be conjunct and direct in Pisces, in your vision zone.  Neptune has been here since 2011, asking you to reimagine what friendship, leadership, and legacy could mean for you. Saturn joined in 2023, bringing structure to  what used to be only dreams. If you’ve felt disconnected from community or unsure of your purpose within a larger movement, clarity is coming — not as a blinding flash, but a quiet alignment. You may realize that a group, platform, or network no longer fits who you’ve become. Or you may feel yourself pulled to share something vulnerable with the right people. Let your people find you. But first, make space for them by clearing what’s expired. </p>



<p>The mood shifts again on December 19th, when the Sagittarius New Moon arrives in your intimacy and shared resources zone. This lunation is about energetic merging with another person, a purpose, a source of power that stretches beyond your ego. You may feel a surge of desire, a temptation to go deeper in a connection, or a hunger to be emotionally seen in ways you’ve been shielding.  </p>



<p>But don’t rush, because just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a six week chapter of expansion, risk, and long-term vision — and that could add tension between staying in control vs. surrendering to something bigger. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium in the skies reminds you to walk your talk. It’s not just about climbing — it’s about meaning. As the year closes, ask yourself: where do I feel brave enough to let go of control? And where am I ready to rebuild, slowly, with  devotion? Your next chapter doesn’t need to be rushed. But it <em>does </em>need to be real. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this month starts with your name in lights, but it’s the kind of spotlight that asks: <em>are you being seen for who you really are, or who you’ve been performing as? </em>The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands directly in your sign, closing out a six-month identity cycle and bringing your emotions to the surface in unexpected ways. You might be smiling at brunch but crying in the car. You might suddenly feel ready to  dye your hair, quit a gig, or tell someone the truth you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/confrontation-friendships-relationships-trust"">rehearsing in your head</a>. This lunation is emotional clarity wrapped in chaos. And with Mercury, your ruler, still in  Scorpio and moving through its post-retrograde shadow, you’re being asked to speak less from impulse, and more from embodied truth. You’ve changed. This full moon wants the real you to lead now. </p>



<p>What makes this emotional shift more potent is the subtle, oceanic current moving  beneath the surface. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn, both moving forward in your career, legacy, and public reputation zone. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>that these two planetary elders will move together, direct, in Pisces. Neptune’s been here since 2011, softening your ambitions, mystifying your path, and teaching you to lead with intuition, not ego. Saturn arrived in 2023 to put  scaffolding around your dreams. And now? You’re ready to step into your role — with  less hustle, more heart. You don’t need to have the five-year plan. You just need to trust the wisdom you’ve earned. Let yourself be visible <em>without </em>needing to perform. Let the right people come find you when you’re grounded in your message. </p>



<p>Then comes a rush of new energy: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your partnership zone, just four days after Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your intimacy and soul-merging zone for a six-week deep dive. Translation? Your love life, and your ability to share your energy, is going through a shift. If you’re in a relationship, you may crave more depth, more transparency, or more space. If you’re single, a connection could spark with someone who feels intense, but oddly familiar. And from December 21st onward, as Capricorn Season hits and Venus and Juno pile on, your relationships — romantic, financial, spiritual — become the mirror. Who are you when you’re <em>not </em>trying to impress anyone? What’s worth sharing, and what needs more boundaries? Let this be the month you return to your truth and let others meet you there. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, December begins like a dream you can’t quite remember but can’t fully shake.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th activates your sector of closure, healing, and  spiritual release, and suddenly, you’re ultra-sensitive to what’s <em>behind the scenes</em>. You may feel more tired than usual, more emotionally raw, more protective of your time and your nervous system. Old emotions surface through strange dreams, random  memories, or even a song that sends you spiraling. You don’t need to explain it. Just <em>feel it</em>. And then let it go. With Mercury still in Scorpio during the retroshade, this isn’t the time to spill all your secrets. It’s the time to check in with the parts of yourself that you’ve been emotionally ghosting. Forgive where you need to. Unfollow what you need to. You’re clearing spiritual clutter before stepping into something real. </p>



<p>And that something real? It starts to crystallize around December 10th, when Neptune stations direct in Pisces, just weeks after Saturn did the same. This is the <em>final direct  Neptune-Saturn pairing in Pisces in your lifetime </em>— and it’s all happening in the part of your life that governs faith, expansion, and your broader worldview. Since 2011, Neptune has been softening your belief systems, inviting you to trust something bigger than control. Saturn joined in 2023 to show you where that trust had to become a practice, not just a Pinterest quote. If you’ve felt spiritually disconnected or unsure of where you’re headed, this month brings grounding to your growth. You may feel called to deepen your studies, return to a forgotten spiritual practice, or even plan a trip that shifts your perspective. This is cosmic wisdom, not just wanderlust. Listen to what your soul has been trying to tell you all along. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the energy pivots fast. The New Moon in Sagittarius on December 19th lands in your sector of health, rituals, and daily rhythm, giving you a fresh start with how you care for your body and manage your mental load. You’re setting intentions around vitality — not perfection. But just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, igniting your relationship zone and kicking off six weeks of serious energy around your partnerships.  Translation? You’ll need to balance your own wellness with the demands of others. From December 21st onward, Capricorn Season — joined by Venus and Juno — deepens your desire for commitment, but also asks for boundaries. Don’t let someone else’s structure become your stress. You’re allowed to prioritize your peace without justifying it. This season teaches you that love isn’t just a feeling: it’s a daily decision to show up, <em>with </em>yourself and <em>for </em>yourself. And that, my friend, is what will make 2026 your thriving year. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, December starts with all eyes on you, but that doesn’t mean you have to say yes to every invite. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th floods your social sector, putting friendships, group dynamics, and future plans under a magnifying glass. You might be the one everyone wants at the party, or the one they call when things fall apart. But you’re also the one who needs to check in with your own capacity. Are you  showing up out of joy, or obligation? This lunation brings a culmination from the past six months: maybe a long-term goal starts showing signs of fruition, or a friendship quietly reaches its expiration point. And with Mercury still in Scorpio in retroshade, words carry weight. So before you commit to one more “collab” or group chat or invitation, ask: does this still light me up, or just drain me? </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, something deeper is shifting. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on  December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your most vulnerable, transformational zone. This is the last time in your life these two will move forward together in this part of your chart, and it’s a big deal. Since 2011, Neptune has asked you to surrender your tight grip on control when it comes to intimacy, trust, and merging — emotionally, sexually, or financially. Saturn came in 2023 to put some structure around all that soul work. And now, you’re beginning to feel the payoff. You’ve  grown. You’ve released. You’ve survived things you didn’t think you could name, let alone move through. This month might bring an invitation to go deeper with someone — or to go deeper with yourself. Either way, you’re not here for shallow exchanges anymore. If it’s not real, it’s not for you. </p>



<p>And then comes your reawakening: the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your pleasure zone. This is a cosmic green light for fun, creativity, love, and unapologetic joy. You might feel pulled to start a new artistic project, flirt more boldly, or reenter your soft era. But just a few days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, activating  your health, wellness, and daily routine zone for six weeks — and here’s where the tension sets in. One part of you wants to dance barefoot under the stars. The other part needs to clean your inbox and fix your posture. When Capricorn Season arrives on  December 21st, followed by Venus and Juno, your days may start filling up with tasks, obligations, or wellness goals. Don’t let the pressure to “optimize” steal your sparkle. Your joy <em>is </em>sacred work. So is your rest. Let December be both a celebration and a sacred recalibration. You’re allowed to shine on your own terms, and 2026 is the year you’ll do just that. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, December begins with a spotlight on you, and for once, you might not deflect it.  The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lands at the peak of your chart, illuminating your career, reputation, and long-term vision. Something you’ve been working toward  since summer may finally reach its moment of clarity or culmination. But this lunation is  less about the achievement and more about <em>how it feels</em>. Are you proud? Are you exhausted? Are you pretending to be fine because that’s easier than admitting you’re running on empty? With Mercury, your planetary ruler, still in Scorpio’s post-retrograde shadow, the energy is intense. But you’re being asked to name what success means to you <em>now</em>, not what it meant six months ago. You’ve changed. Your needs have changed. Let your definition of accomplishment evolve with you. </p>



<p>Beneath the surface, a more intimate reckoning is underway. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn in your relationship sector — both now moving forward together in this part of your life for the <em>last time in your lifetime</em>. Since 2011, Neptune has blurred the lines between you and others: between love and illusion, giving and over giving, merging and losing yourself. Saturn arrived in 2023 to draw  boundaries where there were none. Now, you’re integrating those lessons. You may be seeing a current or past relationship more clearly than ever — not because someone changed, but because <em>you </em>did. This isn’t about judgment. It’s about discernment. Who do you become in the presence of another? Where do you compromise your truth in the name of harmony? These are questions you’re finally ready to answer, and act on. Whether a partnership deepens or dissolves, the clarity will feel like relief. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th invites you back into your emotional roots — your home, your body, your past. It’s a chance to redefine safety and reclaim softness. Maybe you’re moving, renovating, or just finally clearing the emotional weight from your living space. You don’t have to do it all at once… just begin where your heart feels ready. But don’t get too cozy: Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, igniting your creativity, romance, and joy zone for six weeks. You’re being called to pour energy into something <em>you </em>love — not something others expect from you. From December 21st onward, the Capricorn stellium invites a passionate reset. Prioritize play. Take your  dreams seriously. Your inner child has been waiting for your attention — not your  perfection. Let December be a mix of softness and fire. Your tenderness is part of your power now, and that’s what’s going to make 2026 your best year yet. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this month kicks off with a zoomed-out, wide-angle lens on your life. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th lights up the part of your chart that rules your perspective  — your sense of meaning, belief, truth. Something clicks into place. Maybe a story you’ve been telling yourself reveals a deeper thread. Maybe you realize a chapter has closed, even if you never said it out loud. There could be literal travel or legal  paperwork involved, or a publishing opportunity that opens a door. But the deeper shift is internal: you’re not willing to pretend anymore. And with Mercury still in its post retrograde shadow, it’s wise to choose your words carefully. You don’t need to make a grand declaration… you just need to honor the version of you who’s growing out of old frameworks. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, something more embodied is quietly taking shape. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joining Saturn — both now moving forward in your sector of wellness, routines, and energetic boundaries. This is the <em>final time in your lifetime </em>these two will be direct together in Pisces. Since 2011, Neptune has been washing away your  illusions around perfection, service, and “fixing” things through busyness. Saturn came in 2023 to ground your rhythms. Now, it’s time to integrate. You may feel a call to simplify your schedule, recommit to your health, or finally stop performing balance and <em>actually </em>cultivate it. The healing won’t come from controlling everything, it will come from honoring what your body already knows. Ritual. Boundaries. Sleep. Water. Less noise. More breath. You don’t have to earn your rest. You just have to <em>choose </em>it. </p>



<p>Then comes a shift in momentum. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th lands in your communication sector, helping you reset your mindset, clarify your message, or start something that requires your voice. This is a powerful time for pitches, posts, writing projects, or simply reconnecting with curiosity. Say what you need to say. But keep it honest — and kind. Just four days earlier, Mars enters Capricorn, launching a  six-week activation of your home, family, and emotional roots.  </p>



<p>And from December 21st onward, Capricorn Season begins, followed by Venus and Juno stacking up in the same part of your sky. You’ll be asked to get more honest about your foundations: where you live, who you lean on, what “safety” means to you. Home isn’t always cozy. Sometimes it’s confronting. Let December show you where structure can liberate you — not trap you. You’re not seeking control, you’re seeking  peace. And you’re brave enough to build it as we enter 2026. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, you’re no stranger to transformation, but this month asks you to <em>release power struggles you didn’t realize you were still holding onto</em>. The Gemini Full Moon on  December 4th brings something hidden into full view, likely around money, sex, or trust. You may realize you’ve been overly dependent on someone else’s resources, or  you’ve been overly guarded around your own. This is the kind of lunation that makes you whisper “never again” and <em>mean it</em>. But it’s not about cutting people off — it’s about reclaiming the energy you’ve unconsciously leaked. If you’ve been stuck in a  loop around fear of loss, this moon might help you <em>choose liberation over control</em>. Pay  attention to what conversations come up around shared finances, inheritances, debt, or intimacy. The message? You don’t have to prove your power. Just live it. </p>



<p>Then comes a turning point that’s as subtle as it is seismic. Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th, joined by Saturn — both moving forward now in the part of your life that governs joy, play, and creative expression. This is the <em>last time </em>Neptune  will move direct in Pisces in your lifetime, and with Saturn in the mix, you’re being asked to take your joy seriously. Have you been romanticizing suffering? Avoiding your true desires? Over the past 14 years, Neptune’s been dissolving illusions around who you need to be to receive love, while Saturn’s been building boundaries that protect  your heart. This month, you’re invited to honor the creative muse within, whether through art, children, romance, or unapologetic fun. Pleasure is sacred. Don’t postpone it. </p>



<p>Mid-month, your energy gets grounded in practical magic. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th sets the stage for new beginnings in your money and self-worth zone.  This is your annual opportunity to rewire your relationship to earning, spending, and valuing your time. Ask yourself: what am I <em>really </em>worth? Then ask again. If you’ve been undercharging, overworking, or waiting for external validation, this lunation helps you  plant seeds for more aligned abundance. Four days earlier, Mars, your traditional ruler, enters Capricorn, kicking off a six-week period of laser-sharp focus in your communication and planning sector. You’ll end the month writing, speaking, negotiating, editing, and strategizing your way to the next level. Ascension season is here, and 2026 will be your most brilliant year yet.  </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your month, but before the confetti starts flying, the Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th throws a sharp spotlight on your one-on-one relationships. Is there harmony or imbalance in the way you show up for others — and the way they  show up for you? Someone may reveal their true intentions, or you might realize you’ve  been dimming your brilliance to keep the peace. This is a “define the relationship” moon, whether in romance, business, or collaboration. If things have been unsaid, now’s the time to say them. And if you’ve been waiting for a cosmic green light to walk away from something that no longer aligns? This moon hands you the keys and says “Drive.” </p>



<p>Mid-month, you might feel a quiet but deeply emotional shift as Neptune and Saturn station direct in Pisces, activating your home and roots sector. These two planets have been unearthing buried stories from your lineage, resurfacing generational patterns, and reminding you that “home” is more than a place, it’s a feeling. Neptune’s final months in Pisces mark the end of a 14-year chapter of dissolving illusions around family, safety, and belonging. If you’ve felt untethered or nostalgic, these feelings might peak before clarity finally arrives. With Saturn also moving forward, you’re ready to take grounded, mature steps to create a foundation that actually supports you. Don’t ignore the urge to nest, cry, write letters you don’t send, or create altars for your ancestors. It’s healing season, even in the middle of your birthday glow up. </p>



<p>Then comes your cosmic reset. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th is your personal New Year. It’s a rare chance to rewrite your story and step into a new level of self-actualization. If you’ve been feeling like you’ve outgrown your own skin, this lunation gives you the freedom to expand into your next evolution. Reintroduce yourself… not just to others, but to <em>yourself</em>. What would it look like to truly embody your purpose without apology? What would it feel like to no longer filter your light? Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, and a powerful stellium begins activating your money and value zone. Yes, you’re the main character, but the universe wants to make sure you’re paid like it, too. Just don’t burn out trying to be everything to everyone. This month is a masterclass in pacing, presence, and potency. Be bold, but be intentional, and most importantly, be ready for the expansive gifts 2026 has in store. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the month of December begins with a cosmic cleanse. The Gemini Full Moon on December 4th hits your sector of health, service, and routine, illuminating  what’s been neglected or overworked. This is the universe’s way of saying: check in before you check out. Have you been pushing yourself too hard without proper rest?  Have you fallen into habits that no longer serve the version of you you’re becoming?  Use this lunation to recalibrate. Small, consistent shifts now can lead to major upgrades later. If a job, task, or daily rhythm feels hollow, it may be time to release it. And if your body has been sending messages through fatigue or tension, this moon amplifies them so you <em>finally </em>listen. </p>



<p>The middle of the month ushers in a quiet but powerful frequency shift as Neptune and Saturn go direct in Pisces, your zone of communication and mental processing. It’s like waking up from a long dream and realizing what was fogged is now coming into view. You may have revelations about past conversations, family dynamics, or the way your inner voice talks to you. Saturn helps you get honest — even if it’s uncomfortable — while Neptune reawakens your poetic, visionary side. Writing, teaching, or sharing your  thoughts publicly could bring healing, not just for others, but for <em>you</em>. If you’ve been silencing yourself or doubting your voice, this month gives you the courage to speak from a deeper place. </p>



<p>Then, the magic begins. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th falls in your sector of surrender, dreams, and the unseen. This is your time to retreat and reset before your season begins. Rather than rushing ahead with big goals, pause. Reflect. What inner narratives need to be rewritten? What subconscious patterns are you ready to dissolve? Don’t underestimate the power of rest, ritual, and release. Around this time, Mars enters Capricorn, activating your identity and willpower. The final days of the year are a portal: you’ll feel your energy shift from introspection to embodiment. A whole new you is emerging, but first, give yourself permission to integrate all that you’ve learned. What’s done is done. What’s coming is yours. Step into 2026 with quiet confidence. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, December begins with a jolt of heart-centered electricity. The Gemini Full  Moon on December 4th lights up your sector of joy, flirtation, and self-expression.  Suddenly, your inner artist, romantic, or performer is wide awake. Something you’ve  been creating or dreaming about since the summer may come full circle now — especially in your love life or creative pursuits. If you’ve been craving connection or validation, this lunation reminds you that it starts with <em>you</em>. Write that poem, take that selfie, or plan that spontaneous date. But also: notice where your inner child might still be waiting for your attention. What if play was your medicine? </p>



<p>As the month deepens, so does your relationship with security. Saturn and Neptune shifting direct in Pisces in your income and values zone marks a turning point in your financial story. Neptune’s fog lifts, so you might get clarity on where you’ve been undercharging, overgiving, or chasing illusions. Meanwhile your ruler Saturn brings the blueprint. This is the last chapter of a long lesson in knowing your worth and building from it. You may revisit your budget or launch a new stream of income that’s both  spiritually aligned and materially grounding. Money isn’t just about survival anymore…  it’s becoming a reflection of your energy. </p>



<p>The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th brings a wave of visionary inspiration through your sector of networks and purpose. Who are you becoming, and who’s coming with you? Whether it’s launching a digital project, joining a mission-driven group, or redefining your circle of trust, this lunation is a portal into the future. You’re redefining what “community” means and attracting people who feel like soul fam, not just followers. Set intentions that stretch beyond borders; this moon is big-picture energy, and it’s got your name on it. </p>



<p>Then comes a whisper from the deep. Mars enters Capricorn just as the sun nears your shadow sector, initiating a six-week inward journey. The Capricorn stellium starting December 21st pulls your energy toward reflection, endings, and recalibration. This isn’t  about pushing through, it’s about moving <em>with </em>your inner tides. Some of your most important work this month will be done behind the scenes, in silence, or in dreamspace. Let go of what’s expired. Release guilt about needing more space. Your season is coming, Aquarius — and when it arrives, you’ll be crystal clear on what to  leave behind and what to boldly carry forward. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, December begins with a spotlight on your roots and emotional security. The  Gemini Full Moon on December 4th electrifies your home and family sector, bringing  buried feelings to the surface and illuminating patterns you’re ready to outgrow. You might feel more sensitive than usual to your environment, especially to the words,  rhythms, and energy exchanges within your household. Maybe you’re realizing how deeply your early upbringing shaped the way you express yourself or how you navigate relationships. This is a chance to rewrite the narrative. What would it look like to feel safe <em>and </em>free? To let yourself be both soft <em>and </em>sovereign? </p>



<p>Then comes the cosmic homecoming. Both Neptune and Saturn station direct in your sign, marking a massive turning point in your self-concept and spiritual evolution. Neptune’s been with you for 14 years, and this is the final chapter of an identity dissolving, soul-rebuilding era. Saturn joined in 2023, offering structure to all the sacred mess. If you’ve felt blurry, slowed down, or extra sensitive lately, their direct motion may feel like the fog lifting from your mirror. You’ll see yourself more clearly, name what  you’ve outgrown, and remember that boundaries don’t block love… they <em>channel </em>it. </p>



<p>In the second half of the month, the Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space — especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready for  your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed  I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re growing. </p>



<p>Mars enters Capricorn on December 15th, followed by a Capricorn stellium that  culminates at the solstice. This energizes your friendships, community, and long-term visions. You might feel pulled to collaborate, lead a group project, or finally launch something that’s been incubating all year. But beware of burnout… not every connection is meant to be kept. Stay rooted in your values as the invitations and DMs roll in. You’re not just building momentum this month — you’re building meaningful moments. </p>



<p>And then, a surge of support arrives. The Sagittarius New Moon on December 19th activates your visibility and career path. This is a powerful time to set goals related to your public image, long-term legacy, and leadership. Don’t be afraid to take up more space, especially if you’ve been waiting for the “perfect” time. The world is more ready  for your magic than you realize. Ask yourself: what dream would I pursue if I truly believed I was qualified? And if fear of being seen is rising — good. It means you’re  growing, and 2026 is the year where some of your deepest desires manifest with ease. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945890.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /><figcaption>Getty Images. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>From November 30th to December 24th, Venus is flirting and taking chances in Sagittarius. At this point, we are seeking pleasure and adventure. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Venus in Sagittarius</a> allows us to experience and explore the attributes of the Fire sign in a personal way, which includes honesty and directness. Plus, an optimistic outlook and approach to dating. We tend to give a lot of ourselves and bet on love. Nothing can hold us back!</p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Sagittarius might make us long to connect with others. Urging us to be adventurous and noncommittal, we are currently wanting to form connections and unions with others. The caveat is that when Venus aspects Saturn and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>, we might get caught up in the illusion or dream of another. Be cautious to recognize the red flags and trust your intuition. Saturn’s square to Venus will make us feel like we aren’t enough, which is why we have to do some internal healing to boost our confidence. Neptune’s fraught position to Venus makes us hazy and unsure of our motives, but pushes us down the rabbit hole when it comes to romantic matters.</p>



<p>Saturn’s presence could suggest a financial deficiency. Neptune’s moonwalk alongside Venus (until December 10th, when Neptune turns direct) means that we might be deceived or played with when it comes to money matters (even through <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/money-personalities-spending-habits-explained"">an investment opportunity</a>). Be cautious not to lend money to someone you know will be unlikely to repay it on time. Keep all the receipts from holiday shopping to check if anyone is making excessive charges on your credit card that require verification. Chances are that returns are made since you may be enticed to spend beyond your budget. The best way to handle this energy is to be in control and aware of the situation.</p>



<p>The good news is that our creativity will shine brightly in the weeks ahead. These planets are highlighting our artistic senses, giving us some insight and clarity into our emotions that we need to showcase to the world. Any ventures, even if they’re hobbies, will prove to be lucrative at this time, inspiring us to take our dreams to the next level. Perhaps opening an online shop to sell our services and objects could elevate our confidence as well as our wallets. As long as we believe in ourselves, it’ll happen. </p>



<p>On a personal level, we will be called to confront the real versions of ourselves. This means that we are letting people catch a glimpse of our hearts, passions, and authentic identities, which we’ve been hiding from the world for some time, and breaking out of self-imposed ruts. Venus in Sagittarius wants us to push through to the other side and heighten our successes. We shouldn’t hold ourselves back, nor should we let others do so. Giving people a peek into our souls is going to be the best way to create openness and to feel seen. Confronting ourselves and nature will help us grow and reveal the greatest versions of ourselves. </p>



<p>Venus in Sagittarius offers us a rare glimpse into what we want and need in partnerships. We are currently writing the script, so focusing on what resonates with us on a deep level is essential. Pay attention to how you treat yourself and try to give yourself more TLC. After all, it is the most crucial relationship that you’ll ever commit to.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945566.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I love the holiday season but used to dread the endless to-do list and copious shopping required — it weighed on me like a too-heavy ornament pulling down a Christmas tree branch. So, imagine my delight when I found that my favorite app for takeout, <strong>DoorDash</strong>, offers way more than good eats.</p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">I made this discovery last Halloween, when I set out in a panic to find my son a pumpkin-shaped basket for trick-or-treating. It was the day of, and all the stores were sold out. Same-day shipping wasn’t an option. Frustrated and stressed, I shifted my focus to lunch (a carb-heavy meal was needed to soothe my sorrows). I opened my <a href=""http://doordash.com/"">DoorDash</a> app and noticed a bunch of categories beyond food for the first time. I clicked on “Retail,” searched “Halloween Candy Basket,” and behold: exactly what I needed, available for delivery in under an hour. </p>



<p>And that’s how I discovered my gift-giving secret. Using DoorDash for gifts is alarmingly simple — not unlike the ease of ordering food. It works pretty much the same way. Search the product category you’re interested in (beauty, apparel, electronics, sports, etc) and voila, options abound! Most items arrive in less than an hour, great for those last-minute ladies. Just this week, mere hours before our arrival, I sent my crafty aunt a <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/29845282/search/cricut%20joy?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false""><strong>Cricut Machine</strong></a> from Michael’s as a thank-you for hosting Thanksgiving.</p>



<p>I’ll be using DoorDash on Black Friday to begin my holiday shopping, all from the comfort of my couch. From November 28 to December 24, hundreds of holiday favorites from retailers like Sephora, Best Buy, and Dick’s Sporting Goods are up to 30% off on DoorDash nationwide. I’ll be snagging <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/26060023/search/airpod%20pros?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">AirPod Pros</a></strong> for my husband from Best Buy. From Dick’s Sporting Goods I’ve got my eyes on a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/23887136/search/raskullz%20toddler%20helmet?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Raskullz Toddler helmet</a></strong> for my son and a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/23887136/search/stanley%20quencher?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stanley Quencher</a></strong> for my cardio-obsessed bestie.</p>

<p>My cart will be full of goodies from Sephora for all my upcoming White Elephant needs. I’m talking <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/biodance%20real%20deep%20mask?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Biodance Real Deep Mask</a> </strong>gift sets, <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/tarte%20mini%20tartlette?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tarte Mini Tartlette</a> </strong>mascaras and<a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/Tower%2028%20mini%20LipSoftie?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/Tower%2028%20mini%20LipSoftie?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 mini LipSoftie</a> </strong>lip treatments. And hey, I need to look my best this holiday season too, don’t I? A <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/24102893/search/dyson%20airwrap?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dyson Airwrap</a></strong> is my gift to myself.</p>



<p>I plan to send <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/35890445/search/matching%20pjs?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">matching PJs</a> </strong>from the Gap and <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/35890445/search/fuzzy%20slippers?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">fuzzy slippers</a> </strong>from American Eagle to some of the holiday-obsessed folks in my life. I’ve got my eyes on an Old Navy<a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/36558445/search/girls%20bomber%20jacket?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/36558445/search/girls%20bomber%20jacket?attr_src=search&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bomber jacket</a></strong> perfect for my 9-year-old niece. As for my four-legged niece, PetSmart has great finds, like this <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/convenience/store/1440375/search/pink%20candy%20cane%20dog%20blanket?attr_src=home&amp;disable_spell_check=false"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pink Candy Cane dog blanket</a></strong> from Merry &amp; Bright.</p>



<p>If it’s not already obvious, DoorDash has it all, which makes a <strong><a href=""https://www.doordash.com/consumer/gift-cards/?from_gift_store=true"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DoorDash gift card</a> </strong>a failproof gift idea. I’ll be stocking up on Black Friday when they are 15% off and 25% off exclusively for DashPash members.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11945568.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>For those unfamiliar, the DashPass subscription is only $9.99 per month and offers free delivery on many items and reduced service fees. As my go-to app for basically everything, DashPass was an obvious yes. </p>



<p>If you need another reason to join, from December 10 to December 12, DashPass members get 15% off gift cards at select favorites including Xbox, Roblox, Best Buy, Panera Bread, Ulta, Gap and more.</p>



<p>I can not stress enough how many times DoorDash has saved me. I’ve sent <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/store/sprinkles-cupcakes-manhattan-beach-24339072/17524546/""><strong>cupcakes from Sprinkles</strong></a> and <a href=""https://www.doordash.com/business/Levain-Bakery-19070/?CX_US_SE_SU_GO_ACQ_CUSXXX_13078187214_RSTRNT_%2BNB_ACQ_RESTR_IMMERCHANTXXX_EVG_CPAx_EPX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_DOOR_GO_SE_TXT_LXXXXXXXXX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=SEMu&amp;utm_campaign=CX_US_SE_SU_GO_ACQ_CUSXXX_13078187214_RSTRNT_%2BNB_ACQ_RESTR_IMMERCHANTXXX_EVG_CPAx_EPX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_DOOR_GO_SE_TXT_LXXXXXXXXX&amp;utm_term=doordash%20levain%20bakery&amp;utm_content=121857044043&amp;kclickid=_k_CjwKCAiAuIDJBhBoEiwAxhgyFm6EwbwY6NG_nPhocQzav_CqqqMnY6oiByWZyl3yVKas8n5XcNuvMRoCwNQQAvD_BwE_k_&amp;utm_adgroup_id=121857044043&amp;utm_creative_id=770585139540&amp;utm_keyword_id=aud-966867198856:kwd-1261700936846&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=13078187214&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADemgEvQt-y_wsUVPFiD4iSZUrPRS&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAuIDJBhBoEiwAxhgyFm6EwbwY6NG_nPhocQzav_CqqqMnY6oiByWZyl3yVKas8n5XcNuvMRoCwNQQAvD_BwE""><strong>cookies from Levain’s Bakery</strong></a><strong> </strong>as day-of birthday treats, and plan to do the same as holiday gifts for work associates.

<p>DoorDash has transformed Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday shopping all together from a source of anxiety to a welcome occasion. Happy Holidays, indeed. </p>

<p>I was warned about<em> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYcgQMxQwmk"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hamnet</a>. </em>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a crier and that I am easily susceptible to emotional manipulation; whether it’s a schmaltzy commercial with an intergenerational storyline or a corny Hallmark movie about the healing capacity of Christmas, I will weep. So, when it comes to a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/marvel-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-interview"">Chloe Zhao</a> directed, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/movies/hamnet-review.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">critically-lauded drama</a> about the loss of a child and art as a tool to cope with grief, people in my life knew that it would break me. And despite their disclaimers, it did.</p>



<p><em>Hamnet</em> unfolds slowly, telling the story of William Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/paul-mescal-normal-people-season-two"">Paul Mescal</a>) and his wife Anne Hathaway, or Agnes Shakespeare (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/jessie-buckley-lost-daughter-interview"">Jessie Buckley</a>) as she’s known in this adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s book <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/books/review/hamnet-maggie-ofarrell.html""><em>Hamnet: A Novel of the Plague</em></a>, as they fall in love and have three children including their son, Hamnet. The names Hamnet and Hamlet were often used interchangeably back then and this is O’Farrell’s interpretation of what led to Shakespeare’s masterpiece. </p>



<p>In the first half, <em>Hamnet</em> is about the tender beginnings of a relationship and the complexity of marriage. It’s about a free spirit and a neurotic writer navigating their different desires and a long-distance relationship. There are sly nods to Shakespeare’s most famous work, like the fact that William and Agnes are star-crossed lovers as he presumably scribbles down<em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/11/127977/romeo-and-juliet-movie-what-is-true-love""> Romeo &amp; Juliet</a> </em>by candlelight or that William’s relationship with his dad proves Shakespeare’s daddy issues were in full effect. The subtlety stops there. The second half of <em>Hamnet </em>is unflinching, a devastating portrait of the grief that accompanies unconditional love. At certain moments, <em>Hamnet</em> made me angry; I was begging for a break from the onslaught of emotional tyranny it was reigning over its audience. At others, I was grateful for its vulnerability and unabashed sentimentality. If Zhao and co. were manipulating me into crying so hard I had a headache for hours after the credits rolled, it worked. Anything that succeeds in eliciting that much emotion and draws out these extraordinary performances from two of the best actors of their generation is, to me, a triumph.  </p>



<p>When I speak to Mescal and Buckley over Zoom, they’re a lot gigglier than you may expect considering both are known for playing roles that rip your heart out and give your tear ducts a workout. They are thoughtful, polite, and playfully rib each other with the ease of old friends. Below, the Irish actors talk about the emotional weight of <em>Hamnet</em>, the first movies that made them cry, and gush about their co-star to the hilarious discomfort of the other. </p>







<p><strong>Refinery29:</strong> <strong>I’m sure you’ve gotten this a lot today but this movie fucked me <em>up</em></strong><strong>. I was sobbing hysterically by the end. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal: </strong><em>[Both laugh].</em></p>



<p><strong>I feel like people need a disclaimer that they are going to cry a lot. Can you just give a warning or any advice on how to prepare for the emotional experience of watching this film? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Jessie Buckley: </strong>To feel is quite scary. To feel at all is scary. I think we try to control what that is in our lives and in some ways, there’s so much catharsis to connect again to the epicness of just being alive. And this film is so full of love. It’s so full of the courage to love fully and to live fully, and to lose. And anytime you choose to love, you also choose to potentially lose. You’re risking to lose somebody in your life. But I think there’s a lot of catharsis and hope and healing in this film, and you’re not on your own. There’s going to be somebody beside you who’s going to have a tissue, and they’re going to give it to you, and you’re going to have a big chat and a hug afterwards and you’re going to think<em> that was great.</em></p>



<p><strong>Paul Mescal:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>Okay, that was great! </p>

<p><strong>JB:<em> </em></strong><em>[laughs] </em>That wasn’t my experience. I locked myself in a toilet for half an hour afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, I needed to decompress! Do either of you remember the first movie that made you cry or made you feel like this film does? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yes,<strong> </strong><em><a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-35142c55-bb03-459c-8646-302379fb29b6"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Darby O’Gill and the Little People </a></em>[1959]<em>. </em>Because there was a banshee and I thought that was the most terrifying thing in the whole wide world. I was inconsolable. Have you seen it? I mean, it’s not a huge hitter, it’s quite niche.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>What’s it called again? </p>



<p><strong>JB:  </strong><em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That’s not a real movie.</p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> It is a movie! </p>

<p><strong>Paul, what’s the first movie that made you cry? </strong></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>He’s going to say something profound. </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>No, Tír na nÓg [<em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ETqGhF61A"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Into The West</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ETqGhF61A"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, 1992</a>]. </p>

<p><strong>JB and PM</strong><em> [in unison]</em>: The potato and the horse! </p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong>Yeah, that made me cry.</p>

<p><strong>Well, you both made <em>me</em></strong><strong> cry. But the movie doesn’t work without your chemistry. William and Agnes are two big characters to embody and you both did so beautifully. I want to give you a moment to look at each other and gush about working with each other and what makes each other so great. </strong></p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> Jessie is just [<em>laughs</em>] — This is not just a performance of the year, this is a performance, and I’ve said this before, but this is going to be studied in drama schools. Actors around the world, if you want to see what great acting is, not only just watch <em>Hamnet</em>, watch anything that Jessie has ever been in, and you’d be well fed. And that’s all the time we have for today! [<em>laughs</em>] </p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No <em>[laughs]</em>. I feel like I’ve met somebody so significant and giant in my life in working with Paul on this. Firstly, he is absolutely… No, firstly, he has the most…  </p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> <em>[laughs] </em>Firstly, <em>Darby O’Gill and the Little People. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong><em>[laughs] </em>No, no! He has such a gigantic human heart, and he’s such a team player. He holds the biggest parts of you. He can drink a case of you, and not many people can, especially co-leads. Not many people can just, with absolute care and courage, help you to tell the story. I mean this with so much sincerity and belief: he is a movie star, and he wears it — </p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong><em>[nervous, uncomfortable laughter] </em></p>



<p><strong>JB:</strong> No, you are! You just are. It’s true for you, and that’s because you have this capacity of being a giant. You are a giant person.</p>



<p><strong>PM:</strong> I am of average height <em>[laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>JB: </strong> <em>[laughs]</em> No, your heart is gigantic. It’s no coincidence that he’s going from playing William Shakespeare to <a href=""https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/paul-mescal-on-taking-on-shakespeare-in-hamnet-and-paul-mccartney-in-beatles-biopic"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney,</a> and being a gladiator. Not many people can manage that, and he can, and that’s because of who he is as a man.</p>



<p><strong>PM: </strong>That was lovely. </p>

<p>If minimalist nail art is more your thing, then <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mydumbnails/"">Wendy’s</a> pared-back take on festive nails will certainly appeal. There’s still glitz in the form of 3D pearls and golden rhinestones, and the petite dots of color really pop against a sheer, milky base color.
