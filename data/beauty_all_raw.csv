Jewelry is so much more than adornment. For some, nameplate bamboo earrings are a way to express identity and cultural pride. For others, an intricate gold-and-ruby ring serves as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10636309/jewerly-family-heirlooms-stories-second-generation"">family heirloom</a>, passed down to the eldest daughter across generations. For some, a beaded gemstone bracelet is a gift of protection, a talisman that preserves history, spirituality, and love.

I’ve always been a lover girl, so creating something that helps people express care, connection, and emotion feels so fulfilling.” For instance, wearing Esperanza, a stainless-steel heart locket filled with preserved flower petals, is a beautiful way to hold and celebrate your loves.<br /><br /><strong>Greene is Gold</strong> Greene is Gold's Esperanza Heart Locket Necklace, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.greeneisgold.com%2Fproduct-page%2Fesperanza-2"">Greene is Gold</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1102"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937053.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1668&amp;height=1102&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=834:551"" width=""1668"" /><figcaption><strong>Luni</strong><br /><br />Lorenia Henriquez’s jewelry brand <a href=""https://luni.style/"">Luni</a> is a modern expression of magic and heritage.

What began as a brand selling trendy fashion jewelry has evolved into a label creating affordable, high-quality, tarnish-resistant pieces designed for everyday wear and self-expression. The brand’s mission is to “inspire other dreamers and women to do everything they set their minds to” — all while looking and feeling great. I’m currently obsessed with the Alma Marina Shell Ring, an 18k gold-filled piece featuring a sculpted seashell centerpiece.<br /><br /><strong>GabulousLA</strong> GabulousLA's Alma Marina Shell Ring, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgabulousla.com%2Fproducts%2Falma-marina-shell-ring"">GabulousLA</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1208"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948902.png?auto=webp&amp;width=952&amp;height=1208&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=119:151"" width=""952"" /><figcaption><strong>Paula Mendoza<br /></strong><br />Colombian jewelry designer <a href=""https://paulamendoza.com/"">Paula Mendoza</a> launched her eponymous line in 2003, when she opened her first atelier in Bogotá.

Each year, Celeste Sol donates 2% of its sales to organizations that uplift and empower women and girls. So you can look good and feel good rocking your zodiac nameplate necklace.

Warm blanket: Check. Fluffy slippers: Check. Hot chocolate with marshmallows: Check. Enter: Hotel Chocolat’s All New Velvetiser. Nothing makes me happier in winter than a hot drink, especially if it’s sweet! The Velvetiser is so easy to use, quick to make and you can use it in the summer months too as it also makes chocolate milkshakes. But for now, I’m sipping on mint hot chocolates like there’s no tomorrow. <br /><br /><strong>Hotel Chocolat</strong> Hotel Chocolat All New Velvetiser, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.hotelchocolat.com%2Fproducts%2Fall-new-velvetiser-intro-pack"">Hotel Chocolat</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1104"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946901.png?auto=webp&amp;width=912&amp;height=1104&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=19:23"" width=""912"" /><figcaption>Let the hosting season commence! Hosting can be expensive, but it’s also such a joyful way to see loved ones over the holiday season. I’ve already started (because why not?), and my new crisp white Rebecca Udall linen table cloth is simply my new favourite thing. Made from heritage mill in Europe, it’s going to be a table staple for a long time to come. Has red wine already spilled on it? Yes. Did it come out?

Her latest book, <em>The Stolen Crown</em>, pokes holes in everything we thought we knew about Queen Elizabeth I’s succession — the chain of events that led to James VI of Scotland (son of Mary, Queen of Scots, whom Elizabeth’s advisors famously executed for treason — oh, the drama!) taking the throne and ushering in the turbulent Jacobean era.

I’m <em>obsessed</em> with this roller. It’s dual-ended, so one side sculpts while the other smooths and de-puffs, and it genuinely makes a difference.<br /><br />My favorite part?

<p>If I lost <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">my makeup bag</a> today, the first thing I’d replace would be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"">my mascara</a>. Even a single slick makes me feel awake and ready to take on the day. It’s why my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">R29 Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a> always includes one. In 2024, it was the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvoluminous-panorama-washable-mascara-pimprod2042577%3Fsku%3D2617241"">L’Oréal Paris Panorama Mascara</a>, and while I won’t reveal this year’s winner just yet, you can bet it’s even better. But my favorite skincare brand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us"">The Ordinary</a>, might have just convinced me to quit mascara altogether thanks to its latest launch: the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a>.</p>



<h2>What does The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher do, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher</a> is a clear, waterless gel designed to coat every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners, lifting and holding your curl for longer. If your lashes tend to fall flat after curling, think of this as invisible scaffolding. Not only does it help to keep your curl in place, but it also gives lashes a natural, glossy finish, like you’re wearing mascara — all without smudges or flakes.</p>



<p>A handful of clever ingredients make it all work. Without getting too technical, you’ll find non-irritating polymers — or film formers — like butylene, ethylene, and dimethicone copolymers, all approved for use around the eyes. They help the gel cling to lashes, provide all-day support for curls, and keep lashes flexible and comfortable, rather than brittle or caked in product. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948337.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lash Curl Finisher, $9.90</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948127.jpg?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Beyond the film formers, you’ll also spot ingredients that have become staples in your skincare routine. Squalane softens and conditions lash hairs and the surrounding skin, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-glycerin"">while glycerin</a> deeply moisturizes. Though the main effect is cosmetic, mimicking the effects of an expensive <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-lash-lift-review"">lash lift</a> or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-exaggereyes-mascara-review"">luxury mascara</a>, it also doubles as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/12/11243440/keratin-lash-lift-tint-review"">lash treatment</a>.</p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, and is it any good?</h2>



<p>I use the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Flash-curl-finisher-100732.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lash Curl Finisher</a> just like mascara. First, I curl my lashes with my trusty <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyelash-curler-P244437"">Shiseido Eyelash Curler</a> (an imperative step, according to The Ordinary), then I apply it in coats. But make no mistake: this isn’t like the clear mascaras of the ’00s that did nothing but make lashes feel rock hard. This actually makes them look thicker thanks to the lustrous sheen it leaves behind. It’s not quite a wet look, but it’s not invisible, either. If you touch your lashes, they feel slightly tacky before drying — and it’s this texture that keeps them upright, like your curled lashes are preserved (in a gentle way). </p>



<p>You might’ve seen the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">Vaseline lash lift hack</a> on TikTok, where people use petroleum jelly instead of mascara for a no-makeup lash look. <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@jacquelinekilikita/video/7094220545536953606?lang"">I’ve tried it myself</a>, and it works well, but because Vaseline is so soft, it keeps lashes almost wet. The Ordinary’s Lash Curl Finisher, on the other hand, dries down, making it more transfer-proof than petroleum jelly.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11948339.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>

<p>The curved brush also makes it easier to capture each lash, and I’m convinced that both the shape and thickness of the wand give my curls an extra boost, keeping them perky. Honestly, a couple of coats of this is infinitely better at thickening my lashes than a single coat of mascara. Of course, I have dark lashes, so I’m not exactly certain how it would perform on blondes or redheads, but the product does make them appear darker — like I’m wearing black mascara.</p>



<p>My lashes stay curled — with a very slight drop, as is natural — until I remove the product at the end of the day. I just use a cleansing balm, but micellar water or a foaming cleanser works just as well, since the product doesn’t need much effort to dissolve — nothing like the scrubbing mascara can require. </p>



<p>While The Ordinary doesn’t specifically recommend this use, I run the wand through my brows, too, and it works just as brilliantly as a brow gel, keeping my thick hairs perfectly in place.</p>

<p>I have a confession to make. And it’s the kind I can only say now, in my thirties, after <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/motherhood-experiences"">having a child</a> and after finding and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latinas-redefining-marriage-traditions"">marrying</a> an incredible man: I love my husband. I love our life. And I love our daughter. But if we ever divorced, I would never get married again.</p>



<p>It’s not because marriage has failed me. Javy and I met during the middle of the pandemic (remember 2020?) on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">Latino dating app Chispa</a>, and we’ve been attached ever since. We dated for six months before moving in together, and we got married in Las Vegas in 2023, when I was already three months pregnant. He’s a great partner and father. He works two full-time jobs, and still teaches our daughter how to count in Spanish and helps out during bath time. It truly feels like I’ve found a diamond in the rough. </p>



<p>But five years later, I now understand what the real <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/this-is-the-surprising-cost-of-being-in-a-relationship"">cost of partnership</a> looks like and what marriage asks for. And if I ever had to rebuild my life from scratch, I simply would not hand all of that over to someone else again.</p>



<p>Marriage, even the good kind, demands things from women that it doesn’t equally demand from men. No, I don’t mean the often-physical labor of keeping a house or raising a family, though, according to the <a href=""https://thegepi.org/the-free-time-gender-gap/"">Gender Equity Policy Institute</a>, heterosexual women perform twice the amount of childcare and household work as their male counterparts<em>. </em>But for many women, that can be the tip of the invisible labor iceberg: How you plan your day with someone else’s schedule factored in and how you approach bills and major life decisions — it all changes with another autonomous person’s thoughts, hopes, and limitations thrown into the mix. <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/staying-sane-inside-insanity/202204/is-marriage-a-bad-deal-for-women?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Psychology Today</a> revealed that women end marriages not only because of abuse or infidelity, but also because “the relationship is no longer worth the sacrifices required of them.” Turns out, the emotional labor, lack of empathy from partners, and unequal effort are just some of the reasons many women walk away.<em> </em></p>



<p>Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally. For generations, women have swallowed our needs, softened our ambitions, and built our identities around care: care for our partners, our home, our children, and everyone else before us. And for Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”<em> </em>isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would. And it’s not because we’re weak but rather because the world still subconsciously expects it, praises it, and labels anything less as selfish.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Historically, marriage has been an institution built on women’s sacrifice, emotionally, socially, and even legally.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I went into marriage thinking I understood partnership, but once the cake was eaten and the honeymoon was over, I realized how much of my life had become work to keep <em>our lives</em> functioning. The calendar-keeping, the appointments, the remembering, the meal-planning, and the million invisible decisions that keep a household running — it all fell on me by default. I carried it convincing myself it was normal and every partnership goes through this. And part of that came from my culture. I married a loving, devoted Latino man who was raised in a world where men are applauded for “helping.” And I’m a Latina raised with the same script: be strong, but also be accommodating. Build a life, but also carry everyone else’s.</p>



<p>This isn’t how things are for us anymore. Eventually, we talked it over and agreed that we’re not continuing that cycle. Not in our marriage and not for our daughter. And slowly, things shifted. Not perfectly, but intentionally. Today, he carries his share of both the parenting and day-to-day responsibilities.</p>



<p>“Marriage isn’t always 50/50,” <a href=""https://www.waytoknowthyself.com"">Stella Barrutia, LCSW,</a> a Licensed Clinical Social Worker based in Chicago, tells Refinery29 Somos. “Some days, it’s 80/20. Other days, it’s 20/80. When the foundation is truly love and respect, the balance will always realign. The challenge is that many women are taught, implicitly or explicitly, that once they’re married, they must continue doing everything for themselves — and now also for their husbands and children.”</p>



<p>Barrutia, whose work is bicultural and includes a focus on Latine experiences, added that “honest conversations about partnership, roles, ambitions, and expectations are absolutely essential” when it comes to choosing a life partner. In other words, the day-to-day setup of marriage and partnership can be imperfect while the relationship itself is deeply loving. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For Latinas, in particular, who were often raised in cultures where love is shown through service, where “familia primero”isn’t a suggestion but a moral code, it’s frighteningly easy to slip into roles our mothers and grandmothers carried, even when we swore we never would.”</p><cite>Paulina Roe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>My critique is of the structure, not with the man I chose. Javy is a great partner and a great father, and I’m so grateful for him. He fully supports my career and business, cares for our family to make sure we never go without, and shows up when life gets heavy. He brings steadiness into our lives. Just last week, after a 24-hour shift at the firehouse, he walked in, took our baby out of her crib when she woke up at 7 a.m., and fed her breakfast, did the whole routine, and let me sleep without ever making it seem like a favor.</p>



<p>But marriage as an institution? It’s complicated and, based on current trends, is becoming outdated.</p>



<p>Here’s the reality: Americans are <a href=""https://usafacts.org/articles/state-relationships-marriages-and-living-alone-us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">getting married way less</a> and much later than previous generations. The marriage rate in the U.S. has dropped by more than 50% since the early 1900s, and only about 1 in 5 people in their mid-20s today has ever been married, the lowest level ever recorded. People of all genders aren’t rushing down the aisle anymore, and instead are taking their time, building careers, and figuring out who they are before they sign up for that kind of commitment.</p>



<p>And the myth that marriage is the only path to stability? Well, that’s gone, too. Latinas, and women in general, are now earning <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/15/how-latinas-educational-and-economic-situation-has-changed-in-the-last-two-decades/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">more college degrees</a> than men, and we’re showing up in spaces our mothers and abuelas could only dream about. Financial independence has shifted the power dynamic, too. And to add to that, women are delaying motherhood (I had my first baby at 31), choosing different family structures, and rejecting the idea that being a wife or a mother has to define your entire identity. </p>



<p>Many of us grew up watching our mothers carry the emotional load, the childcare, the cooking, everything — and now we’re refusing to recreate what drained the women before us.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs. So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.”</p><cite>Stella Barrutia, LCSW</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Many women — and especially Latinas — grew up watching generations of women carry their marriages on their backs,” Barrutia notes. “So even when they’re ambitious, educated, and financially independent, there’s a learned fear that marriage will shrink them. They’re afraid that choosing partnership means choosing limitations. That’s not because women are unsure of themselves; it’s because the institution still carries expectations rooted in another era.” </p>



<p>Barrutia continues: “When women ask, ‘Can I be ambitious and married?’ they’re really asking, ‘Is there room for all of me here? Healthy partnership answers that with a yes. But culturally, many haven’t seen that model reflected back to them.”</p>



<p>True, these ambitions can feel a little less isolating when you have a partner cheering you on. Javy supports my dreams in the ways that actually matter. When work gets intense, he picks up what I can’t. When I’m building <a href=""http://themamicollective.com"">The Mami Collective,</a> he steps in with childcare, dinner, and whatever else needs to be done. He asks how he can help before I say I’m overwhelmed. He celebrates my wins with me. He makes space for my goals. And, most importantly, he shares the invisible load so it’s not all on me. Because that’s partnership: not perfect, not 50/50, just two people choosing to show up for each other.</p>



<p>Yet, even still, it often feels like the contours of marriage are constrained by outdated and ever-present expectations. </p>



<p>When writer Chanté Joseph posed the question <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/is-having-a-boyfriend-embarrassing-now"">“Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?” </a>for <em>Vogue</em> in October, I noticed something interesting in the Instagram comments and the surrounding discourse. By and large, respondents echoed the same sentiment: I love my partner, but sometimes I fantasize about the freedom I’d have if I didn’t have to factor someone else into every corner of my life. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Not because we want our partners gone, but because we want ourselves back. We miss the unshared version of ourselves — the woman who had her own schedule, her own thoughts, her own orbit. Wanting that again isn’t selfish. It’s a sign you’re still in touch with who you are. That’s the difference.</p>



<p>So when I say I wouldn’t get married again, I’m not saying that I’m rushing to divorce my husband. In fact, when I told him I wouldn’t get married again, he didn’t spiral. He lifted his eyebrows and said, “Honestly? I get it.” We’ve talked about how marriage hits differently for women and how the mental load and expectations pile up even in the healthiest partnerships. He knows I love him; he also knows the institution asks more of me than it ever will of him. His reaction wasn’t defensive. It was honest, a little uncomfortable, and very, “Yeah, you’re not wrong.”</p>



<p>I’m not married because of fear, tradition, or cultural pressure. I’m in it because I choose to be. Because this specific partnership works for me. Because the love and respect are mutual and because my husband makes the sacrifices with me, not just for him.</p>



<p>But if the water were to rise and hell were to freeze over, I wouldn’t do it over again. Not the white dress, not the bridal shower, not the honeymoon. I’m not interested in further contributing to a narrative in which a Latina’s value is tied to having a partner. I’ve worked my butt off to build my life, career, and identity. I don’t need to rebuild it all over again.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough.”</p><cite>PAULINA ROE</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This clarity can be powerful. It helps me show up intentionally in my marriage today — not because I fear divorce, but because I understand what marriage takes from the both of us. A good marriage takes honest conversations about the hard things, even when they’re uncomfortable. And it takes partners choosing effort and accountability on purpose, because the relationship deserves it.</p>



<p>My marriage is one of the most beautiful parts of my life, but it also taught me exactly how much of myself it takes to build a partnership that works. If I ever had to rebuild again, I’d do it as me: Paulina Roe. Because that’s enough. I’d want to keep the version of me that survived. The woman who rebuilt her identity not as a wife or mother, but as herself.</p>



<p>On <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8UrKksq/"">TikTok</a>, many women have expressed feeling similarly. “I love my husband, but marriage still asks more of me than it does of him,” Diana Lopez, a 34-year-old Mexican-American mother of two based in Chicago, said. “I don’t want out, I just want room to breathe, to grow, and to still be my own person. Wanting yourself back isn’t a threat to your relationship — it’s a sign you’re finally paying attention to what you need.”</p>



<p>And why is that? Because we’re finally being honest about the price of partnership, even when it’s good.</p>



<p>And we’re asking ourselves: If I ever had to pay that price again, would I?<br /><br /></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, how are you feeling after that epic <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-super-cold-moon-in-gemini-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">final full moon</a> of the year? You might still be processing all the mental breakthroughs, communication revelations, and identity shifts last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-super-cold-moon-in-gemini-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Gemini Full Moon</a> brought up. As we enter this week, the energy shifts dramatically. Starting Monday, the moon enters Leo, and suddenly we’re revved up and ready to go. This fiery lunar transit wants us confident, creative, and taking action on everything we just learned about ourselves. The Leo energy is basically the universe saying “okay, you had your revelations, now let’s DO something  about them,” which feels empowering after days of emotional and mental processing. </p>



<p>Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th at 7:23 A.M. EST, marking the final time this planet will be retrograde in Pisces in our lifetime. If everything’s felt foggy, confusing, or like you’re living in a rom-com where you can’t tell fantasy from reality for the past five months, Neptune retrograde is why. The planet of dreams and collective  consciousness has been reviewing lessons since July, forcing us to distinguish between what’s real and what’s wishful thinking in our lives. When Neptune shifts direct, that fog starts lifting.  </p>



<p>On a collective level, this final Neptune in Pisces chapter (since 2011!) means we’re  wrapping up a 14-year cycle of learning to balance spirituality with reality, creativity with practicality, and compassion with boundaries. We might finally stop being so easily brainwashed by media narratives, romanticizing red flags, or escaping into fantasy when reality gets hard. Stay hydrated this week (Neptune rules water and our bodies will feel the shift), get grounded through movement or time in nature, and  journal your dreams. The subconscious is downloading final wisdom before this cosmic chapter closes. </p>



<p>Adding to the forward momentum, Mercury enters Sagittarius on December 11th, joining the sun, Venus, and Mars already in this Fire sign for one powerful final week of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season energy</a>. After Mercury’s long stay in Scorpio (thanks to the retrograde), this shift into Sag has our minds craving adventure over analysis. With four major planets in Sagittarius, this is the most positive, forward-moving energy we’ve felt in months, perfect for manifesting, saying yes to invitations, spending time outdoors, and having more fun.  </p>



<p>But here’s the shadow: with all this Sag fire, we can easily spread ourselves too thin, overcommit because everything sounds exciting, or lose focus jumping between seventeen different opportunities. Take advantage of the action-oriented vibes without burning yourself out trying to do absolutely everything at once. Be bold, be honest, be adventurous, but also be intentional about where you’re directing all that energy.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, your inner world is about to get a whole lot clearer, but first, are you ready for what’s coming? Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your spirituality and closure sector, and honestly, the fog in your subconscious is finally starting to lift after five months of retrograde confusion. This marks the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, which is significant because your inner world,  dreams, and spiritual practice have been under cosmic renovation since 2011. The direct motion brings clarity about which healing practices actually work versus which ones were just spiritual bypassing, and what closure you still need before Neptune enters <em>your </em>sign on January 26th for over a decade. Use these final weeks of Neptune  in Pisces to finish the inner work, release what’s been lurking in your subconscious, and solidify your spiritual foundation because once Neptune hits Aries, your entire identity is going to get the foggy, transformative, confusing-but-magical treatment. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars (your ruler!) in Sagittarius lighting up your expansion sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and actions aligned on adventure, learning, and growth. The fire energy is peak levels right now… you’re motivated, optimistic, and probably saying yes to everything that sounds  exciting. But here’s the cosmic tension: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars in Sagittarius</a> is squaring Neptune in  Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for bold action and your need for spiritual rest. This square might manifest as wanting to book spontaneous trips  while also feeling called to meditate for hours, or pushing forward aggressively while your subconscious is screaming that you need to slow down and process. The lesson? You can be both adventurous and spiritually grounded, but only if you’re intentional about balancing the two. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and suddenly your  friendships are about to make a lot more sense. For five months, Neptune retrograde  had you questioning which communities were real versus which ones were just  comfortable illusions, and now direct motion brings clarity about who actually deserves  your energy. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime,  marking the end of a 14-year cycle of learning to distinguish between genuine  connection and codependent loyalty in your social circles. You might suddenly feel ready to post again, curate your timeline without guilt, mute people who <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=peace+refinery29&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">drain your peace</a>, or simply have peaceful detachment from friendships that no longer align with who you’re becoming. With Uranus also wrapping its final tour in your sign, this double dose of clarity about community is helping you trust your discernment… if someone feels off, they probably are, and you don’t owe anyone access to your evolution just because they knew the old you. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your  transformation and shared resources sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making conversations about money, intimacy, and depth way more direct. Things might have felt tumultuous around wealth-building and joint finances, but this Mars energy is pushing you to finally take action on investments, partnerships, or healing work you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag is squaring Neptune in Pisces this week,  creating tension between your desire to hustle independently and your need to lean on  community support. This square might show up as wanting to do everything yourself financially while your friends are literally offering help, or being overly generous with your resources because someone’s sob story pulled on your heartstrings. This transit’s about learning when to receive support from your community versus when to set  financial boundaries so you’re not depleting yourself trying to save everyone. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th and your career sector is  finally getting some forward clarity after months of professional fog. Neptune  retrograde had you questioning whether your ambition was authentic or just what you  thought success should look like, and now direct motion helps you see which  professional path actually aligns with your soul versus which one just looks impressive. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing a 14-year cycle of learning that reputation without authenticity is exhausting. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to make any last professional adjustments, solidify your authentic career direction, and prepare for Neptune entering Aries in January,  which will shift the collective fog from your career to your community, giving you even more clarity about your public path. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your partnership sector, and Mercury joins the party on December 11th, making relationship conversations and collaborative projects move quickly. You’re feeling bold about what you need from partnerships and finally saying it out loud instead of just adapting to what others want. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire for direct, honest partnerships and the confusion still lingering in your career ambitions. This square might manifest as wanting clarity in relationships while your professional life feels foggy, or pushing partners to be decisive when you’re still figuring out your own path. The lesson? You can demand honesty in your connections while also admitting you don’t have everything figured out professionally.  </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th in your expansion sector and suddenly your beliefs about what’s possible are getting clearer. For five months, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune retrograde had you</a> questioning your entire worldview, spiritual practices, and whether your optimism was genuine or just denial, and now forward motion helps you see which philosophies actually serve your growth. This is the final time Neptune will  be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between faith that empowers and fantasy that enables. You might feel ready to commit to spiritual practices that work, book travel that’s been calling you, or simply trust your intuition about what expansion looks like now. Use this time to embody the wisdom you’ve gained instead of just philosophizing about it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your wellness and daily routine sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your mind and body aligned on creating sustainable habits. You’re motivated to optimize your health, work routines, and self-care practices with enthusiasm instead of just grinding through  obligation. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire for structured routines and your need for philosophical  exploration. This square might show up as wanting to meal prep and stay disciplined while also feeling called to spontaneously book a spiritual retreat, or pushing yourself  hard physically while your beliefs are saying rest is sacred too. Remember that  wellness and expansion aren’t enemies… you can have daily discipline and spiritual freedom simultaneously. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your transformation and  intimacy sector, and the fog around your shadow work is finally clearing. Neptune  retrograde had you processing depth, shared resources, and vulnerability in ways that felt confusing… were you healing or just talking about healing? Now direct motion brings clarity about which transformation has been authentic versus performative. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between real intimacy and curated vulnerability designed for maximum impact. You might suddenly see which financial partnerships are solid, which intimate connections are worth the investment, or where you’ve been using depth as another role to play instead of actual healing. Use these final weeks of  Neptune in Pisces to solidify the transformation that’s been happening beneath your spotlight: the real work, not just the highlight reel. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your self-expression bold, unfiltered, and honestly unstoppable. You’re creating from inspiration, loving with passion, and expressing yourself without apologizing — peak Leo energy backed by  cosmic fire. But here’s the tension: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to be seen boldly and the quiet transformation still happening in your depths. This square might manifest as wanting to perform your growth publicly when some of it still needs private processing, or creating art about your shadow work before you’ve fully integrated the lessons. The lesson? You can be both visible and still becoming, but make sure your external expression is backed by  internal authenticity. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your partnership sector is getting the clarity you’ve been desperately craving. Neptune retrograde had you  questioning which connections were genuinely reciprocal versus which ones only  worked because you did all the emotional labor, and now forward motion helps you see  the difference clearly. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that not everyone you try to fix actually wants to be saved. You might suddenly have peaceful detachment from relationships that were draining you, see which partnerships are built on authentic alignment, or simply trust your standards without guilt. Use this time to honor connections that actually meet you halfway and release the ones that were always one-sided. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your home and family sector, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making domestic conversations and foundation shifts move quickly. You’re ready to take bold action on your living situation, set boundaries with family, or simply make your private life match your public evolution. But here’s where it gets interesting: Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your desire to revolutionize your foundation and the relationship clarity still integrating. This square might show up as  wanting to make big home changes while your partnerships are still finding balance, or having family drama triggered by the new standards you’re setting in relationships. The lesson is that changing your foundation and changing your partnerships happen simultaneously — they’re connected.  </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your wellness sector and  suddenly your daily routines are making more sense. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning which self-care practices actually worked versus which  ones just looked spiritual, and now direct motion brings clarity about sustainable  wellness. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that optimization without intuition is just exhausting perfectionism. You might suddenly see which health habits serve your actual body versus which ones you maintain because they’re trendy, or realize that rest is productive even when it doesn’t look like anything. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to commit to routines that honor both your need for structure and your body’s need for flexibility: wellness that’s sustainable, not just Instagram-worthy. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your communication sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your voice bold, direct, and maybe a little too honest if you’re not careful. You’re saying what you mean without diplomatic editing, which is liberating but could also burn bridges if you’re not intentional. Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to speak bluntly and the wellness clarity still integrating. This  square might show up as saying yes to everything because direct communication feels good, then crashing physically because you overcommitted. Or being so honest in  conversations that you forget your body needs gentle energy too. The lesson is that your voice and your wellness are connected… speaking your truth should energize you, not deplete you. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your creativity, romance, and pleasure sector is finally getting forward momentum. Neptune retrograde had you seeing your patterns in love and art clearly… were you creating from authenticity or performing depth? Now direct motion helps you express and connect from the real place instead of the romanticized ideal. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, wrapping up 14 years of learning the difference between destiny and delusion in romance. You might suddenly have clarity about which creative projects deserve your energy, which romantic connections are actually a match (not just full of potential), or where you’ve been using intensity as a substitute for  genuine intimacy. Use this time to express yourself authentically and choose connections that are real, not just promising. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your money and self-worth sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making financial conversations and value declarations bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to charge what you’re worth, invest in yourself confidently, or simply stop undervaluing your resources because of old scarcity programming. But Mars in Sag also squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your financial ambition and the  romantic/creative clarity still settling. This square might manifest as wanting to spend money on creative projects or romantic gestures while you’re still figuring out if they’re  aligned with your authentic expression, or being overly generous financially because someone’s potential pulled on your heartstrings. This is teaching you that your resources should support your genuine passions and connections, not the fantasy versions. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your home and family sector, and the fog around your foundation is finally lifting. Neptune retrograde had you questioning what home even means and whether your emotional roots were solid or just familiar, and now forward motion helps you see which domestic patterns actually support you. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your  lifetime, completing 14 years of learning that not all family dynamics need to be understood or fixed. You might suddenly have clarity about living situations, peaceful  detachment from family patterns that no longer serve you, or simply trust that home can look different than you thought it should. Use these final weeks of Neptune in  Pisces to solidify your foundation with intention; create the sanctuary that actually grounds your expansive nature instead of trying to force roots where they don’t fit. </p>



<p>This is also your final full week of Mars in your sign, plus Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your energy, communication, and confidence absolutely  unstoppable. You’re on fire — motivated, optimistic, saying yes to everything, and honestly probably overcommitting because it all sounds exciting. But here’s where the cosmic tension comes in: Mars in your sign squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to charge forward boldly and the home/family clarity still integrating. This square might show up as wanting to book spontaneous  trips while your foundation feels unsteady, or being so focused on external adventure that you’re ignoring emotional needs at home. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take bold action on your goals, but don’t ignore the voice asking you to also tend to your emotional foundation before you sprint toward the next horizon. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, Neptune shifts direct in Pisces on December 10th and your communication  sector is getting the clarity you didn’t know you needed. For five months, Neptune  retrograde had you questioning how you express yourself and whether your words  were connecting or just filling space, and now forward motion helps you speak with both emotional depth and actual clarity. This is the final time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, ending 14 years of learning that vulnerability in communication doesn’t mean weakness. You might suddenly feel ready to have conversations you’ve been editing into safety, express emotions without needing  perfect delivery, or simply trust that your words land even when they’re not perfectly composed. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to solidify the emotional intelligence you’ve developed in how you communicate… you can be both practical  and tender with your words. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your spirituality and closure sector, and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your inner work and private processing move quickly. You’re motivated to finish healing that’s been  lingering, release what’s been hiding in your subconscious, or simply take action on closure you’ve been contemplating. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating friction between your desire to aggressively heal and the communication  clarity still settling. This square might show up as wanting to process everything alone when you actually need to talk it through, or being so focused on spiritual bypassing that you’re not having the practical conversations necessary for real closure. Use this final Mars in Sag week to take action on your inner work, but don’t forget that speaking your truth is part of the healing process. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, Neptune stations direct in Pisces on December 10th in your money sector and suddenly your financial fog is clearing. Neptune retrograde had you questioning  your relationship with abundance and whether your manifestation practices were  actually building wealth or just making you feel better temporarily, and now forward motion brings practical clarity. This is the last time Neptune will be retrograde in Pisces in your lifetime, completing 14 years of learning the difference between spiritual abundance and actual financial strategy. You might suddenly see which income streams are sustainable, where you’ve been spending emotionally instead of  intentionally, or how to merge your idealism with actual money management. Use these final weeks of Neptune in Pisces to get honest about your finances; you can be both  spiritual and strategic about abundance, but only if you’re willing to look at the numbers. </p>



<p>This is also the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius lighting up your friendship and community sector, and Mercury enters Sag on December 11th, making your social life and collaborative projects move at lightning speed. You’re ready to connect with your people, launch group projects, or simply show up boldly in communities that celebrate your evolution. Mars in Sag squares Neptune in Pisces this week, creating tension between your social ambitions and the financial clarity still integrating. This square  might show up as wanting to invest heavily in community projects while your personal finances need attention, or being so generous with friends that you’re depleting your own resources. Use this final Mars in Sag week to build collaborative projects and authentic community, but set financial boundaries so you’re not funding everyone else’s dreams while neglecting your own stability. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, Neptune shifts direct in your sign on December 10th and honestly, who even are you after this retrograde? For five months, Neptune had you reviewing your entire  identity, and now forward motion helps you actually be the person you’ve been  discovering instead of just contemplating them. This is the final time Neptune will be  retrograde in your sign in your lifetime, meaning 14 years of identity dissolution and spiritual evolution are wrapping up. You might suddenly feel clearer about who you are (boundaries and all), less apologetic about your sensitivity, or simply ready to define yourself instead of being everything to everyone. These final weeks of Neptune in your  sign before it moves to Aries in January are crucial: solidify the boundaries, own the  identity, trust the evolution. You’ve spent over a decade being cosmically dissolved and rebuilt; now it’s time to actually live as the person who emerged from the fog. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, this is the final full week of Mars in Sagittarius activating your career sector,  and Mercury joins on December 11th, making your professional ambitions and public communication bold and unapologetic. You’re ready to go after career goals, pitch yourself confidently, or simply be seen professionally as the evolved version of yourself instead of who people expect. But Mars in Sag squares Neptune in your sign this  week, creating friction between your career ambition and your still-integrating identity.  This square might show up as pushing yourself professionally while your sense of self is still settling, or being so focused on external success that you’re ignoring the internal clarity still forming. The lesson is that career and identity work together… your professional path should reflect who you’re becoming, not who you previously were. </p>

Books are always a great gift and if you’ve got a friend whose love language is physical touch but they haven’t exactly cuffed this cuffing season yet, I’ve got the steamy literature that’s going to keep them warm. These two books by Nigerian-British <a href=""https://www.bolubabalola.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">author Bolu Babalola</a> are hot and spicy and go together like fried yam, plantain and eggs (Nigerian fam, did I get that food combo, right?).
