<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-wedding-guest-dresses-summer"">""Wedding season”</a> is often associated with summer, but the most popular months to say “I do” <a href=""https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings"">actually fall later in the year.</a> Maybe it’s the foliage or the welcome relief from the heat, but fall weddings are definitely a <em>thing</em>. While the colorful leaves make for stunning wedding photos, finding fall wedding guest dresses can be tricky. The goal: something elevated, seasonally appropriate, and comfortable enough to carry you through hours of celebrating (and dancing).<br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up 24 statement-making fall wedding guest dresses that work for dipping temperatures (think: maxi lengths, long sleeves, and rich fabrics) and every kind of venue (think: luxe halls, breweries, or lakeside). Expect autumnal florals, sweet puff sleeves, and slinky satin picks. Whether you need an elegant gown for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-tie-wedding-guest-dress"">black-tie affair</a> or are craving a trendy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/arrange-asos-brand-plus-size-review"">plus-size dress</a> for a casual ceremony, your perfect look is just a click away.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

In addition to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters"">cardigan sweaters</a> along with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/knee-high-boot"">knee-high boots</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-leather-handbags-latine"">leather bags</a>, the transitional jacket is a beloved autumnal classic. The best fall jackets are lightweight enough for layering when the temps aren't quite cold — the Goldilocks of your seasonal closet, if you will.<br /><br />Whether you want something to throw on for early-morning dog walks or a more buttoned-up (excuse the pun) style for work or evening plans, there’s a topper out there for everyone. Consider the trusty denim jacket, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/trench-coats-for-women"">trench coat</a>, or leather jacket… or more on-trend <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barn-jacket-trend-explained"">barn jackets</a> and seasonal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/suede-styling-ideas-fall"">suede jackets</a>. And as it gets colder, think of coats made from wool, fleece, and puffer materials as well as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">styles with scarf details</a> for extra coverage and warmth.<br /><br />To provide a little shopping inspiration, we've gathered our top picks from reader-favorite retailers like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-loungewear-loungeful-collection"">Lululemon</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-free-people-fp-movement-sets-co-ords"">Free People</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gap-sandy-liang-collaboration-2025"">Gap</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-damson-madder-new-arrivals"">Damson Madder</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/maeve-anthropologie-bestsellers-review"">Anthropologie</a> to cart up and elevate your fall ‘fits. <br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When you think of “beauty sleep,” you might think of plush mattresses, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silk-pillowcase-hair-skin-benefits"">silk pillowcases</a>, or maybe an overnight mask from your favorite K-beauty brand. And while rest is essential for staying in tip-top shape both mentally and physically, it’s also when your skin gets to work.</p>



<p>That’s right: When you’re enjoying your trip to snoozeland, that’s when your skin gets hard to work — which is what inspired Nocturnal’s hero serum.</p>



<p>“If you’re not getting the proper sleep your body needs, cortisol levels remain high, interfering with cellular activities like wound healing, and even skin hydration,” dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, MD, tells Refinery29. “This even can contribute to acne breakouts.” Founded by beauty industry veterans Katey Hassan and Daniel Kiyoi, Nocturnal’s <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a> is smart, luxurious skincare in a bottle — and it’s definitely not your everyday night serum. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night Renewal Serum</a>, $178</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11938218.jpg?width=910&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=455%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Packed with peptides, niacinamide, oat-derived lipids, and evening primrose, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum"">Polar Night</a> is made to brighten, hydrate, and address signs of aging. However, the most notable innovation IMO lies in a patent-pending delivery system — which actually matters so the potent ingredients you’re paying for get readily absorbed by your skin. But at the end of the day, all of the fancy technology in the world doesn’t matter if my skincare doesn’t yield results.</p>



<p>I may not have wrinkles and fine lines yet (I’m 32, but still get routinely asked if I’m still in college — a slight annoyance that I will one day love, I’m sure), so I can’t speak much to the fine line-reducing ability of Polar Night, but I will say that my overall bounciness and texture have vastly improved since incorporating this into my PM routine. (I even keep it on my nightstand to reapply right before bed.) In the morning, I wake up with soft, smooth skin that isn’t screaming for moisture.</p>



<p>And here’s the thing: Is it expensive? Yes. However, I always recommend investing in your serum or moisturizer (as opposed to cleansers) since they tend to be more concentrated in actives and stay on your skin for a longer period of time. The 30mL full size lasted me a few months with nightly use, and I just replaced it with a <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/UBAGQESK/products/polar-night-renewal-serum-refill?variant=43293817143484"">refill pod</a>. (Which, when the packaging is as gorgeous as Nocturnal’s, it genuinely makes me want to reuse it forever.) And since I’ve been using Polar Night, I’ve haven’t wanted to book a facial or invest in richer moisturizers since my skin is already happy and hydrated. Serums that work smarter <em>and </em>harder? Here for it.</p>

<p>We’re now in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-fall-candles-2025-latine"">middle of fall</a>. The onset of Scorpio season lands in the depths of fall for the Northern Hemisphere. As we dive into the simmering waters of Scorpio, we’ll feel more connected to others because our hearts and minds will be open. We have the opportunity to realize our dreams and we will be lucky enough to be happy with the outcome. Read on to discover the spooky and sweet vibes that will be coming in the month ahead.<br /><br />As a fixed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/water-signs-zodiac-traits-explained"">water sign</a>, Scorpio is known for devotion and loyalty. The scorpion, who will sting with their poisonous venom when hurt, is extremely intuitive and highly aware of their surroundings. Scorpios wear their hearts close to their chest and suss people out before letting them in. In the days ahead we are going to decide who and what is worth investing our energy into. Being cautious will lead to us being comfortable around the people we trust. </p>



<p>The decaying leaves dropping off the trees remind us of our own mortality. Scorpio is the sign of sex, death, taxes, and evolution and we will be monitoring our personal advancementł. This is a time to make the shifts that have been on our minds. The winds of change are having a profound effect on us. We hold the power to our success and joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">Manifesting our goals</a> will be easier. Like the crops being picked, our visions will soon be a reality. With two retrogrades (Mercury and Jupiter) and a potent Super Full Harvest Moon, we’ll contemplate our next moves and reflect on the past. </p>



<p>The feeling to watch out for is jealousy. On October 24th, when the Sun squares Pluto, we may be consumed by the green-eyed monster. This feeling might be projected onto others, or we could be the victims of it. Scorpio energy can bring out our dark side. We need to make peace with shadowy emotions by embracing our inner child and recognizing these our feelings for what they are. We should love these parts of ourselves in an effort to temper and heal them. By using our innate strength and stamina, we can create a better state of being for ourselves. Be gentle and sympathetic to others and yourself as you float through the enigmatic waves of Scorpio season.</p>



<p>Key Astrological Dates For Scorpio Season: <br /><br /><strong>October 22nd:</strong> The Sun enters Scorpio, starting a month of transformation. Our emotions will get deep, urging us to commit.<br /><br /><strong>October 29th:</strong> Mercury moves into Sagittarius, making communication direct and upfront — no more mincing words.<br /><br /><strong>November 4th:</strong> Mars glides into Sagittarius, pushing us to chase our independence and embrace adventure. <br /><br /><strong>November 5th:</strong> The magical Super Full Moon in Taurus illuminates the sky and highlights our sensual desires.  </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939013.jpg?resize=150%2C150"" /></figure></div>



<p>Let me start by saying this: I am <em>not</em> a sports girl. Never have been. I danced as a kid, I work out, but anything that involves a ball and coordination? Count me out. So when <a href=""https://usapickleball.org/"">USA Pickleball </a>invited me to <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/south-coast/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=104221446&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4_U5AhxrctAUMq2uzoLE8kEywU5&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6bfHBhDNARIsAIGsqLjkljtYkno35KSzZW5OFnvIzuxguWYbDOHKgW_w-WY_uOvjewusxnwaAqYXEALw_wcB"">Sandals South Coast</a> in Jamaica for World Pickleball Day, I was equally excited and terrified.</p>



<p>But after one week of sun, sweat, and intense fun, I get it. I finally understand why everyone’s obsessed with pickleball.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Sandals was named <a href=""https://www.sandals.com/pickleball/"">USA Pickleball’s Official All-Inclusive Resort,</a> and we were there to celebrate the partnership and test out their brand-new courts. From the moment we arrived, they rolled out the red carpet: new rackets, balls, and enough <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pickleball-gifts"">pickleball merch</a> to fill a carry-on. Jamaica is already my favorite island so getting to play my first-ever game in paradise was an unreal experience.</p>



<p>Before we jumped into games, our coach gave us a crash course in Pickleball 101. We started with the basics: how to hold the paddle, how to serve, how <em>not</em> to send the ball flying into another court (which I may or may not have done). My biggest struggle? Figuring out how hard to hit. My brain kept wanting to play tennis, I was reminded over and over: <em>no wrist flicks, no power swings, just a light tap.</em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939014.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>If I’m being honest, I was almost more excited about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11488863/pickleball-fashion-outfits"">pickleball fits </a>than the actual sport. On day one, I wore a cute tan set that immediately betrayed me. I had visible sweat marks all over my body and let’s just say I was no longer the girl with the cute fit on the court. I was drenched in sweat, and my cute court outfit was a distant memory. But by day two, I came back strong in a white cropped tee, white tennis skirt, bucket hat, and sunnies. Looking cute on the court was an instant confidence boost. I actually started getting the hang of it.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939015.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>By the end of the week, I was into it — like, “maybe I’ll join a pickleball league” level of into it. It’s social, easy to learn, and doesn’t leave you feeling like you just survived bootcamp. I totally get why everyone from your parents to your favorite celebs can’t stop talking about it.</p>



<p>I also have to give Sandals its flowers. I’m usually not an all-inclusive resort girl, but this trip changed my mind. Between the food, the vibes, and the fact that they have everything you need to pick up a new hobby (paddles, balls, courts, and lessons), it’s the perfect setup for both chill and play.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939016.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>I went to Jamaica thinking I’d sip cocktails by the pool and maybe try this pickleball thing once. Instead, I got my cardio in, made new friends, and found a sport I actually like. So yeah, consider me a convert.</p>



<p>If you’ve been side-eyeing the pickleball hype like I was, take this as your sign: grab a paddle, find a court, and try it for yourself. Just… don’t wear tan.<br /></p>

<p>On the first day of her first job out of college, Olandria Carthen, aka Bama Barbie, walked in and was struck with one thought: <em>I’m the only one who looks like me. </em>Not only were there no women, but there weren’t any Black folks. </p>



<p>“In that moment in time, I had to remember: Tuskegee literally prepares you for moments like this,” says the beloved reality star, model, and aspiring entrepreneur, on the latest episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, in partnership with <a href=""http://target.com"">Target</a>, about how her Historically Black College and University (HBCU) experience prepared her to face the realities of working in the elevator industry — one that’s very white and very male. “I fell into a mini post-college depression. Imagine going from an all-Black classroom to being the only Black person in the office. But I feel like Tuskegee showed me how to adapt to those types of environments and how to network. I had to remind myself: Never shrink yourself in the presence of others to make them feel more empowered.” </p>



<p>Carthen never expected to find herself in sales at an elevator company (she graduated with a degree in supply chain management), but her disarming charm — plus her Tuskegee education — set her up for success. In just a short time, she was outperforming her peers, knocking out one goal after another. It’s that same charm that not only won over her significant other — Nicolas Vansteenberghe — on arguably the most-watched reality TV show program of the summer, but also fans all over the nation. </p>



<p>“When I was on that show, I knew I was representing more than just myself — I’m representing Black women as a whole. So, going on there and knowing my self-worth, my value, and  self-acceptance truly helped me navigate this space,” she says. “Knowing I have so much support from my community, or just from all women, means the world to me.”</p>



<p>Listen to the full podcast episode during which Carthen chats with Kathleen Newman-Bremang, senior content director of entertainment at Refinery29; Sandy Pierre, brand partnerships lead at Unbothered; and Claire Ateku, social producer at Unbothered about Homecoming season, how she’s handling fame, Nicolandria, and more. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Get ready to sizzle! The day before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Scorpio season</a> begins, October 21st, brings a super intense New Moon in Libra. Relationships and money are shifting and itching for evolution. The cosmos is asking us to define our aspirations and inclinations. <br /><br />The Moon’s orbit around the Earth takes nearly a month to go from New to Full. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lunar-wellness-cycle-meaning-black-women"">lunar cycle</a> begins when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in line with each other, with the Moon facing Earth bearing no light from the Sun. As a result, a Dark Moon happens. A New Moon occurs astrologically when the Sun and Moon form a conjunction in the same sign and degree. The union of the two is a balance of the conscious (Sun) and the unconscious (Moon). We are attaining harmony in our identity and feelings. They dance together, allowing us to find our sense of self and our purpose.<br /><br />The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscope-19-october-25-2025-meaning-effects"">New Moon in Libra</a> gives us clarity on who we want to partner with and the strength of vision to cut ties with those we do not. Regardless of our chosen avenue, we are gearing up to make tough decisions regarding matters of the heart. Exciting partnerships could develop, encouraging us to lean into romantic notions. We might also consider balancing various parts of our lives to achieve harmony and peace of mind. Finances could come into play, and we should ensure we stick to a budget and do not overspend. The overall message is to embrace relationships and lifestyles that lift us and allow us to grow. Emotional safety is necessary, so tighten the foundations and build toward a better place.</p>



<p>The lunation occurs in the latest degree of Libra, the 29th, called anaretic degree. This brings a messy vibe and the need for immediate change. We might show our tempers if our patience is exhausted. Additionally, the New Moon squares Jupiter in Cancer, expanding our sentimental and passionate horizons. Although this sounds amazing on paper, we might overindulge in our desires, making it challenging for others to relate to us or vice versa. While we wish to scream our feelings from the rooftops, it may be best to subdue them as a form of energetic protection. Saturn retrograde in Pisces initiates a minor frustrations within this lunation. Basically, we should slow our roll. <br /><br />Yes, we’re in love with life — but it’s advisable not to shoot our shot too quickly. We should wait until we have100% confidence in matters. Think of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/october-2025-tarotscopes-process-release"">Fool tarot card</a>; one misstep backwards brings catastrophe. Speaking of tarot, this lunation is associated with Justice and the Two of Swords. Justice represents the Sun in Libra, and the Two of Swords correlates to the Moon in Libra. The combination of these cards is another warning against rushing in — even though Jupiter is strongarming us and making us believe that haste is a good idea. Meditate for a hot minute about what truly speaks to your spirit. The more impetuous we are, the less we listen to our intuition, and intuition is key right now. </p>



<p>This is the first moment we’ve had that pushes us to manifest — last month’s eclipses caused too much frenetic energy for us to see straight, so we paused on setting intentions. Now is the time to take a leap toward our goals and make moves to secure our bag for the future. Whether committing to a ‘ship or starting a project, be sure to center your energy on the ideas that inspire and motivate you to be the greatest version of yourself. The truth is, the only way to do fantastic work and to live up to your potential is to love what you do and who you spend your time with. It’s that simple!</p>

<p>This week begins with a wave of beauty, balance, and intention-setting as the New Moon in Libra arrives on October 21, opening up a 10-day portal to re-center and recalibrate. The New Moon is ruled by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">Venus, who’s just come home to Libra</a>, adding a layer of divine ease and elegance to the cosmic weather. Think of this lunation as your official invitation to simplify your life, clear emotional clutter, and call in relationships that reflect your growth, not your patterns. Even if the world feels chaotic, this is a window where the inner world can start to feel a little more in rhythm — one breath at a time. <br /><br />But don’t get too comfy, because the next day, on the 22nd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/libra-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Libra Season</a> ends, and on the 23rd, the depths of Scorpio Season rise up to meet us. That shift alone — from Air to Water, from surface to soul, from curation to catharsis — is a reminder that life moves in layers. We’re at a threshold, a moment between what’s light and what’s heavy, and the astrology this week is here to teach us that we don’t have to pick one or the other. We can live and let live, love and let love, <em>and</em> still honor the shadows that live within us. This isn’t a week of either/or. It’s both/and. <br /><br />And here’s the plot twist: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars, Scorpio’s ancient ruler, is also in Scorpio</a>, intensifying our instincts, sharpening our focus, and stirring our deepest desires. When both Venus and Mars are in their home signs, it’s like the divine feminine and divine masculine are having a private convo about where we’re really headed. Passion meets poise, truth meets tenderness, and we’re being asked to integrate it all. The version of you who craves connection and harmony gets to co-exist with the one who’s finally ready to stop pretending and speak from the soul. </p>



<p>Also on October 22, Neptune retrogrades back into Pisces at 5:51am EST for its final visit to its home sign — a placement it’s held since July 2011. That’s 14 years of dreaming, dissolving, romanticizing, escaping, and sometimes deceiving ourselves. So let’s pause here: <em>What were you longing for in 2011 that still lingers in the background of your life today? What illusions have been too sweet to let go of? What delusions have actually protected you, and which ones are now blocking your growth?</em> Neptune’s final retrograde through Pisces is here to help us differentiate between being delulu and finding the solulu, and that lesson is as spiritual as it is sobering. <br /><br />And it’s not just personal… this retrograde affects us on a collective level, too. With Saturn also recently re-entering Pisces, and the North Node currently transiting Pisces (until 2026), there’s a massive wave of Piscean energy shaping our intuition, our ideals, and our imaginations. That means questioning media narratives, cultural myths, and the stories we’ve been spoon-fed. It means trusting your gut, even when the facts aren’t clear. And above all, it means reclaiming your spiritual sovereignty. The answers don’t always arrive through logic — sometimes they live in a poem, a dream, a flash of insight, or the moment your body relaxes for the first time in days. <br /><br />This week is about trusting the quiet truth inside you, even if you’re still figuring out how to name it. It’s okay to change your mind. It’s okay to want solitude one minute and to feel wildly social the next. Conversations will be both hilarious and profound — the kind that make you laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh again. And the more grace you offer yourself through this integration process, the more you’ll be able to offer it to others. We’re all riding this wave together. No one’s doing it perfectly. </p>



<p>So lean into the beauty. Let yourself desire peace. But don’t be afraid to feel the edges of your longing, too. Let the Libra New Moon remind you that healing doesn’t always look like shadow work — sometimes it’s a playlist, a pretty dress, a flirty glance, or the moment you decide to forgive yourself for being human. And let Scorpio Season’s arrival remind you that transformation can be tender, and it’s okay if you’re not ready to share the full story just yet. You’re allowed to evolve quietly.<br /><br />Because this week? It could all be so simple — and it gets to be. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’ve been pretending not to care, Aries, but the Libra New Moon on October 21st is calling your bluff. It’s happening in your partnership sector, and with Venus also in Libra, it’s time to admit that yes, you want softness. You want connection. You want someone who sees you and doesn’t flinch. Whether you’re in a relationship, navigating a situationship, or feeling completely solo — this lunation wants you to pause and check in: <em>What kind of love are you calling in?</em> You get to rewrite your expectations and begin again. It’s okay to let yourself want more: more harmony, more depth, more reciprocity. That doesn’t make you weak; it makes you wise.<br /><br />Then, two days later, the vibe shifts completely as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/10/10719292/scorpio-season-october-2021-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season</a> begins on the 23rd, lighting up your sector of merging, intimacy, and long-term investments. This is about more than sex (though, yes, that too). This is about legacy. About who you’re building with. About what you’re merging your energy, resources, and soul with and why. With Mars, your ruling planet, in Scorpio, you’re operating with more instinct and intuition than usual. You’re not showing all your cards. You’re observing, planning, feeling more private, and more potent. That can feel disorienting for a Fire sign, but it’s medicine. Let your decisions simmer. Reassess how you spend your energy and who you trust with your heart, your body, your secrets. Scorpio Season is about power, not performance. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your body knows. Your spirit knows. Your routines know. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is like a soft reset for your wellness, work, and rhythm sector, and it’s reminding you that healing isn’t supposed to feel like punishment. It’s supposed to feel like <em>alignment</em>. That means going to bed at a decent hour, turning your phone off an hour before sleep, choosing ginger tea over scrolling, and saying “no” without guilt. With Venus, your ruling planet, also in Libra, this is your chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/venus-in-libra-horoscope-october-2025-meaning-effects"">romanticize your wellness</a>. Make your water fancy. Play jazz while you fold clothes. Eat your snacks before 8pm. You already know what needs tweaking — this lunation just gives you permission to actually <em>do it</em>. And yes, small changes count. <br /><br />But then the tempo changes: Scorpio Season begins October 23, activating your relationship sector and inviting you into the realm of real connection. And not the Instagram kind — the deep, soul-mirroring, “why are you in my dreams” kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, your desire for depth in partnership is doubled. It’s cinematic and intense. You may find yourself magnetically pulled toward people with Scorpio placements, or just craving more <em>presence</em> from the people already in your life. But the challenge? Don’t lose yourself in the sauce. Remember your rituals. Stay rooted in your values. You don’t have to prove you’re lovable. You just have to be present. </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This Libra New Moon on October 21st is a love letter to your inner child, Gemini. It’s a fresh start in your creativity, romance, and play sector, and it wants you to do what actually feels good. Remember hobbies? Remember flirting for fun? Remember making things just because you felt like it? That’s what this lunation is about. Venus in Libra is also holding your hand, reminding you that ease can be productive. That joy is part of your path, and that laughter heals. This week, say yes to the dance class, the art project, the silly text, the cartoon rewatch, the solo karaoke in your bathroom mirror. Give your inner child the wheel for a bit. They know the way. <br /><br />Then, once Scorpio Season begins on October 23, your energy gets more serious — but in a helpful way. Scorpio lights up your sector of wellness, habits, and systems, and Mars in Scorpio gives you the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-improve-focus"">power to focus</a>. You’re not just dabbling anymore. You’re getting your sh*t together. And yes, that might feel a little overwhelming at first — the structure, the schedule, the responsibility — but it’s so necessary. Think of this as your season of refinement. What systems do Future You need in place? What boundaries? What daily rituals? Treat discipline as a form of devotion, not restriction. You’re not doing this to limit yourself — you’re doing it to <em>free yourself</em>. </p>

<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You can’t decorate over a wound, Cancer. This week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your home, healing, and inner foundation sector, and it’s gently guiding you to tend to what’s beneath the surface. Maybe that means rearranging your room so it feels more like a sanctuary. Maybe it means having a long <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/talking-to-family-relationship-disapproval"">talk with a family member</a>. Maybe it means journaling the thoughts you usually keep hidden. This isn’t about appearances — it’s about <em>alignment</em>. With Venus also in Libra, you’re supported in creating beauty and balance where things have felt off-kilter. Let this lunation be a reset for your nervous system. You’re allowed to begin again, even if you never got the apology. Especially if you didn’t.<br /><br />Then comes the glow-up: Scorpio Season kicks off October 23, activating your sector of joy, pleasure, romance, and creativity for the next four weeks. This is your permission slip to <em>feel yourself</em>. To flirt, to play, to create. With Mars also in Scorpio, your sensuality is magnetized, but so is your creativity. You’re not just craving fun, you’re craving depth <em>within</em> fun. Art that moves you, love that consumes you, moments that feel like magic. Just don’t forget: the muse needs rest, too. Protect your energy, and your intuition. The next four weeks are about remembering what brings you back to life and refusing to settle for anything less. </p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is a social, stimulating reset for you, Leo. It’s lighting up your communication, curiosity, and connection zone. Conversations flow easier this week, and you may find yourself reaching out to people you’ve been meaning to text back since… August. With Venus also in Libra, charm comes naturally to you (yes, even more than usual). You could be asked to collaborate, speak, teach, or write something that finally gets your ideas the attention they deserve. Say yes to anything that feels light, exciting, and reciprocal. This lunation wants you to remember that words are spells, so choose the ones that align with where you’re headed, not where you’ve been. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, the vibe shifts inward. Your attention turns toward your home, your emotional safety, and your sense of belonging. It’s less about how you’re <em>perceived</em> and more about how you <em>feel</em> when the lights are off and no one’s watching. With Mars also in Scorpio, family dynamics, domestic decisions, or living arrangements may need attention. But instead of reacting, try responding. Scorpio Season is about moving from pride to presence. About anchoring yourself in the small, sacred rituals that keep your heart steady. Decorate your space. Reconnect with your roots. Make home feel like peace again. </p>

<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week’s Libra New Moon on October 21st is whispering “stability” — not in a boring way, but in the “let’s actually feel safe in our bodies and our money again” kind of way. It lands in your finance and self-worth zone, encouraging you to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">treat your energy like currency</a>. Where are you investing your time, your attention, your money, your heart? Do those investments still align with your values? With Venus also in Libra, you’re being guided to reconnect with the pleasure of abundance — not hustle for it. Maybe that looks like budgeting with grace, paying yourself first, or simply believing you’re allowed to receive without overexplaining. This lunation wants you to see yourself as the asset.<br /><br />Then, Scorpio Season begins on October 23rd, shifting your attention to your communication and learning sector. You’re not just observing anymore — you’re analyzing, processing, and saying the things that others are too scared to. With Mars in Scorpio, your words carry weight, and your intuition about people is almost eerie. Don’t use that power to overthink or prove yourself — use it to connect. Journal your thoughts. Have the difficult conversation. Take the class or trip that’s been calling to you. Your mind is a portal right now. Speak from the heart, and it’ll reach exactly who it needs to. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve made it to <em>your</em> annual new moon week, Libra, and it’s one of the most beautiful cosmic resets of the year. On October 21st, both the Sun and Moon meet in your sign, with your ruler Venus also cozy at home in Libra. Translation? This is a full permission slip to live and let live, love and let love. You don’t have to earn peace; you can choose it. You’re not being superficial for wanting beauty or harmony — you’re remembering that those things heal you. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">Set intentions</a> that celebrate who you’re becoming rather than fixating on who you used to be. This lunation is a mirror moment. Look closely. You’ve grown more than you realize. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun slides into Scorpio, the tone deepens — and your focus turns to your values, resources, and inner self-worth. You might notice where you’ve been over-giving, or where your generosity hasn’t been matched. Don’t spiral… Just rebalance. With Mars in Scorpio, it’s time to get practical about your goals. Where do you want to build lasting stability? What’s worth your emotional bandwidth? Scorpio Season helps you refine what “abundance” really means to you. Sometimes, it’s money. Sometimes, it’s peace. This next chapter teaches you how to protect both. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio Season begins this week, babe! You can feel it coming, can’t you? But before we get there, the Libra New Moon on October 21st feels like the inhale before the exhale — a quiet clearing in your healing, rest, and reflection zone. You may crave solitude more than usual, and that’s not isolation… it’s preparation. With Venus also in Libra, your soul is recalibrating before the spotlight returns to you. This week’s new moon wants you to release the pressure to do everything at once. Rest is the ritual, closure is the work, and forgiveness is the reset. Give yourself the stillness your spirit’s been asking for, and watch how naturally the inspiration flows back in. <br /><br />Then, on October 23rd, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">it’s officially </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects"">your</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2024-meaning-effects""> season, Scorpio</a>. The Sun enters your sign, and so does the main character energy. With Mars, your ancient ruler, also here, your magnetism skyrockets. You’re bold without trying, mysterious without forcing it, and on some level… people just <em>know</em> not to play with you right now. But with that power comes a choice: will you lead with love or control? This next four-week chapter is about mastering your intensity — not dimming it. Say what you want, own what you desire, and move like you’ve already shed what needed to go. It’s transformation season, and you’re the divine template. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st lands in your community and social goals sector, Sagittarius — and it’s giving “soft launch your reinvention” energy. This is the moment to remember you’re allowed to be known in new ways. You may feel drawn to refresh your brand, update your online presence, or pitch that creative idea that’s been living in your Notes app. With Venus also in Libra, friendship becomes a love language — so lean into the joy of collaboration and platonic intimacy. Whether it’s scheduling a girls’ night, finding a new creative crew, or saying “yes” to something that terrifies you <em>just a little</em>, this is a portal to deeper alignment. Don’t ghost your future self. <br /><br />By October 23rd, when Scorpio Season begins, your mood turns reflective. This is your annual “soul sabbatical” — when the Sun illuminates your closure, subconscious, and healing zone. You may feel more sensitive or sleepy than usual, especially with Mars in Scorpio intensifying your dreams and instincts. Use this time to untangle what you’ve been carrying that isn’t yours. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">Set boundaries with the energy drainers</a>. Tend to your inner world like it’s your most sacred altar. The magic of this season isn’t loud — it’s hidden, behind-the-scenes, preparing you to rise again in late November. For now, rest <em>is</em> productivity. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is blessing your career and visibility sector, Capricorn, and it’s your cosmic cue to step into the spotlight — but on your own terms. What do you <em>really</em> want to be known for? Who do you feel called to become? This lunation, with Venus also in Libra, helps you approach your ambition from a place of harmony and alignment, rather than grind and guilt. Pitch the bold idea, apply for the role, speak up in the meeting. It’s not about proving anything — it’s about <em>remembering</em> what you bring to the table. You’re building a legacy. Let this new moon reflect that.<br /><br />When the Sun enters Scorpio on October 23rd, the energy pivots toward your friendships, networks, and long-term dreams. Suddenly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-relationship-connection-vs-compatibility"">you’re craving connection</a> — but not the surface-level kind. With Mars also in Scorpio, you’re being guided to deepen your bonds or lovingly release what’s no longer aligned. This season helps you call in your soul tribe — the people who see your power and remind you of your softness. Whether you’re building something new, joining a cause, or just having a long-overdue heart-to-heart with a friend, Scorpio Season is your reminder: success is sweeter when it’s shared. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the Libra New Moon on October 21st arrives with lightness and lift — activating your exploration, truth, and belief sector. It wants you to zoom out. To remember that life isn’t only about responsibilities and goals, but also about adventure, serendipity, and soul expansion. This is a beautiful week to plan a trip, take a course, or follow a philosophical rabbit hole that intrigues you. With Venus also in Libra, you might even fall for someone with a different background or worldview. This lunation is about freedom. Say yes to what expands your heart, and say no to what keeps you small. <br /><br />Once Scorpio Season kicks off on October 23rd, your focus shifts to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/career-horoscope-2025"">your career, reputation, and long-term impact</a>. With Mars in Scorpio, your drive to succeed sharpens, but so does your tendency to burn out if you’re not being honest about what success <em>means</em> to you. Scorpio Season asks you to build more than just your resume. It asks you to build trust. Build truth. Build something that won’t crumble when things get hard. Keep your vision, but let go of the masks. The real you? That’s the version the world’s been waiting for. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The Libra New Moon on October 21st is an intimate one for you, Pisces… it takes place in your sector of merging, transformation, and shared resources, which means you may be reflecting on the emotional (and financial) ties in your life. Who are you sharing your energy with, and why? This lunation, paired with Venus’ current transit in Libra, helps you navigate these waters with grace, honesty, and softness. Whether you’re deepening a relationship, releasing an entanglement, or calling in a more balanced dynamic, the message is clear: don’t settle for anything that doesn’t feel <em>sacred</em>. You’re worthy of depth that doesn’t drain you.<br /><br />By October 23rd, when the Sun enters Scorpio, the mood lifts slightly — but it also gets <em>real</em>. This is your annual call to expand, both spiritually and literally. With Mars in Scorpio, your curiosity is on fire. You’re craving truth, adventure, and deeper meaning. Whether it’s planning a spiritual retreat, writing your truth, or diving into metaphysical studies, Scorpio Season activates your philosopher mode. But it’s not about escaping. It’s about understanding the hidden patterns that guide your life. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-intuition-psychic-spiritual-meaning"">Let your intuition lead you</a> somewhere that pleasantly surprises you and helps you expand your possibilities. </p>

It’s finally time for Target’s annual designer collaboration, and this one stands out from its most recent slate, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-kate-spade-collaboration-shop"">Kate Spade</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/target-diane-von-furstenberg-collaboration-lookbook"">DVF</a>. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has partnered with the nearly 200-year-old <a href=""https://www.woolrich.com/us/en/"">outdoor lifestyle brand Woolrich</a> on an ultra-cozy, adventure-ready, and dare we say: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPzeJaZk-pX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">lumberjack-chic collection</a>. <br /><br />Beyond buffalo-check womenswear and menswear — which Woolrich popularized — you can fully embrace your adventurous side out on the trails or in your humble abode with a range of Target-exclusive accessories, homeware, outdoor gear, and food and drinks. Think: <a href=""http://goto.target.com/55rXmn"">landscape-printed fleece zip-ups</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/GKWAoE"">sheep-covered pillows</a>, <a href=""http://goto.target.com/EEB5GX"">binoculars</a>, and new <a href=""http://goto.target.com/2aDGXD"">maple syrup Kodiak pancake mix</a>.  So while Woolrich’s high-quality and durable apparel may typically cost you a pretty penny, this Target collaboration makes the heritage brand’s designs (and expanded categories) more accessible to a broader audience — with most price points falling under $40.<br /><br />“Woolrich x Target is all about fashion meeting function to help consumers embrace the outdoors in style,"" said Jill Sando, Target's executive vice president and chief merchandising officer, apparel &amp; accessories, home and hardlines in a press release. ""From the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/e1zOBg"">Quilted Sheep Tote Bag</a> to the <a href=""http://goto.target.com/mOMDrD"">Buffalo Check Outdoor Wearable Throw</a>, to the amazing <a href=""http://goto.target.com/jebM2a"">inflatable kayak</a>, and so much more, I love how Target and Woolrich have worked together to create something that's fun and affordable.""<br /><br />The classic utilitarian aesthetics and functional features get a playful Target spin à la vibrant colorways, playful sheep graphics, printed reversible styles, and even a campaign shot in New York to show how Woolrich’s designs can translate into “modern urban style.” So whether you break up your buffalo check ""Pennsylvania tuxedo” with a graphic tee, cargo pants, or quilted skirt, you’ll look and feel confident taking on camping sites <em>or</em> bustling crowds. <br /><br />Woolrich’s creative director, Heekyun Kim, said in the release: ""This collaboration with Target represents an exciting opportunity to introduce our iconic designs, like our legendary buffalo check, to a new generation of explorers.

<p><em>Welcome to</em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/money-diary""><em> Money Diaries</em></a><em> where we are tackling the ever-present taboo that is money. We’ve partnered with</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/""><em> Klarna</em></a><em>, the financial services company that offers the</em><a href=""https://www.klarna.com/us/klarna-card/""><em> Klarna Card</em></a><em> that can be used two ways — as a traditional debit card anywhere Visa and virtual payments are accepted, or as a flexible pay-later option — allowing its users to feel empowered and in control of their spending. </em></p>



<p><em>Today: </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ayanahyman""><em>Ayana Hyman</em></a><em>, a 23-year-old Los Angeles-based content creator, uses her Klarna Card to buy essentials like groceries (adulting!) and little things that make her happy.</em></p>



<h2>Day One</h2>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm clock goes off. I immediately hit snooze and sleep for another hour. Classic. I eventually peel myself out of bed at 10 a.m. and then I remember: I live in Los Angeles now(!!), and that gets me hyped for the day. Moving here has been my dream for forever, and even though I’m all settled in now (I moved a couple months ago), it still feels surreal. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I wash the crust out of my eyes and do my morning skincare routine while bumping to my favorite tunes. I absolutely have to start the day with music pumping through my veins — it’s my way of grounding myself in a new city that honestly still <em>feels</em> new.</p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — I go to my favorite torture class — pilates — and sweat outrageously for an hour. I’ve actually met some of my new friends here. Moving to a new city can be lonely, and it’s been a challenge putting myself out there, so it feels good to start recognizing some familiar faces. <strong>$40 </strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — I grab a container of mangoes — definitely a little pricey, but they make my day every time. Worth it. <strong>$15</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — I have a random craving for BBQ, so I order some and it <em>bussed zownnn</em> (as it should for 86 whole dollars!!). Did it taste like comfort? Absolutely.<strong> $86</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $141</strong></p>



<h2>Day Two</h2>



<p>11 a.m. — I start my day with a morning croissant and matcha that I order straight to my door. Matcha is definitely a <em>non-negotiable </em>on heavy editing days. I’ve been a content creator for four years now, and I’ve learned that little treats, like matcha, are just the thing I need to keep going. <strong>$30 </strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — It’s a full hair wash day today: washing, blow drying, and braiding, which kind of feels like the Hair Olympics. I blast music and chat with my mom, which makes the time go by much faster.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Finally done and I reward myself with a home-cooked meal of chicken, potatoes, and crab claws. It’s a weird combination of dishes, I know, but comfort food always reminds me of home back in Atlanta.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $30</strong></p>



<h2>Day Three</h2>



<p>7:30 a.m.  — It’s an early start today because I’m going to a workout class with the girlies I met at pilates. Yay for new friends.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I’m a sucker for cute workout clothes and the workout studio has the <em>CAY-UTEST</em> top. I buy it, of course. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — After our workout, we all get lunch. I only order one smoothie and a croissant, and somehow that’s $30, but I guess that’s LA for ya. I’m still learning how to manage my money out here (social spending versus staying home), but these little hangs definitely make the city feel less lonely. <strong>$30</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon editing content I’ve been procrastinating on. It’s just been sitting in my phone for weeks (oops). I eat a freezer dinner and decide to call it a day. Welcome to the unglamorous side of content creation. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $60</strong></p>



<h2>Day Four</h2>



<p>12 p.m. — I have a brand dinner tonight, and I spend the entire morning thinking about my outfit. When I have something to look forward to, my brain can only think of that one thing for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>3 p.m. — I don’t need to leave until 6:30 p.m., but I start getting ready now, because I’m a professional dilly-dallier. The earlier I get ready the better, because I don’t want to be late — tonight’s event is with one of my favorite Black-owned beauty brands.</p>



<p>6:45 p.m. — Told you! I’m finally ready and leave for dinner. The event is <em>stunning</em>. Moments like these remind me of why I moved out here. I’m living the life I’ve always imagined.  </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h2>Day Five </h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11937459.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>12 p.m.— I get dressed to go to the nail salon — only for them to turn me away because they’re all booked for the day (cue the dramatic <em>nooooo</em>). </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — Instead of heading home, I take myself on a solo movie date. In Atlanta, I would be hanging out with my sisters or friends. Sometimes being alone feels a bit harder in a new city, but I’m learning to enjoy my own company. And this beats doing chores, so I don’t regret my decision at all. <strong>$43</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I end the night by FaceTiming with my mom, aka my long-distance bestie. I always feel lighter after chats with her. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $43</strong></p>



<h2>Day Six</h2>



<p>2 p.m. — It’s Self-care Saturday. Translation: bed-rotting and doom-scrolling for hours. Sometimes you just need to do nothing. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — If I want to make it to the next day, I’m going to need some food in my house, so off to the grocery store we go, where I buy ingredients for a few recipes I have in mind, plus a little bouquet of flowers to brighten my home. To be completely honest, grocery shopping is an adulting task that I’m still getting used to.<strong> </strong>The total amount is a lot, but I justify it because it’ll be cheaper than eating out. And by using my Klarna Card, I can easily track how much I’m spending in the app. And the beauty of this card — and how it differs from other cards — is that I can use it two ways: as a regular debit card wherever Visa or virtual payments are accepted (so, <em>pretty much </em>everywhere) and as a way to plan for a bigger purchase and pay later. </p>



<p>I first learned about Klarna in college. I would buy clothes, and with Klarna, pay the amount in installments. Making smaller payments was just easier (also, girl math), and I felt more in control of my spending. And so I love that I still have that ability to plan for purchases with the Klarna Card, except now, I can use it virtually anywhere and for virtually anything (instead of being limited to select merchants that have Klarna at checkout). <strong>$146</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — My mom talks non-stop about this pasta recipe she’s always making nowadays, so I take a shot at making it with my newly purchased ingredients. And she wasn’t exaggerating — it’s <em>good. </em></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $146</strong></p>



<h2>Day Seven</h2>



<p>10 a.m. — I show up to the nail salon because I made an actual appointment this time (#womeninstem). And my nails came out so cute. I simply tap to pay using my Klarna Card (#blessed). <strong>$112</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — As much as I want to order food because I don’t feel like cooking, I lace up my big-girl boots and make a lettuce wrap with the groceries I bought earlier. Who’s proud of me? (Me haha).</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Sundays are all about comfort. And it just so happens that <em>all </em>of my favorite shows air on Sundays. So you can find me on my couch for the rest of the night — it’s a ritual that reminds me of home, even if home is now thousands of miles away. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $112</strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>“I must confess: I don’t usually track my spending, so I honestly thought that I’d spend <em>way</em> more this week. But I feel good about where my money went. Most of what I spent was on little things that made me happy — like flowers or a matcha or a cute workout top — which feels like the best kind of spending. But I’m also very much aware that regularly dining out can add up, which was why I started to make a concerted effort to cook more at home this week. Keeping track of everything helped me see where my money was going, and using my Klarna Card gives me the flexibility to pay now or plan a purchase to pay later.”</p>
