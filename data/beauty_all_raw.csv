<p>When <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11939743/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt’s</a></em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/shabanaazeez_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shabana Azeez</a> talks about her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/changing-surname-career-ethnic-discrimination"">career,</a> she traces it back to a single, almost accidental moment of kindness that allowed her to follow a dream that had always been inside her. “I got into acting because a lady was really nice to me one time,” she says, laughing. It sounds flippant, but it’s the truth. She grew up in a family where the arts were not encouraged, academics were the priority, and despite wanting to act her whole life, she never studied drama at school. It wasn’t until she was working at Mercury CX, an emerging filmmakers’ hub in Adelaide, Australia, that someone finally asked her the right question.</p>



<p>Her boss pulled her aside. “She said, ‘You’re great, but this isn’t your passion. What is it?’ And I was like, ‘Well, I’d like to act, but I’ve literally never acted before.'” Within an hour, her boss had secured her an audition for a short film, and she booked it, with no prior acting experience. That led her to secure roles in the animated <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gemma-chua-tran-lesbian-space-princess-queer"">Lesbian Space Princess</a></em> and the coercive-control thriller <em>Bird Eater</em>. She expresses the same mix of gratitude as she talks about her leap from Australian indie television to <a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HBO’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Pitt</a></em><a href=""https://www.hbomax.com/shows/pitt-2024/e6e7bad9-d48d-4434-b334-7c651ffc4bdf"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">.</a> The contrast, she says, is both extreme and strangely familiar. “It’s chalk and cheese in some ways, and exactly the same in others,” she explains. The budgets are bigger, the access is better, on <em>The Pitt</em>, she can consult real doctors and benefit from an army of specialists, but the core remains unchanged. “Everyone cares about the story.”</p>



<p>When Shabana first read the script for<em> The Pitt </em>she described it as information overload. “It’s like ten series regulars and then a bunch of recurring characters, and then all the patients, and all the names for the doctors are surnames. So you can’t be like, ‘Who’s a woman? Who’s a man? What are their age?’ There’s no clues. I had to go out and buy more highlighters and color-code the entire script,” she says. The audition process for <em>The Pitt </em>was surprisingly lowkey: a single self-tape, followed by a Zoom scheduled for twenty minutes that wrapped after just nine minutes. When the call ended early, she assumed it was a bad sign. “I cried for half an hour afterwards,” she says. “The Zoom was nine minutes. The emotional recovery was three times that.” So when she landed the role, and learned the production would sponsor her visa and fly her halfway across the world it came as a genuine shock.</p>



<p>Moving to LA was, in her words, “horrible in so many ways” and yet also strangely exhilarating. There was a joy in not knowing what came next, in stepping into something undefined. “To not know what you’re stepping into, and to have that curiosity, that scared feeling, that’s what life is about,” she says. Once in Los Angeles, the emotional weight of the move fully settled in. “Oh my god, I knew no one,” she says. “I truly knew not a single person in LA.” That isolation became especially clear during her first days at work. Sitting at lunch during boot camp, she watched as coworkers casually texted friends and loved ones. “Everybody was texting their friends, and I was like, I have no friends to text. They’re all asleep,” she says. “That was really lonely and really scary,” she adds.</p>



<p>Everything shifted when she formed a close friendship with co-star Supriya Ganesh, who plays Dr Samira Mohan. Their bond deepened quickly. “I adore her. I think the world of her,” she says simply. “She’s my best friend.” That sense of shared experience extended into their professional lives as well. Shabana notes that her character wasn’t originally written to be South Asian, but the production pivoted after her audition. “I remember thinking that would never happen because they already had a ‘brown girl’,” she says, pointing to the unspoken limits that still shape representation on screen. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“All of our experiences in the world are embodied experiences, and mine is that of a young brown woman, and that’s not going to change. It was so healing to have somebody there with me.”</p><cite>Shabana azeez</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Season one was filmed in near-total anonymity. By season two, the shift was impossible to ignore. Filming now overlapped with awards season; days were spent on set, nights at the Golden Globes or Critics’ Choice Awards. The pace was punishing. “I got flu-level sick three times,” she admits. Still, amid the noise and spectacle, the work itself never changed. “The show is the same to make,” she says. “And that’s really grounding.” In <em>The Pitt</em>, Shabana plays Victoria, a medical student, a role that could easily collapse into the familiar model minority archetype: hyper-competent, genius-level, and primarily functional. But Shabana was intent on resisting that flattening, shaping Victoria into a character defined as much by her flaws as her intelligence. “When we talk about excellence or prodigies, we tend to think, ‘Let’s play that,’” she says. “But that’s not really how people work. When you’re very good at something, you usually have a deficit that’s just as powerful. For Victoria, it’s social. She’s deeply socially inept.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958220.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>What she loves most about acting is the research. “It’s an exercise in empathy,” she says. Through projects like <em>Bird Eater</em>, where she researched stories of emotional abuse, she found it changed her not only as an actor, but as a person. “Every woman I spoke to had a story. It genuinely changed my life.” Rather than focusing solely on the medical aspects of her role, she immersed herself in romance novels, glossy American teen dramas, and studies of loneliness. Victoria, she explains, is “building a life she doesn’t really want,” and fantasy becomes a form of escape. By Season Two, the show allows that internal tension to surface. “We really dig into the icky parts, her jealousy, her exhaustion, her sharpness. She fails a lot. And I think that’s what actually dismantles the model minority myth.”</p>



<p>When I asked Shabana how she stays grounded amid the whirlwind success of <em>The Pitt</em>, she laughs. “My little brother keeps me really grounded. Honestly, they kind of bully me about it, which is actually kind of helpful. When I went home for Christmas, every time I tried to speak and someone interrupted me, my brother would be like, ‘Everybody, excuse me — Hollywood is trying to speak.’ Before I said anything, my uncle would be like, ‘Action.’ It’s that kind of teasing that reminds me it’s just a job.”</p>



<p>“It brings me back to earth. It’s meaningful work, but it’s art, it’s play, and it’s fun, it’s not brain surgery. I think there’s a real danger of people taking themselves too seriously, and my family bullying me actually really helps with that.”<br /><br /><strong><em>Season 2 of The Pitt is now streaming on HBO MAX . </em></strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2026-02-11/emerald-fennell-wuthering-heights-jacob-elordi-margot-robbie"">Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> opens with a scene I hated so much, I almost walked out of the theater. Don’t worry, it goes up from there! The scene in question is a hanging. Two feet dangle from a guillotine as an onlooker jokes about the lifeless body’s final unconscious act: a hard on. It’s mentioned later that the perpetrator was a rapist. So the glee in which the spectators (including <a href=""https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Catherine_Earnshaw"">Catherine “Cathy” Earnshaw</a>) gawk at his erect penis while he is strangled to death is justified. I understand the point — that the story about to unfold is equal parts morbid, horny, irreverent, and uncomfortable — but it just felt like a cheap ploy for shock and awe. The good news is that the rest of the film deals with these conflicting emotions more effectively. And Catherine’s (played in her early years by Charlotte Mellington) curiosity for sex and macabre runs throughout the story, creating a fascinating duality of romance and toxicity, the things <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wuthering-heights-emily-bronte-life?srsltid=AfmBOopEfPLX2S82YU3O5iTObCpeBNCYdMcrYMhooysjNkTh80SZTpkD"">Emily Brontë’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> are known for. But this opening scene is very different from the book’s, and it was just one reason (of many) why I’m glad the Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is white. </p>



<p>Depending on who you ask, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/was-emily-bront-s-heathcliff-black-85341"">Brontë’s Heathcliff is supposed to be Black or Brown</a>, since he’s described in the novel as a “dark-skinned gypsy in aspect” and a “dirty, ragged, black-haired child.” Another description: “as dark almost as if it came from the devil.” In a <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/heathcliff-wuthering-heights-white-jacob-elordi-casting.html?regwall-newsletter-signup=true"">piece for Vulture called <em>Is Heathcliff White?</em>,</a> Jasmine Vojdani writes that, “The idea that Heathcliff might be of African descent first entered academic discussion in the 1950s and gained momentum as postcolonial studies became more popular in the ’80s and ’90s. Scholars have argued that the proximity of Liverpool — one of the biggest slave ports at the time in which Wuthering Heights is set — to the Brontës’ home in Haworth cannot be overlooked.” Vojdani interviews scholars and tries to get to the bottom of this mystery surrounding one of literature’s most famous leading men. One scholar says, “He is both based on the boy of an Indian ruler who’d been orphaned because of the East India Company battles. But he’s also based on an Ashanti warrior’s son.” Another: “The feeling that he should be of African heritage, I think that is interference coming in from [Brontë] sister’s book. Because we do know that in Jane Eyre, Bertha Rochester is born in Jamaica.” Ultimately, Vojdani decides, “By Victorian standards, he’s definitely not white — and likely by ours as well. Is Heathcliff Black? Maybe! It is both historically and textually viable, but he isn’t necessarily Black.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959122.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=569&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A569"" /></figure>



<p>We can debate Brontë’s intentions for decades (and clearly, scholars have), but what’s true in this adaptation is that a white Australian man (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/feb/11/is-jacob-elordi-really-the-hottest-man-on-the-planet-six-things-you-need-to-know"">Jacob Elordi</a>) and a white British boy (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/adolescence-netflix-race-debate-incel-red-pill-culture"">Owen Cooper</a>) play Heathcliff. After watching the film, honestly, it’s for the best. I am not encouraging whitewashing, which let’s be clear is exactly what this adaptation and many before it have done, but aside from what implications could be drawn from a movie starring a Black man opening with a lynching, I just don’t think this <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2026/02/12/wuthering-heights-movie-heathcliff/"">love story</a> is one I would want to see, or engage in the discourse, if it was a man of color seducing and obsessing over a white woman in this way.</p>



<p>When they are grownups, Heathcliff and Cathy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/margotrobbieofficial/?hl=en"">Margot Robbie</a>) have a tumultuous and toxic relationship. Heathcliff is surly, cruel, and vindictive. He emotionally terrorizes Isabella Linton (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alisonjoliver/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alison Oliver</a>) because he can’t have Cathy. So much so that at a certain point, Isabella crawls on the floor like a dog as he holds onto her collar and makes her bark. While Isabella seems to enjoy this roleplay, it’s uncomfortable to watch. It would take skill, care and precision to pull off this kind of sexual deviance and kink between a consenting couple, let alone between one with a problematic age gap, and power imbalance. I like how female desire is depicted through Isabella, but throw race into the mix and to be frank, I just don’t think Fennell has the range. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959124.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure></div>



<p>Based on what scholars have deduced and what Brontë wrote, Heathcliff was probably Brown, which is interesting considering Fennell cast Pakistani-British actor Shazad Latif as Edgar Linton, Cathy’s husband, who was definitely white in the books. His race is not mentioned in the movie. And neither is <a href=""https://people.com/wuthering-heights-alison-oliver-hong-chau-interview-exclusive-11895056"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hong Chau’s Nelly</a> (played in youth by Vy Nguyen), Cathy’s live-in maid and best friend, also a white character who is now reimagined as Asian. There’s a brief mention of Nelly’s race, when Cathy’s father says something that implies she should be grateful he took her in. Otherwise, the way race would factor into their volatile friendship is never explored. In another writer-director’s hands, this story would be rife for mining the racial and class tensions of the era. With the right storyteller, I’m all for showing flawed characters of color in toxic relationships. They don’t have to be perfect representations of their race. But, again, I don’t think Fennell has any intention, or the competency, to tackle all of that in her work.  </p>



<p>You realize early on what Fennell is doing. And that this <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is not a straightforward adaptation; it’s her own personal fantasy. She said as much on the <a href=""https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/uk/lifestyle/a70174020/wuthering-heights-film-changes/"">red carpet for the LA premiere</a>: “Everyone who loves this book has such a personal connection to it, and so you can only kind of ever make the movie that you sort of imagined yourself when you read it.” In Fennell’s fantasy, Heathcliff couldn’t possibly be anything but a tall, white man that looks like Elordi. Heathcliff is an object of desire and Fennell’s desires cannot extend beyond her worldview, and clearly, that world is very white. Which is fine, actually. She can make the movie she wants to. And I’d rather not watch a story told by a rich, white woman about the twisted proclivities of a Black or Brown man. I wouldn’t want to see it, and I wasn’t holding my breath waiting for it. And it’s telling that in Fennell’s fantasy, the only people of color, Nelly and Edgar,  are characters who Cathy uses and discards at her pleasure. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I’m not trying to be condescending, I just genuinely didn’t expect a nuanced rumination on class, race, desire, and abuse from this movie. I watched the trailers, heard Robbie and Fennell talk about the movie, and I’ve seen Fennell’s previous films (which I didn’t hate!). I knew what they were trying to do with <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. It’s the spiritual equivalent to the genre of toxic white mess that unfolds in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/12/10785227/succession-black-characters-season-3-review"">TV hits like <em>Succession</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>The White Lotus</em></a><em>.</em> It’s a continuation of the recent trend of modern, magically race-bent, colorblind retellings of beloved literary works, like Netflix’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/08/11082731/color-blind-casting-cons-bridgerton-persuasion""><em>Bridgerton </em>and<em> Persuasion</em></a><em>, </em>and Apple TV’s <a href=""https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-buccaneers/umc.cmc.g28hcpusm23xbs9zwvnwn9re""><em>The Buccaneers</em></a><em>. </em>It was never going to be that deep. But all <a href=""https://preview.refinery29.com/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl?type_id=11958540&amp;site=us&amp;edition_id=1&amp;app=rosetta&amp;type=blog_entry"">art is political</a>, so yes, while white filmmakers should know better and <em>do</em> better, I would rather spend my time championing original work from Black and Brown filmmakers and storytellers than wish<strong> </strong>for a non-white Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. I think that’s a waste of time. There is inevitably going to be an onslaught of thinkpieces and TikTok rants dedicated to chastising this casting. Sure, let’s call out whitewashing, but instead of expending all our energy on begging for scraps from white Hollywood, let’s support our own. </p>



<p>I’d rather focus on making sure <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7574286690517404958""><em>The Gilded Age</em></a><em> </em>gets 17 seasons (its co-showrunner is <a href=""https://deadline.com/2025/10/the-gilded-age-sonja-warfield-anonymous-content-1236590863/"">Sonja Warfield</a>, a Black woman) and the upcoming adaptation of <a href=""https://deadline.com/2024/03/the-davenports-ya-novel-prime-video-alloy-entertainment-1235846686/""><em>The Davenports</em></a><em> </em>(also brought to you by Warfield), gets all the hype it deserves than try to make this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>into something it was never going to be. I’d rather watch <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belle-bridgerton-black-period-drama"">Amma Asante’s <em>Belle</em></a> again and support whatever work she’s got in the pipeline. I’d rather execs greenlight anything and everything <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11939097/hedda-movie-review-tessa-thompson-interview"">Nia DaCosta is going to do next</a>. I’d rather uplift <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/alyssa-cole-when-no-one-is-watching-interview"">Alyssa Cole</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ladriana_herrera/?hl=en"">Adrianna Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://vanessariley.com/"">Vanessa Riley</a>, and the countless other Black and Brown woman historical romance writers than force Fennell to change her warped fantastical version of Heathcliff and Cathy’s ill-fated love story into anything other than what it is. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959136.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>So let’s get into what <em>is</em> onscreen and whether that is worth your time. This may surprise you, but I actually think it might be. When I settled into Fennell’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em> world, and got over the unnecessary shock tactic of that opening scene, I started to enjoy myself. I was entertained. Elordi and Robbie (who the internet also swore was miscast because of her age) are electric together. I think their chemistry makes the whole thing worth it. </p>



<p>In the story that Fennell is telling, their chemistry is the one thing that needs to work, and it does. I believe that these two people would tear the world — and themselves — apart to be together. I also believe that they want to tear each other’s clothes off. They are so down bad for each other, inanimate objects that are slightly sexual set them ablaze. Chemistry often feels like a lost art and it was refreshing to see good, old-fashioned, horny-ass onscreen attraction. And for the first time, I understood the global thirst for Jacob Elordi. While Robbie’s Cathy is spunky, stubborn, and independent, Elordi’s Heathcliff is brooding, desperate, and clingy. He’s a real yearner and this may mean that I need some serious therapy, but I was <em>into it. </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959130.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /></figure>



<p>A friend of mine went to an early screening of the movie as well and his review was simply, “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzPpZwSDcRo"">gowns, beautiful gowns</a>” and he’s not wrong, but I think it’s more than that. The costumes are absurd, but in this cinematic world, that’s a compliment! This movie thrives in absurdity and extravagance. There were moments when Robbie as Cathy walked into the frame and I had an audible reaction to her costume. Sure, at times, that took me out of the story, but if they were going to gasp-inducing costume design moments, they succeeded. Visually, <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is stunning. It nails the gloomy, overcast foreboding rolling hills that the source material describes while also injecting shots of color, humor, and exuberance into the film’s aesthetic. In spite of the depressing subject matter, this <em>Wuthering Heights </em>is more camp than melancholy. </p>



<p>The film will probably never beat the style over substance accusations, understandably, but for me, the performances are the best part. Chau is perfectly exasperated and defiant. Latif is doting and oblivious yet likeable. Oliver is intoxicating and exhilarating to watch. And Elordi and Robbie lean so hard into the <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/review-finally-a-smooth-brained-wuthering-heights.html"">“smooth-brained sensuality”</a> of Fennell’s adaptation that it’s not hard to believe they were <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/news/1427555/jacob-elordi-margot-robbie-bond-on-wuthering-heights-set"">obsessed with each other on set</a>. </p>



<p>The audiences who show up to the theater on Valentine’s Day hoping for a feel-good romance may leave a bit traumatized (just like I was when I first read <em>Wuthering Heights </em>in high school), but they’ll also buy into the splendor and pageantry of this movie. And they’ll understand why Elordi and Robbie are two of the most in-demand talents of their generation. I do wish that a Black-led, Black-directed film — or one made by and for people of color — was getting the same over-the-top treatment, star-making potential, and <em>budget</em>, but until we start yelling more about why we aren’t seeing those stories greenlit, funded, and released, we’ll be stuck in our own fantasy. Fennell’s warped, whimsical, white-as-hell fever dream may be a compelling watch, but it’s <em>her </em>imagination come to life. I want to imagine a world in which the weird whims of Black and Brown filmmakers are able to be awakened too. </p>

<p>If, like me, your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skincare routine</a> rarely stretches beyond a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-hydrating-cream-to-milk-cleanser-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">simple cleanser</a> and a basic moisturizer <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">or serum</a> — but this is the year you’ve vowed to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skincare-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">step things up a notch</a> — then investing in an LED light wand might just be the answer. </p>



<p>Chances are your TikTok feed is already flooded with influencers and skincare enthusiasts bathing in red, green — even purple — light, with full-coverage <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-light-face-masks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED masks</a> the sci-fi tool of choice. But as a beauty director who’s tried most of them, some can be heavy and uncomfortable, leave you feeling sweaty, or make it seem like your eyes are taking a hit. (How people manage to read or watch TV while wearing them, I’ll never know.) </p>



<p>For me, LED wands offer a far more comfortable — and not to mention more targeted — experience. </p>



<h2>What are LED wands and what are the skincare benefits? </h2>



<p>LED wands offer everything you love about an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED mask</a> — often harnessing red and blue light — but in a far more compact form. Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/daniellegambleskin/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Danielle Gamble</a> says, “Red light builds collagen, speeds cellular repair [essentially healing skin], and calms inflammation.” Sure enough, several studies have found that red light can help <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10311288/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">boost collagen and elastin,</a> two things that keep skin strong and supple.  </p>



<p>Then there’s blue light: “[This] helps kill acne-causing bacteria and reduces active breakouts,” says Gamble. While there’s less research on blue light and skin, mounting anecdotal evidence suggests it’s especially useful for treating pimples. I’m convinced that <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Fmedicube-age-r-booster-pro-pink-edition-1-set-english-version%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1130943349"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medicube’s Booster Pro</a> helped significantly minimize a large, painful chin breakout recently. LED wands are also nifty enough to reach trickier areas, like under the eyes. </p>



<h2>What’s the difference between an LED wand and an LED mask? </h2>



<p>Gamble says, “Wands are typically more cost-effective and allow for targeted treatment, which is useful if you’re focusing on specific areas like active breakouts or fine lines.” The trade-off? “They require manual use, so you need to hold the wand and move it from area to area,” she adds. </p>



<p>Because LED wands only work when applied correctly and consistently, Gamble recommends regular, measured use. While she says that masks are <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-beauty-led-face-mask-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">better for full-face results</a>, wands excel at spot treatment and precise application. </p>



<h2>Who are LED wands best suited for? </h2>



<p>LED wands may take a bit more attention and thought than an LED mask, but Gamble says handheld wands are ideal for targeted concerns: “Think the occasional breakout or fine lines in a specific area you want to address,” she says. </p>



<p>Intrigued? Here are the best LED wands to add to your wish list, depending on your skin concerns.  </p>

<p>My beauty editor peers can’t stop talking about this smart LED wand, and that’s because it does the most. The electroporation setting helps thick moisturizers and masks sink into the skin, while the gentle microcurrent acts like Pilates for facial muscles, boosting firmness instantly and over time. But it’s the light settings that really make it worth the price. Blue light helps calm raised pimples, red light encourages skin healing, green light is said to boost <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10084420/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">collagen production</a>, and orange light <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6181673/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">supports skin repair</a>. I like that it’s lightweight, which makes targeting specific areas much less of a chore. I reach for it whenever I have a hormonal pimple that concealer can’t cover — and I’m pretty sure it helps deflate them. </p>

<p>This slim wand may look unassuming, but it’s like a mini at-home facial. I — and hundreds of other reviewers — love that it warms up, making every pass over stressed skin feel incredibly soothing. Beyond its comforting heat, the rotating wand also uses red light to help stimulate collagen and elastin, and its compact size means it can easily reach under the eyes where fine lines often appear. </p>

<p>This LED device is a bit chunkier than others, but that actually works in its favor since it covers a larger surface area, making it excellent value for money. It’s especially handy for bigger zones like the jawline, cheeks, or forehead, and it even comes with goggles to protect your eyes. The multiple red-light wavelengths help reduce inflammation, calming redness from clusters of pimples. </p>

<p>NuFace devices are beloved by R29 staff — and for good reason: the brand thinks of absolutely everything. At its core, this is an LED device, packed with red, amber, and infrared lights. Skin absorbs red and infrared light more easily, helping to kickstart regeneration and encourage newer, healthier skin cells. It also includes a microcurrent attachment with conductor gels. When used consistently, microcurrent can provide a temporary lift. You can even pair it with an app to boost the power. Genius. </p>

<p>This tool cleverly combines red and blue lights to increase collagen in the skin and help eliminate the bacteria that can cause breakouts. The five-star reviews speak for themselves, with users noting reduced acne and less severe scarring. Even better, it’s fast — treatments last just three minutes, and the device automatically shuts off when time’s up. Again, consistency is key to achieving good results. </p>

<p>This wand was designed with delicate skin in mind, especially the under-eyes. Depending on the concern you want to target, you can switch the panel between blue and red light. Treatments take just five to 10 minutes, so you can use it while watching TV or getting ready for bed. The heat and vibration feel especially good because you’re meant to maneuver it over the face; it requires a little more thought than other wands, but the process feels therapeutic. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/luxury-valentines-day-gifts"">Happy Valentine’s Day!</a> This year, we are reflecting on the importance of connection and acceptance — not from others, but from the relationship we have with ourselves.</p>



<p>Be warned though as the Waning Crescent Moon in Capricorn brings an unexpected twist. This is due to the presence of Uranus in Taurus, which means we may push traditional celebratory rituals to the side and opt for unique ways to enjoy the festivities instead. The healing centaur Chiron, which is in Aries, helps us discover that the purest and best love is how we love ourselves. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that Mercury is in the midst of its pre-retrograde shadow, which began on February 11th. The planetary moonwalk commences on the 26th, twelve days <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/valentines-day-tarot-reading-2026"">after Valentine’s Day</a>, and is plotting and sussing out the story, so beware of mishaps, missteps, unforeseen issues, travel delays, the resurrection of exes, and awkward moments. Hopefully, we can laugh it off and rise above it all. Be joyful and lean into the good vibes! </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Aries </h3>



<p>Aries, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/specific-horny-turn-ons-dating"">hard launching your relationship</a> is not only going to make your crush/significant other extremely happy, but also make them more positive about the future. By being open with friends and family about your partnership and feelings, you’ll have the confidence to take things to the next level. They will want to take the leap into the future with you as well!</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Taurus </h3>



<p>Taurus, the weather outside might be frightful, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t connect with nature on Valentine’s Day. You might decide to take refuge by going for a walk in an enchanting botanical garden while sipping hot chocolate or building a snowman with your boo. It’ll be a breath of fresh air to be out and then warm up together.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Gemini </h3>



<p>Gemini, hit the pedal to the metal and go on a local road trip with your partner, friends, or yourself. Getting out of town for a hot minute will let you feel free and adventurous. Exploring new places and spaces evokes a sense of wonder, passion, excitement, and interest for your Mercurial spirit. Go on, take a journey out of town.<br /></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Cancer </h3>



<p>Cancer, cupid’s arrow is pushing you to shoot your shot and ask bae out. In preparation for the date, you’ll text heart eyes and fire emojis to get your flirt on. In the interim, you both will share amusing stories and thirst traps. Before you know it, you’ll take the plunge to DTR the ship on the fringe of cuffing season. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Leo </h3>



<p>Leo, treat the greatest love of your life — YOU — to a fancy meal or night out. Whatever you decide to do, the aim is to connect with yourself. Make sure you’re getting all the attention and adoration in the world. This means sending yourself a Valentine’s Day card and a bouquet of roses, with encouraging messages. Do you, Leo!</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Virgo </h3>



<p>Virgo, an ex who you’re still lusting after could make a reappearance, asking you to hang out. Regardless of the past, you’ll meet up with them for a coffee. Be cautious about what you reveal about your current situation and mindful of the questions you ask. You don’t want to be caught up in the same cycle — especially not today. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Libra </h3>



<p>Libra, staying at home and ordering takeout may not be glamorous, but you’ll make it fabulous with your creative talents. You’ll slay a slice of a heart-shaped pizza with bae while sitting by the fireplace watching a rom-com. The good news is that you’ll get to pick the movie and get cozy. The heat keeps you warm from cuddling and canoodling.<br /></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Scorpio </h3>



<p>Scorpio, intimacy doesn’t come easy for most, but not for you this Valentine’s Day. Luckily, you’re able to connect with someone special on a deep level. By discussing your hopes, goals, and fears, you are breaking down the barriers that keep others at arm’s length. Now, they can get to know the real you, and vice versa. Sharing is caring, Scorpio.<br /></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Sagittarius </h3>



<p>Sag, your bank account might be taking a hit, urging you to spend the holiday balling on a budget. There are many activities you can partake in that do not require you to go overboard, like making your own cards, writing a poem or song, and cooking dinner as a couple. Your plans will be low-key and fun.<br /></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Capricorn</h3>



<p>Cap, you are pulling out all the stops this year, trying to impress your boo with over-the-top declarations and gifts. Instead of purchasing high-end presents, use your words. Communicating your feelings is the best way to show you care, because it is authentic and what your Valentine yearns to hear. In return, they will give you something equally important and meaningful.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Aquarius </h3>



<p>Aquarius, a little bit of rest is an ideal endeavor to evoke self-love. Book the spa day appointment that you’ve been dreaming of. Whether you opt to go solo or with others, the objective is to unwind and wash away your worries. A massage, body scrub, or yoga class will set the chill mood and heighten your vibration. Make it a self-care day.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Pisces </h3>

<p>On September 29, 2025, 49-year-old Arturo Ruvalcaba, who is deaf, was waiting at a bus stop near Salt Lake City to head back home from work. As Ruvalcaba, who is originally from Mexico, waited, three SUVs arrived at the stop and two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents approached him. They were wearing green uniforms, bulletproof vests (one with “ICE” written on it), and their faces were partially covered. The agents asked for Ruvalcaba’s ID and shouted commands, but given his disability, Ruvalcaba couldn’t hear them. Through gestures and signing, he tried to tell agents that he’s deaf, but the agents continued to approach him. </p>



<p>While Ruvalcaba was trying to find his green card — to show his status as a permanent resident — one of the agents applied pressure over his shoulders, while another one pulled one of his arms, injuring him. When Ruvalcaba was able to show them his identification and his green card, the ICE agents left the area, according to court documents and Ruvalcaba’s lawyer, Jared Allebest.</p>



<p>Once at home, “he showed me his arm, and [it] was completely swollen from the elbow down to his wrist,” Natalie Ruvalcaba, his wife, tells Refinery29 Somos. “We took him to the doctor the next day, and the doctor said he had sprained his elbow, so he needed to start physical therapy.” </p>



<p>The following week, Ruvalcaba tried to go back to work, but he was in a lot of pain. Following another doctor’s visit, and because of the swelling and pain, he had to take several weeks of unpaid leave from work.</p>



<p>“It was a very scary situation,” Ruvalcaba adds. “I was very angry that this happened because all he was doing was waiting for the bus.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I was very angry that this happened because all he was doing was waiting for the bus.”</p><cite>Natalie Ruvalcaba</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In November, Ruvalcaba, who has three young children and has been in the U.S. for more than 22 years, filed <a href=""https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/12/13/deaf-utahn-sues-ice-federal/"">a lawsuit</a> against the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, and other federal officials, alleging violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and discrimination due to his disability, including failure to provide him with an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/142324/sign-language-baby-dad-song"">American Sign Language</a> (ASL) interpreter to be able to properly communicate.</p>



<p>As ICE agents continue to swarm U.S. cities as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, detaining and deporting people en masse, and often <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2026/01/09/us/dhs-immigration-crackdown-ice-arrests-protests-vis/"">using aggressive</a> and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minnesota-ice-violence-tactics-videos.html"">violent tactics</a>, advocates and lawyers say there has also been an increase in cases similar to Ruvalcaba’s, in which deaf immigrants are detained without being provided appropriate sign language interpretation. (Despite repeated requests for comment, neither the Department of Homeland Security nor ICE responded.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959000.jpeg?width=726&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=363%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>Celena Ponce, the founder of <a href=""https://handsunitedor.org/otros"">Hands United</a>, a nonprofit organization that provides immigration services for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, says that over the last six months, she’s worked with four immigrants detained in states, including Texas, Georgia, and Washington, who have not been given sign language interpretation weeks into their detention. </p>



<p>Howard Rosenblum, the founder and chair of <a href=""https://deafequality.org/"">Deaf Equality</a>, an advocacy organization led by deaf attorneys like himself, says that while there’s always been issues with ICE and their communication access, he is aware of several cases including, among many <a href=""https://www.dailynews.com/2026/02/01/deaf-la-teenager-says-immigration-officers-assaulted-him-for-not-heeding-commands/"">others</a>, a deaf <a href=""https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/daca-immigrant-with-disabilities-recalls-terrifying-ice-arrest/3753758/"">Mexican DACA recipient from California</a> who was detained in El Paso, Texas, for weeks without an interpreter; and a <a href=""https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/man-with-physical-developmental-disabilities-in-wa-ice-detention/"">nearly deaf 21-year-old man with a developmental disability</a> who was detained in Tacoma, Washington, and was also <a href=""https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/man-pending-release-ice-custody/3972345/"">not provided adequate interpretation</a>.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“As ICE agents continue to swarm U.S. cities as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, detaining and deporting people en masse, … advocates and lawyers say there has also been an increase in cases similar to Ruvalcaba’s, in which deaf immigrants are detained without being provided appropriate sign language interpretation.”</p><cite>Valeria Ricciulli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Another one of those cases is Avirmed’s, a 49-year-old <a href=""https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/07/deaf-immigrant-released-from-detention/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">deaf Mongolian immigrant</a> who was detained in San Diego for five months without access to interpretation in his main language, Mongolian Sign Language (MSL). </p>



<p>Mr. Avirmed, who prefers to go by his last name, has a traumatic brain injury. Last year, he decided to come to the U.S. to meet his sister, who is a U.S. citizen. When he entered the southern border on February 15, 2025, Mr. Avirmed showed a letter, translated to English, where he expressed his intent to apply for asylum. According to court documents, the Border Patrol agents refused to accept or read the letter, and instead transferred him to ICE custody without providing MSL interpretation. </p>



<p>Even though Ms. Avirmed, his sister (who also prefers to be identified by her last name), kept informing ICE that he needed MSL interpretation, agents kept trying to communicate with Mr. Avirmed in ASL, which he doesn’t understand. “He went through hell,” Ms. Avirmed tells Somos. “He just didn’t understand what was going on around him. He never expected that he would be detained that long.” One of the times she was able to talk to him via a Zoom call, he said he was exhausted because agents kept forgetting he was deaf and kept trying to call his name. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“He went through hell. He just didn’t understand what was going on around him.”</p><cite>Ms. Avirmed</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>During one of the calls, she taught him some English words, and the letters “D-E-A-F,” so he could wear them on his shirt for agents to remember. Another time, she tried to talk to him in MSL through a device provided to him, but the device automatically blurred the background when they were signing, so they couldn’t understand each other. “We went through a lot, it was such a hard time,” she says. “Every time I called and talked to him, I would cry.”</p>



<p>According to Ms. Avirmed, the only times her brother had access to MSL interpretation were when she found an interpreter herself and paid out of pocket, so her brother could properly communicate with his attorney. (Following a July court order, Mr. Avirmed was <a href=""https://disabilitylawunited.org/2025/07/24/deaf-mongolian-asylum-seeker-released-from-ice-custody-following-federal-court-order-requiring-disability-accommodations/"">released</a> and has now reunited with his sister, as he continues with his asylum case.)</p>



<p><strong>ICE is required by law to provide accommodations for immigrants with disabilities</strong></p>



<p>According to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, all federal agencies, including ICE, are <a href=""https://www.ice.gov/leadership/ocrc/disability-access"">required by law</a> to provide equal access for people with disabilities to all “programs, activities, and services,” which includes providing deaf detainees with accommodations such as sign language interpreters and other communication services.</p>



<p>“If someone cannot effectively communicate, then how are these folks [supposed] to navigate being in detention,” says Laura Murchie, staff attorney at Disability Law United, who represented Avirmed. “[Detainees] need to be able to communicate with their lawyer. They need to be able to examine and defend themselves against any evidence the government attorney might put on. They need to understand the proceedings as they’re happening.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“If someone cannot effectively communicate, then how are these folks [supposed] to navigate being in detention?”</p><cite>Laura Murchie</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Murchie adds that deaf individuals also need to be able to communicate (via a tablet or videophone, for example) to make medical requests, to be able to buy something from the commissary, or to talk with their loved ones. </p>



<p><strong>American Sign Language is not universal</strong></p>



<p>Ponce explains that there are many nuances when it comes to sign language interpretation. One of them is that not all deaf people know sign language in the first place, so they may have their own gestures that are not part of a formal language. </p>



<p>Additionally, as Avirmed’s case proved, “every country has its own sign language, so just because someone comes from a Spanish-speaking country does not mean they need Spanish Sign language,” Ponce adds. “They need to use Mexican Sign Language, Colombian Sign Language, Venezuelan Sign Language … which is why it’s really important to know what country someone is from when you’re trying to get accommodations for a deaf individual.” </p>



<p>Ponce adds that over the past few months, there’s been instances in which interpreters in foreign sign languages have tried to enter ICE detention centers to interpret for deaf detainees, but they were not allowed in because they were asked for a certification — but there is currently no certification in the U.S. for languages other than ASL. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Every country has its own sign language, so just because someone comes from a Spanish-speaking country does not mean they need Spanish Sign language. They need to use Mexican Sign Language, Colombian Sign Language, Venezuelan Sign Language … which is why it’s really important to know what country someone is from when you’re trying to get accommodations for a deaf individual.”</p><cite>Celena Ponce</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Besides not having access to the sign language they use to communicate, deaf and hard of hearing immigrants detained by ICE may face other barriers. For instance, if a person’s hands are cuffed behind their back, they can’t communicate. And once in detention, they might be given tools like the one Avirmed used, where the background of a video is automatically blurred. “And because sign language very much depends on the shape of your hand and which fingers you have up, if your hand is blurred, you’re not able to know what that person is saying,” she adds.</p>



<p>Finally, Ponce adds that it’s important to keep in mind that a deaf person’s first language is sign language, so relying on reading and writing as a way to communicate while in detention is the equivalent of asking a person to go through an entire legal process in their second language. “Regardless of how much education you’ve had in that language, people obviously still prefer their first language,” she adds. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Communication access is not a courtesy; it is a legal requirement, and ICE’s violations of these requirements put deaf individuals’ lives at risk.”</p><cite>Howard Rosenblum</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As <a href=""https://www.nj.com/hudson/2026/02/ice-is-breaking-families-apart-12-year-old-says-amid-raids-in-nj-city.html"">ICE raids continue</a>, organizations like Hands United and Deaf Equality have several resources to help the deaf community in case they are approached or detained by ICE, including <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/16daxkMvOyyFnlocwfj4B471exwoMYYn1/view"">printable “Know Your Rights” cards</a> to carry, <a href=""https://handsunitedor.org/programs/immigration-support/kyr"">translated into several sign languages</a>; printable <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OTmVwvIq9h2ntIJuCkol6lKGhCsHSPv9"">ICE communication boards</a>, a <a href=""https://deafequality.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DE_ICE_TEMPLATE.pdf"">downloadable letter</a> that explains their rights, and a <a href=""https://deafequality.org/2025/09/22/ice/"">video on what deaf and hard of hearing</a> individuals should know about ICE. </p>



<p>Most importantly, though, the deaf community, advocates, and attorneys are calling for the agency to follow the law and provide the required accommodations. </p>



<p>“When deaf individuals cannot understand why they are being arrested, where they are being taken, or communicate with staff at detention facilities; when they are denied communication access during high-stakes immigration hearings; and when they have no ability to contact family members or an attorney, the legal, psychological, and physical consequences can be severe,” Rosenblum concludes. “Communication access is not a courtesy; it is a legal requirement, and ICE’s violations of these requirements put deaf individuals’ lives at risk.” <br /></p>

My salary is steady and predictable, but my husband works in film/TV, which is very unpredictable. Work was very slow during the pandemic and SAG-AFTRA/WGA strikes in the US, but he’s worked a lot more over the past year and will bring in about $80,000 this year. This also includes some very part-time graphic design work that he does on the side, and employment insurance when he’s not working. We also receive $542.50 from the government each year of Canada Child Benefit ($45.20 a month). My husband and I combine our finances. We have a joint credit card, bank accounts, and savings, which I manage, plus individual credit cards (for gifts etc.) and separate investments.<br /><strong>Assets:</strong> <br />Registered Retirement Savings Plan [RRSP]: $127,000 <br />Tax-Free Savings Account [TFSA]: $39,200 <br />Locked-In Retirement Account [LIRA]: $29,300<br />First Home Savings Account [FHSA]: $3,000<br />Husband’s RRSP: $74,491<br />Husband’s TFSA: $32,950<br />Joint Emergency Savings: $10,000<br />Joint Savings: $50,300<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $0<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $4,395<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $3,998 for a two-bed, one-bath apartment, parking space, and storage locker. <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> n/a<br /><strong>Electricity:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Internet:</strong> $78<br /><strong>Daycare:</strong> $1060 (the full price would be $1605, but the government provides a $545 subsidy).<br /><strong>Gym:</strong> $90<br /><strong>House Cleaner:</strong> $90<br /><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> $31.64<br /><strong>Phone:</strong> $218 ($68 for me, $150 for my husband)<br /><strong>Tenants Insurance:</strong> $26.39<br /><strong>Car Insurance:</strong> $157.92<br /><strong>Pet Insurance:</strong> $302<br /><strong>NYT:</strong> $2.10<br /><strong>Spotify Premium:</strong> $20.04<br /><strong>iCloud storage:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Crave:</strong> $24.64<br /><strong>Disney+:</strong> $15.99<br /><strong>Netflix:</strong> Included in internet<br /><strong>Apple TV:</strong> $12.99<br /><strong>Shudder:</strong> $8.99<br /><strong>Patreon:</strong> $14.97 (<em>The Birth Hour</em> podcast and Aja Barber)<br /><strong>BCAA:</strong> $20.56<br /><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> (for my husband’s work): $29.11<br /><strong>Dropbox</strong> (for my husband’s work): $31.35<br /><strong>Bank account fees:</strong> $16.95<br /><strong>Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP):</strong> $200<br /><strong>RRSP Contribution</strong> (comes from my paycheck and is matched by my employer): $708<br /><strong>Extended healthcare:</strong> $0 (paid for by my work)<br /><strong>Charitable Donations:</strong> $106 (Black Lives Matter, Binners Project, Canadian Mental Health Association, Indian Residential School Survivors Society)<br /><br /><strong>Annual expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Credit card fees:</strong> $135<br /><strong>Amazon Prime:</strong> $110.88<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes. I grew up in the UK, and neither of my parents went to university (although my dad later completed a degree part-time at night school), but I was expected to go to a good one. I didn’t get an offer from any of my top three schools because my predicted grades weren’t as high as I needed (even though my actual grades were top marks — the UK system is weird), but I still landed at a top-20 university. I paid for my tuition and living expenses with student loans and part-time jobs, but my parents paid for my rent until I graduated, aged 20 (it was a three-year program).<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I was brought up not to ask about or share specifics on salaries or spending, as it was deemed rude (very British). I knew neither of my parents grew up with much money, but my dad eventually worked in software engineering, and we were comfortably middle-class. My dad started a few companies, and my mom was always terrified about the lack of financial stability. They’re both quite cautious, and I remember being told that saving for retirement was key and not to place my pension in any remotely risky investments. They’re now retired and living in Canada close to me, and are very worried that I don’t own a home, and likely won’t any time soon.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I got a job working in the village shop on Saturday mornings aged 13. My parents encouraged me to learn the value of work and commitment, and I loved the extra spending money ($18 USD a week). I quit when I got a better paying job at age 16, and my younger brother took over at the shop.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Not in the day-to-day sense. Occasionally, I’d pick up some tension or uncertainty from my parents, and there were tighter times than others, but I had everything I needed for school, and we went on vacation every couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes. I have a great salary and solid savings, but rent and daycare come to 60% of my income, and my husband’s work is very unstable. Any money we do save when he’s working subsidizes our living expenses when he’s not. Saying that, we could definitely cut down on our expenses (coffees, meals out) if we really had to. Buying a place to live in Vancouver feels out of the question, so I worry about our long-term plans, especially as we need more space for my son as he gets older. I’m on the wait list for a co-op and really hope we get in within the next couple of years.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />Aged 20 when I graduated from university, and my parents stopped paying my rent. They’re now retired and are on a budget, but they would definitely give me a loan if I needed it (as long as I paid them back).<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />My parents gave me $15,000 towards my wedding in 2017, and $25,000 in 2022 as part of my grandmother’s inheritance when she passed away. We used some of it to buy a car when our old one died, and most of it went to keeping us debt-free when I was on maternity leave and my husband had a 10-month stretch of not working.</p>



<h3>Day One: Wednesday</h3>



<p>7:20 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm and lie in bed thinking about morning logistics. My son D., is now a three-nager, and recently started a new daycare which has longer opening hours and is close-ish to my office. My husband K., is working on a movie at the moment, so I’m usually on daycare duty on the bus, but he has a rare late start today, so I can take the car. I drag myself out of bed, do my morning routine of Origins Ginzing Moisturizer, and get D. out of the door — though not without some protests.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — I start my workday from home, with an instant coffee to help me navigate my inbox. I’ve moved house since my last Money Diary, into a two-bed apartment in a new rental building about a five-minute walk from the Co-Op I was subletting. This place is a third of the size of the last place and triple the rent which is painful, but the views are amazing, and the location is perfect. Luckily, K. has been working a lot this year, and I also started my current job three months ago. It was a really hard decision to leave my last role, which I loved, but it’s a step up to VP level with a small salary bump (though the healthcare benefits and PTO aren’t as good), and I knew I’d get out of my comfort zone and learn so much. I’m now responsible for operations and HR, so I have a couple of calls about a salesforce transformation project I’m leading, and work on some job descriptions. K. takes the dog for a walk, stopping off for a coffee and a pastry. <strong>$11.24</strong></p>



<p>9:01 a.m. — …and a bag of prescription food from the vet. It’s a new diet and our pet insurance will reimburse about $35 per bag for the first two months — but soon we’ll be covering the full amount. When K. gets back, he heads to work. I heat up and eat a frozen mini burrito for a late breakfast, then have a baked potato with tuna mayonnaise for lunch. <strong>$87.62</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I walk the dog around the block, then change into “business casual” (jeans and a nice top) and head into the office. I have a weekly 1:1 with my boss on Wednesday afternoon, and I always prefer to have it in person. Our talk today is particularly important, as it’s been a frustrating couple of days and I have some feedback to share about how we’re working together (or not). I make an iced coffee for the road, and take the bus as it’s too hot outside to walk without turning into a sweaty mess. <strong>$2.70</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — The conversation goes well! I suggested we get out of the office for a walking meeting, which was definitely the right call, but I’ve racked up 7,000 steps in flats that squeeze my toes, and am a sweaty mess after all. No Evo’s (local car share company) today, so I take an Uber to daycare and arrive right before they close at 5:30 p.m. It takes a while to get him all packed up, and we miss the bus by a minute! I melt at the bus stop for 15 minutes while we wait for the next one, which we jump off early to pick up a photo book of D.’s photos from his mini kid camera (paid for when I ordered it last week). He loves it, and we look through it together on the final bus home. <strong>$14.10</strong></p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back home and I am exhausted. D. and I look through the photo book together, then FaceTime my parents who are living their best retirement life and sailing around the Gulf Islands this week. I make D. a peanut butter sandwich and some strawberries, while I finish off a leftover portion of tortellini with cheese sauce. D. is mad at me because there isn’t more pasta, and goes to play alone in his room (that’s the three-nager part). I use the time to tidy the kitchen.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — K. gets home. We try to tidy D.’s room since the cleaner comes tomorrow and we can barely see the floor for Hot Wheels, but D. throws his pajamas out of our 14th floor window and things devolve. Luckily for me, K. is on bedtime tonight, so I take a much-needed shower, clean the kitchen, and pack tomorrow’s lunches for D. and myself (K. is very well-fed on set). When I’m done, I book tickets to the outdoor pool for Saturday as it looks like good weather. It’s Labor Day weekend and we were going to go to Whistler, but my parents aren’t around to dog sit and I decided taking a three-year-old and a dog wouldn’t be so relaxing, so I cancelled our hotel last night. <strong>$17.92</strong></p>



<p>10:20 p.m. — K. emerges from D.’s room. We quickly talk through the next day’s schedule, then I do my nighttime routine (Sunday Riley Good Genes serum and Olay moisturizer) and get into bed. I am absolutely hooked on <em>The Americans</em> right now, so I watch part of an episode, then switch to a podcast and fall asleep around 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $133.58</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I wake up from a very deep sleep with D. next to me. He wakes up in the middle of the night and comes into bed with us most nights, which I don’t mind as long as he stays still. I get up, get dressed, give the dog his morning pill (he just turned 12 and he’s on five pills a day for various ailments), and get D. an Eggo waffle and a banana for breakfast. D. is upset I gave the dog his pill first and throws his food on the floor.</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — K. is taking D. to preschool today, which is great as Thursday is one of my two office days. I enjoy the office and go every day when K. isn’t working, but need to be home for the dog more when he is. I planned to be on the bus by 8:20, but the food-throwing and some potty assistance delay me. I end up taking an Uber to the office. <strong>$9.52</strong></p>



<p>10 a.m. — K. does the daycare drop-off then picks up a dark roast with mocha syrup from Starbucks across the street. I do an in-person interview at the office, which I really enjoy, but the candidate isn’t a fit. <strong>$1.97</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — The dog walker and cleaner (in monthly expenses) both arrive at lunchtime, and I buzz them in from my cellphone. <strong>$20</strong></p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — The afternoon flies by in a blur of meetings, including some interview debriefs and a “Party Planning Committee” meeting to plan our Summer BBQ next week. I take a short walk to get some fresh air, and find myself at a coffee shop buying a vanilla latte and a chocolate walnut cookie. The cookie is delicious, but I regret spending the money almost immediately. <strong>$13.47</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — Leave work later than planned as I had to wait for our weekly payables to be ready for approval, so I grab an Uber to daycare. <strong>$10.15</strong></p>



<p>5:30 — I pick up D. and take him to the grocery store to pick up watermelon and pineapple for a daycare potluck picnic tomorrow, plus some fruit freezies that D. spies. The bus is still 15 minutes away and D. is hungry, so I get him a banana bread at the coffee shop next door before it arrives for the bus). <strong>$32.92</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I throw some laundry on as soon as I walk in the door, and see that B. has found my mini Charlotte Tilbury Pillow Talk lipstick (a gift from a friend) and drawn all over his face. Dinner is a mix of baked potato, baked beans, cheese, broccoli, and some pineapple and watermelon that I’ve chopped for the potluck. K. gets home around 8:45 p.m., and I start D.’s bedtime. The routine involves some playing, some books, and lying uncomfortably on the floor next to his crib while he falls asleep. We’re hoping his new daycare will cut his naps as he’s getting older, so he’ll go to sleep earlier.</p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is finally asleep, so I shower and head straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $88.03</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Friday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — I had set my alarm to help K. with the morning routine, but he tells me his call time was pushed back overnight, so I don’t need to be up just yet. I’m exhausted but can’t fall back asleep, so I shower, take the dog on a longer walk than usual, and catch up on my voice notes. I stop at my favourite coffee shop for a large caramel latte. K. also picks up a coffee and a pastry after daycare drop-off. <strong>$18.80</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — My calendar is usually empty on a Friday, so I hold the time to catch up on work. However, today everyone wants a “quick chat” and I’m on back-to-back calls all morning. One of them is to finalize a colleague’s promotion, which we celebrate by text. I make a quick sandwich for lunch, pack for the daycare potluck, and take an Uber to the office with my homemade iced coffee in hand. <strong>$9.99</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I get to the office and join a technology demo in our boardroom. I’m multi-tasking and end up not listening, I know my team will share the main updates with me next week.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get a taxi to daycare with another parent friend who works two blocks from me (she covers the fare). The potluck is chaotic but really nice. I know a few of the parents there just coincidentally (there aren’t many daycare spots in Vancouver), so it’s nice to catch up and see how the new kids are settling in. The watermelon and pineapple are a hit, but I end up losing my Tupperware in the chaos. K. misses most of the fun, but comes to pick us up when he’s finished work.</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — I supervise D.’s bath time, then hand over to K. for bedtime and walk the dog to the liquor store to buy some weekend beverages for K. and I (three beers, three coolers, one cider). Bedtime takes a while, but I wait up for K. I’m exhausted and know I should go to bed, but he puts on the new Amanda Knox TV show and I end up watching the first episode even though neither of us loves it (though I find her story fascinating). I watch another episode of <em>The Americans</em> and fall asleep after midnight. <strong>$40.48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $69.27</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Saturday</h3>



<p>7:15 a.m. — It’s the weekend! D. slept all night in his own bed and is up early. We all sleep better this way, but the trade-off is that mornings start sooner. We snuggle and chat in bed for half an hour, then I get up, make his breakfast (Eggo waffle and strawberries), and tidy up. It’s an independent play kind of morning, so I watch <em>The Americans</em> while he plays with monster trucks. I suddenly realize I’m starving, so I heat a frozen burrito for breakfast, then head to the gym. I recently joined a women-only gym at the end of my block and while I wish I had the energy to go during the week, I really try on weekends. I do 20-minutes on the treadmill and a full-body weight machine circuit.</p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I shower and we head to our favorite coffee shop with the dog in tow. I get a large caramel latte and a pastry, K. gets a flat white, and D. has a mini pastry called a kouign-amann. We sit outside and eat, drink, and play with Hot Wheels, and D. gets a second pastry. <strong>$33.13</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — On the way home, we stop in at a florist and K. buys a small pearl vine for our plant wall, and I get a free pink rose for following the florist on Instagram. When we get home we go up to the rooftop patio, where we hang out watering the plants in our garden bed and playing with more Hot Wheels. <strong>$4.47</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I convince K. we should go to the Pacific National Exhibition (very busy outdoor fair) for its final day on Monday, and I buy tickets on my phone with a 30% discount as a BCAA member. <strong>$67.80</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — I’m so tired and just want to nap, but have a pedicure booked as my toenails are a state and I’m not done wearing sandals yet. I watch <em>The Americans</em> on my phone during the appointment. <strong>$62.33</strong></p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — The weather isn’t as hot as hoped, but we go to the outdoor pool anyway, as we have tickets. We have fun splashing around and playing in the shallow end and manage to get dried and dressed without any drama.</p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — We leave the pool and stop off at our local brewery for dinner. K. gets a pint of raspberry sour, I get a 12oz of the same and we attempt a family game of snakes and ladders. The brewery recently partnered with a burger vendor who we love, so I order three cheeseburgers and fries. We share a table with a nice and patient couple who put up with the preschooler screams and give K. a beer that the bartender made them by accident. The portions of fries are absolutely huge and we end up taking a whole box home, along with most of D.’s burger. <strong>$85.80</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — Bedtime is chaotic, but D. is tired. He falls asleep soon after 10 p.m. and I go straight to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $253.53</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Sunday</h3>



<p>9:15 a.m. — I wake up and am shocked when I see how late it is! D. woke me up coming into our bed in the night and it took me a while to get back to sleep, but the sleep in is worth it. I get up and head to the gym, where I do a short incline walk on the treadmill and a Juice &amp; Toya arms and abs workout on YouTube.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Home, shower, and out for a walk for coffee and pastries from our usual place. Same order as yesterday — a caramel latte, flat white, pastry, and kouign-amann. K. and D. walk to the grocery store across the street to get started on the weekly shop, while I walk the dog home and drive back down and meet them with the shopping bags. We get all of our usual lunch staples, including bread, bagels, croissants, salad kits, cucumber, berries, shredded cheese, yogurt, broccoli, filled pasta, canned tuna, and kids snacks, plus some Drano. <strong>$222.27</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — We have a chill couple of hours at home doing scrap paper crafts and watering the rooftop garden plot. We’re meeting friends at the beach this afternoon, so I pack up our beach bag and throw in some turkey croissants to share, and a piña colada cider I got from Friday’s liquor store run.</p>



<p>4 p.m. — We pick up a friend who lives a few blocks away from us, and make it two minutes before I get a Facebook message from someone on her way to pick some of D.’s old clothes that I’m selling on Marketplace, and have forgotten to leave out — shoot! We go back home and I leave them in my lobby to buzz her in when she arrives. She only takes 1/3 of the clothes but transfers me the full $25. Great! We arrive at the beach and I pay for parking. We meet our other friend, and have the best afternoon together. The four of us met the day we all arrived in Vancouver from the UK almost 15 years ago, and while we don’t get to hang out together as often as we like, we have the best time when we do. We play about on my SUP, take turns chasing D. around, and the non-drivers drink beers. <strong>$14.49</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — We’re having so much fun and don’t want the day to end, so we all jump in the car and return to the same brewery from last night for more burgers. The burger place said they were open until 9 p.m. on Instagram, but when we arrive they’ve closed an hour early. I shoot them a note letting them know and a crying emoji. We decide we still want burgers, so order takeout on Uber Eats instead and eat on a picnic bench outside. I get two Angus burgers on a BOGOF deal and fries to share, plus a cheeseburger combo meal for D. They’re still pretty good! K. drinks two pints and I stick with water. <strong>$80.23</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — It’s late and dark, so we pile in the car and I drive our friends home. D. hasn’t napped today, so we play <em>The Lion King</em> in the car to keep him awake. Once we get home, I realize we left the diaper bag at the brewery and make the three-min drive back to get it. K. handles bedtime while I walk the dog and do the briefest of nighttime routines (Sunday Riley Luna Oil and Olay moisturizer). I’m in bed by 11:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $316.99</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Monday</h3>



<p>9 a.m. — Wake up squished against D., and scroll for half an hour in peace. The burger place from last night sent me a DM apologizing for the error on hours and offering me a free meal next time I’m there, so nice! D. wakes up and we look through baby photos of him on my phone together until it’s time to get up. There’s sand everywhere from yesterday’s beach adventure and I offer to help K. clean, but he says I won’t do a good enough job and he’d rather do it himself (he’s right). He really struggles when things are out of place, which makes parenting pretty tough. I get out of his way and take the dog for a walk to the coffee shop, where I get our usual order to go, plus a pistachio-pineapple pastry for K. <strong>$30.18</strong></p>



<p>11:30 — We’re finally ready to leave for the fair. A new work friend lives right across the street from the grounds and offered for us to park at her place, so we drive straight there. D. has an accident in the car, so we change his underwear in her driveway when we arrive. He spots the big trampoline in her yard, so we spend ten minutes catching up while he bounces before bribing him with a new Hot Wheels car to leave.</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — We have a fun afternoon at the fair! D. tries out hockey, basketball, and soccer at the kids’ sport zone, we watch the super dogs and the high divers shows, and D. goes on a few kids’ rides. We manage to limit him to one “prize-guaranteed” fairground game and he chooses a tiny bottle of bubbles as his prize. <strong>$10</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — It’s a hot day, so I get a Coke Zero and soft serve ice cream for D. and I. K. skips the ice cream and gets a tuna poke bowl. We stay for a few hours, then manage to make a tantrum-free exit. <strong>$44.87</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — We’re home. K. and D. go up to the roof to water the plants while I call TELUS. My internet/TV plan expired a couple of months ago and our bill jumped from $98 a month to $200! I speak to a rep and end up negotiating the same package but with better internet for $78/month, plus a $100 credit to cover the increase in the last two months. D. watches YouTube videos of families playing with monster trucks and starts crying because he doesn’t have a backyard. Sigh. I think he’s incredibly lucky to be growing up in this city and apartment life won’t kill him, while K. really hates that he likely won’t experience living in a house. We redirect him with cartoons and order Indian takeout. <strong>$95.60</strong></p>



<p>9 p.m. — My turn to do bedtime. After some negotiation, D. is asleep by 10. I realize I needed to wash my hair tonight but I’m too tired, so I’ll have to get up early and do it in the morning instead. I head to bed and watch <em>The Americans</em> until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $180.65</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Tuesday</h3>



<p>7 a.m. — Wake up to my alarm. D. is in our bed again, although I don’t remember him getting in. K. has a rare day off today, so I have a nice long shower, wash and dry my hair, and walk to work with an instant coffee. K. takes D. to pre-school and gets a coffee from Starbucks afterwards. <strong>$4.44</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Tuesday is our mandatory “in office” day and it’s a busy one. I work on my quarterly work plan, answer some emails about insurance, and attend our weekly Executive Team meeting. I eat last night’s Indian leftovers at my desk for lunch, which I realize have been in my backpack instead of the refrigerator all morning. It tastes even better the day after. </p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I have a confidential call with my HR Manager and there are no meeting rooms available, so I head to a coffee shop across the street where no one from work can overhear us. I order a hedgehog mocha and a chocolate walnut cookie. Another colleague wants to meet before the end of the day to discuss some meeting structures, so I make it a “walk-and-talk” around the park so I can make a speedy exit. <strong>$13.49</strong></p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I’m making the most of K. being on daycare pick-up duty and meet friends for happy hour! We try a new spot that’s only a 10-minute walk from my office. It’s bar service, and I know that once we sit down and start chatting, I won’t want to get up again, so I order two happy our tequila and Sprites up front. After catching up, we Uber to a liquor store (my friend pays). I don’t buy anything as I brought my last two coolers from home, then we walk to meet two more friends at the beach. <strong>$12.56</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I have the best evening! We order delicious pizza ($30 each), drink delicious drinks, and don’t stop talking for hours. We’re all British, and all parents of under-fives who met on the Peanut app a few years ago while we were on maternity leave. We talk about the highs and lows of parenting, vent about our partners, and discuss the best spicy romantasy books. It’s a beautiful sunset and I wade into the ocean just to get my feet wet. <strong>$30.00</strong></p>



<p>10 p.m. — I share an Uber home with the friend who paid earlier, so I get this one. <strong>$8.00</strong></p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — D. is already in bed when I get home; he and K. went to a brewery after daycare and got a pint and an apple juice plus parking. I take the dog out and get ready for bed. D. wakes up and hears me and asks to sleep in my bed. I’ve missed him after all the parenting talk tonight, so after some half-hearted efforts to re-settle him, I say yes, and we fall asleep together around 11. <strong>$18.69</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $87.18</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p><br />This was a pretty average week, and even though it was a long weekend, which meant some extra spending, we spent a lot less than we would have if we’d gone to Whistler for the weekend, so that was a good choice. I’ve known for a while that I could save a lot more money if we cut down on coffees and happy hours/takeout, and recording my expenses did make me very aware of that — and skip a couple of cookies! However, I don’t really have any sort of goal to motivate my savings right now, so it’s easier to just choose enjoying life in the moment. I’m sure that will change in the future, and I know there are areas I can cut back on if I need to.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11888777.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Time stands still for no one, or so the planet Saturn teaches us. Saturn is leading us into Aries on February 13th. As we move onward in life, the austere and reverent cosmic force urges us to be responsible and ambitious as we grow. Along the way, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/may-2025-monthly-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn will present obstacles</a> and it’s up to us to find the best path forward. </p>



<p>Saturn is a dominant planet that likes to take charge and Aries is the zodiac sign that is self-reliant. When the two collide, we may focus on how we can solely advance ourselves rather than on helping others. Saturn is exalted in Libra, which is the opposite sign of Aries, and commits to being a team player. This means that when Saturn is in Aries, the planet is in detriment and urges us to be selfish. As a result, struggles can occur along the way. Saturn in Aries can be a complex combination because the fire sign is impulsive, and the planet itself is known to be strategic. When these two come together, it can make us question how to take action.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries can be a tad immature. Rather than learning and moving on with the knowledge and insight the universe gives us, we may still chase the same challenges and opportunities (until we decide to move on). Even though we know instinctively that the “white whale” is unobtainable, it’ll still be lingering in our minds until we reach that goal. This could hinder us from growing and evolving into the next stage of life. Aries is a zodiac sign that won’t and can’t stop until it wins; Saturn gives it the extra determination to do so. We can still achieve greatness, it’ll just require extra effort. As long as we’re up for the task, then we should be able to thrive.</p>



<p>Saturn’s stint in Aries is unique because Neptune is transiting the same sign and moving closely with Saturn. The two planets will form a conjunction on February 20th, 2026. This magical time encourages us to reach for the stars and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifest our dreams</a>. Saturn cements Neptune’s aspirations, making it a decisive moment in time. These two planets haven’t aligned in Aries in centuries. </p>



<p>Although the centaur Chiron will be far away by a degree, we’ll still feel the lingering energy in the same sign as Saturn. Chiron helps us heal, and Saturn helps us acknowledge the lesson. We can transcend internally by mending our trauma at this time. The growing pains might be challenging; however, we’ll face our shadow selves and embrace our fears, squashing them as we move toward enlightenment.</p>



<p>Those born on the dates below will be experiencing their Saturn returns, making it a transformative time. For those not in the know, the Saturn return is when the planet returns to the sign and degree it was when you were born, every 27 to 30 years. The first one teaches us how to adult, the second journey urges us to embrace our success, and the third Saturn return is a moment of reflection. Reference the dates below to see if you qualify: </p>



<p>Apr 25, 1937, to Oct 17, 1937</p>



<p>Jan 14, 1938, to Jul  6, 1939</p>



<p>Sep 22, 1939, to Mar 20, 1940</p>
