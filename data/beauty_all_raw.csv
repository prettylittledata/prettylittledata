<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>November opens with a bang — and a bite. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">first three days of this month</a> mark the final stretch of Mars in Scorpio, so if you’ve been simmering with ambition, desire, secrets, or strategy… you’re not imagining things. Mars is in its domicile here. It’s potent, precise, and a little bit ruthless. There’s a reason things have felt <em>hot</em> beneath the surface — emotionally, sexually, and globally.  <br /><br />This is a week to notice what you’ve learned during this <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio journey</a> (since early October). Have you confronted your triggers? Decluttered your energy? Spoken your truth in a controlled burn? Or maybe you’ve been holding it all in, trying to perfect your next move… but Mars in Scorpio doesn’t wait forever. The first half of this week is your cosmic green light to finish strong, but be mindful of your intensity. Don’t spiral into obsession, revenge, or paranoia. You’re wiser than that now. </p>



<p>By Tuesday night into Wednesday, Mars says goodbye to Scorpio and enters freedom loving Sagittarius, and suddenly everything feels a little lighter… and a little riskier. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter</a>, the planet of expansion, exaggeration, and big-picture dreams. So this Mars in Sag transit (from Nov 4 through late December) gives us energy to believe again. We’re breaking free from emotional stagnancy and burning through limitations. Globally, you’ll see the people speaking out for justice louder than ever, organizing protests, demanding rights, and moving with radical optimism. Individually, it’s time to stretch. Move your body. Hike that mountain. Try that dance class. Say yes to things your cautious self might decline. Just be careful not to say <em>yes</em> to everything, because Mars in Sag is also notorious for burnout. Take big swings… but be sure to rest in between. <br /><br />Then on November 5th, the energy deepens with the Taurus Full Moon. Earth signs take the stage, reminding us to come back to the body, back to the breath, back to the beauty of what’s real. This lunation activates themes around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">money, security, self-worth, and sensuality</a>. It’s a powerful time to pause and ask yourself: <em>Where am I rushing? Where am I forcing what could simply flow?</em> Taurus teaches us that consistency is magic. That pleasure isn’t earned — it’s our birthright. So yes, you can manifest the bag under this lunation, but don’t forget to enjoy the garden you’ve already built. Put your bare feet in the grass. Make the luxurious meal. Light the candle just because. Taurus wants you to taste life, not just conquer it. </p>



<p>Finally, November 6th brings a double dose of cosmic intensity: Venus enters Scorpio and Uranus retrograde re-enters Taurus. Venus in Scorpio is loyal, laser-focused, and just a <em>little bit</em> obsessed with whatever (or whoever) has its attention. This is not the time for superficial love. We’re craving depth, intimacy, and truth. You’ll feel more sensitive to energy; you’ll pick up on what people <em>don’t</em> say more than what they do. And your own aura? Unmissable. You’re magnetic now. But be careful of testing people or playing mind games. Real ones want honesty, not manipulation. As for Uranus sliding back into Taurus for one final round (until it leaves for good in 2026 — not to return for 80+ years), we’re revisiting the lessons around stability, value, and revolution. What outdated ideas about money, land, pleasure, and the body need to go? What new systems are you ready to build? This is the final stretch — so let’s make it count. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, Mars, your planetary ruler, is switching signs this week, and you’re gonna feel it like a gust of wind in your sails. On November 4th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars enters Sagittarius</a>, activating your expansion zone, and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been swimming in the deep, emotional waters of Mars in Scorpio for weeks now, digging through shadows and figuring out who’s really down for you and who just likes your fire. But now it’s like the fire returns to <em>you</em>. Mars in Sag wants you to move — mentally, physically, spiritually. It’s giving “book that trip,” “say the bold thing,” “write the damn pitch,” “go back to school,” “start the documentary,” “text your mentor back.” Your world is ready to grow, but first you’ve gotta believe there’s more than the tiny corner you’ve been stuck in. And if you’ve been shrinking yourself to survive? Not anymore. This is a cosmic jailbreak. Freedom is calling, and it wants you to answer.<br /><br />Then we get hit with that Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th, lighting up your money zone — and it’s not subtle. Something you started building financially (or energetically, self-worth-wise) around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-taurus-april-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus New Moon six months ago</a> is coming to a head. Maybe you’re finally seeing the payout from something slow and steady, or maybe you’re realizing where you’ve been undercharging, undervaluing, or underestimating yourself. Either way, this lunation is here to shake you back into confidence — but not without a few questions. Especially because two days later, Uranus retrograde reenters Taurus, like a surprise pop quiz from the Universe: “Have you <em>really</em> changed your money mindset? Or are you still clinging to fear, scarcity, or control?” The bag is trying to get bigger, Aries, but you’ve gotta stop blocking it with old narratives. Let this moon illuminate your next step, and then take it, even if your voice shakes. </p>



<p>And let’s not forget Venus
entering Scorpio on November 6th, because whew, things are getting deep. With
both the Sun and Venus now in your sector of intimacy, power, and merging,
you’re not really in the mood for surface-level anything. You want to feel
held. You want to feel trusted. You want to get to the bottom of it — <em>whatever it is</em>. This could be a magnetic
time for financial partnerships too: loans, collaborations, shared investments,
but make sure it’s a soul yes, not just a shiny one. Emotionally, you might
find yourself craving more than words — you want actions, presence, energy. You
want someone who sees through the mask, even the one you forgot you were
wearing. Let yourself be soft <em>and</em>
smart. Let yourself be all-in — but not at the expense of your boundaries.
You’ve come too far to betray yourself for someone who doesn’t know how to swim
in your depths. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week starts off like the drumroll before the drop… and the Full Moon in your sign on November 5th? That’s your moment, baby. You’re closing a chapter that began around your birthday season, and even if you didn’t know it, you’ve been building toward this culmination for months. Something about your identity — the way you present, the way you carry yourself, the way you take up space — is breaking through to a new level. You’re releasing versions of yourself that felt safer but smaller. And honestly? You’re no longer available for the role of “reliable one who keeps the peace.” You’re the main character. The muse. The mountain. Don’t be surprised if emotions run high around this lunation: you might cry at random commercials, or suddenly want to chop your hair off, or finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-outfit-inspiration-ideas"">wear the outfit you’ve been saving for “someday.”</a> That someday is now. <br /><br />And just when you think that Full Moon glow is the climax, Uranus retrograde re-enters your sign on November 7th, stirring up the final stretch of your personal revolution. Think back to the shake-ups and glow-ups that started around 2018. Uranus was trying to wake you up from autopilot. Now it’s back for the final rewrites — one last round of “plot twists” that push you closer to the version of you who lives freely, speaks boldly, and doesn’t compromise just to be liked. There might be a reunion or revisit this week, maybe with an old desire, maybe with a person, maybe with a part of you that’s been hiding. Instead of resisting it, ask: What is this moment trying to liberate me from? The future is calling, and it wants <em>you</em>, not your mask. </p>



<p>And then Venus, your planetary ruler, slips into Scorpio on November 6th, straight into your partnership sector, and suddenly, everything feels more intense. You’re magnetizing people like crazy — lovers, collaborators, past situationships you thought were long gone. But this isn’t about nostalgia. Venus in Scorpio is here to show you who’s <em>actually</em> ready to meet you in the depth you crave. Loyalty, sensuality, psychic connection — these are the bare minimum now. If it’s not soul-stirring, why are you entertaining it? This transit might also bring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/202646/money-questions-to-ask-your-romantic-partner"">money talks in relationships</a> or contracts with business partners, and your boundaries will be everything. You’re not here to be agreeable; you’re here to build legacy. Say what you want. Ask for what you need. And let love — the real kind — <em>transform you</em>. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Mars moves into Sagittarius on November 4th, and suddenly you’re not just craving connection — you’re demanding real partnership. The kind where communication feels electric and aligned, where conversations don’t loop in circles but actually <em>go somewhere</em>. This is happening in your relationship sector, so people might start projecting their stuff onto you, especially since Mars tends to stir tension before it brings clarity. But if you’ve been people-pleasing or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/define-the-relationship-advice"">avoiding the Big Talks</a>, this week might blow that avoidance wide open. You may find yourself blurt-blessing truths in mid-convo like: <em>“Wait…why are we even doing this if we both want different things?”</em> Don’t regret it. You’re setting fires, yes, but they’re the kind that forge something stronger from the ash. Whether in business, love, or friendship, Mars is turning up the heat, and if the flame doesn’t grow <em>with</em> you, you’re allowed to walk away. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th hits your subconscious sector like a lucid dream you don’t want to forget. This is the realm of endings, solitude, intuition, and rest, so if you’re suddenly feeling emotionally wiped out, it’s not just you being “too sensitive.” It’s your soul saying: <em>Pause. Listen. Heal.</em> This full moon is helping you end an old karmic loop: maybe a self-sabotaging behavior, an internalized fear, or a secret you’ve been carrying for way too long. Add to that Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, and you might be up late at night processing dreams, journal prompts, or uncanny synchronicities. Pay attention to what your body is telling you to… your nervous system has been holding a lot. Give it a release. Baths, naps, nature, prayers, poetry, whatever grounds you, do it. This full moon is a gentle but firm push into surrender. </p>



<p>By November 6th, Venus slips into Scorpio and lights up your daily routine zone with an edge of mystery, sensuality, and craving. You’re feeling more tuned in to your habits: what you consume, who you give your energy to, what you do with your hours. And to keep things real, Gemini: some of it has gotten too scattered. Venus in Scorpio isn’t about adding more to your to-do list, it’s about deepening what’s already working and letting the rest fall away. You might also feel more physically in tune with your body, or more aware of who at work is draining your joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Trust your gut</a>. This is an ideal time to bring more pleasure into your healing journey: hot yoga, Pilates, music baths, dance breaks between emails, delicious meals you eat <em>slowly</em>. Life isn’t a checklist. Let it become an offering. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s power in rest, Cancer, and this week, the stars demand it. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 activates your community and dream-vision sector, revealing which collaborations are truly aligned with your soul’s long-term growth, and which have quietly expired. It may feel like a wave of both grief and gratitude floods in as you realize certain friendships, teams, or goals no longer resonate. Let it. This full moon is a mirror: <em>Here’s what you wanted then. Here’s what you’ve outgrown. Here’s what you’re ready to dream next.</em> If you’ve been shouldering too many people’s hopes and expectations, this week calls you back to your own lane. You’re allowed to not answer every text. You’re allowed to unplug. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, supercharging your health and daily rhythm zone with fire and pressure. You might feel the urge to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-morning-rituals"">commit to a routine</a>—or finally <em>ditch</em> one that’s been draining your joy. Be mindful of burnout, especially if you’ve been over-giving. Mars here isn’t subtle; it demands action. It wants you to be more discerning with your time and habits, not more productive for productivity’s sake. Trust your body when it asks for different pacing. Then on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, inviting more sensuality, play, and emotional depth into your creativity and romantic life. Think less “get back on track” and more “build a life where joy is the track.” Start there. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re stepping into the spotlight whether you planned to or not, Leo. The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public reputation, and the impact is tangible. An opportunity you’ve been quietly nurturing may come to fruition—or a chapter may close to make space for one that’s more aligned with who you <em>really</em> are now. You don’t have to be ready to be seen. You just have to <em>show up</em> honestly. And if you’re not being recognized where you’ve been pouring your energy? Take note. This lunation brings revelations around legacy, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/secret-to-happiness-at-work"">work-life balance</a>, and your capacity to lead in ways that feel <em>true</em>, not just impressive. <br /><br />Then Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4 and Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, shifting your axis of expression. Mars fuels your fifth house of passion and selfexpression, pushing you to say what’s been unsaid: on the page, on stage, in love, or in your journal. The fire returns to your belly. Your inner artist is hungry. Let them feast. But with Venus moving into your emotionally intense fourth house, there’s also a longing to retreat, to nurture your inner child, to reconnect with what truly feels like <em>home</em>. Let both parts of you breathe this week—the one who wants to shine, and the one who wants to curl up in softness. You’re both. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week opens with a sacred pause, Virgo: an invitation to step back and look at the bigger picture. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 lands in your ninth house of perspective, expansion, and spiritual philosophy, and it’s whispering: <em>What if it’s not about fixing? What if it’s about trusting?</em> You’ve been growing. Quietly, steadily, deeply. This full moon reveals how far you’ve come and encourages you to release the illusion that you have to have it all figured out before you take the leap. Travel, education, or even a shift in worldview could mark this week. Let curiosity lead you more than control. <br /><br />With Mars entering Sagittarius (your home and roots sector) and Venus moving into your communication zone, your inner and outer voices may clash. Mars in Sagittarius could stir conflict on the home front or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/single-solo-travel-romanticise-life"">make you crave more independence</a> and space than usual. That’s not a betrayal of your people — it’s a call to check in on your nervous system and boundaries. Venus in Scorpio, meanwhile, blesses your words with velvet, and you’re more sensual, intuitive, magnetic. Whether you’re writing, speaking, or just thinking, you’re tapping into a deeper truth. You don’t need to scream to be heard. Whisper your magic. It’ll find who it’s meant for. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, it’s time to stretch your wings and remember how much more of the world there is for you to touch. With Mars entering Sagittarius on November 4, you might feel a jolt of energy and inspiration in your communication zone — and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been thinking deeply, maybe even overthinking, but now the cosmos is asking you to speak, write, teach, and share again. Not from a place of performance, but from presence. Your words carry fire now, Libra. Conversations will have more spark, more conviction, more truth. So whether it’s pitching that idea, reaching out to an old friend, or just hitting publish on a post you’ve been second-guessing, Mars says: just go for it. <br /><br />Then just a day later, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your intimacy and legacy sector. And it’s not just a regular full moon: Uranus retrogrades back into Taurus two days later, intensifying whatever emotional or financial storyline is rising. This could be the time where you finally release an old debt — emotional or literal. A truth about what you truly <em>value</em> in deep partnerships might surface. You may feel this in your body too: your throat chakra buzzing, your sensuality heightened, your nervous system needing grounding. Ride the waves, but let go of control. There’s alchemy happening in your shadows. </p>



<p>And with Venus entering Scorpio on November 6, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">your money sector is now infused with magnetism</a>. But not just the “cash flow” kind — I’m talking about a deeper rerooting in your self-worth. This is a great time to review your budget or raise your rates, yes, but it’s also about asking: am I honoring the <em>value</em> of my energy? Of my presence? Venus in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level abundance. She wants you to get intimate with your desires and become unapologetic about claiming what’s already yours. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week Mars, one of your planetary rulers, is leaving your sign after an extended stay that probably felt like a bootcamp for your soul. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">The first few days of November</a> carry this final blast of Martian energy, and it’s intense. You may feel a pressure to prove yourself, make a move, or demand clarity… but before you do, breathe. Mars in your sector of self has been reminding you what it feels like to move with your own instincts, not based on validation or trends, but based on your gut. And now, as it moves into Sagittarius on the 4th, your energy shifts to money, security, and self-worth. Your identity work isn’t over, but now it’s more about how you fund the life you’re building, how you value your energy and time, and how you build confidence through aligned action. There may be unexpected purchases, business ideas, or moments where you finally charge what you’re worth. Don’t rush the pivot… just notice where the fire’s leading you.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th, activating your relationship sector — and it’s <em>major</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Some Scorpios could be falling in love</a>, signing a marriage license, or realizing they’ve outgrown a connection they once centered their whole world around. </p>



<p>You might go from <em>“I don’t want love”</em> to <em>“I want a home and a legacy with someone”</em> in 24 hours — or vice versa. The moon is revealing what you truly desire in partnership, and what you’ve been pretending not to want. Maybe you’ve been avoiding intimacy when what you crave most is to be held. Or maybe you’ve been <em>centering a fantasy of love</em>, while forgetting your own name in the process. This moon brings truth, clarity, and release. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, that clarity isn’t temporary — it’s evolutionary. Expect twists. Expect breakthroughs. Expect to surprise even yourself. <br /><br />By the time Venus enters your sign on November 6th, you’ll feel a soft but powerful return to self. Mars handed you the blueprint, but Venus wants to show you how to move with grace, magnetism, and self-awareness. This is your glow-up moment. People are watching. You’re becoming more intentional about how you show up in relationships, and how you allow others to show up for you. It’s also a powerful time to attract wealth, romantic attention, and recognition, but only if it aligns with the person you’re becoming, not the one you’ve outgrown. Venus in Scorpio doesn’t play about love, money, or authenticity. This is your cue to romanticize your own life, Scorpio. Not because it’s cute — but because it’s time. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your cue to stretch, breathe deep, and get ready, because Mars enters your sign on November 4th, and your world is about to speed up. The beginning of the week still carries <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the remnants of Mars in Scorpio</a>, which for the past several weeks has activated your spirituality and solitude sector, pulling you inward, forcing you to look at the patterns you’ve avoided, and making you rest even when you didn’t want to. If you’ve been feeling lowkey exhausted, maybe even emotionally foggy or withdrawn, don’t trip — that was part of your cosmic reset. But now the heat is back.  <br /><br />As Mars returns to your sign, so does your drive, your confidence, your power to initiate, and your sense of momentum. The fog lifts. You’re inspired again. Just don’t try to do everything all at once, as this transit can make you impulsive, even reckless. Channel the fire into focused movement, especially with your body: hiking, dance classes, morning runs, boxing, swimming — anything that grounds the energy. You’re not supposed to go from zero to a hundred. But you <em>are</em> meant to follow the fire that feels real. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk money, worth, and self-sufficiency, because the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th (followed by Uranus’ retrograde in Taurus on the 7th) is lighting up your sector of routine, work, and wellness, and it’s bringing some truth to the surface. Maybe it’s a project finally wrapping up, a contract closing, a health scare resolving, or a realization that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">your burnout wasn’t just physical</a> — it was emotional. This moon says: what in your everyday life is truly sustainable, and what needs to go? <br /><br />Then, on November 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, diving into your dreams, secrets, and emotional processing zone. It’s like your sensual side turns inward. You might be craving more time alone, not because you’re antisocial, but because you’re finally understanding the beauty of emotional privacy. Old loves may resurface, either literally or energetically. You could find yourself craving intimacy without chaos, longing for depth in your friendships, or even reconnecting with a creative project that once felt too vulnerable to share. Let yourself feel things all the way through. Journal. Make playlists. Cry in the shower. Dream big. This transit is preparing you for the soft launch of a new emotional era — one that doesn’t need to be loud to be real. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the week begins with a quiet hum of closure, as Mars finishes its journey through Scorpio, activating your community and collective impact sector one last time. For the past month, you’ve likely been in your boss mode bag, but not in the “climb-the-ladder-alone” kind of way. You’ve been assessing who’s truly in your corner, who aligns with your vision, and where you may have been playing it small just to fit in. Now, as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a more introspective chapter — your healing sector gets lit, and suddenly all the things you’ve been pushing through rise to the surface. Don’t brush it off this time. If you need to rest, rest. If you need to forgive someone (or yourself), do it without making it a whole performance. This is the time to slow your hustle just enough to make sure your soul is still in the driver’s seat. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, and baby, this one’s personal. It activates your pleasure, romance, and creativity zone, and it’s bringing up all the feels. For some Capricorns, this could be a literal climax: a passionate fling turning serious, a creative baby being born, or a truth bomb dropping in matters of the heart. For others, it could feel like a deep craving for joy and softness that you haven’t let yourself feel in a while. Let it in. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, don’t be surprised if an old crush, hobby, or dream makes an unexpected reappearance. This energy is like your inner child saying, “Can we please go back to what made us <em>feel</em> alive?” Let yourself feel playful again — not because it’s productive, but because your joy is sacred and revolutionary. </p>



<p>And then we have Venus entering Scorpio on November 6th, which breathes depth and intensity into your friendship and vision sector. This is “ride or die” energy. You might suddenly find yourself drawn to new people who feel like soul family — or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/outgrowing-friendships-as-an-adult"">you may start reevaluating long-time connections</a> that don’t hold the same magic they used to. Creatively, you’re magnetic right now. People are watching you, even if they’re not saying it. Don’t shrink your passion. Venus in Scorpio reminds you that the right people won’t flinch at your intensity; they’ll mirror it back to you with devotion. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the start of the week hits with a potent shift in momentum: Mars wraps up its journey through Scorpio, which has been activating your career and legacy zone for weeks. Whew. You’ve likely been in hyper-focus mode, trying to solidify your path, prove yourself, or restructure what success even means to you. Maybe you were working overtime, maybe you were silently wondering if all your effort is even being seen. (It is, btw.) But here’s the catch: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio can bring out your most obsessive tendencies</a>. If you’ve been pushing yourself past burnout in the name of excellence, pause. That drive isn’t sustainable if it’s rooted in fear.  <br /><br />On November 4, when Mars enters Sagittarius, the tone shifts completely — now it’s all about community, collective dreaming, and your wider network. You’re being invited to remember you don’t have to build the future alone. This transit wants you to connect, collaborate, and maybe even call up those people you keep meaning to reach out to. You’re most powerful when you remember your ideas are meant to inspire a movement, not live in a vacuum. </p>



<p>Then comes the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5, illuminating your home and emotional security sector. This could bring major revelations around where you live, who you live with, or even what “home” means in this current chapter. Some Aquarians might be finalizing a move, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/family-arguments-toxic"">mending family dynamics</a>, or finally releasing emotional weight that’s been stored deep in the body. If you cry this week, let it happen — there’s medicine in those tears. With Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, this isn’t just a random full moon: it’s a wake-up call from the Universe about your nervous system and ancestral patterns. Is the version of “security” you’re clinging to actually nourishing you? Or are you due for a whole new blueprint of what rootedness looks like? <br /><br />And then — boom — on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, joining the Sun and continuing the deep dive into your career and public reputation zone. You’re magnetizing attention like never before, but not because you’re trying to. It’s the depth, the edge, the truth in your voice… people feel it. This is a powerful time for rebranding, launching something bold, or showing up with raw, authentic power in spaces where you previously felt like an outsider. Just don’t fall into the trap of over-curating your image. Trust that being your whole self is what draws the right opportunities in. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the week begins with an emotional sigh of release. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is finishing its time in Scorpio</a>, your sector of expansion, spirituality, and long-distance journeys, and baby… what a ride. These past weeks may have felt like an initiation, one that cracked you open and demanded deeper trust in your intuition — not the watered-down, airy kind, but the kind that whispers <em>“go anyway”</em> when logic says don’t. You’ve been traveling (literally or spiritually) and shedding beliefs that no longer align. And now, on November 4, Mars enters Sagittarius and your career zone, shifting the spotlight to how you show up in the world. Expect things to get louder, faster, and more visible. You’re being asked to own your expertise, pitch the dream project, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/online-job-search"">apply for the thing you thought was too big</a>, and step into your power like you didn’t just spend a month doing inner excavation. You did — and it shows. But be mindful of burnout. Mars in Sag can make you think you’re invincible — <em>you’re not</em>. You’re still water, love. Stay hydrated. Stay soft. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus arrives on November 5, lighting up your communication and learning zone. Something you’ve been processing mentally may suddenly drop into your body with clarity. A conversation you’ve been avoiding? A message you’ve been waiting to share? This full moon cracks open your throat chakra and dares you to speak from the heart. Words become spells now, so use them wisely. And with Uranus retrograding back into Taurus just two days later, you’re revisiting how you process, think, and even teach. This week rewires your voice and your mind, anchoring your ethereal wisdom into grounded, practical action. </p>



<p>By November 6, when Venus enters Scorpio, the cosmos brings things full circle. You’re being called deeper into your desires for intimacy, depth, and soul-stirring truth — and not just romantically, but spiritually, intellectually, and even professionally. Your magnetism increases tenfold, but so does your craving for meaningful experiences. You’re not here for surface-level vibes anymore. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-travel-trends-google-powerpoint-spreadsheets-planning-travel"">planning an international trip</a>, beginning a new study, or finally sharing the sacred work you’ve kept close to your chest, this transit says: go all in. Trust the path even when it’s foggy. Love yourself through the mystery. You are the ocean, Pisces, and the world is ready for your waves. </p>

<h2>14K Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Huggies &amp; Small Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940585.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Small gold hoops may be subtle, but these pint-sized pieces bring just the right touch of shine to any look. Huggies also, well, hug your lobes just right, offering maximum comfort while still offering a polished touch to your outfit. Given their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-petite-workwear-ann-taylor"">petite size</a>, you can easily stack them to climb your ear or wear them solo. From twisted tubes to diamond accents, there’s a huggie for every sartorial vibe. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>White Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940586.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If all the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend"">color analysis videos</a> have convinced you that you’re more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silver-nails-manicure-trend-ideas"">silver gal</a> (but you still want the luxe durability that gold provides), white gold is the cool-toned twist you need to own. Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940587.png?width=960&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=15%3A16"" /></figure>



<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette. Either way, they effortlessly elevate everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-street-style"">minimalist outfits</a> to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters""> cozy cardigans</a>. And sure, bigger can certainly be better, but that doesn’t always mean more expensive — these styles all come in under $150.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Large Gold Hoop Earrings </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940588.png?width=818&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=409%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<p>For a good chunk of the late ‘90s and 2000s, it would be rare to see twins Tia and Tamera Mowry without each other. For many Black millennial women like me who grew up with  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/06/157426/sister-sister-reboot-tia-tamara-mowry""><em>Sister, Sister</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-3aa9e7b5-c02e-45db-a8dc-88e9e3a04a11""><em>Twitches</em></a>, Tia and Tamera embodied what we’re talking about when we say “representation matters”: on<em> Sister, Sister</em> they were whole characters who got to be serious or silly, logical or impulsive, boy-crazy or booksmart. And they gave us the freedom to be all of the above too — well, depending on whether you were a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/11/10172757/where-to-watch-sister-sister-netflix-canada"">Tia or Tamera</a> (my good grades, shyness, and constant need for parental approval made me a Tia of course). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">And with </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">Twitches</a></em> (and <em>Twitches Too</em>), they redefined spooky season. Something that didn’t always <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/10/10731680/growing-up-black-without-halloween"">feel like it was for us</a> was suddenly anchored by a movie starring two Black girls, and 20 years later, it’s still a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">Halloween staple. </a></p>



<p>Now, the Tia and Tamera sightings are fewer and farther between. So much so that last year when Tia mentioned on her docuseries <em>Tia Mowry: My Next Act</em> that she wished the two were “still close” the internet was convinced the twins had fallen out. Later, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tia-tamera-mowry-relationship-now-rcna172091"">Tia Mowry clarified</a> that she and Tamera (now Mowry-Housley after marrying Adam Housley) are better than good and still as close as ever, they just live apart and are busy with their respective professions (both have maintained successful acting careers for the past two decades) and families, naturally. And yet, when the duo reunited recently in <a href=""https://people.com/tia-mowry-tamera-mowry-housley-love-reuniting-focusing-on-what-really-matters-during-holidays-exclusive-11838188"">partnership with HomeGoods</a> for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQR_KO2Aa2I/?hl=en"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, the fact that they were in the same place at the same time prompted social media users to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQap_IKkZJ4/?igsh=N2ZleXBqdmsxc2Y0"">lose their minds</a>. </p>



<p>When Tia and Tamera logged on — together — for our Zoom interview, I wish I could say I kept my chill. I didn’t. The nostalgia was too strong. I reverted right back to the kid who worshiped at the altar of <em>Sister, Sister </em>reruns every day after school and who made her entire identity for multiple Halloweens doing the <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitches</a></em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> chant</a>. Tis the season to relive our obsession with Tia and Tamera so it’s only fitting that the duo are back together for the holidays for <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HomeGoods annual </a><em><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, </em>a holiday created for those early decorators who can’t wait to kick off the holiday season<em>. </em>It was surreal to see their distinct personalities on full display as they chatted about their dueling holiday alter egos, whose mac and cheese is better, and which Mowry sibling is hosting Thanksgiving this year. Here, we get into all of the above — plus, Tia and Tamera talk about what <em>Twitches</em> means to them all these years later and what <em>they</em> mean to Black women. </p>



<p><strong>I’m getting emotional just seeing you two together! Everyone is always so happy to see you both in the same place. Do you feel that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia Mowry: </strong>Yesterday, every five minutes we were getting stopped. And the word that everybody was saying was “nostalgia.” They were so happy to see both of us together. They would see [Tamera] and then when they would see me, they were like, “Oh my god! Hey!” They just lit up when they would see both of us. So basically, what you just did was happening all day yesterday. It was very, very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>You mean so much to me! Do you understand how much you mean to millennial women, especially Black women? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you. Yesterday, a girl asked for a photo with us and she said the same thing. So I am honoured. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera Mowry-Housley: </strong>We are honoured. It’s so sweet. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I think [we do understand] now. I think when we were younger, we never really did — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>That’s interesting. I did in the sense of our natural hair. So many young and up and coming actors now, they would say,<em> thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair. </em>Because, as you know, in the last decade, our natural hair wasn’t always accepted, especially on television and in the workforce. So when they saw us, they’re like,<em> oh my gosh, yes, I can wear my natural hair.</em> It’s beautiful.</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, I think, now, and especially in our late — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Gosh, don’t say it. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> In our late 40s! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You look good, girl! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you, you too!<em> [laughs]</em> Now, in our <em>late 40s</em>, I’m truly understanding the impact of representation and how important it is to see women that look like you be celebrated, and I feel that it leans into the quote, “if you see it, you be it.” And so I think that’s why I followed [your statement] with, “I am honored,” because it’s not easy. Being in the positions that we are in, it’s a constant battle. It’s a constant fight, just being a woman in general.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>So many young and up and coming actors now, they say,<em> </em>‘thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair.’ </p><cite>tamera mowry-housley on ‘sister, sister’s’ impact</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I can speak for Hallmark. When I started at Hallmark — it’s been about seven years —  I remember not seeing women like me at all on that network, and I got to give it to Michelle Vicary, who is there now, she gave me my chance. She was like, “listen, we want you to tell your stories. I’m going to give you three films to produce.” And I was like, <em>Oh my gosh, the pressure!</em> But also, like Tia was saying, I felt very honored. I did a movie called <em>Girlfriendship</em>, an all-Black woman cast <em>on Hallmark</em> and literally, the producers came back and said, “we’ve had the most black audience we’ve ever had on Hallmark, thank you.” That felt beautiful and amazing. And I’m happy that I’m still there. I still get to tell all kinds of stories of what Black families look like. We’re biracial, I get to tell those stories. And to be honest, the response as the new person, the trailblazer going in there, telling these stories, it wasn’t always positive. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, and that’s why I said there’s still a challenge. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>But we’re doing it! </p>



<p><strong>You’re partnering with HomeGoods. Tell me more about that collaboration.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Let me tell you this, one thing about HomeHoods that I love is there’s representation. So when you see the Santas, you see some Black Santas. It’s amazing. You’ll see some Black nutcrackers. When I saw them I was like, <em>let’s go! </em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia always says she loves for people to feel seen, feel heard, and understood. And what’s so cool is that this campaign focuses on the holiday alter ego that comes out</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>And doing the holidays your way! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>There’s so many different styles. There’s so many different styles, so many different HomeGoods holiday carols that you can choose from that you feel like represents your festive alter ego. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the difference between your holiday alter egos? Who’s the early decorator? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>We’re both early decorators! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>For our Thanksgiving dinner that I hosted for our family, it was Christmas. There was Christmas everywhere, but Tia’s more whimsical, winter whimsy. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Sparkle, sparkle, baby! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Yes, glam! I am an ever green icon. So the traditional Christmas colors that you think of — red, green, that cozy, warm, traditional woodsy vibe. But what’s cool is I have blue ornaments, I’ll embody the golden glam Holiday Carol alter ego and I’ll add some gold in there. I love interior design, I love decorating, I love hosting. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p><cite>tia mowry on the 20-year anniversary of ‘twitches’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> And hosting on a budget, okay? And that’s what’s so amazing about HomeGoods. I’m telling you, when you look at the prices, you’re like <em>what!? </em>I literally saw a huge Nutcracker. And I love Nutcrackers. We grew up with Nutcrackers. Our mom loves pecans and walnuts, and she would always bring out that Nutcracker. But there was a huge Nutcracker, maybe four, five feet tall, and it was 100 dollars! </p>



<p><strong>We’re talking about holidays so I would love to know your favorite holiday memory together. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Oooh! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I have a memory, and it was together, I just don’t know if you remember it<em> [laughs]. </em>My memory sometimes is her memory. I’ll say “I remember…” and Tia will be like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“No, that was me!” </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia, do you remember <em>Polar Express,</em> this book, about if you have hope and you believe in magic, you can hear a bell. So we would always read that book to our brother, Tahj, and still to this day, he loves that book. I’ve passed down reading that book to my kids, but there was a moment where I could have sworn we were eight years old and I heard Santa’s footsteps, and I heard the bells. Do you remember that, Tia? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940561.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Yes, I do! We really thought it was really Santa because we heard the bells from the reindeer, but it was Dad. We ended up realizing later it was Dad. Our parents did such a great job. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We believed [in Santa] until we were 11 years old. Yeah, we believed for a long time! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera, you said you hosted Thanksgiving. Are you hosting this year? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>No, we oscillate.<strong> </strong>I always host Christmas but on Thanksgiving we oscillate. It was you last year, me the year before that, so now Tahj is hosting this year. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We’re going over to his house and we’re all going to be there. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We do potluck style with Tahj.</p>



<p><strong>Who brings the mac and cheese?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I do. I can throw down on some mac and cheese. And you know who’s really  good at mac and cheese now?</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>[our other brother] Tavior. [My husband] Adam’s good too!</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>But girl he can’t touch my mac and cheese, I’m sorry. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know what we should do? We should have the family vote. We need to have a mac and cheese competition between Adam’s, Tavior’s and yours. So you know if you won hands down. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I’ve tasted Adam’s mac and cheese, girl, and it’s fabulous. It’s great too. But he can’t beat my mac and cheese. Sorry<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>We know that you’re both moms, and during the holidays you’re hanging out with each other’s families. Who would your kids say is the fun Auntie between the two of you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> I’m gonna say me. I am so the fun Auntie! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> But what would they say about me? </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I would say that they think that you’re really sweet. And warm and cool. </p>



<p><em>[Editor’s note: Tamera’s phone rings and it’s her husband Adam] </em></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> That’s Adam. Tell him my mac and cheese is better!<em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong><strong><em> [on the phone]:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Adam, we’re doing an interview right now. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Lord have mercy on my soul! My mac and cheese is better than your mac and cheese, Adam! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>What do you say, Adam?</p>



<p><strong><em>[Adam through the phone]</em></strong>: I’m not getting in the middle of this one! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>SMART man! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> I love you, I’ll call you later. <em>[hangs up phone] </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940564.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=762&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A381"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>So I’m the one that’s like, let’s come over to the house and have sleepovers, and let’s jump in the pool, and let’s go to amusement parks and stuff like that. Not that you’re not, but [Tamera], you’re very warm. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong>: If they want to talk about something, or if they’re having a challenging time and just want to release and chill. We’ll watch movies and just relax.</p>



<p><strong>It’s spooky season so everyone is doing their <em>Twitches</em></strong><strong> re-watch. Did you know when you were doing Twitches that all these years later people would still be so obsessed with it?  Does it still blow your mind? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>It blows my mind that people have tatted themselves with the sun and the moon. I’ve seen tattoos! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> They have Halloween parties, like the Halloween parties are themed around <em>Twitches</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia and I loved <em>Halloweentown. </em>Remember, we were obsessed with <em>Halloweentown, </em>and we had no idea that <em>Twitches</em> was going to become one of those. It is insane. Like, it’s iconic. It’s <em>Sister, Sister </em>and <em>Twitches</em>. That’s what we hear the most. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>People actually don’t know that we improvised the [“Go Twitches, go Twitches” chant]. I forgot what the director said but he was just saying, like, have fun. I think in the script it just said “Twitches” or “Twin witches” or something like that. And then we were like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“Go Twitches, go Twitches!” [<em>laughs</em>]</p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> It’s like “go home, Roger!” </p>



<p><strong>That’s our time but I was just going to ask you both to turn to each other and give each other the proverbial flowers that we collectively give to you all the time.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Aww! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We really, really appreciate that. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know, we should really do that today, give each other [actual] flowers. I’m serious! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>No, I know. Let’s go get some flowers. </p>

<p>November starts off like a smoldering poem written in invisible ink, and ends like an action-packed indie film with a rom-com twist and a psychedelic soundtrack. If October was about uncovering what haunts you, November is about <em>what you do with the ashes</em>. Are you going to keep poking around in the ruins, or are you finally going to build the fire pit, roast the marshmallows, and invite your higher self to come hang? <br /><br />The astro-weather this month is intense, deep, philosophical, and yes… messy. But in the best “clarity-through-chaos” kind of way. We kick off the month with Mars shifting into Sagittarius on November 4 after an emotionally consuming six-week stint in Scorpio. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio was laser-focused</a>, obsessive, and operating like a detective with a vendetta, chasing one target at a time with no room for distractions. <br /><br />Now, with Mars in Sagittarius, the energy gets more expansive, scattered, and inspired. But don’t let the hype fool you. This isn’t just a sprint toward “bigger and better.” Jupiter (Sag’s ruler) is retrograde in Cancer, so the compass is internal. Expansion for expansion’s sake is out. <em>Heart-led, intuitive expansion</em> is the only way forward. Every opportunity that knocks this month should be questioned: “Do I want this because it’s shiny? Or because my soul says yes?” </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 is like a cosmic weighted blanket. It’s earthy, ancestral, and anchored in reality, but still deeply sensual and steeped in beauty. Venus rules this moon, and she’ll be in the final degrees of Libra at the time, which adds a soft, romantic, and artful lens to the emotional intensity. There’s an invitation here to release the need to hustle for worthiness. Let your nervous system downshift. Let pleasure be productive. Let simplicity be sacred. <br /><br />Venus joins the Scorpio party on November 6, the day <em>after</em> the Taurus full moon. So while Mars has left the chat, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio energy is still very much holding court</a>. With the Sun, Venus, and later Mercury retrograde all swimming in Scorpio’s dark, transformational waters, the vibe is: “If I can’t bond with you on a soul level, what are we even doing here?” Expect obsessions, secrets, power plays, and some steamy (and possibly confusing) connections. Intimacy is currency this month — spend it wisely. <br /><br />On November 7, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde</a> shifts into the final degrees of Taurus, where it will complete its seven-year revolution through this sign. This is major. Taurus represents our values, our money, our bodies, our land, and our sense of stability. Uranus represents upheaval, revolution, and awakening. Over the next few months, we’re being asked to reflect: How have your core values changed since 2018? What financial, physical, or emotional risks have actually brought you closer to your truth — and what comfort zones have quietly been killing you? These final Uranian activations are wildcards, but they’re also full-circle. Prepare for the plot twists. </p>



<p>Here comes the real kicker: Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, just five days after Mars enters the sign. And it’s giving existential crisis with a laugh track. Expect mental overload, spiritual rants, lost documents, misunderstood texts, and big ideas that may not land… just yet. You might say too much, or not enough. But it’s all part of the recalibration. <br /><br />Then on November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio. Cue déjà vu. Whatever themes came up in October when Mercury was originally in Scorpio? They’re back. But this time, you’re not just collecting receipts — you’re reading them aloud and deciding which ones you want to return <em>and which ones you’re keeping as trophies</em>. Lessons will repeat until integration happens. </p>



<p>As if that wasn’t enough, Jupiter retrograde begins on 11/11 in Cancer. If Mercury retrograde is the mental review, Jupiter retrograde in Cancer is the emotional one. Expect tender feels, nostalgia bombs, family karma flare-ups, and a re-evaluation of what emotional security actually means. Jupiter retrograde in Cancer asks: Have you been caretaking others at the expense of yourself? Or avoiding intimacy under the guise of independence? Either way, this is your cue to grow — not by going “out there,” but by going <em>in here</em>. <br /><br />And then — finally — the clouds begin to part. On November 21 at 8:35pm, the Sun enters Sagittarius. That’s when the heaviness begins to lift. Your inner child wakes up. Your passport starts winking at you. There’s laughter again… the kind that surprises you mid-sentence. Sag season reminds us that we don’t always need a plan; we need a vision. And with Saturn finally stationing direct in Pisces on November 27, some of the lessons and limits we’ve been trudging through since June <em>finally</em> start to make sense. You’ve earned your wisdom stripes. Now you get to dance with them. <br /><br />To wrap it all up, Mercury stations direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30. So not only are we clearer, but we’re funnier, flirtier, freer. The month ends with a bang… in the best way. So yeah, the first three weeks of November may feel like crawling through an emotional escape room, but the final stretch? It’s giving spiritual carnival. An open road. And if you play your cards right, you’ll end this month with a deeper trust in your heart, your boundaries, your voice — and your ability to rise. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>You’re no stranger to fire, Aries, but this month starts in the deep end of water, and asks if you’re really ready to feel the heat that comes from <em>within</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season is activating your sector of shared intimacy</a>, soul ties, and karmic debts. That’s not exactly light-and-breezy terrain. Especially with your ruling planet, Mars, still journeying through Scorpio until November 4, you may find yourself quietly wrestling with themes like: <em>“Who do I trust enough to let all the way in?”</em> or <em>“Why do I keep giving energy to situations that don’t pour back into me?”</em> This is the kind of month where you could meet someone and immediately sense their presence in a past life — or finally have a long-overdue financial or emotional breakthrough around shared resources, inheritances, or entanglements. You’re not being dramatic, you’re being spiritually initiated. There’s a difference. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, landing in your money and selfworth zone, and things get <em>very</em> real, <em>very</em> fast. Suddenly the spiritual downloads from Scorpio Season have price tags attached: Are you charging what you’re worth? Are you getting paid fairly? Are you spending in ways that align with your values? With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus retrograde in Taurus</a> nearing its final degrees, this full moon might trigger a surprising plot twist with your finances or possessions — a job opportunity that wasn’t on your radar, an unexpected payout (or expense), or a radical new way of thinking about your resources altogether. Think of this as a cosmic audit, not a punishment. The Universe is asking: <em>Do your values and your budget actually match?</em> </p>



<p>From November 4 onward, things get feistier, as Mars enters Sagittarius, your zone of adventure, long-term vision, and personal expansion. Suddenly, all those emotional lessons you’ve been processing don’t feel quite so heavy — they feel like motivation. You might feel a deep pull to book that trip, apply to a course, publish your writing, or finally say the thing you’ve been holding back. But heads up: Mercury will be retrograde in this same part of your chart starting November 9, so while you <em>should</em> dream big and speak freely, double-check all logistics, contracts, and travel details. This retrograde may delay or reroute your plans, but not to block you. It’s to help you clarify your “why.” And once Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, you’ll get one last chance to rewire your mindset around fear, power, and desire before moving forward with more clarity and strength. <br /><br />The month ends on an upward note, as Sagittarius Season begins November 21, and Mercury Retrograde wraps up by November 29. You may feel like a fog is lifting, and suddenly the big picture makes sense again. Venus joins Sagittarius on November 30, sprinkling blessings over your long-term goals, education, and spiritual path. You’re not the same Aries you were at the start of the month; you’re deeper, wiser, and more attuned to what motivates you from the inside out. You didn’t just rise from the ashes. You studied the fire, danced with it, and now you’re ready to use it to light up the next chapter of your life. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins with intensity dripping from every interaction, Taurus. Scorpio Season is lighting up your relationship and one-on-one connection sector, and it’s not here for shallow vibes or lukewarm half-commitments. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">With Mars in Scorpio until November 4</a>, your relationships are your mirror — and they’re showing you everything you need to see, especially the stuff you’d rather avoid. This could be a sexy, soulstirring transit for some Bulls (yes, even the emotionally reserved ones), and for others, it could stir tension, jealousy, or unmet needs that have been bubbling under the surface for months. If you’re single, your standards are getting higher — as they should. If you’re partnered, you’re realizing the partnership needs to evolve if it’s going to last. You want more. And you’re not wrong for that.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, your annual cosmic spotlight. It’s been a <em>year</em>, hasn’t it? And yet here you are — softer, stronger, and more self-aware. This moon is ruled by Venus, your planetary ruler, which is finishing her journey through Libra before diving into Scorpio the next day. So this full moon is bittersweet: a celebration of how far you’ve come, and a shedding of all the versions of yourself you no longer need to perform. Since Uranus is retrograde in your sign and now in its final degrees, you may feel a deep urge to <em>finally</em> accept how much you’ve changed in the past seven years in appearance, identity, relationships, and direction. What used to define you might feel like an old costume now. Good. Hang it up. Something new is trying to grow in its place. </p>



<p>By mid-month, things start to shift from emotional excavation to deep embodiment. Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, joining the Sun there, and asking you to love deeper, choose wiser, and stay attuned to your real desires… not just the aesthetic ones. Then Mercury retrograde begins November 9 in Sagittarius, your intimacy and merging zone. This can bring back old lovers, contracts, or money matters tied to shared resources. Don’t be surprised if someone from the past wants to “talk.” But you’re not who you were before. You’ve got receipts. And Mercury’s backspin into Scorpio on the 18th will give you the chance to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2021/07/10567193/toxic-relationships-setting-boundaries"">renegotiate your emotional boundaries</a> if you need to. Be honest, but don’t overexplain. Your energy speaks volumes now. </p>



<p>The last stretch of the month opens the portal to real healing. Sagittarius Season kicks off on November 21, encouraging you to take your time before leaping into the next thing. Your soul is still digesting everything you’ve let go of this fall. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on the 27th, helping you re-establish faith in your friendships and long-term dreams, especially the ones that took a back seat this year. And with Mercury direct on the 29th and Venus entering Sagittarius on the 30th, things that once felt emotionally foggy (money, sex, trust) become clearer. You’ve been through the depths and didn’t flinch. Now, you’re ready to trust your body, your desires, and your evolution — even if it doesn’t look like anyone else’s. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s be real, Gemini — November might start off feeling like molasses. The Sun is in Scorpio, combined with Mars wrapping up its time in your wellness and routine sector, means you’ve been in <em>fix-it</em> mode: fixing your habits, your mind, your environment, your inbox (or trying). But it’s not just about optimizing your calendar… this energy is calling you to ask: <em>What is my life force actually fueling?</em> Your body is speaking louder now. If you’ve been ignoring rest, boundaries, or hydration (you know better!), this month will make you feel it. Let the first week of November be your reset — your personal rehab for burnout, guilt spirals, and emotional avoidance. This is your permission slip to pause and <em>listen</em>. </p>



<p>The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your spiritual sector like a dream download. If you’re someone who has trouble slowing down, this lunation might knock you into stillness through a dream, a sign, or a gut-level knowing. You’re ending a chapter here — maybe a limiting belief or an outdated loyalty. Venus is still in Libra when this full moon peaks, making it an aesthetic moment too. Surround yourself with music, scent, softness. Then, as Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, the vibe gets deeper, more reflective. Your daily rhythms might get a bit moodier, or you may notice you’re craving more alone time than usual. It’s not isolation, it’s a form of integration, especially with Uranus retrograde in Taurus, hovering at the end of a seven-year subconscious transformation. You’re realizing just how much you’ve been rewiring — even the invisible stuff. </p>



<p>Then things get… interesting. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your partnership zone. Oh yes, exes may text. Collaborators from the past may circle back. Current partners may say something that makes you go “Wait, what?” But don’t spiral… this is your cosmic cue to <em>review</em> the terms of your emotional contracts. Mercury re-enters Scorpio on the 18th, bringing the focus back to how your boundaries and emotional labor are being managed. If you’ve been doing <em>too much</em> (classic Gemini when anxious), this is your call to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-detox-how-to-cleanse-your-mind"">delegate, detox, and discern</a>. Don’t be afraid to <em>not reply immediately</em>. Mercury’s got you covered. </p>



<p>The final stretch of November is giving plot twist with a happy ending. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on the 21st</a>, energizing your one-on-one connections and reminding you that vulnerability is not a weakness — it’s an invitation to intimacy. Jupiter retrogrades in Cancer starting 11/11, bringing a money mindset reset, while Saturn shifts direct in your career zone on the 27th, helping you take your creative visions more seriously. By the Venus in Sagittarius shift on the 30th, you’re magnetic again — romantic, radiant, and recharged. You’ve done the shadow work, now get ready to flirt with life like the main character you are. Trust: you can do both depth <em>and</em> levity. That’s your superpower. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November begins like a poem with a plot twist, Cancer. Scorpio Season activates your sector of creativity, romance, and joy, but it’s a deep kind of joy, not the fleeting fireworks. It’s the kind that comes from healing your inner child. That’s why this month may bring tender feelings to the surface: unresolved heartaches, old crushes, or forgotten dreams asking for a second chance. Mars is here too, stirring up passion and creative urgency. If you’ve been sitting on an idea, this is your green light to birth it. Just know that Scorpio doesn’t do anything halfway. Whether it’s love, art, or sex, you’re either <em>in</em> or <em>out</em> — no halfway intimacy allowed. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">your friendship and community zone</a>, helping you see who’s really in your corner. You may realize that a long-standing connection no longer fits the vision of who you’re becoming, and it’s okay to let go with love. Or maybe you’re finally ready to <em>lead</em> in your community, turning a private passion into a public project. Since this Full Moon is ruled by Venus in late Libra, your home life and family dynamics are also highlighted. Beauty rituals, ancestral wisdom, and long phone calls with your favorite cousin are all medicine. And then — bam — Venus enters Scorpio on the 6th, turning your love life into a gothic novel. Think: slow burns, meaningful glances, psychic intimacy. <em>Someone</em> wants to go deeper with you, but can they meet you where you are? </p>



<p>Here’s where the retrograde fun begins. Mercury Retrograde starts in Sagittarius on November 9, shaking up your daily habits, health routines, and work-life balance. You may lose a file. Miss a meeting. Or get a strong urge to quit something that’s draining your spirit. Take a breath… this isn’t sabotage, it’s realignment. When Mercury slips back into Scorpio on the 18th, you’re being asked to rework a creative idea or reconnect with a lover from the past. Don’t romanticize the rewind, but <em>do</em> be curious. Meanwhile, Jupiter retrograde begins in Cancer (your sign!) on 11/11, making the second half of November a mirror. How have you outgrown your own identity? What would expansion look like if it were rooted in <em>self-love</em>, not performance? <br /><br />Then comes the glow-up. Sagittarius Season starts on the 21st, helping you turn chaos into a system. Your task? Find structure that feels <em>freeing</em>, not confining. Saturn shifts direct in your expansion zone on the 27th, grounding you in your truth, and Mercury stations direct in Scorpio on the 29th, freeing up creative blocks or emotional confusion. Finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you find joy in the small things again: making your matcha, editing your playlist, flirting in the grocery aisle. November ends with you feeling more <em>you</em> than you’ve felt in a while — bolder, clearer, and ready to move from survival to sparkle. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November’s energy begins in your emotional roots, Leo, as Scorpio Season activates your sector of home, family, and your inner world. With Mars also in Scorpio, you may feel more sensitive than usual, even if you’re trying to keep up your bold and brave front. This isn’t the month to push feelings down. It’s the month to look them in the eye. There may be tension with loved ones or a desire to move, rearrange your space, or finally set boundaries with a roommate or parent. You’re reclaiming your sanctuary — physically and emotionally — and it’s not always graceful work, but it’s soul-deep and necessary. Journaling, therapy, crying in the bath… it all counts as progress this month. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public recognition zone, and the world is watching. You’ve been working on something behind-thescenes, and this lunation could bring praise, press, or even promotion. But it also asks you to reflect: <em>Am I doing this for legacy, or for applause?</em> Venus is still in Libra that day, softening communication and helping you speak your truth kindly, but clearly. The next day, Venus enters Scorpio, adding more intensity to your private life. Expect deeper conversations, late-night pillow talk, and some potent family revelations. It’s like your inner world becomes the real love story of the month, even if that means finally loving yourself in the places you used to abandon. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the retrogrades start stirring things up. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your fun, flirtation, and self-expression zone. If a creative idea stalls or a romantic prospect ghosts, don’t panic. Rethink your approach. Ask yourself where the spark went — maybe it’s you that needs rest, not the idea or the lover. When Mercury re-enters Scorpio on November 18, you’re brought back to unresolved emotions at home or with family. A childhood memory may resurface. Or an old version of yourself might be grieving what you’ve outgrown. Don’t rush through the tenderness. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, lighting up your spiritual zone. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/recurring-dreams-meaning"">Your dreams may be extra vivid</a>. Your ancestors extra loud. Listen. <br /><br />And then: lift off. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and you start to feel like <em>you</em> again. Not the Leo who has to hold it all together, but the one who laughs loud, kisses like fire, and shines unapologetically. Saturn shifts direct in your intimacy sector on November 27, helping you better understand what commitment actually means for you — and what’s worth saying yes to. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, bringing emotional clarity at last. Then Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, and romance, creativity, and confidence start bubbling again. November ends with your heart wide open — wiser, softer, and still burning bright. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The beginning of November pulls you inward, Virgo. Scorpio Season is activating your communication and inner dialogue sector, and with Mars also in Scorpio, your mind is a hotbed of activity. You might feel more argumentative than usual, or more quick to defend your ideas. But instead of getting stuck in loops or overexplaining, take a beat: <em>Who are you really trying to convince?</em> Others… or yourself? The truth is, this month wants to help you refine your inner voice — to trust it, but also challenge it when it’s stuck in outdated loops. Therapy, journaling, or even audio notes to yourself could be surprisingly clarifying. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 activates your expansion sector, which is all about publishing, travel, and higher learning. Something you’ve been studying, writing, or dreaming about may finally come full circle, and you’ll be asked: <em>Do you still want this?</em> Venus in Libra that day helps you align your values before making any big declarations. But the very next day, Venus enters Scorpio, and suddenly, everything feels more emotionally charged. Your words can cut — or heal — depending on how you wield them. Old conversations may come back for review later in the month when Mercury Retrograde (starting Nov 9 in Sagittarius) retraces its steps, first in your home and emotional sector, then eventually back into Scorpio on November 18. </p>



<p>And yes, Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius may stir up home drama or nostalgia. You might reconnect with a sibling, parent, or even an old roommate. Or you could find yourself rethinking where you want to live and what kind of foundation you’re building your future on. The Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting 11/11 adds an emotional edge to your friendships and long-term dreams. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mid-distance-relationships"">Some relationships might feel distant</a>. But that distance is showing you who truly sees you — and who’s just there for convenience. Not everything that’s consistent is actually nourishing. <br /><br />Then comes relief. Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and the Sun lights up your foundation, helping you feel more secure and centered. Saturn shifts direct in your relationship sector on November 27, bringing clarity around boundaries and long-term commitment. Mercury shifts direct in Scorpio on the 29th, restoring flow to your conversations and mindset. And to wrap it all up, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, helping you beautify your home and maybe even plan a cozy holiday gathering. You’re leaving November with a clearer head, a softer heart, and a deeper understanding of what home <em>really</em> means — inside and out.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>November wants to talk about your worth, Libra. And not just in terms of money — though Scorpio Season and Mars in Scorpio are definitely heating up your financial sector. This is bigger. It’s about your value system, your sense of self-worth, and how those two things intersect. You’re being asked: <em>Are you charging enough for your gifts? Are you pouring your energy into people who match your frequency?</em> The month starts off intense, especially if you’ve been overextending yourself in order to be liked. No more. You’re recalibrating. Even if that means pulling back. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your intimacy and merging sector, bringing some financial, sexual, or emotional entanglements to a head. Something’s gotta give. It could be a final bill, a revelation in therapy, or a sexual connection that either deepens or ends. Venus is still in Libra that day, helping you move with grace and charm. But on the 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, and your vibe gets much more private. Suddenly, you’re craving quality over quantity in love, in money, in everything. </p>



<p>It’s giving: “If it doesn’t feel sacred, I don’t want it.” Honor that. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, in your communication zone. So watch what you say and how you say it, and also how you <em>hear</em> others. Miscommunications could spark easily, especially in text or over email. When Mercury retrogrades back into Scorpio on November 18, y<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/low-self-esteem-spending-money"">our money and self-worth come back into focus</a>. If you’re negotiating rates, contracts, or even just trying to figure out your holiday budget, take your time. This retrograde is your chance to revise, not rush. Add in Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starting on 11/11 — lighting up your career sector — and it’s clear: November is all about long-term alignment, not quick wins.<br /><br />By Sagittarius Season (Nov 21), your voice gets stronger again. You’ll feel like sharing more, laughing more, connecting more. Saturn shifts direct in your daily routine sector on November 27, helping you get back on track with health, organization, or wellness habits that may have fallen off. Mercury shifts direct on the 29th, clearing mental fog. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, and you’re back in your social butterfly flow — radiant, expressive, and ready to flirt again. You end the month remembering who you are: an artist, a lover, a light. Don’t forget what you’re worth. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You are <em>the</em> moment, Scorpio, but you already knew that. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Scorpio Season keeps going strong through November 21</a>, and with Mercury also spending time in your sign from November 18th to December 11th, your energy is magnetically focused, deliciously intense, and hard to ignore. You’re in transformation mode, and the world can feel like it’s rotating around your evolution. You’ve likely been tunnel-visioned lately, obsessed with a particular outcome, person, or path. But as Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, it’s time to loosen your grip. The work you’ve done to go deep now wants to expand. But not just anywhere… your soul knows exactly where. <br /><br />Right after Mars exits your sign, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your relationship sector, bringing closure or clarity in love. Someone may surprise you with their emotional maturity, or their lack of it. You’re seeing clearly now. Venus is in her final degrees of Libra that day, moving through your soul and secrets sector, helping you end a chapter with grace. But once Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, you’re magnetic as hell. People are watching you like art. You’re watching them like a hawk. Your beauty is sharper, your desires louder. Love, sex, and money all take on deeper significance, but beware of projecting old wounds onto new people. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets tricky, though. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, clouding your money mindset and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-confidence-code-a-reminder-that-you-are-worthy"">self-worth sector</a>. Double check receipts, revisit pricing, and be gentle with self-talk. Then on November 18, Mercury dips back into Scorpio, and boom — you’re reviewing your own words, your own intentions. Something you said or decided last month may need to be reworked. Don’t panic. This is a cosmic do-over. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on 11/11, activating your publishing, travel, and belief system sector. You may postpone a trip or start questioning your bigger life plans. Let the questions come… They’re clues. <br /><br />And then? Big breakthrough. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2024-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius Season begins on November 21</a>, and with it comes the shift from intense introspection to grounded action. You’re focused on your finances, your value, your legacy. Saturn shifts direct in Pisces on November 27, in your creativity and romance sector, helping you solidify a passion project or commit more seriously in love. Mercury shifts direct in your sign on November 29, unblocking your voice and clarity. And finally, Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, reminding you that abundance is your birthright, but only when you believe you’re worthy of it. You’ll end the month sharper, sexier, and more self-aware than you began. Phoenix status: reactivated. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>The month starts in the cocoon, Sag, but it doesn’t stay there for long. With the Sun in Scorpio through November 21, your sector of rest, release, and dreams is activated, nudging you to slow down before your season begins. This is your yearly invitation to clean house spiritually and emotionally. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, launching a six-week period of accelerated movement, confidence, and main-character energy. The tension between the two — wanting to retreat and also being pushed into the spotlight — can be confusing at first. But here’s the thing: just because Mars is in your sign doesn’t mean you have to rush. Move with clarity, not chaos. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your wellness and work sector, helping you re-evaluate your daily habits and rituals. If you’ve been <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-of-anxiety-and-depression-symptoms"">neglecting your body</a> or overextending yourself with work, this lunation is your wake-up call. With Venus at the final degrees of Libra the same day, friendships may play a surprising role in helping you ground yourself. Then Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, stirring hidden feelings. Someone you thought you were over may resurface in your dreams, your inbox, or your heart. This Venus transit moves through your solitude zone, so you might be more sensitive to energetic shifts; don’t dismiss your intuition. </p>



<p>The middle of the month gets hazy. Mercury Retrograde begins in your sign on November 9, making you rethink everything from how you show up online to what you <em>really</em> believe in. If you’re working on a pitch, post, or big reveal, delay it until next month if possible. Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer begins on 11/11, activating your intimacy and soul-merging sector. Emotional boundaries may blur, but this is also a chance to heal old wounds around trust. By November 18, Mercury retrogrades into Scorpio, pushing you back into reflection. Whatever came up during Scorpio Season needs a final purge, so make space. <br /><br />Then your solar rebirth season begins — finally! Sagittarius Season starts on November 21 at 8:35 PM EST, and the shift will feel like a deep exhale. You’re back, baby. The Sun in your sign brings vitality, clarity, and the courage to dream again. Saturn goes direct in Pisces on November 27, stabilizing your home and emotional foundations. If you’ve been navigating family tension or housing uncertainty, things start to feel more solid. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on November 29, giving you a clearer sense of what to say, or <em>not</em> say. And on November 30, Venus enters Sagittarius, gifting you with charm, beauty, and cosmic flirtation. You’re ending the month glowing, expansive, and ready for your next adventure. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first three weeks of November remind you that even the most selfsufficient mountain goat needs community. Scorpio Season activates your sector of friendships, social networks, and long-term dreams. You may find yourself orbiting new circles, or reevaluating the people who get to be in your orbit at all. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, stirring up your sector of closure and healing. This is a sixweek invitation to burn away what no longer resonates with you, especially habits or mindsets you’ve outgrown. With Mars behind the scenes, not everything needs to be public. Power moves can still be made in silence. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 turns your attention to your sector of romance, creativity, and pleasure. You deserve to feel good in your body, and this lunation reminds you of that. Whether you’re deepening a current connection or expressing yourself through your art, something you’ve been nurturing is ready to blossom. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra that day (your career zone), a professional payoff may also arrive — recognition, a collaboration, or a glow-up that reminds you you’ve still got it. But the next day, Venus enters Scorpio, so expect your social life to become deeper, more emotionally layered, and maybe a little more intense. </p>



<p>The middle of the month asks for patience. Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on November 18. Conversations, contracts, or collaborations <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-is-deja-vu-meaning"">may feel like déjà vu</a>. You might revisit an old dream, a past friendship, or a vision for the future that you shelved. Don’t rush to act… just listen. Jupiter Retrograde begins in Cancer on November 11, calling for reflection in your relationship dynamics. Ask yourself: are your partnerships truly reciprocal? Are you overgiving? Or perhaps being too guarded? You don’t have to fix it all this month,. but consistent self-awareness is step one. <br /><br />Sagittarius Season begins on November 21, and it’s your time to slow down before your own season begins. Think of this last stretch of the year as your cosmic hibernation: rest, review, and reconnect with your inner compass. Saturn, your ruling planet, ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27, making communication, writing, and mental clarity much smoother. You’ll start to feel like your words hold more weight… and they do. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on November 30, softening your inner world and giving you the grace to forgive yourself for how long healing has taken. You’re in deep preparation mode. By next month, you’ll be ready to rise. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re a visionary, Aquarius, but even visionaries hit fog. Scorpio Season rules your sector of legacy and career, so the first three weeks of November are deeply focused on your purpose. But it’s not just about what you do, it’s about <em>why</em> you’re doing it. Mars’ entrance in Sagittarius on November 4 ignites your sector of community, collaboration, the future. Suddenly, people are reaching out, ideas are flowing, and projects with purpose start calling your name. You’re not just chasing the bag this month — you’re chasing the vision that aligns with your soul’s mission. Still, with Uranus (one of your planetary rulers) retrograding in Taurus, your home, family, or sense of inner stability might feel shaky. Breathe through it. You’re building a new foundation. <br /><br />The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your domestic sector and your emotional center. Something you’ve been suppressing about your past, your upbringing, or even your living situation may come up for release. This is a heart-check moon, one that reminds you to nurture your inner world before building the outer one. And just when you think you’re getting grounded, Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, intensifying your desire for power moves and recognition. Yes, you’re deeply magnetic, but protect your peace. </p>



<p>Mercury Retrograde begins in Sagittarius on November 9, then moves into Scorpio on the 18th. This combo could feel like you’re reworking both your dreams <em>and</em> your professional direction. An old project may return, or a past ambition reawakens. Take notes, but don’t rush. Meanwhile, Jupiter Retrograde in Cancer starts on 11/11 (an ascension portal day!) And nudges you to reconfigure your routines and health habits. Are you doing what actually sustains you, or just what looks good on paper? <br /><br />By the time Sagittarius Season starts on November 21, life gets a bit lighter, more adventurous, and hilarious in that Sag way. The final 10 days of the month bring major energetic shifts: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn ends its retrograde in Pisces on November 27</a>, helping you finally implement new financial or self-worth boundaries. Then Mercury shifts direct on November 29, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, helping you align with the friendships and collabs that uplift your spirit. You’re not here to follow trends, Aquarius — you’re here to shape the future. So stay weird and stay wise. You’re closer than ever. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, November opens with a whisper from your higher self: “You’re evolving.” Scorpio Season rules your sector of wisdom, expansion, and travel, and these first three weeks may feel like a spiritual initiation. Maybe you’re craving distance, space, or perspective. Maybe you’re being pushed to outgrow a belief, a path, or a relationship you once thought was forever. Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4, activating your sector of career, and just like that, the stakes feel higher. You’re climbing a new mountain, Pisces. The next six weeks want you to lead, to be seen, to step into the role you’ve quietly been preparing for. <br /><br />But slow your roll… the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 hits your sector of communication, teaching, and truth. A conversation, message, or idea lands deeply. You could launch something, publish something, or even receive news that shifts your course. With Venus finishing its journey through Libra, your intimacy and financial dynamics reach a point of clarity, and then Venus dives into Scorpio on November 6, bringing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-finances-transparency-relationship"">emotional transparency into your relationships</a>. Say what you feel, even if your voice trembles. Say what you want, even if you’re not sure how it’ll be received. </p>



<p>The middle of the month is retrograde heavy: Mercury Retrograde in Sagittarius begins November 9 and then Scorpio (Nov 18) may slow career launches or travel plans. You might question the direction you’re heading — don’t panic. That’s part of the process. Then Jupiter Retrograde begins in your fifth house of love, creativity, and joy on November 11, nudging you to reconnect with what lights you up from the inside out. Have you been making space for beauty? For your art? For romantic playfulness? Don’t wait until you burn out… nourish yourself and tend to your needs now.<br /><br />Sagittarius Season starts November 21, and with your career in the spotlight, the pressure may rise, but so does your ambition. Then on the 27th, Saturn shifts direct in your sign after months of restructuring your identity and path. You may feel more grounded in who you are and what you offer. Mercury ends its retrograde in Scorpio on the 29th, and Venus enters Sagittarius on the 30th, ending the month with a boost of charm and cosmic green lights. November ends on a high note: expansive, exhilarating, and a little chaotic in a good way. You’ve done the inner work, Pisces. Now let the world catch up to your brilliance. </p>

Mamacita has many meanings. Literally, it translates to “little mother,” but colloquially it can describe an attractive woman or serve as a sweet nickname for someone dear. For Miami-based fashion label <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection%2Fproducts%2Felsa-cardigan&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carolina K</a> and model <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/helena-christensen-proves-shes"">Helena Christensen</a>, the name of their newly launched line captures all those nuances — strength, sensuality, and affection — while also honoring the Andean elders who hand-knit each piece.<br /><br />Launched on October 24, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcarolinak.com%2Fcollections%2Fmamacita-collection&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fcarolina-k-helena-christensen-mamacita"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mamacita</a> draws inspiration from both Carolina Kleinman, the Bolivian-Argentine designer who founded Carolina K in 2005, and Christensen, the Peruvian-Danish supermodel, as well as from the South American mothers who shaped them. In fact, the collaboration became a deeply personal creative journey when Christensen returned to her mother’s hometown of Lima, Peru, after decades away. She brought her mother, Elsa, along, and together they reconnected with family while visiting historic neighborhoods and art galleries from their past.<br /><br />“We were in my hotel room looking at all the pieces, and we were all just expressing how important it felt. For them, it was a personal trip, and I got to be part of that,” Kleinman tells Refinery29 Somos.<br /><br />Timed to the 20th anniversary of the Carolina K brand, Mamacita represents both a creative milestone and a heartfelt tribute to the communities that have inspired Kleinman’s vision from the start. For nearly two decades — long before <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/can-fashion-be-sustainable"">sustainability became a buzzword</a> — Kleinman has championed ethical fashion through handcrafted pieces that celebrate ancestral techniques and empower the artisans who keep them alive. Working with makers in remote regions of Mexico, Peru, and India, her brand continues to honor cultural traditions while protecting the planet.<br /><br />“We are not about inventing something new every season. Instead, we want to give what we make a longer life. The more timeless we get to do things, the better it is for everyone,” Kleinman says. “Some things are just classic. And we wanted to create a brand that was classic and meaningful.”<br /><br />From limited-edition hand-embroidered garments and Peruvian-made knitwear to design details inspired by the Andes and the ocean, the collection embodies a timeless elegance.<br /><br />As Kleinman explains, the capsule includes pieces “for every occasion.” In the lookbook, Christensen models the collection in moments that span her life’s journey: dipping into the ocean, walking through the Lima neighborhood of Barranco, attending a dinner party, and wandering the cool mountains. “There’s a look for every moment in our lives, because it represents different women. There’s not one prototype of a woman.”<br /><br />Swipe through to discover some of our favorite pieces from the Mamacita collection.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on Friday, October 31 (Happy Halloween!), and both VIBs and Insiders get the green light on November 4. <em>All</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>

<p>We<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review""> reviewed Shark’s FlexFusion</a> last year, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. This year, we’re eyeing the Glam —Shark’s latest innovation, which includes curling barrels, a smoothing brush, finishing tool, straightener, and a concentrator nozzle to achieve a variety of looks.</p>

<p>Charlotte Tilbury’s iconic Lip Cheat pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. From the iconic Pillow Talk rosy nude to rich reds, this makeup artist-favorite liner is a lip combo essential.</p>

<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever.

<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>

<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now.

The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>

<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>

<p>This time last year, celebrity makeup artist Mary Phillips’ brand, m.ph, was still waiting in the wings. This year, however, is a different story. The versatile complexion palette is already a Sephora bestseller, and thanks to a recent restock, you can snag yours at a discount during the sale. </p>

<p><em>Warning: This story contains graphic details of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2019/10/8643443/15-signs-of-domestic-violence-that-arent-physical"">domestic violence</a>.  </em></p>



<p>I will never forget the night that finally made me leave. My ex-partner and I were at an event with friends. Everything seemed fine until he — as he often did — switched from affectionate to enraged without warning. Throughout the night, he sent me cryptic texts: <em>“I’m watching you. You’ll see what happens when we get home.”</em></p>



<p>The venue was dark and crowded, which allowed him to hide in the shadows. When he finally appeared, I was already in tears. I told him I was done. He grabbed me so tightly I could barely breathe, whispering, “You’ll never leave me.” When I tried to escape, he threw me to the ground and began kicking me—my face, my stomach, my back. I remember praying, <em>“God, please help me get through this.”</em> A friend eventually pulled him off me, and another rushed me outside.</p>



<p>That night, I ran to my sister’s apartment. My best friend joined us, and together they convinced me to call my mother. I didn’t want to; I had been hiding so much from my family, and I knew calling meant going to the hospital and filing a report. I also feared what my ex had always threatened: <em>“If you send me to jail, I’ll kill myself.”</em></p>



<p>When my mom saw my bruised face over FaceTime, she broke down. At the hospital, I was surrounded by police officers and doctors, forced to retell the story again and again. Even then, I tried to protect him—until I learned he and his mother lied to the police, saying I’d fallen down stairs. That betrayal broke something in me. I told the truth. I filed for a restraining order, terrified but determined to protect myself.</p>



<p>When I met him, I was in a vulnerable place and searching for love, something I think now that he sensed. The control and manipulation started subtly—name-calling, jealousy, isolation. I was shocked, yes, but I took it because I convinced myself that he loved me. Then the emotional abuse became physical. I was constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of his next outburst. He would punch walls, throw objects, and then apologize, promising he’d never hurt me again. Like so many survivors, I stayed, believing he could change. I was in a constant state of hope—hope that the man I first met would return, hope that things would go back to “normal.” However, the truth is that there was never anything normal about it.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The abuse only escalated from there. Over time, I became someone I didn’t recognize—isolated, anxious, and ashamed. He would push me against walls, crack drywall, and then threaten to harm himself to pull me back in. I remember breaking down locked doors to stop him from self-harming. Every time I thought of leaving, he’d promise to change—or promise to die.</p>



<p>After that final night, something inside me broke open. I started therapy and eventually found <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/"">Safe Horizon</a> through friends and family who told me about the work they do. It was the first time I felt truly ready to speak out.</p>



<p>I learned that my story was not unique, and that’s what makes it so devastating. Domestic violence is not simply isolated or personal; it’s cultural, systemic, and global. It crosses every boundary: race, class, gender, and age. The tactics abusers use are eerily similar: isolation, intimidation, emotional manipulation, and control.</p>







<p>Safe Horizon, the largest victim service nonprofit in the U.S., provides critical resources for survivors of abuse and violent crime. What drew me to them was their inclusive approach—they support survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and more. Their <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/streetwork/"">Streetwork Project</a> helps young people experiencing homelessness due to abuse, offering food, shelter, medical care, and compassion without judgment. They reach survivors wherever they are, meeting them with dignity and safety.</p>



<p>Too often, young women—especially Black women—don’t feel safe seeking help. We’re told to stay quiet, that no one will believe us, that leaving is pointless. And the question survivors hear most—<em>“Why didn’t you just leave?”</em>—is one of the most harmful. As FKA Twigs bravely shared when <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html"">speaking about her own experience</a>, that question blames the survivor instead of the perpetrator. Leaving isn’t simple—it’s dangerous. It’s layered with fear, shame, financial dependency, and psychological manipulation. Even after leaving, survivors face systemic challenges: renewing restraining orders, reliving trauma in court, and constantly looking over our shoulders.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=5wSrVmPeQSA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Through Safe Horizon</a>, I found healing, advocacy, and community. The <a href=""https://www.safehorizon.org/about-us/leadership/senior-leadership/"">organization’s leaders</a> like Lisa A. O’Connor and Liz Roberts, create true safety by approaching survivors with empathy, patience, and emotional intelligence. Even small gestures—asking <em>“Do you welcome hugs?”</em>—remind survivors that we have autonomy again.</p>



<p>One of the most profound parts of my healing has been realizing that survival doesn’t mean the pain disappears. It means transforming it. As <a href=""https://grief.com/"">author and grief expert David Kessler wrote</a>, I learned to turn my “pain into purpose”. I use my voice now to help others recognize the signs of abuse before it’s too late. Love should never make you smaller. Real love doesn’t silence, it protects and uplifts.</p>
