<h2>What are Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Prime Day started out as a one-day sale in 2015 to mark Amazon’s 20th anniversary, and has now become a full 48-hour shopping event that takes place twice a year. It’s fully become its own shopping holiday, rivaling Black Friday. Prime Day (and its <strong><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Big Deal Days</a></strong> sister holiday) itself has evolved over the past decade, but what you can always expect are daily and hourly deals on a massive selection of the site’s best-selling items, both from in-house brands as well as familiar names in fashion, beauty, and more. </p>



<h2>When is Prime Big Deal Days this year?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://amzn.to/3KkD9zd"">Prime Big Deal Days 2025</a> will take place on <strong>October 7 and 8</strong>. Watch this space to discover which products you need to snag ASAP and how you can access the sale.</p>



<h2>What is on sale for Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>As with previous Prime Days, products across beauty, fashion, home, tech, and more will be on sale this week as part of the event. While you wait for the deals to begin, you can shop early discounts on everyday essentials, home tech, and more. </p>



<h2>How do I get access to Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>There’s no way around it: You have to be an Amazon Prime member to access these discounts. Set deal alerts based on your shopping and search history for personalized recommendations through the Amazon app. (Alexa can also help you in this department.)</p>



<h2>Is Prime Big Deal Days worth it?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, if you’re unsure about the benefits of joining Amazon Prime but don’t want to miss out on Prime Day, you can sign up for a free (!) 30-day trial. (This is kind of the perfect time to work the system, but, if you love the benefits, you can keep your membership after the trial period for $14.99 a month.) In addition to the marquee benefits of free lightning-fast shipping and hours of entertainment via Prime Video, there are lesser-known conveniences, like discounts from Amazon Pharmacy, early access to blink-and-you’ll-miss-them Lightning Deals, and ad-free music and podcasts with Amazon Music.</p>



<h2>Does Amazon ever offer discounts on Prime memberships?</h2>



<p>If you decide you like the Prime lifestyle and want to keep your access to everything Amazon has to offer, there are two ways to get an ongoing discount on your Prime membership. <a href=""https://amzn.to/448ycOr"">College students are eligible for a six-month free trial</a> followed by a $7.49 monthly fee for Prime, which is 50% off the regular monthly price. In addition, if you<a href=""https://amzn.to/3NHNPHp""> receive government benefits</a> in the form of SNAP, WIC, or other EBT programs, you can get Prime perks for a discounted $6.99 per month.</p>



<h2>What deals will Amazon’s competitors have during Prime Big Deal Days?</h2>



<p>Amazon has done such a thorough job of creating a frenzy around Prime Day that almost every other big-box retailer under the sun (Best Buy, Target, Walmart, even eBay) is likely to run some sort of alternative sale around then. All’s fair in love and shopping, right? </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935639.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to the week where September ends and October begins; where Q4 kicks oﬀ and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/locking-in-tiktok-trend-personal-development"">collective lock-in</a> begins. Mars, the planet of action, is oﬃcially in Scorpio, the sign of intensity, precision, and transformation. This is the week to take your power back. To get organized about what actually matters, to follow through, to stop pretending someone’s coming to save you.<br /><br />We kick oﬀ with a First Quarter Moon in Capricorn on September 29, about a week after the Virgo Solar Eclipse. It’s our first cosmic checkpoint, a moment to assess how our new Moon intentions are landing in reality. Quarter Moons aren’t the flashiest lunations, but they’re often the most honest. In Capricorn, the Moon says: show me your progress, not your promises. For the collective, this lunation invites us to take practical, strategic steps toward our long-term goals, but also to hold ourselves and our institutions accountable. In a world full of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-focus-concentrate"">distractions and deflections</a>, Capricorn moons cut through the noise. They expose what’s been swept under the rug, from the personal to the political.</p>



<p>Then, on October 1, we experience a major energetic shift: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9888932/asteroid-day-2020-astrology-meaning"">Juno, the asteroid</a> of marriage, enters Sagittarius. Asteroids represent archetypes, and Juno specifically rules soul contracts, loyalty, devotion, and commitments, both romantic and otherwise. In Scorpio, Juno made us crave all-or-nothing intensity: if it wasn’t soul-shaking, it wasn’t enough. But Juno in Sagittarius says <em>freedom is sexy too. </em>We may now crave more spaciousness in our partnerships, friendships, and even within ourselves. This is the season of sacred detachment: committing to growth without clinging, opening to love without losing ourselves. Whether you’re single, partnered, in community, or solo- traveling the cosmos, Juno in Sagittarius reminds us that devotion and exploration are not opposites. They can, and must, coexist.<br /><br />Finally, Mercury spends its final days in Libra this week, preparing to dive into Scorpio next week. As the planet of communication wraps up its journey through the sign of balance, justice, and relationships, we’re being invited to reflect on what we’ve learned about how we speak, listen, negotiate, and align. These final days are your last chance to make peace — with others or with yourself — before Mercury joins Mars in the deep waters of Scorpio. Let your words be bridges, not blades. Let your mind be open, not avoidant. Libra energy is often labeled indecisive, but in truth, it’s just thorough. Mercury in Libra is teaching us how to see the full picture, especially when it comes to love, justice, and truth.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, you’ve been reborn. Last week’s eclipse helped you recalibrate your daily flow and reconnect with your body’s wisdom. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon shines in your career and legacy sector, reminding you that ambition without purpose <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. What goals are worth sustaining through Q4? What are you chasing, and who are you chasing it for? You’re being asked to align your outer achievements with your inner truth. Don’t just move forward because you’re used to moving… move forward because your soul said “yes.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, Juno entering Sagittarius activates your sector of expansion and truth, making this a powerful time to redefine your relationship to commitment. Maybe you’re not meant to settle — maybe you’re meant to soar with someone who shares your vision. This transit could bring a romantic spark abroad, online, or in a classroom setting, or rekindle curiosity within an existing connection. Mercury’s final days in Libra land in your partnership sector, giving you one more chance to clarify what you want and how you want to be met. Don’t assume people know; say it, write it, show it.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, your beliefs are evolving. The Virgo eclipse reminded you that creativity is your birthright, not a luxury. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon activates your sector of expansion, travel, and higher learning, pushing you to take a leap: book the trip, say yes to the course, pitch the wild idea. What if the structure you crave is only waiting on your first step? It’s time to let yourself outgrow the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/childhood-nostalgic-memories-comfort"">comfort zone</a> that’s secretly become a cage. Let inspiration, not obligation, be your guide: Especially when the path feels unfamiliar.<br /><br />Juno’s entrance in Sagittarius activates your intimacy and transformation sector, asking you to expand your view of what deep connection looks like. Sometimes, the people we’re most bound to are also the ones we need to loosen our grip on. This transit can help you explore new levels of vulnerability, or reclaim power from contracts and entanglements that no longer serve your becoming. Mercury in Libra finishes its tour through your wellness and work sector, helping you clean up loose ends and restore balance before life gets more emotionally intense. Stay hydrated, reorganize your schedule, and remember: busyness is not proof of worth.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the eclipse last week cracked your heart open, and now you’re in the rebuilding stage. The Capricorn First Quarter Moon rises in your sector of shared resources and vulnerability, asking: who do you trust with your full self? Not just the witty surface — but the tender, complicated truth underneath. Where are you still performing instead of allowing yourself to be witnessed? This is a week to name what you need, even if it scares you. Especially if it scares you. Liberation starts with honesty.<br /><br />Juno’s shift into Sagittarius lands in your partnership sector, reigniting your desire for playfulness, honesty, and adventure in your relationships. Whether single or committed, you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-end-a-situationship"">craving connections</a> that feel like freedom, not pressure. Think shared road trips, soul-expanding conversations, and laughing till your belly hurts… that’s the vibe. Mercury’s final stretch in Libra activates your sector of romance and joy, helping you flirt, charm, and express yourself with style. Create space for levity; your heart wants room to dance, not just overanalyze.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, this month’s Virgo eclipse turned your attention to your words and thoughts, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon at the start of the week rises in your relationship sector, making it clear that communication isn’t just a skill… it’s a love language. This lunation may illuminate a partnership dynamic that feels out of alignment with your long-term vision. Are you truly feeling seen? Or are you shrinking to keep the peace? If tension surfaces this week, don’t avoid it. Navigate it with grace, but also with boundaries.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/06/9888932/asteroid-day-2020-astrology-meaning"">Juno entering Sagittarius</a> this week energizes your wellness and daily rhythm sector, encouraging you to prioritize commitments that keep you grounded. It’s time to treat your rituals — sleep, breathwork, walking, journaling — as sacred partnerships too. The fun begins when your nervous system feels safe. Mercury in Libra wraps up its journey through your home and emotional foundation sector, helping you bring peace and clarity to your inner world. Use these final days to declutter, both physically and emotionally, and make your inner sanctuary reflect the calm you crave.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, last week’s solar eclipse brought new awareness to your money mindset, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon activates your sector of wellness, structure, and routine. This is your cosmic check-in: are your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-activities-routine-week-long-challenge-essay"">daily habits</a> truly supporting the life you say you want? Where are you leaking time or energy, and what systems could help you plug those leaks? You don’t need a full overhaul — just one intentional change can create momentum. Structure isn’t a punishment, it’s a devotion to your future self.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Juno’s entrance in Sagittarius lights up your romance and joy sector, reminding you that love is allowed to be light, fun, and liberating. This is a beautiful transit for rekindling flirtation with others, with yourself, and with life. You might be surprised who catches your eye or how much more magnetic you feel when you stop trying so hard. Mercury’s final steps in Libra pass through your sector of communication and connection, so speak the desire, send the pitch, write the poem. Express your truth with flair… you’re a walking headline right now.<br /></p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, last week’s solar eclipse in your sign was your cosmic reset, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon at the start of the week lands in your sector of creativity, play, and self-expression. What are you craving to create, simply <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2024/06/11736272/womens-bathroom-nightclubs-community-safety"">for the joy of it</a>? This isn’t about performance or productivity… it’s about letting your inner child lead. Are you giving yourself enough time to play? Or are you always “fixing” something — a person, a plan, a problem? Let joy be a valid goal, not just a byproduct.<br /><br />Juno entering Sagittarius this week energizes your home and roots sector, asking you to explore what freedom looks like inside of commitment. Maybe the “perfect family” was never the goal… maybe inner security is. This transit could inspire you to move, redecorate, or emotionally release something you inherited that no longer fits. Mercury finishes its journey through your sector of money and values, helping you reflect on what truly matters to you, beyond what society says should. What you value is shifting — and that’s a good thing. Trust it.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, last week’s Virgo solar eclipse in your solitude sector brought your attention to the unconscious patterns shaping your life. Now as the First Quarter Moon rises in Capricorn on September 29th, your emotional foundation and sense of home come into focus. This is a moment to root down — not in nostalgia, but in truth. What makes you feel safe now, not 10 years ago? There may be a shift in family dynamics, your living situation, or even your inner dialogue. Don’t rush to fix it… just feel it and listen. You’re growing roots where your future self can bloom.</p>



<p>As the new month begins on October 1st, Juno enters Sagittarius and lights up your communication and curiosity sector, nudging you to speak from your gut instead of your script. This shift helps you break free from overthinking or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/people-pleasing-sex-life-satisfy-partner"">people-pleasing</a>, especially in your closest bonds. What conversations have you been avoiding for the sake of harmony? With Mercury finishing up its tour through your sign, you’re finding the clarity and courage to say what matters most — beautifully and boldly.</p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, the recent eclipse energized your social circles and future visions, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th directs your attention to your communication sector. Your voice matters, but is it being heard in the way you intend? This is your cue to refine your message, double-check your tone, and make space for silence in between. Maybe it’s time to unplug and listen more. Or maybe it’s time to finally say the thing you’ve been afraid to articulate. Either way, your words have weight — so use them wisely.</p>



<p>In contrast to this grounding lunar energy, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">Juno shifts</a> out of your sign and enters Sagittarius on October 1st, activating your value and self-worth sector, and inviting you to commit to partnerships, romantic or professional, that support your sense of abundance. You’re being reminded that devotion and freedom can coexist. Relationships that feel financially or emotionally constricting may feel harder to ignore now. Meanwhile, Mercury in Libra wraps up its time in your spirituality sector, giving you a final chance to process, release, and prepare for Mercury’s arrival into your sign next week. Quiet time now will fuel your power moves later.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, the Virgo eclipse likely placed you at a crossroads in your career or public life. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th brings your income, confidence, and sense of worth into sharper focus. What are you building, and do you believe it’s worth the eﬀort? You’re being called to reevaluate your relationship with discipline: Not as punishment, but as devotion to your bigger dreams. This lunation could inspire <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/loud-budgeting-money-boundaries"">a new budget</a>, business idea, or even a major investment in yourself. Don’t let imposter syndrome steer the wheel. </p>



<p>And as October begins, Juno, asteroid of commitment, enters your sign on October 1st, marking a fresh chapter in how you show up for yourself and others. This is your invitation to prioritize freedom <em>within </em>relationships, not <em>from </em>them. You may feel more drawn to people who mirror your truth and challenge your growth — or even decide you’re your own best partner for now. With Mercury finishing its time in Libra, your friendship and community sector feels more balanced, helping you discern which social connections are worth deepening as the year winds down.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, you’ve been restructured from the inside out since last week’s eclipse. Now, on September 29th, the First Quarter Moon rises in <em>your sign</em>, illuminating your identity, self-concept, and leadership style. It’s a checkpoint: what version of you is emerging, and are you letting them shine? This lunation is less about control and more about clarity. Let yourself release outdated expectations and step into the soft power of showing up <em>as you are</em>. You don’t have to have all the answers to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/short-women-confidence"">move with confidence</a> — you just have to trust the step you’re on.</p>



<p>As a counterbalance to this self-focused energy, Juno shifts into Sagittarius on October 1st, lighting up your spiritual and healing sector. This may inspire a quieter, more reflective approach to relationships. Who are you when no one’s watching? What sacred contracts are ready to be rewritten, especially around forgiveness or trust?Mercury’s final days in Libra land in your career sector, helping you smooth over past misunderstandings, wrap up lingering negotiations, and prepare for a more emotionally raw (and revealing) chapter once Mercury enters Scorpio. It’s a week for grounding <em>and </em>shedding. Prepare the soil for what’s next.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this month’s Virgo solar eclipse likely stirred some deep truths around intimacy, fear, and letting go. Now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th arrives in your subconscious and closure sector, shining light on the quiet parts of your psyche that need tending. This is your signal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/slow-living-anti-hustle-culture"">to slow down</a> and listen. What are your dreams trying to tell you? What emotions have you buried under your intellectual strength? If you’re feeling more tired or tender this week, it’s not a weakness — it’s a sign of healing. Trust the wisdom in the pause.<br /><br />As a form of cosmic reorientation, October 1st brings Juno into Sagittarius, igniting your friendship and long-term vision sector. You’re ready to commit to people who get your weird, wild brilliance, and let go of bonds that keep you small or stagnant. Whether through organizing, collaborating, or reconnecting with soul friends, this is about building joyful communities rooted in mutual growth. Meanwhile, Mercury finishes up its stay in Libra in your expansion sector, helping you make sense of recent lessons and encouraging you to share them. Your voice is needed, especially when it’s so profoundly visionary.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, last week’s Virgo solar eclipse activated your relationship sector, and now the Capricorn First Quarter Moon on September 29th lights up your friendship and community sector, asking: who’s really walking this path with you? Who feels like family, and who feels like performance? This lunation helps you distinguish between loyalty and obligation and gives you the courage to realign. You may feel drawn to mentor someone, join a cause, or even set boundaries with a group you’ve outgrown. If it no longer aligns, it’s okay to swim elsewhere.<br /><br />As October begins, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/asteroids-astrology-horoscopes-meaning"">Juno enters Sagittarius</a> on October 1st, landing in your career and reputation sector, and inspiring you to take bold ownership of your public story. What does professional commitment look like <em>for you </em>— not for tradition, not for others? You may attract mentors, clients, or collaborators who push you to dream bigger but on your terms. Meanwhile, Mercury closes out its time in Libra in your depth and transformation sector, encouraging you to clear lingering energetic debts or financial entanglements. It’s a week of wise recalibration, so start by knowing what you want to be known for.</p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Yes: My maternal grandmother was the reason I went to college, though there wasn’t much discussion surrounding the topic. I was told I was going to college and that’s it. I have a Bachelor of Arts, Juris Doctor degree, and a Master of Social Work. All of it was paid for from the funds of my structured settlement.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>I don’t remember having many conversations about money. When I was a teenager, I learned that I was getting a certain amount per year or every three or four years (more on this later). My grandmother told me college would be paid for and explained how. I didn’t know the full details of the settlement until I was well into my 20s. My dad did take me to a financial advisor one year to start an investment account.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was at Wendy’s when I was in high school. I was expected to pay for my own car insurance.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>I guess I never really thought about it when I was a kid. Neither of my parents went to college (mom was an LPN and dad worked in a factory), but I never wanted for anything.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>All the time. It’s crazy when I actually look at the numbers. I feel like I’m somewhat ok. But I constantly worry there won’t be enough/it’s going to run out, etc.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>Probably when I got my first job at 16. In order to drive, I was expected to pay for my own insurance. After that, I’ve supported myself through work and funds from the structured settlement.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Yes: My mom was killed by a drunk driver when I was a child. He happened to be driving a company vehicle. My family successfully sued the company. The funds then went into a structured settlement and I received an annuity payment every four to five years up until I was in my late 30s. The annuity payments increased every year and the last one was the biggest. Also, as I mentioned above, before I started high school, my grandmother told me I was getting approximately $1,000 per month, which would last for four years and which would pay for my tuition (I went to a private school). After that, I would get a lump sum once a year for the four years I was in college, which would pay my college tuition. And then after that, I would get a lump sum payment every four of five years, which lasted until my late 30s.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — My dog starts barking and it’s time for me to get up and take him out. Before we go out, I start coffee so I can have a cup when we come back in. We go for a short walk around the neighborhood and he does all his business. I feed him when we get back and then grab my coffee.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I’m trying to have the laziest day possible, but my dog is having none of it. He brings me toys to throw and we do that for a while. I want to nap and/or work out but I don’t think either is going to happen today. I have a big week coming up and I’m really just trying to mentally prepare myself for that. I had breakfast earlier but I’m not really interested in any food right now.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — I am off from work today so I basically spend the whole day relaxing, playing with my dog, and trying to nap. I start to get hungry as we are out on a walk. Even though I have one more HelloFresh meal to make, I do not feel like cooking. Decide to order Chop’t for pick-up and walk over with the dog. I get a Santa Fe wrap and we head home. <strong>$17.94</strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — After I eat, I realize I don’t have anything to eat for breakfast for the week. Luckily, there is a Morton Williams across the street. I get yogurt (4 for $5), a Lean Cuisine, protein bars, jell-o vanilla chocolate swirl pudding (an impulse purchase), and two mini bags of Tate’s chocolate chip cookies. <strong>$25.24</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — I start getting things ready for work tomorrow. I make sure my work bag is packed and I put some of the items I just bought into my lunch bag (which is really just a NYPL tote bag). I take the dog out one more time then get in the shower. After that I watch a <em>Friends</em> re-run before going to bed.</p>



<p>11 p.m. — I try to be in bed around 11 p.m. and tonight I am successful. I make sure the pup is settled and then it’s lights out. I scroll through a few podcasts and eventually end up on a <em>Going West </em>episode. Most of what I listen to is true crime. One of my friends does not understand how I can listen to true crime while I am trying to go to sleep. I don’t really have an answer for that!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $43.18</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I hit snooze a few times then drag myself out of bed. I get dressed to take my dog outside. I grab some cash before we go out so I can buy some fruit from the fruit stand on the corner. I get a large box of strawberries, blueberries, and three pears. <strong>$7</strong></p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — After the walk, I come back inside and get ready for work. I make sure the dog is fed and then proceed to get food together for the day. I pack breakfast (almost always yogurt, berries, and granola), which I will eat at work. I also throw in a protein bar, a stick of cheese, a pear, and leftovers from one of my HelloFresh meals. I head out the door to catch the bus to work. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>8:15 a.m. — I have an appointment to see a rehab doctor first thing this morning. I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer back in January. Since then, I’ve had surgery and completed four rounds of dose-dense chemo. I’ve had pain in my legs since my second round of chemo which was back in May. It hurts to walk and sometimes my legs feel weak when I stand. I also fell in my apartment back in May when my dog peed on the floor. I didn’t see it, slipped, and fell hard on my knee. I got x-rays the day after and nothing was broken but my knee continues to bother me. I pay my copay when I check in. The doctor tells me I likely have a bone bruise on my knee. He is going to prescribe an anti-inflammatory for my legs and refer me to physical therapy. <strong>$25</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — The last part of my cancer treatment is radiation. I completed 15 of 20 treatments and this is my last week of treatment. My appointments are always around lunchtime so I head to radiation and prepare myself to wait. My appointments are only scheduled for 20 minutes but sometimes they are running so far behind that I’ve waited up to two hours for treatment. Once again, they are running late. After about an hour and half, they send me up to another floor. When I get up there, I’m taken back immediately. Everything is fine. The radiation hits one side and then moves to my other side. I am on the table with my eyes closed when I hear a loud bang. I think the ceiling is falling down! Staff runs in and it turns out it was something on the radiation machine that wasn’t secured but the machine still works. My other side then gets radiation and I’m done. As I’m getting ready to leave, I check the Crumbl app just for the hell of it. I see they have a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie. I decide I need this after the chaos at radiation. I order ahead and it’s ready when I get there. <strong>$5.94</strong></p>



<p>7 p.m. — I open up Zoom for my appointment with my Psych NP. I’ve been seeing him since 2017 for anxiety and depression. We meet every three months or so for a check-in and medication refills. Typically, I would request reimbursement from my FSA for the fee but between copays and medical bills from my cancer diagnosis, that is long gone. I give him updates on my treatment and tell him that despite everything going on, I am doing relatively well. We also discuss the Cowboy Carter Tour. He tells me he was so close to Beyoncé he could touch her! <strong>$300</strong></p>



<p>8 p.m. — The rest of my workday is super chill. I make some phone calls and eventually eat my leftovers. I am counting down until the end of the day. I work three 12-hour days and have to be back at work in 12 hours. I decide to take a Lyft home. I get home and immediately take my dog out for a walk. We come back inside, I feed him and we play fetch for awhile. He’s a little over a year old and has endless energy. I do not. I eventually shower and get into bed around 11 p.m. <strong>$23.05</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $363.89</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — My alarm is just cruel at this point. I wake up and take the dog out. When we come back, I make coffee and feed him. I then get ready for work. When I am done, I get my food ready for the day. Once again it’s yogurt, granola, and berries for breakfast. I throw more of the same from yesterday (protein bar, cheese, a pear, and HelloFresh leftovers). I walk over to catch the bus for work. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>10 a.m. — I got paid last week and decide I need a new T-shirt from Beyond Yoga. Their featherweight tee has some great colors right now and I order one in dark maroon. When I go to check out, I discover that healthcare workers get a 20% discount! I submit my credentials, which are quickly accepted, and place my order. Thanks Beyond Yoga! <strong>$51.20</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — After the fun of buying new clothes, I get serious and check out my credit card statements. I have 3, 2 AmExes and one Chase United rewards card. I make all big purchases on my Chase card so I get the miles. I use one Amex mostly for Lyft and the other one for things like the vet and my NP. I try to pay all of them off each month. I pay half on the card linked to my Lyft account, which is more than usual due to two airport rides in July. The other half I will pay out of my next paycheck. I pay the balance due on the Chase. <strong>$283.19</strong></p>



<p>12 p.m. — I walk over to my radiation appointment. Things are running much smoother today. I’m in and out within an hour. I usually make a coffee when I am there with a vanilla caramel cream pod but there’s none of those today. I am exhausted so I order a caramel macchiato from Starbucks ($6.83) and go to pick it up. I had money on my Starbucks card and pay for it from there. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After I pick up my Starbucks, I have a craving for empanadas from Sophie’s and it’s been a minute since I’ve been there. They have a three for $10 deal so I get two beef and one guava and cheese and I head back to the office. When I get back, I give one of the beef to my coworker. I also offer half of the guava and cheese but she declines. <strong>$13.37</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — I’m still at work and ready to go home. I have the next three days off so I am holding on as much as I can. We end up getting a call to go see a patient in the community. It’s a location and person we know so we head out. We have to see the patient within a certain timeframe so we can take a Lyft which is linked to a corporate account. The visit ends up being quick as the person does not want to speak with us. My coworker and I head back to the office. I spend the rest of time writing notes and making phone calls. <strong>$14.39</strong> (Expensed)</p>



<p>8 p.m. — Finally my day is over! I walk over to catch the bus home. Once I get home, I take the dog out for a walk. We play fetch again when we get back inside. I decide to do a puzzle on my iPad but I fall asleep on the couch while doing it. It’s 12:30 a.m. by the time I wake up so I gather myself, put the dog in his crate, and immediately get back into bed. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $353.56</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>9 a.m. — On my off days, my dog is my alarm clock. He will start barking and will not stop until I am up. It’s rare he lets me sleep past 7:30 a.m. Today, it was 7:15 a.m. It’s ok though as he is going to doggie day care later. He usually goes once a week on one of my off days to give us a break from each other. On the walk over to day care, I stop at CVS (which is one of his favorite places) to pick up the prescriptions my NP refilled. After a short wait, I get the medications and walk him over to day care. <strong>$22.06</strong></p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I catch the bus to go to radiation. Only three more sessions! Today runs pretty smoothly and I am again in and out within the hour. I am starting to get hungry but don’t want anything big. There is a market near the bus stop that has a really good tuna pasta salad. I go in and get a small container. I then get on the bus and head home. <strong>$12.04</strong></p>



<p>5 p.m. — When I get home from radiation my plan is to nap, do a load of laundry, and work out. I end up falling asleep on the couch around 3 p.m. I sleep for a solid two hours. When I get up, I put on workout clothes and gather up the dog’s blankets to wash. He is potty trained and there are potty pads for him but he continues to pee in his crate or on his bed when he is mad. Luckily, I have laundry in my building. I go downstairs and put the blankets in the wash. When I come back upstairs, I get on my Peloton and do a five-minute warmup, a 30-minute class, and a five-minute cool down. After I am done, I run downstairs and put the laundry in the dryer. <strong>$4.25</strong></p>



<p>7:15 p.m. — I walk over to pick up my dog from day care. I try to leave him there for as long as I can so he can run out all his energy. He’s a staff favorite there. They bring him out and he gets a treat before we leave. He doesn’t want to walk when we leave so I pick him up and carry him the rest of the way. He tries to play a little when we get home and I don’t understand how he’s not exhausted. Eventually he gives up and is knocked out. Once he falls I sleep I doomscroll, play Candy Crush, and watch reruns of the OG<em> Law &amp; Order</em> before I go to bed around 11 p.m. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $38.35</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>11 a.m. — I am up again around 7:30 a.m. I take the dog for a walk and we relax until it’s time for me to leave for radiation. Around 11 a.m., I get a text letting me know that T-mobile debited my account for my cell phone bill. After this, I get ready to leave and am out the door around 11:30 a.m. to catch the bus to treatment. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m — It’s a miracle! Today I am in and out of radiation in 30 minutes. I see my doctor after treatment and this is the first week that I am actually on time for my appointment. He tells me that my scans look great. He also tells me what to expect of the next few weeks which can include skin peeling and continued darkening of the skin. I head to Trader Joe’s after I leave my appointment. I buy coffee (the most important thing!), more yogurt, milk, protein bars, granola, bread, a mini pumpkin spice sheet cake, and some other items. I am a sucker for Trader Joe’s pumpkin items. I hope the pumpkin biscotti are back soon. <strong>$52.53</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — After I leave Trader Joe’s I walk down to PetCo to pick up a few cans of wet food that I mix with my dog’s dried food. I look at some treats and toys but just get the food. When I leave, I walk over to the bus stop to head home. When I get home, I put all the groceries away and make a HelloFresh meal. I eat and spend time with the dog before I get ready for the Liberty game. <strong>$5.86</strong></p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — My friend and I did a partial season ticket plan for the Liberty this year. The games are so fun and the crowd is always amazing. I also secretly want to be a Timeless Torch. They’re playing the Sky tonight and although I am cheering for the Liberty, I am looking forward to seeing Angel Reese play. I get down to Barclay’s and meet my friend and we head in. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>6:50 p.m. — Once we are inside we stop for snacks and drinks before going to our seats. I got popcorn the last game I went to and it was so good. I want to get it again but I decide to get a High Noon Black Cherry as an early celebration for my last day of radiation, which is tomorrow. My friend gets a hot dog. We then head to our seats and settle in for the game. <strong>$17</strong></p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — The game did not go how I expected and the Liberty lost. My friend wanted to go to Chick-fil-A after, so we walk over there. I’m hungry too and decide to get a five-piece nugget and an order of fries ($6.14). A lot of folks from the game are there so it’s super busy. I need to eat my food before I go home otherwise it will be cold. Luckily there’s an open table so we sit down and I eat my food. After we are done, I get on the train to head home ($2.90). <strong>$9.04</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $87.33</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I get an email from the dog walking company letting me know my account has been debited for this week’s walks. It’s $5 more this week because one of the walks is on Saturday. Because I work 12 hours, he gets walked on the days I work each week. He seems to be anxious on the days I am not there. I have come home to ripped up potty pads, poop on his bed, and general gremlin things. He seems to be getting better but still continues to chew on things, with his current obsession being the cable wire. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I get the bus to the clinic for my last day of radiation and last day of treatment overall! It almost feels surreal. The last seven months of my life have been consumed by this. It’s been quite the journey but I made it. There’s not a long wait today and I go back pretty quickly. After it’s over, I thank the radiation techs for all they’ve done and for taking such good care of me. They wished me the best and said not to come back. When I am done, I go over to the bell to take a selfie. A kind woman in the waiting room offers to take some photos for me. I end up ringing the bell and she records it. The people in the waiting room clap for me and offer congratulations. It’s very overwhelming. <strong>$2.90 </strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I decide to take myself out for a celebratory lunch. I go to this café that I’ve wanted to try and order a glass of rosé and a pizza with burrata and truffle oil. It’s delicious. I take my time there and read a little bit of the book I have with me. Eventually, I leave and start walking home. On the way, I pass one of my favorite wine bars which has $7 wines for happy hour. It’s such a beautiful day so I stop there for a glass of rosé which turns into two. I sit there for a while and end up finishing my book. I am slightly tipsy when I leave and I walk home. <strong>$68.61</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I take the dog out when I get home. We play for a while. I exchange some voice messages with one of my BFFs. I get hungry again around 7:30 p.m. so I make steak tacos which is one of my HelloFresh meals. I eat dinner and clean up. I have to work tomorrow so I am settling in for the night and biding my time until 20/20. I only make it a half hour before I fall asleep on the couch. </p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — The dog wakes me up so he can get off the couch. He then brings me a toy to throw for him. I am so tired and just can’t do it. I drift back off until he brings me another toy and starts barking. This goes on until I decide it’s actually time for bed. I put on my pajamas, put him in his gated area and crawl into bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $71.51</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I hit snooze as per usual. I am absolutely exhausted but drag myself out of bed. I take out the dog. When we come back in, I get ready for work. Somehow I get myself together to pack my breakfast and snacks for the day.</p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I order a Lyft to get to work. I typically take one when I work on the weekend as my usual bus doesn’t start running until a little later. I could take the local bus, but I always worry I’m going to be late if I take it. <strong>$21.98</strong></p>



<p>8:45 a.m. — I get to work and see we have an appointment first thing this morning. I am very familiar with this patient and the building they live in. We end up taking a Lyft to the appointment. The appointment is productive and we devise a follow-up plan. <strong>$17.60</strong> (Expensed)</p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — We have another appointment this afternoon. The individual is within walking distance so my coworker and I walk over to meet them. We spend some time walking around the neighborhood and talking to her. She was very thankful and grateful for our time today.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — We get back to the office and I start writing notes from the interactions I had today. While working on those, I get a call from another patient who needs assistance. I talk with them and their sibling and give them ideas and instructions on what they should do next.</p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I get a call from one of my colleagues letting me know they are now meeting with the patient I spoke to on the phone earlier. I provide my colleague details of my interaction with the patient earlier. They are being evaluated and my colleague will update me when she can.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I start working on my sign-out for the person who will be working tomorrow. It’s something we do each night so the person working the next day can see what was done and what, if anything needs a follow-up. After that is finished, I start gathering my belongings to leave for the night.</p>



<p>8 p.m. — My workday is over! I walk to the bus to head home. I take the dog out when I get home. We play for a while but I am tired. I am in bed by 11:30 p.m. and hope the pup will let me sleep in tomorrow. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $24.88</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><strong><br /></strong>“As I was typing in things, I thought to myself, ‘This is a lot,’ but I don’t know that I’d necessarily change things moving forward. Some of my expenses this week were not things that I typically spend money on. I considered my lunch and wine stop a special occasion since I finished treatment.”</p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?<br /></strong>Yes, college was always expected. I come from an immigrant family, and everything my parents did was to set my siblings and myself up for a future. I was a high-achieving student at a competitive public school, and attended a top state university. My parents participated in a 529 plan and pre-purchased my in-state tuition when I was around 8 years old, making it considerably inexpensive. I believe they paid $22,000 for all four years, which I was extremely grateful for.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?<br /></strong>We were middle class but my parents were very frugal, since they both grew up poor in their home countries. Since arriving in the US, it’s always been very important for them to have a great credit score, so they never missed a payment and saved every penny. We hardly ever ate out and only went on a vacation maybe every other year. However, my mom was also able to retire early, and I know they will also leave a comfortable inheritance for my sibling and myself.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?<br /></strong>My first job was a hostess at a restaurant when I was 15. I mainly got the job to start earning pocket money for myself. I worked for a few years in the restaurant industry throughout high school and saved enough to buy a used car (my parents’ old car), as well as for a solo trip to Europe when I turned 18 and graduated. I had only been to Canada and Mexico previously.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?<br /></strong>A bit: we could afford all the essentials but never had “fun” money. I got used to shopping for things on sale or thrifting, which is something I still carry with me to this day. There were lots of times in high school when I would wish we had money to buy the trendy things I saw other girls wearing. I do remember one time in elementary school, we were going on a “Little House on the Prairie” field trip, and we had to buy these old-fashioned costumes, but they were pricey and my mom couldn’t afford them. I tried to tell the teacher I was going to skip the field trip but she insisted on it. We ended up finding something at Goodwill, even though it was not the exact style. However, I’m glad my parents instilled a frugality mindset in me now, because it helps me budget an average salary in an expensive city.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?<br /></strong>Yes, more so now. Even though I can split expenses with my partner A., we are both victims of lifestyle creep from time to time. Most of our disposable income goes towards going out, eating out, and traveling. I admit I do also have a bit of a shopping problem (especially working in fashion!) which has accumulated a bit of credit card debt.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?<br /></strong>At 22, when I graduated. I worked part time throughout college but my parents still helped out with certain things like my car insurance. I don’t have a financial safety net right now, which is something I am going to work towards once I pay off my credit cards. Technically, I could use my 401(k) in an emergency, and both A. and I have supportive parents who would help us out if absolutely needed. But I prefer to be independent and have my own funds.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.<br /></strong>Yes, last year my parents started my Roth IRA and contribute the max $7,000 every year, as I did not want to contribute beyond my 401(k). This is partially a hobby of my mother’s, who has been playing with the stock market since she retired early. She likes to “play” with my retirement money but will give any earnings to me. Win-win.</p>



<h3><strong>Day One: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up slightly earlier than usual since I have a meeting at 9 a.m. on the dot, and we are in office most days now. I take my morning probiotic and drink a cup of water: I have a sensitive stomach and find taking probiotics and eating a healthy, mostly non-processed diet helps. Afterwards, I start getting ready: Too Faced mascara, Anastasia brow gel, NARS tinted moisturizer/sunscreen, Charlotte Tilbury bronzer, and Merit blush balm. I keep this routine to 10 minutes max. I pack some pre-made boiled eggs, my za’atar chicken and rice pilaf lunch (which was the leftovers from last night’s dinner) and take the subway to work (which is covered by my prepaid transit card).</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — On the way, one of my friends texts in a group chat about a trip coming up. We are all going to France for a wedding, and then planning a day trip to a vineyard afterwards. We each owe $47 for the bus round-trip. I venmo her since she will pay in Euros for all of us. <strong>$47</strong></p>



<p>9 a.m. — I peel my eggs and make Earl Grey tea at work (I stopped drinking coffee during the pandemic). I also take some fiber gummies my mom sent me (she sends me a lot of vitamins and supplements).</p>



<p>12:30 p.m — Work is mainly uneventful, as it’s quiet during the summer. I eat the lunch I bought. There were visitors for a meeting, and they had leftover pasties, so I also have a mini croissant as my dessert. I hardly ever eat sweets, but I’ve been good at eating healthy and cooking almost all my meals lately, so I allow myself this treat.</p>



<p>5:15 p.m. — I leave the office a bit early and head to the gym. There are massive train delays due to the rain so it takes me nearly an hour to get to my home station, near where the gym is. </p>



<p>7 p.m. — On the way home from the gym, I stop in at the Walgreens next door, since I am out of toner. I buy Thayer’s Witch’s Hazel ($14.99) and some cotton balls ($4). It’s amazing how much things are inflated — the same toner was always $9.99 before COVID-19!! <strong>$19.24</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — I quickly down an Oath Nutrition Clear Whey protein shake in Frosty Lemonade and start dinner. I make a soup with shrimp, mushrooms, and tomatoes, using Maesri Thai Tom Yum Soup paste. I love to cook and hate spending money on eating out unless it’s with friends or for a special occasion. I read a lot of cooking blogs and have found Maesri to be one of the most cheap and authentic Thai brands. The soup is yummy, and my partner A. and I eat two-thirds of it for dinner. I have a work lunch tomorrow, so the leftovers will be A.’s lunch. Afterwards, we relax and watch <em>Sorry, Baby</em>. A. is a big cinephile and pays for all our streaming subscriptions and any movie rentals. Before we dated, I only had Netflix and watched everything on my laptop. He was quite horrified by this and now we have a 75-inch screen tv and a Sonos surround-sound system.</p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — I walk the dog and prepare for bed. Double-cleanse with Aprilskin cleansing balm, Eminence daily exfoliating cleanser, Thayer’s toner, Glow Recipe blackberry retinol, and Farmacy honey halo moisturizer. This is a bit early for me, but I’m tired and fall asleep quickly!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $66.24</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Two: Thursday</strong></h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I wake up early for some reason, maybe because I did go to bed early. I lay in bed for nearly an hour and then get up. I take my probiotic and go through my makeup routine. Today for breakfast, I pack a Chobani 2% mango Greek yogurt since I’ve eaten hard-boiled eggs three days in a row now. I do love my eggs though!</p>



<p>9 a.m — Arrive at work and it’s another quiet day. We were three days a week for a long time and just went up to four days. A lot of people are really unhappy about this, especially as not everyone is following the mandate. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Head to my work lunch. It’s at a trendy steakhouse and the vendors I’m meeting order a bunch of apps to share. I go with a butter salad salad with grilled steak as my main since I indulge a bit on the apps. They pay.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — Home and thinking about what to eat as we are mostly out of groceries. A. says he is meeting up with the boys at a new taco spot. I’m invited but he warns me it’s a boys night. I decide a quiet night by myself sounds much more appealing. I make a Costco salmon burger we had in the freezer and alternate between reading <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and playing with my dog until bedtime.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I sleep in because I’m WFH today! I didn’t used to sleep so much but ever since COVID-19, I became a deep sleeper and must get at least seven or eight hours every night. I lay in bed since I don’t really have a morning routine during WFH. I chat with A. about needing to go on our weekly grocery run today or this weekend. He is not enthused. I know I will need to wait until he is hungry to bring it up again.</p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — It’s payday, so I make a $500 payment to my credit card that has the highest interest rate (I also paid $1,500 the last payday, aggressively trying to pay this down). The rest I will need for rent next week and extra cash coming up for my trip next month. I check on some work emails but it’s mostly quiet. We have summer Fridays so around 1 p.m. I start logging off. <strong>$500</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Since we skipped breakfast this morning due to sleeping in, I decide to make us a big brunch. I make bacon, Birch Benders vegan protein pancakes, fried eggs, and leftover sourdough I got from the farmers’ market last week.</p>



<p>4 p.m — I suggest taking the dog to the park to enjoy the nice day (the last couple of days were rainy). I am also trying to up my step count to hit 10,000 a day because I keep hearing it’s an underrated way to get fit. We walk to the park and decide to make it a longer walk and end up going to Greenpoint to try their fabulous restaurant scene. Neither of us are super hungry so we get happy hour drinks first. We stop by a Mexican restaurant that has bar stools outside on a lively street. I get a rosé and my boyfriend gets a beer. He pays (I am not a big drinker so he tends to pay for my drinks).</p>



<p>7 p.m. — The restaurant next to us has outdoor diners eating an amazing-looking panzanella salad. We go for it and it’s delicious. I get a filet mignon with side salad for my main and he gets a pesto pasta with lamb ragu. We also both get Guinness — it’s so rare to see this on a menu outside of Irish pubs! We discuss going on a day trip upstate tomorrow to take advantage of the nice weather all weekend. <strong>$72.50</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $572.50</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Four: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Apparently my body likes routine: I could not sleep in until 9 a.m. A. is still asleep so I take the dog out for his morning walk. I make some bacon and eggs because I want to save our appetite for when we are upstate.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — After a bit of a slow start, we head out to Grand Central to catch an 11:55 a.m. train to Cold Spring. We get there early so we can grab seats. <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>1:17 p.m. — Arrive in Cold Spring. It’s late and we still need to eat lunch, so we do a short loop that is right on the river and has a small outlook trail. A. wants oysters so we go to a quaint seafood restaurant with outdoor seating and river views. We share oysters and I also get two glasses of rosé and a seafood pasta. A. gets two beers, gazpacho, and a big bowl of mussels. It’s cash only, so he goes to the ATM. (The meal was $80. We’ll split the expenses later, as we have a shared tracker.)</p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — We walk around the small downtown and shop at the local boutiques. We go to a candle shop (I love candles), but A. decides he wants to buy a diffuser to have a nice scent 24/7. I buy a stitching crochet kit with a funny message. <strong>$19.51</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — We still have 30 minutes until we have to catch the train home, so we find a wine bar and have a quick drink. He gets a beer and I get an orange wine. I put down my card since he paid for lunch. <strong>$16.82</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Buy train tickets quickly on the app and catch the train back to the city! <strong>$15.25</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back in the city and we have dinner plans to catch up with a friend. We drop the dog off at home and meet her at a Michelin-starred Vietnamese restaurant. I am still so full from lunch so I just order an appetizer and a salad, while A. orders a huge plate. I have one glass of wine while they both have two drinks. My friend and I didn’t eat much, so we pay a bit then A. covers most of the bill. <strong>$48</strong></p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $114.83</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Sunday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Feeling slightly hungover from the couple of drinks I had yesterday, and not sleeping quite enough. We lounge in bed for a couple more hours and finally get up to make breakfast before grocery shopping. We go to a specialty shop nearby to get fresh Shewolf bakery bread and also pick up some ’nduja (Italian spreadable salami) and boquerones (Spanish anchovies) to snack on later. A. makes poached eggs to go with the bread and the nduja. <strong>$23</strong></p>



<p>1 p.m. — Weekly Trader Joe’s run. We get two bouquets of flowers, jasmine rice, tofu, cut butternut squash, green beans, cilantro, parsley, tomatoes, shredded carrot, edamame, avocado oil, arugula, lemons, limes, chicken breasts, tuna, olives, tea, oat creamer, oven roasted turkey, white cheddar corn puffs, frozen shrimp rolls, and frozen chicken wontons. <strong>$77.65</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — When we get home I realized I forgot canned coconut milk. I go to a nearby grocery store and pick up a can, as well as a couple of Chobani and Fage 2% Greek yogurts. I hate fat-free yogurt and also don’t want full-fat, so these are a happy medium. I don’t bother adding this to our shared expense sheet since it’s not much. <strong>$10.37</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I had made an appointment to get a haircut at a Chinatown salon that I saw on TikTok that does $40 haircuts which includes a nice head/scalp massage. I am skeptical but I have naturally straight hair and I just need a trim, so I figure they can’t mess it up that bad. The head massage was more like a scalp scratching, not relaxing at all. But the haircut is pretty decent! I get a good trim and some face-framing layers. I like my hair stylist and her English is good. I tip $10. <strong>$50</strong></p>



<p>6 p.m. — Home and time to make dinner. I make a Thai red curry with the groceries we got today and a can of curry paste I had. It’s delicious and our leftovers will be lunch tomorrow. We watch some random movie and pass out early.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $161.02</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Monday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m — Morning routine and head to the subway. Because we were three days in office for a long time, I only opted to load $50 per month on my prepaid transit card this year. This lasts me half the month, so I just end up paying with my card the rest of the time. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Eat my leftovers lunch and go for a 30-minute walk to help with digestion and get steps in.</p>



<p>3:30 p.m — Browse the Abercrombie sale online as I am thinking about getting some barrel pants for the fall. I add four things to my cart to meet the $100 free shipping minimum and plan on returning most things to the store. I do have quite the shopping problem (hence the credit card debt), so I decide to think about it overnight and wait until tomorrow to order.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap credit card to pay for the metro card. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is tom yum fried rice with the leftover paste I had from last week. It’s an open package so I’m trying to use it up. Fairly tasty, but not much different than Thai fried rice I’ve made and had before. Packed the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $5.80</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Day Seven: Tuesday</strong></h3>



<p>8:30 a.m. — Morning routine and head to subway, another tap to pay. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I see items in my Abercrombie cart have an extra 15% off. That’s a sign, right? I spend $160 but plan on only keeping one thing and returning the rest. <strong>$160</strong></p>



<p>3 p.m. — My coworker remarks how she needs more work clothes now that we are in the office more days. We browse Uniqlo’s JW Anderson collab and decide to make a quick run to the Uniqlo store across the street from us to check it out. I end up buying a boxy Oxford, straight-leg jeans, and a bra tank top that was on sale. All great basics that I’m super excited about. <strong>$90</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Leave work and go to the gym. Tap to pay again. <strong>$2.90</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Spend the rest of the evening trying on outfits and starting to plan for our trip soon! </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $255.80</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I went out to eat more than usual this weekend, because we went upstate. I didn’t realize how much I would spend if I ate out all weekend, even with breakfast at home! I think I will be more conscious that this can’t happen every weekend, as I’m trying very hard to pay down my debt.”</p>

<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-wedding-guest-dresses-summer"">""Wedding season”</a> is often associated with summer, but the most popular months to say “I do” <a href=""https://www.theknot.com/content/is-there-an-off-season-for-weddings"">actually fall later in the year. </a>Maybe it’s the foliage or the welcome relief from the heat, but fall weddings are definitely a <em>thing</em>. While the colorful leaves make for stunning wedding photos, finding fall wedding guest dresses can be tricky. The goal: something elevated, seasonally appropriate, and comfortable enough to carry you through hours of celebrating (and dancing).<br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up 24 statement-making fall wedding guest dresses that work for dipping temperatures (think: maxi lengths, long sleeves, and rich fabrics) and every kind of venue (think: luxe halls, breweries, or lakeside). Expect autumnal florals, sweet puff sleeves, and slinky satin picks. Whether you need an elegant gown for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-tie-wedding-guest-dress"">black-tie affair</a> or are craving a trendy <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/arrange-asos-brand-plus-size-review"">plus-size dress</a> for a casual ceremony, your perfect look is just a click away.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

This season, look for off-the-shoulder necklines, dramatic sleeves, and lots of sparkle to stand out from the crowd and land on the best-dressed list.<br /><br /><strong>Lulus</strong> Plisse One-Shoulder Maxi Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lulus.com%2Fproducts%2Fpoised-performance-navy-plisse-one-shoulder-maxi-dress%2F2705711.html"">Lulus</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1747"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11927730.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1165&amp;height=1747&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1165:1747"" width=""1165"" /><figcaption><h2>Pomander Place Black Marisol Dress</h2><br /><br /><strong>Pomander Place</strong> Black Marisol Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftnuck.com%2Fproducts%2Fblack-marisol-dress"">Tuckernuck</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1500"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935074.png?auto=webp&amp;width=846&amp;height=1500&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=141:250"" width=""846"" /><figcaption><h2>Bec &amp; Bridge Deija Off Shoulder Maxi Dress</h2><br /><br /><strong>Bec &amp; Bridge</strong> Deija Off Shoulder Maxi Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopbop.com%2Fdeija-offshoulder-maxi-dress-bec%2Fvp%2Fv%3D1%2F1599502324.htm"">Shopbop</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1333"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935075.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1333&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1000:1333"" width=""1000"" /><figcaption><h2>Reformation x Nara Smith Petites Drizzle Dress</h2><br /><br /><strong>Reformation x Nara Smith</strong> Petites Drizzle Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thereformation.com%2Fproducts%2Fpetites-drizzle-dress%2F1319054GOR.html%3Fdwvar_1319054GOR_color%3DGOR"">Reformation</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1971"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11927726.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1314&amp;height=1971&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""1314"" /><figcaption><h2>Hutch Iris Off-the-Shoulder Floral Maxi Dress</h2><br /><br /><strong>Hutch</strong> Iris Off-the-Shoulder Floral Maxi Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Fhutch-iris-off-the-shoulder-floral-maxi-dress%3Fcolor%3D001%26quantity%3D1%26type%3DSTANDARD"">Anthropologie</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1435"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11927711.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1125&amp;height=1435&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=225:287"" width=""1125"" /><figcaption><h2>ASOS DESIGN Curve Cami Ruffle Detail Maxi Dress</h2><br /><br /><strong>ASOS DESIGN</strong> Curve Cami Ruffle Detail Maxi Dress, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asos.com%2Fus%2Fasos-curve%2Fasos-design-curve-cami-ruffle-detail-maxi-dress-in-raspberry%2Fprd%2F208617907%23colourWayId-208617915"">ASOS</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2078"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935071.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1646&amp;height=2078&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=823:1039"" width=""1646"" /><figcaption><h2>Mac Duggal Beaded High Neck Bishop Sleeve Satin Gown</h2><br /><br /><strong>Mac Duggal</strong> Beaded High Neck Bishop Sleeve Satin Gown, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacduggal.com%2Fproducts%2F26575%3Fvariant%3D40262050349235"">Mac Duggal</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1806"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935073.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1962&amp;height=1806&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=327:301"" width=""1962"" /><figcaption><h2>Adrianna Papell Plus Size Linear Bead Cape Column Gown</h2><br /><br /><strong>Adrianna Papell</strong> Plus Size Linear Bead Cape Column Gown, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adriannapapell.com%2Fproducts%2Fplus-size-linear-bead-cape-column-gown-in-mahogany-ap1e212295"">Adrianna Papell</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1986"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11927763.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1380&amp;height=1986&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=230:331"" width=""1380"" /><figcaption><h2>Cocktail Wedding Guest Dresses</h2><br />Cocktail attire hits that sweet spot between formal and casual, which is why it’s one of the most popular <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/old-navy-the-occasion-dresses"">special-occasion dress codes</a>.

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve never been a big fan of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-mask-conditioner-trend"">hair masks</a>. For starters, I don’t have the patience to wait for a mask to sit for anywhere from five to 15 minutes. But mostly, I’ve never found one that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fable-and-mane-shine-hair-mask-review"">hydrates my hair</a> without weighing it down. I have extremely thick, long hair that is prone to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-conditioners-for-frizzy-hair"">frizz</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10655215/dyson-supersonic-flyaway-attachment-review"">flyaways</a>, and I rely on hair oil and dry oil mists to help add shine and moisture. But when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/igk-mistress-hydrating-hair-balm-review"">IGK</a> — one of my most <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/smoky-brunette-hair-color-trend"">tried-and-true hair brands</a> —announced a limited-edition version of its <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-dry-hair-mask?pr_prod_strat=jac&amp;pr_rec_id=d095e4954&amp;pr_rec_pid=7125454651436&amp;pr_ref_pid=7903988809772&amp;pr_seq=uniform"">Antisocial Dry Hair Mask</a>, I was immediately intrigued.</p>



<p>A <em>dry</em> hair mask? Sounds like a beauty juxtaposition to me — but I’ll admit that the concept was genius: Weightless, shine-boosting hydration that works overnight? Sign me up.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/antisocial-midnight-silk-mask-P517733"">Antisocial Midnight Silk Dry Hair Mask</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11934808.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Taking inspiration from another overnight beauty sleep MVP — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silk-pillowcase-hair-skin-benefits"">silk pillowcases</a> — <a href=""https://www.igkhair.com/products/antisocial-midnight-silk-time-release-bond-building-dry-mask"">IGK’s Midnight Silk</a> version of Antisocial features extra-special packaging and a light, subtly sweet scent. Per the instructions, I tried it on clean, dry hair and brushed it throughout before securing in a loose braid – my preferred bedtime hairstyle. The next morning, I woke up with loose waves and touchably soft, smooth hair. I still had some rogue flyaways at the top — nothing I couldn’t fix with a little hairspray — and my hair looked visibly shinier and my highlights brighter, somehow. And best of all, I loved not having to rinse anything out — just spray, brush, and wake up to silky, shiny hair.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Ingredients like vegan silk protein (another nod to the name), plus a bond-building peptide complex mean that this stuff doesn’t just hydrate on a surface level to temporarily tame frizz; with continued use (including mid-day refreshes or even on second-day hair), I actually could see and feel a difference in my hair health. </p>



<p>Much like skincare, the best hair care is the kind you’ll actually use regularly — and now that I no longer have to deal with the inconvenience and heaviness of traditional hair masks, taking care of my length has never been easier. (Also, I finally get the hype surrounding Antisocial — she’s sold out eight times ever since launching. NBD!) At $38, it’s a luxury product, but the rare one that is worth every penny, in my opinion. (Also, I have a <em>lot</em> of hair, and I’m still on my first one after nearly a month of use.) Antisocial may be her name, but this is one beauty product I’m happily sharing with anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>This past summer, I was presented with an amazing opportunity to tour New York’s Garment District, and what I saw as a Black creative wasn’t just beautiful or innovative — it was affirming. I witnessed other Black creatives who are not only at the forefront of technological advancement, but using that to completely reshape the fashion landscape. </p>



<p>Our first stop was the New York Embroidery Studio — a nondescript building from the outside, but on the inside, houses one of the most ​​​​​advanced ​​​​​tools ​​​​​in ​​​​​fashion ​​​​​tech ​​​​​right ​​​​​now: the ​​​​​Stratasys ​​​​​J850, ​​​​​a ​​​​​​printer ​​​​​that ​​​​​uses ​​​​​lenticular ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​or ​​​​​a ​​​​​type ​​​​​of ​​​​​3D ​​​​​printing, ​​​​​to ​​​​​apply ​​​​​holographic, ​​​​​raised, ​​​​​or ​​​​​shifting ​​​​​visuals ​​​​​directly ​​​​​onto ​​​​​fabric (think ​​​​​layers, ​​​​​gradient, ​​​​​photo ​​​​​realism, ​​​​​or ​​​​​textures ​​​​​that ​​​​​appear ​​​​​to ​​​​​move ​​​​​when ​​​​​you ​​​​​do). This is ​​​​​how ​​​​​sketches ​​​​​become ​​​​​sculpture, ​​​​​and ​​​​​fabric ​​​​​becomes ​​​​​an ​​​​​engaging ​​​​​and ​​​​​fun interactive ​​​​​experience.</p>



<p>This ​​​​​tour, which was led by Lenese Griffin, a seasoned apparel production manager with a wealth of experience in product development, opened my eyes to the massive, complicated world of fashion. The industry is so much more than aesthetics and seasonal trends — it’s an intricate system that’s evolving into something ​​​​​more ​​​​​intelligent, inclusive, ​​​​​immersive, ​​​​​and ​​​​​intentional. ​​​​​And we’re at the intersection ​​​​​between ​​​​​high ​​​​​design ​​​​​and ​​​​​high ​​​​​tech, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Black ​​​​​designers ​​​​​like ​​​​​LaQuan ​​​​​Smith, ​​​​​Anifa ​​​​​Mvuemba, ​​​​​and ​​​​​Madison ​​​​​Maxey ​​​​​are ​​​​​leading ​​​​​some ​​​​​of ​​​​​the ​​​​​boldest ​​​​​work ​​​​​in ​​​​​that ​​​​​space. ​​​​​</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>LaQuan Smith</h2>



<p><a href=""https://laquansmith.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LaQuan ​Smith</a>’s ​spring/summer 2025 ​show ​featured ​a ​sleepwear ​capsule “Lucid Dream,” ​co-created ​with ​Samsung, that drew design inspiration from the sleekness of the ​Galaxy ​Ring. ​The ​sleepwear ​arrived ​in ​vivid ​chartreuse ​silk ​organza and it served as a contrast against other designs, like ​trench ​coats ​made ​of ​a ​new ​material ​Smith ​calls ​“transparent ​horse,” ​made ​by ​his ​Italian ​mills. He described the look as perfect for when “a ​woman, ​on ​a ​rainy ​night, ​goes ​to ​her ​man’s ​house ​to ​have ​makeup ​sex.” It’s sensual luxury with a futuristic edge. </p>



<p>The New York-based designer used “AI Atelier” on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, where AI tools like sketch-to-image helped with the design process, and “Now Brief,” which supported things like organizing fabrics, scheduling fittings, and making communication with his team more efficient. </p>



<h2>Anifa Mvuemba </h2>



<p>Congolese born and DMV-based Anifa Mvuemba is the designer behind <a href=""https://hanifa.co/?srsltid=AfmBOopY2D4vaIZ-GhEgvdx1nxq3Sa7oHvPrTZDNcdsW6bG5g0pqANK_"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hanifa</a>, a brand that draws on her cultural background, resulting in bold silhouettes and inclusive sizing. In May 2020, she presented Pink Label Congo, a collection that honored her Congolese roots while raising awareness about issues like the exploitation that’s tied to coltan mining, as a digital runway show using invisible 3D avatars on Instagram Live. It was immediately celebrated for its innovation and cultural commentary, proving that technology can be used to amplify a message and unite the community instead of diluting it. </p>



<p>Since then, Hanifa has continued to evolve, balancing innovation with intentional craft. Mvuemba uses digital tools, like CLO, Procreate, and Blender in her design process, reducing waste while refining her vision of how clothes should move on the body. Her philosophy is clear: Fashion should be inclusive, technologically forward, and deeply connected to heritage. </p>



<h2>Madison Maxey </h2>



<p>Imagine buying a jacket that not only keeps you warm, but also senses how often you wear it, keeps track of how many times it’s been washed, and even helps a brand understand how its product moves through your life. That’s what <a href=""https://www.loomia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loomia</a> is doing right now. The tech — Loomia Electronic Layer (LEL) — is a flexible circuit sheet that bends, sketches, and survives in fabrics while carrying functions such as heating, lighting, or pressure detection. And yes, the layer holds up when stretched or handled; its electrical performance stays stable, unlike older “smart fabrics.” </p>



<p>And the woman behind Loomia is: Madison Maxey, who started it out of a desire to make electronics disappear into clothing, so the fabric does the work without feeling like gear. Before Loomia, she experimented with conductive inks, computational design, and patterning electronics with designers and engineers. LEL is now mostly used in medical, outdoor, automotive, and wellness fields, proving that wearable tech can be something that’s used, lived in, and trusted every day, by everyone. Case in point: A recent collaboration with L.L. Bean, where LEL was sewn or attached inside of outdoor gear to report wear behavior: temperature, wash, count, and usage patterns. The versatility of the technology shows how seamlessly it can be folded into existing brand identities and products. Loomia isn’t just for Loomia —  it’s scalable and transferable, and that’s its real strength.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>These designers are writing the next chapter of what fashion looks like. ​​​​​They’re ​​​​​building ​​​​​new ​​​​​systems, ​​​​​new ​​​​​fabrics, ​​​​​new ​​​​​languages, and ​​​​​doing ​​​​​it ​​​​​on ​​​​​their ​​​​​terms. We ​​​​’re ​​​​​entering ​​​​​a ​​​​​new ​​​​​era ​​​​​of ​​​​​fashion, ​​​​​and it ​​​​​values ​​​​​identity, ​​​​​innovation, ​​​​​and ​​​​​equality that leaves an impact — and ​​​​​I ​​​​​can’t ​​​​​wait ​​​​​to ​​​​​see ​​​​​what’s ​​​​​next.</p>

<p>When I received my flights and itinerary for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/friendship-milestone-anniversary-trip"">besties’ trip</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-nomad-full-time-traveler-chiang-mai-thailand-money-diary"">Thailand</a>, I immediately called my other half to go over the plan. As <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/05/232968/long-distance-friendship-tips"">long-distance BFFs</a>, we wanted to make every moment together count. On the phone, we revised the schedule, slotting in activities during our six-hour layover at Changi Airport in Singapore and any free days we had in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FHotel-Search%3Fdestination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26regionId%3D6035013%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26flexibility%3D0_DAY%26d1%3D2025-10-08%26startDate%3D2025-10-08%26d2%3D2025-10-09%26endDate%3D2025-10-09%26adults%3D2%26rooms%3D1%26pwaDialog%3Dfee-inclusive-pricing-sheet"">Koh Samui</a>, an island on the southeastern coastline of the Gulf of Thailand that Expedia recently named “Best for Affordable Luxury” on its <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/see/islandhotlist"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2025 Island Hot List</a>. It was the first time either of us was headed to Asia, and we wanted to see as much as we could and do as much as possible. We had five days — 120 hours — and we were determined not to waste a single minute.</p>



<p>But as the first several hours of our adventure together failed to go according to plan, I began to learn an important lesson about time: that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/03/10332829/why-does-time-feel-weird-covid-pandemic"">idea of time</a> as something we can structure and control is an illusion, mostly because time, itself, doesn’t actually exist in the way I thought it did.</p>



<p><strong>Day 1 — We Can’t Control Time</strong></p>



<p>Twenty-four hours into our travels, when we made it from Orlando, to San Francisco, to Changi Airport — where we had scheduled a free tour of the city, waterfall gazing at the Rain Vortex, a photoshoot at the Sunflower Garden, a playful walk along Canopy Park, and, of course, a meal at the Michelin-starred Kam’s Roast — we ended up adjusting our overambitious schedule by finding a comfortable place to rest before grabbing a quick bite. What felt like an hour somehow turned into five, and we ultimately jetted to our Bangkok Airways flight to Koh Samui without crossing off a single item from the list we’d meticulously built.</p>



<p>About an hour and a half later, when we arrived at our final destination, we were still spooked by the mysterious speed of time. But we laughed it off and were determined to return to scheduled programming. It was morningtime in Koh Samui, and we were ready to dip into the pale jade waters of Chaweng Beach and take photos in flowy dresses at the jungle-themed Songbird Lounge at our resort, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2FKoh-Samui-Hotels-Anantara-Lawana-Koh-Samui-Resort.h3131654.Hotel-Information%3Fchkin%3D2025-10-08%26chkout%3D2025-10-09%26x_pwa%3D1%26rfrr%3DHSR%26pwa_ts%3D1758721984916%26referrerUrl%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXhwZWRpYS5jb20vSG90ZWwtU2VhcmNo%26useRewards%3Dtrue%26rm1%3Da2%26regionId%3D6035013%26destination%3DKoh%2520Samui%252C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%252C%2520Thailand%26destType%3DMARKET%26selected%3D3131654%26latLong%3D9.501394%252C99.995619%26sort%3DRECOMMENDED%26top_dp%3D268%26top_cur%3DUSD%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB%26semcid%3DUS.UB.GOOGLE.PT-c-EN.HOTEL%26semdtl%3Da115095931062.b1128773544346.g1kwd-297287725106.e1c.m1Cj0KCQjwrc7GBhCfARIsAHGcW5VBLzRw9rRHeaCGOunCIQpr2i0CqLaFCoWPea-iuW3yXFOgccIEc5kaAqgwEALw_wcB.r155ea443aba8fb20a6b16868a6f0ab3ce1aca4e3140cc92f6afa62889c1fbd11b.c1.j19011784.k1.d1558748078076.h1p.i1.l1.n1.o1.p1.q1.s1anantara%2520lawana%2520koh%2520samui%2520resort.t1.x1.f1.u1.v1.w1%26userIntent%3D%26selectedRoomType%3D448130%26selectedRatePlan%3D382653233%26searchId%3D8e57e978-cc7a-4345-89b8-cd5f1b021a07"">Anantara Lawana Koh Samui</a>, where scenes from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10640659/the-white-lotus-review-the-limits-of-white-self-critique""><em>White Lotus</em></a> Season 3 were filmed. Except my friend’s checked luggage didn’t make it with us. Apparently, her suitcase was stuck somewhere in Singapore and we were told it would be located and delivered to our resort by the end of the day. But by then, we’d have lost the sunlight for the beach and the photos. </p>



<p>Once again, our first few hours in Asia — the precious, never-to-return time — would be “wasted,” or so we thought. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value.

<p>Growing up in the U.S., time often feels like currency, and as a Latina raised in a frugal home, I was taught to not squander anything of value. So, like money, I spent my time “wisely:” Every hour had a purpose and every day took me closer to a goal. At the time of my besties’ trip, I had already been feeling like I had mispent my time. That summer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/solo-midlife-birthday-trip-mexico"">I turned 35 years old</a>, and I realized my life was not where I had thought it would be. Sure, I had crossed most items off of my adulthood to-do list, but I had never been able to scratch off motherhood, and it started to feel like time for this milestone was running out. And unlike cash, there was no way I’d get that currency back. On this trip, I was beginning to feel that anxiety again, the feeling that days spent off schedule were days missed and misused. </p>



<p>When we finally arrived at our resort, anxious and exhausted, my thoughts about time began to shift. In Thailand, time doesn’t necessarily move according to the clock. Things begin when they’re meant to. The focus is more on readiness and less on the actual minute hand. This idea showed up from the moment we stepped into our resort. The concierge staff welcomed us with a smile, walked us over to a large ceremonial gong, and invited us to strike it three times. It was a symbolic way of marking our arrival and the beginning of our stay. But it also made something click: whatever time we’d “lost” stressing about luggage or sleeping through layovers didn’t matter. That time had passed, and in that sense, it no longer existed. And now we had time to do what our bodies actually needed us to: freshen up, relax on the king-sized bed in our villa, and beat jet lag so we could actually enjoy the days ahead of us.</p>



<p><strong>Day 2 — We All Experience Time Differently</strong></p>



<p>On the second day, once my friend finally had her suitcase of essentials, we jumped back into our itinerary, which was still patiently waiting for us. It didn’t matter which day we did what, just that we were doing it. Over breakfast at Ocean Kiss, the resort’s breezy beachfront buffet restaurant, we had fresh watermelon juice, Thai iced coffee, tropical fruit, noodles, pastries, and made-to-order omelets. Afterwards, we wandered the resort for some light cardio, passing koi ponds, checking out the tree house restaurant, <a href=""https://www.treetopsrestaurantsamui.com/"">Tree Tops,</a> we’d booked for later in the week, and stumbling into a rooftop boxing gym with the most stunning island views. Back at our villa, we cooled off in our private pool, enjoying deep catch-ups and hilarious photoshoots. That evening, we also watched a traditional Thai light show on the beach. The performer, barefoot and dressed in a bright red and gold costume, danced ram Thai, a slow movement that’s hundreds of years old and was originally performed in royal courts and religious ceremonies.</p>



<p>That night, I noticed my phone said the year was 2568. The month and day were correct, but the year was 543 years ahead. I was confused, so, naturally, I looked into it. I learned that Thailand uses the Buddhist calendar, which is five centuries ahead of the Gregorian calendar most of the world uses. What we call 2025 is 2568 in Thailand. That’s because their year zero is tied to the death of the Buddha rather than the birth of Christ. </p>

<p>While I joked to my family back home that I was both 12 hours ahead of them and hundreds of years in the future, it also reminded me that time isn’t fixed. It’s cultural and, thus, made up. We mark it based on what we value, whether that’s religious figures, harvest seasons, fiscal years, school schedules, or birthdays. But it’s still just a framework. The calendar we use, the milestones we aim for, and the pace we’re told to keep aren’t universal. It’s just one way to move through life, meaning there must also be other ways to do so. </p>



<p><strong>Day 3 — Time Is Cyclical, Not Linear, So It Can’t Run Out</strong></p>



<p>The next morning, we went on a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fnull.a1460577.detalles-actividades%3Frid%3D6307515%26location%3DMuelle%2520Haad%2520Rin%26swp%3Doff%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08"">“Best of Samui” city tour</a> with a local guide who drove us to several cultural and spiritual sites around the island. Our first stop was Wat Plai Laem, a colorful, modern temple that blends Thai, Chinese, and Hindu iconography. We saw a striking statue of Guanyin, the 18-armed goddess of compassion; a Laughing Buddha representing abundance and joy; and intricate depictions of Hindu deities like Ganesha, the remover of obstacles.</p>



<p>After that, we headed to Wat Phra Yai, better known as the Big Buddha Temple. We climbed 73 steps to reach the massive seated Buddha, which stands about 40 feet tall and overlooks the island from a raised platform. After paying our respects, praying, and taking in the gold-plated statue surrounded by lotus blossoms and prayer bells, our guide struck up a conversation about the Thai calendar, noting that it was the year 2568 and that, for many Thai people, especially practicing Buddhists, time is seen as cyclical instead of linear. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935020.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>He explained that in Western culture, time is often thought of as a straight line: you’re born, you grow up, you hit certain milestones, and eventually you die. It’s forward-moving and goal-oriented. But in Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress. Basically, you don’t have to accomplish everything in one lifetime, so there’s no sense of being “too late” or “running out of time.” There’s just where you are now and where you’re headed, eventually. As two women in our mid-30s who had been feeling the pressure of time, this concept felt both comforting and freeing.</p>



<p>Next, we visited Hin Ta and Hin Yai Rocks, famous for looking like male and female genitalia (yes, really). It was a quick stop and a very popular photo op, but our guide told us that the rocks had taken on these shapes naturally and slowly by wind and sea erosion over thousands of years. It was another reminder that time, when left alone, unrushed, and without a deadline, creates its own beautiful and worthy story. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“In Thai Buddhism, time isn’t something you race through. It moves in cycles: life, death, rebirth, and spiritual progress.

<p>Finally, our last stop was Wat Khunaram, where the body of a mummified monk named Loung Pordaeng is displayed in the same seated meditation position he died in decades ago. His body has barely decayed, and his hair and teeth are still intact. For Buddhists, death isn’t an endpoint. It’s just another phase. The emphasis is on how you live rather than on how long you lived. According to our guide, the monk had told his followers that if his body remained preserved, it would be a sign that he had reached enlightenment, the Buddhist state of Nirvana, where suffering ends and the cycle of rebirth breaks, leaving behind only clarity, compassion, and spiritual liberation. I appreciated seeing death presented as something still unfolding rather than an end.</p>



<p><strong>Day 4 — I Am Exactly Where I Need To Be at This Time in My Life</strong></p>



<p>The next day, we learned that the full-day snorkeling trip we had planned for Koh Tao and Koh Nangyuan had been canceled due to an incoming storm. Normally, this would’ve felt like a wasted day. But by then, after three days in Thailand both learning and witnessing how differently time is experienced, I didn’t panic. Instead, my friend and I had a long breakfast and then walked down to Chaweng Beach. </p>



<p>She hiked along the rocks, and I stayed behind to meditate in the still waters. Around me, tourists enjoyed each other’s company: a British family of three played “Marco Polo” and a large group of Arab relatives laughed during what seemed like a family reunion. At one point, I noticed a little girl drifting too far into the water and waded in to carry her back to her father. He thanked me for being at the “right place at the right time.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There was that word again. For most of my life, I’ve treated time like something to be managed, maximized, and spent. But moments like that reminded me that I’m always exactly where I need to be, even when things don’t go as planned, maybe especially then. If something doesn’t happen when I thought it would — whether it’s a trip, a relationship, or a phase of life — it’s not that time is running out but that it just wasn’t time yet. </p>



<p><strong>Day 5 — Time Is Meant to Be Experienced, Not Rushed Through</strong></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11935022.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our last day, my friend and I participated in <a href=""https://www.expedia.com/things-to-do/thai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details?location=Koh+Samui%2C+Surat+Thani+Province%2C+Thailand&amp;startDate=2025-09-24&amp;endDate=2025-10-08&amp;rid=6035013&amp;AID=11552045&amp;PID=100062354&amp;SID=30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fthings-to-do%2Fthai-cooking-class-organic-micro-farm-experience-farm-to-table-since-2015.a2595376.activity-details%3Flocation%3DKoh%2520Samui%2C%2520Surat%2520Thani%2520Province%2C%2520Thailand%26startDate%3D2025-09-24%26endDate%3D2025-10-08%26rid%3D6035013&amp;affcid=network.cj.100062354&amp;cjevent=78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c&amp;affdtl=CJ.78eb5893995911f0803c00950a82b82c.11552045.30283X879131X958c566ec844ad51a37b52f31bfc80c3&amp;button_referral_source=other"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chef Lat’s Island Organic Farm Thai Cooking Class</a>, the first farm-to-table cooking class on Koh Samui. The four-hour experience started with a guided tour of Chef Lat’s lush organic micro‑farm, where she cultivates more than 70 varieties of Thai herbs, vegetables, and fruits, including galangal, kaffir lime, lemongrass, and moringa. With freshly picked produce in hand, we moved to our stations in the open‑air Thai cookery kitchen and got to work. We started with a refreshing butterfly pea flower herbal drink, followed by four classic Thai dishes: Pad Thai Prawn, Tom Yum Prawn, Penang Chicken, and Som Tum (papaya salad).</p>



<p>Even in the comically high-pressure kitchen, there was another lesson about time. As Chef Lat reminded us, we wouldn’t rush the layering of flavors in the curry or speed up the pounding of herbs in the mortar and pestle. Thai cooking, like much of Thai life, demands time and presence. It’s not about finishing quickly but rather about being deliberate, staying focused, and honoring each step in the process. Just like in life, slowness isn’t inefficiency. It’s care, presence, and intention. It’s less about squeezing as much as we can into an hour and more about actually being in the hour.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“If time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>With that, my bestie and I returned to our resort for a 60-minute full-body massage followed by a 30-minute Indian head massage. We locked our phones in a safe, leaving the 24-hour clock behind with them. A gong was struck when we began and again when we were finished. But for the time in between — when our therapists used warm coconut oil to smooth out the tension in our shoulders, backs, and scalps — we were fully present.</p>



<p>I grew up believing time was linear, fixed, and constantly slipping away. It was something I had to beat, never fall behind from, or catch up to. But Thailand reminded me that time is a human invention. It’s experienced differently across cultures and even across seasons of life. But if time is relative, then it’s not absolute. And if it’s not absolute, then it can’t really run out. With that, maybe I haven’t missed anything. Maybe I’m not behind at all. Maybe, like everything else on this trip, I can trust that I will arrive exactly when I’m meant to.</p>
