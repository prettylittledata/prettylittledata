<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style and ring in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-years-eve-nail-art-designs"">the new year</a> with a trendy winter coat. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and look out for versatile coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. (And be sure to also look out for non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.)</p>

<p>It’s 2010. I’m 13 years old and I’m on my way to what I <em>know</em> will be one of the craziest nights of my life: <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Justin Bieber </a><em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My World 2.0</a></em><a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-announces-my-world-tour-first-headlining-trek-958949/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Tour.</a> As I crank my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hair-straightening-tools"">hair straightener</a> up way too high (RIP to my ends), I pause mid-section and wonder: <em>What am I missing? What would truly make Justin fall in love with me? </em>And then it hits me: my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/favorite-perfumes-editors-picks"">vanilla cupcake perfume</a> from Claire’s.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fragrance"">perfume is aggressively sugary</a> and smells like straight icing. All my mom could hear from downstairs was <em>sksksksksks</em> as I drowned myself in it, fully convinced that if Justin couldn’t see me from the stage, he would at least smell me. And well, not to spoil the ending, but… he did not fall in love with me that night. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2018/11/217863/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-marriage-confirmed"">Congrats, Hailey</a>!</p>



<p>What <em>did</em> happen, though, was far more consequential: that was the night I fell in love with gourmand fragrances, specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-7-virtues-vanilla-woods-perfume-fragrance-review"">vanilla</a>. I never cared what brand it was, as long as the bottle starts with <em>buttery</em>, <em>whipped</em>, or <em>sugar</em>, I was in.</p>



<p>Life was going great until one day, a coworker casually mentions that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfume-fragrance-editor-favorites"">favorite fragrance</a> reminds her of what it smells like to be a child. Suddenly, I was overthinking everything. Was I still that 13-year-old hoping to be noticed by JB, or did my signature scent simply need a rebrand?</p>



<p>Turns out, it was both.</p>



<p>When I heard that <a href=""https://thesoapandglory.com/""><strong>Soap &amp; Glory</strong></a> dropped a brand-new, mood-boosting fragrance line, I was intrigued. It covers pretty much every palette. There’s <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-tropical-sunrise/ID=300462740-product""><strong>Tropical Sunrise</strong></a> with pineapple and coconut, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-orchid-bliss/ID=300462734-product""><strong>Orchid Bliss</strong></a> with orchid and sandalwood, <a href=""http://walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-radiant-rose/ID=300462747-product""><strong>Radiant Rose</strong></a> with florals and bergamot, <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-watermelon-spritz/ID=300462746-product""><strong>Watermelon Spritz</strong></a> for something bright and juicy, and of course <a href=""https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/soap-%26-glory-body-mist-vanilla-licious/ID=300462744-product""><strong>Vanilla-licious</strong></a> with warm caramel and vanilla notes. With a set with this much range, it’s perfect for mixing and matching. And with each fragrance under $20, it felt like the perfect chance to find my signature scent and actually play around with layering.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952221.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=491&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A491"" /></figure>



<p>Since I hadn’t elevated my fragrance in nearly 20 years, I tapped the internet’s favorite fragrance guru, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@paulreactss?lang=en""><strong>Paul Fino</strong></a>, for advice on how to layer scents and whether I can keep being a vanilla girl at my big age. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p><strong>Unbothered: So talk to me about vanilla. Do you think it’s having a moment right now? And do you think it’s one of those scents that transcends seasons, like a year-round thing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Fino:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Vanilla is year-round for me because there are so many vanilla-adjacent scents. You can find vanillas that lean super creamy, more floral, or even more powdery. That said, vanilla is definitely most popular in fall and winter. People love warm gourmands in colder months, and in summer they usually want something more tropical, fruity, or fresh. But vanilla is not going anywhere. It’s had its moment and it’s become one of those things that just sticks around.</p>



<p><strong>My coworker said vanilla is childish. So when you see something like Vanilla-licious, which feels more grown and sexy but still has that inner-child sweetness, how do you elevate it? How do you layer it so you don’t smell like cupcake perfume from Limited Too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> I 100% get that. A lot of gourmand vanillas can lean artificial or very young. When people say they want a “mature” vanilla, I get it, but “mature” doesn’t mean grandma. It can mean deeper, sexier, more attractive. One of my favorite ways to elevate Vanilla-licious is pairing it with Radiant Rose. Radiant Rose is basically their iconic signature scent, but repackaged and made a little newer and fresher. Rose is romantic, and it deepens the vanilla. The musk in both helps them blend really beautifully. That vanilla-rose combination is gorgeous.</p>



<p><strong>I feel like layering fragrance is like cooking. You wouldn’t put mustard and jelly together. So how do you know what works? What’s the science of scent layering, especially for someone new who wants to smell unique but still wearable?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> It’s all about understanding notes and scent families. I can usually predict how something will smell based on the notes and how many fragrances I’ve experienced, but a simple rule is to keep things in similar scent profiles if you want to play it safe. Sweets with sweets, gourmands with gourmands. For example, vanilla with pineapple and coconut makes sense because it’s tropical sweet. Vanilla and coconut always work together, so Vanilla-licious with Tropical Sunrise is an easy layering combo.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952222.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What about combinations that are risky?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Sometimes mixing two different ends of the spectrum can clash, but sometimes a clash is exactly what makes it interesting. That’s how you get people to ask, “What are you wearing?” Also, fragrance wears differently on everyone, so experimentation matters.</p>



<p><strong>Are these meant to be layered only with each other, or can you layer them with perfumes too?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> You can absolutely layer these with perfumes. They’re body mists, but they have really good projection and longevity, especially for the price point. They’re great as base layers.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a method for layering? Like an order you follow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong>Yes. I do heaviest to lightest. I start with my deepest scent first, like a heavy wood or musk, then layer lighter scents on top. It’s kind of like how fragrance is built, with base notes, heart notes, and top notes.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952224.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>If someone just wants one scent from the line for self-care, like a shower that makes you feel calm and relaxed, which one is it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Orchid Bliss. Hands down. If you want truly relaxing and calming, Orchid Bliss is the one. It’s slightly sweet, it has sandalwood, and there are also notes like vanilla and pistachio in there, but they feel more subtle and deeper in the background. It’s like a spa in a bottle.</p>



<p><strong>Why not Vanilla-licious for calm?</strong></p>



<p><strong>PF:</strong> Vanilla makes me feel confident. Like, super confident. Orchid Bliss gives more calm spa-night energy. If you’re tired, overworked, and want the most relaxing shower, I’d do scrub, wash, body butter, and spray in Orchid Bliss, then top it with your favorite perfume if you want extra oomph.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>After talking to Paul, I realized it was never really about retiring vanilla. It was about wearing it with intention. It was about keeping the sweetness but adding depth. It’s time to let my inner 13-year-old have her moment, while my grown self makes my scent feel polished. So yes, I’m still a vanilla girl. I’m just a vanilla girl with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-vanilla-perfume""><em>range</em></a> now.</p>

<p><em>Music journalist Kelly Washington travelled to the Playa Pacha at the FIVE Luxe Hotel to profile <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/peggygou_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a>, the queen of K-House and techno. </em></p>



<p>It is around midnight at the Playa Pacha openair nightclub in the <a href=""https://luxejbr.fivehotelsandresorts.com/"">FIVE LUXE hotel in Dubai</a>. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gerdjansonofficial/?hl=en"">German DJ Gerd Janson</a> has just dropped a remix of Stevie Nick’s “Edge Of Seventeen” when <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/dj-peggy-gou-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Gou</a> appears next to him, diamond-clad in a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/q_millinery/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Q Park Millinery</a> sparkly bandana, with a cat on the front reading “Mew Mew,” paired with a black two-piece. I am standing behind the decks, watching her slink into the space with her entourage, as the crowd reacts to her presence. Someone next to me breathlessly exclaims “queen”, in a way that seems involuntarily. As the crowd howls in unison and Gou clasps their hands, I am struck by how comfortable she looks.</p>



<p>It is hard to believe that once upon a time, Gou was just starting out in the underground scene; she seems as if she was plonked down on earth, already a successful 34-year-old, with her knowing, winning smile and covered in patchwork tattoos, cigarette in one hand, tending to the decks with the other. The ‘female DJ’ as an archetype has gone through many iterations, but never before has she propelled herself into mainstream stardom the way Peggy Gou has. In a short space of time, she achieved global fame, headlined major festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury, created global hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCz5y84dwuA"">(It Goes Like) Nanana,</a>” and became the first Korean to play the <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/berghain-linux"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">world-renowned legacy club Berghain.</a> </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952202.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The FIVE LUXE hotel is flooded with Brits escaping the December chill at home, as well as Americans, Russians, and other European clientele. Backed by the hotel’s luxury ecosystem project, the FIVE LUXE has a “do more with less” ethos and is 100% solar powered, making it the world’s highest-rated 5-Star Hotel green building under LEED v4 (the international standard for high-performance green buildings). FIVE’s service is the best I’ve ever experienced (even my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/winter-clothes-accessories-2025#slide-8"">battered Vagabond handbag</a> gets its own seat at every table), and I’m grateful I packed my <a href=""https://www.loopearplugs.com/products/swarovski"">Swarovski Loop ear plugs</a> (the only sparkly thing I own) so I just about fit in with the bold and flash crowd.</p>



<p>I ask Peggy to describe Dubai’s club scene in three words, to which she enthusiastically responds “energetic, diverse and growing!” Considering a huge 90% of the population are expats, she’s not wrong. FIVE’s Palm Jeremiah hotel (also in Dubai) even boasts its own recording studio, and with a club in Ibiza too, it’s clear the team has set their sights on Dubai as their next ultimate party destination. They have the cash, and they plan to spend it on the best talent money can buy; hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlcoxofficial/?hl=en"">Carl Cox</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marcocarola/?hl=en"">Marco Carola </a>and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/solomun/?hl=en"">Solomun</a> at Playa Pacha. </p>



<p>When she was 18, Peggy Gou went to study at the <a href=""https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/london-college-of-fashion/study-at-lcf?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22332830344&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-G_q8pyDEQVeFZGpmfJ8Qdf3lAZE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9aPKBhBhEiwAyz82J0Y4h9qKJbh7cGoshAwRUZaq-07o72iJKm9Ca2eli2Uxv2PBe2o4sxoCvVEQAvD_BwE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London College of Fashion</a> with hopes of becoming a designer, then a photographer, then a stylist. But she’d always been passionate about music, and eventually found a way to use her skills in fashion promotion to fill a gap in electronic music. While most house and techno DJs dress understated, she knew her style would play a pivotal role in her success once she began producing music and cutting her teeth at small venues in London and Berlin. I ask her why these grassroots spaces are important right now, and her critical eye shines: “Club culture continues to influence many aspects of creative industries far beyond music. Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it,” Gou says. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Without grassroots and independent venues, we will lose the very foundations of electronic music as we know it.</p><cite>dj peggy gou</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Above all, Gou is a strategic and smart producer, and is incredibly intentional about what she puts out and why. Back in July 2018, I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Manchester in the UK, and a label called Defected Records reigned supreme among most of my friends who were into house music. It was on this label that Gou released a remix of Shakedown’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“At Night (Peggy Gou’s Acid Journey Remix)”</a> that defined the summer. As catchy, accessible and pop-fluent as the chorus was, it never seemed to get old, and hit #1 on the UK Official Dance Singles Chart. Everywhere you went, the At Night remix was playing. The pulsing vocal could be heard from Manchester, to London, to party island Ibiza, often heard in a rendition similar to that of a football chant. With this single, Gou propelled herself into the dance music world, then onto the global stage, and hasn’t slowed down since. </p>



<p>Blowing up in electronic music as a woman, can be your best and worst nightmare all at once. Overnight, you are successful, impressive, and adored. But six months later you are likely to fall victim to criticism for <em>something</em>, like being too commercial or having rich parents. Her haters will say that she sold out, that once Peggy Gou had everyone feeling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZbf2JR422w"">“much better… at night</a>”, she was no longer the underground DJ sensation who cut her teeth in clubs in London and Berlin – they’d lost her to A-list status. Charli XCX touched on this in <a href=""https://itscharlibb.substack.com/p/the-death-of-cool"">her recent substack </a>titled “The Death of Cool.” XCX wrote, “I have always rejected the idea that art, film, persona or music becoming commercial means it cannot also be considered cool. The rejection of commerciality ‘just because’ is such a boring and immature argument that is perhaps more suited to some mediums than others but in general I find to be elitist in a way that does not thrill me whatsoever,” she continued. “Disliking something purely because of its widespread popularity or links to commercialism comes with a distinctly art school type energy that is super triggering to me.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952204.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Charli XCX is right, artists can’t take this chatter personally – just because some fans in the electronic music space have a habit of tarnishing those who rise to success quickly, especially if you’re a woman. At the same time, it is not wholly uncommon to witness legends (often male), playing what can only be described as the worst set you’ve seen in your life, on no sleep, without consequence or fallout in the scene.</p>



<p>When cool points are gained on the basis of youth and niche references, mainstream success can become the enemy in certain circles. Once something transcends the underground, it transforms into something else entirely. But Peggy never forgot her roots; a genre-blending selector with range, she’s known for her energetic but composed sets. She often plays a combination of pulsing house, techno and break beats, dropping tunes from artists like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dj_seinfeld/"">DJ Seinfeld</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/andrezimmer_/?hl=en"">Andre Zimmer,</a> as well as hosting the likes of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dmx_krew/?hl=en"">DMX Krew</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/regularfantasy/"">Regularfantasy</a> on her label. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>… this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world.</p><cite>peggy gou on mentoring other djs</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Sure, it’s inevitable that those who are successful will be criticized. Someone’s song blows up, they get big, and then we get bored until they do something else remarkable. But in this corner of entertainment, it’s silly to dismiss a DJ because of their accolades. To paint a picture, a Berlin-based journalist I met recently told me (with a straight face) that because Gou is never seen in the local pubs in Berlin, it must mean she doesn’t actually live there (she does). So let’s set the record straight, aside from electronic music’s swirling pool of cool that has a habit of eating the principles it so vehemently defends, I can confirm that Gou is touring the world, looking sensational, and most importantly very, very good at her job. </p>



<p>To get a broader picture of how she shaped her taste, I ask Gou to name an album, movie and a book that was essential in her cultural education. For her movie she selects cult classic <em>Pulp Fiction</em> (which tracks with her style), the book is Nietzsche’s <em>Ubermensch </em>(there’s that critical thinking), and a true music head, she sites Kraftwerk’s <a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/3-d-the-catalogue-live/1572506374"">3-D: The Catalogue (Live) </a>as the ultimate education. Gou explains how she still tries to make it down to grassroots venues, “not just as a DJ but more importantly as a raver, which I always find inspiring and cathartic.” Her dedication to a range of culture shows in the sets she plays, so I think we can forgive her for not sharing a pint with us at the local boozer.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Gou realized she wanted to own her own music and uplift other artists on the rise, so she created <em>Gudu Records</em> and released her own album titled “Moment”. A few years ago, I interviewed the<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/matisa.dj/""> Italian DJ Matisa</a>, who has released music on Peggy Gou’s label. When I asked her about her experience as a woman in the industry, she credited Gou as a brilliant mentor to herself and others in the dance music community, adding that she’s very hard working and down to earth. I ask Gou about her mission to lift up other DJs like Matisa, and she stresses the importance of not only supporting new talent via <em>Gudu</em> but also including the newcomers on her line-ups IRL, “this is not just focused on the fact they’re women, they’re exceptionally talented and it’s important for me to use my platform to share that with the world”. </p>



<p>With rising costs for venues and AI music creation causing a stir, who knows where 2026 will take electronic music. I ask Gou if she’s optimistic about where the industry is heading, in terms of building a better future for those that follow her success and she leaves me with a gem of hope that mirrors the energy she brings to the industry: “I’m optimistic for sure, but as with anything growing as fast as our industry, it won’t be without its challenges.”<br /></p>

<p>Forget tortoiseshell, leopard, and cow prints for a second — deer print is about to steal their thunder. It’s also one of the easiest prints to recreate. Tiny, deliberate white spots stretch from base to tip on a brushed brown background, creating a deer-hide effect that perfectly nods to the winter season. We love this set by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRHqxjPjZwm/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Sierra, also known as @thatglosssauce</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before our iced coffee obsession made its way to our nails — and this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcoHkmkXYV/?hl=en"">nail tech Elizabeth</a> is nothing short of incredible. It starts with a bronze cat-eye base, manipulated with magnets to achieve a glassy finish, followed by a matte top coat. Then, fine lines are painted on top using a glossy top coat to create a striking contrast effect.</p>

<p>Just hit the Explore page on Instagram, and it’ll become clear: baby blue and chocolate brown are the unexpected color combination of 2026 — and we’re here for it. There’s a ’70s retro vibe to the pairing, but it works effortlessly. Created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOB6k9NCF7E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Heather Errington</a>, this pastel blue heart layered over a molten chocolate base is so cool.</p>

<p>Taking cues from A/W runways, plaid nails are everywhere, but velvet plaid — essentially plaid layered over a velvety cat-eye base — is what’s bringing the intricate pattern into 2026. Thanks to the mix of polish finishes, the effect is beautifully multidimensional. We love this icy <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDATgRDhWq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">look by @nailology.101</a>.</p>

<p>Hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> describes the varsity bob as a choppy, chin-skimming cut with subtle layers and a center part. The inspo? <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stxph.h/?hl=en"">Steph Hui</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/milliebobbybrown/?hl=en"">Millie Bobby Brown</a>. “Polished but never prissy, it carries a cool collegiate energy — youthful without being childish and preppy without being stiff,” says Smith. While the movement might look undone, it’s actually intentional and well-maintained, adds Smith, thanks to the invisible layers through the mid-lengths and ends that create that flicky volume.</p>

<p>“Gucci bangs feel very fashion-forward — and powerful,” says celebrity hairstylist and colorist, Dimitris Giannetos. He recalls creating the softly-parted, slightly grown-out look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPCbqhRCcFf/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Demi Moore</a> ahead of her role as the fictional character Barbara Gucci in the short film <a href=""https://www.gucci.com/uk/en_gb/ms/short-film/video/?srsltid=AfmBOoqmlK5X6LGynFA07QzQ_cV-MEN9asH5aMoAgw1q-0w5QmEfs8ve""><em>The Tiger</em></a><em>.</em> “To achieve this look, ask for wispy curtain bangs just below the brows with face-framing pieces towards the ears,” recommends Giannetos. The key? “Avoid a blunt cut by adding some variety to the length of the bangs across the face,” he says.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRwqKtLkWkX/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Anok Yai</a>’s striking short bob, complete with a blunt fringe, highlights the boldness of this style,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>. “It’s a sharp, chin-skimming bob paired with a clean fringe, and it’s set to stand out this winter.” Why? It has a strong, modern silhouette, Dublin explains, yet still feels polished and low-maintenance.

The ripped bob, however, is a more interesting, layered take, thanks to softly separated ends created with a texturizing technique where the hair is chopped into vertically. This cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFiwwTohOJ6/?hl=en"">Catherine Gibbs</a> is perfect.</p>

<p>The shag is set to take on a much gentler image in 2026, according to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neale.rodger/?hl=en"">Neale Rodger</a>, style director at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/stil.salon/reels/?hl=en"">STIL salon</a> in London. “Think soft, feathered layers that build volume and create easy movement,” says Rodger, like this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ8UfaOEZwa/?hl=en"">Ryenne Snow</a>. Rodger adds that it’s the kind of cut that still looks intentional even as it grows out. “It’s a brilliant choice for medium to thick hair,” continues Rodger, “especially if there’s already some natural wave or texture to play with.” Guiding your stylist is simple: “Ask for feathered layers throughout, soft ends, and a length that sits somewhere between the neck and shoulders,” advises Rodger.</p>

<p>The ’70s have had their time in the sun. Now, it’s 1960’s time to shine, and bangs are leading the resurgence, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rickyandthe64/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ricky Walters</a>, founder and creative director of <a href=""https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/kDPwCAD7OkS1gz3BSGfnFGBjS0?domain=instagram.com"">Salon 64</a>. “The new incarnation is all about boldness: think thick, heavy, statement-making fringes taken surprisingly far back into the crown,” says Walters. He adds, “This isn’t a whisper of a fringe; it’s a full-volume curtain that instantly reshapes the face, adding drama, mystery, and a touch of French-girl rebellion.” Walters says that cutting it with plenty of density — adding bulk through techniques like point cutting and texturizing — prevents it from slipping into anything too dated. Hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRgiqAzkYj5/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a> always nails it.</p>

<p>The power pixie has <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKC7SdkIV8j/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Florence Pugh</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/glennclose/?hl=en"">Glenn Close</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lirisaw/?hl=en"">Iris Law</a> to thank for its meteoric rise. “This is a cropped, layered pixie that’s sharp, sculpted, and deliberately androgynous,” says Smith. Its key characteristics? “Enough length and the top and front to allow for versatile styling,” adds Smith, who calls it the ultimate anti-blowout style. “This is great for finer hair types and those who want more lift, as it helps to contour the jawline and cheekbones when long enough to be tucked behind the ears,” says Smith. Asking for it couldn’t be simpler: “Ask for close layering and texture that can shift from matte and punkish by day to polished and glossy at night,” advises Smith — and don’t forget the longer, swooping bangs.</p>

<p>The name sounds complicated, but the result speaks for itself. It’s essentially a soft blowout with rounded, bouncy ends, explains Giannetos, who recently debuted the look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPfNBxrAm_i/?img_index=1"">Amal Clooney</a>. “It works well on long, layered hair, about 6-8 inches from the shoulder. This look enhances body, adds movement, and makes the blowout feel thicker and more voluminous,” says Giannetos. “I like to take a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbioionic.com%2Fproducts%2Flong-barrel-curling-iron%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop4ikEqvaTUTaxG4jDAYCjJnatn52afqSSXogJ4hCj1l_BzoThO"">1.25” Bio Ionic Curler</a> to the ends to lock in the rounded shape.”</p>

<p>Super-short styles are still trending, says Dublin, but the polished pixie is having a moment.

<p>The shaggy bob is not only effortlessly chic, says Dublin, but it’s practical for winter and spring. “The layers add movement and texture — great under scarves or hats — while still looking polished for work or evening plans,” adds Dublin. Grab a hydrating hair cream like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpalo-santo-styling-cream-for-curly-coily-hair-P514454"">PATTERN by Tracee Ellis Ross Palo Santo Styling Cream</a> and let your natural texture do its thing.

<p>Mussed-up texture is in this season, says Stenson, and while the classic shag’s layering technique is making a comeback, it’s being reimagined for 2026 with modern softness and volume. “Even better, it’s flexible across hair types,” he adds. “A shag is great for anyone with thick hair because it removes weight and bulk. If you have finer hair, ask for a modern micro-shag or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/07/10604094/wolf-cut-hair-style"">wolf-shag</a> with strategic layering that adds volume and texture without making the hair look sparse,” advises Stenson.

<p>“The textured lob [aka long bob] will continue its quiet takeover,” says Rodger. “It’s mid-length, slightly undone, and effortlessly cool — the kind of cut that behaves beautifully through winter,” he adds. It’s also a seasonal all-rounder, and easy to air-dry in the warmer months, too. “I love how it slips under scarves and coats without losing shape, and it gives hair that natural, lived-in movement,” continues Rodger, who says it’s perfect for wavy and lightly curly hair. “Ask your stylist for a neck-to-shoulder graze with feathered, textured ends, and a soft, natural finish,” suggests Rodger.

<p>The 2026 update is lighter than its previous counterpart, says Walters, and it sits in what he refers to as the magic zone: “Just above the collarbone and never shorter than the jawline,” adds Walters, like this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DL7RI9nTj3h/?img_index=1"">Miho Mai</a>. “This sweet spot creates a clean, graphic silhouette without sacrificing softness.” What gives it a modern edge is the invisible layering: “These are subtle, sliced-in shorter pieces hidden underneath,” says Walters. “These secret layers act like built-in movement, allowing the bob to swing, breathe, and catch the light in all the right ways.”</p>

<p>If they’re not cut properly, curtain bangs can look blocky and unnatural, failing to blend into the rest of your lengths. That’s why Stenson suggests asking for “texturized” curtain bangs. Texturized bangs are cut with techniques that soften the fringe and remove bulk, so they fall more naturally. “Your stylist will assess the density of your hair to ensure your bangs are proportionate to your face,” says Stenson. “Bangs are especially a great choice for those with fine or thin hair and looking to bring some volume to their look. They’re truly versatile enough to suit all face shapes.” Take inspiration from this cut by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHXGOA8RxGH/?hl=en"">@charlottexstyles</a> on Instagram.</p>

<p>The bixie — bob meets pixie — is heading into 2026 with us, and for good reason: it’s soft, wearable, and short enough to feel fresh, says Rodger. “This is a sweet spot between a bob and a pixie, and it’s ideal for anyone tempted to go shorter without committing to a full pixie,” says Rodger. He adds that it works especially well on fine to medium hair, which always benefits from added texture through the mid-lengths and ends. “When you’re asking for it in the chair, think chin length or slightly above, with light, choppy layers and a soft, airy finish.” We love this crop by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKmqHaSxsQ2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Chellsie Aiger Serrano</a>.</p>

<p>Rodger is convinced that a “clean, blunt bob” is the answer to feeling polished without the effort, like this cut on STIL client <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcGcLqIu_E/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Abbie de Fontaine</a>. “The strong, even line gives you instant structure,” he says. “Plus, it looks incredible peeking out from under winter and spring layers.” He adds that the cut is particularly beautiful on slightly wavy or straight, finer hair, as it lends weight and sharpness. For the best result, Rodger suggests asking for a chin-to-collarbone bob with crisp, blunt ends and minimal layering. “Keep it sleek or lightly textured depending on your hair type,” he says.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we least expect <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/what-are-5-love-languages-meaning"">it, love appears</a>. Venus in Capricorn is going to bring a lot of rizz to our hearts, allowing us to elevate our romantic game. The last week of December 2025 and first week of January 2026 are going to be filled with tenderness in its purest and deepest form; the planets aren’t fooling around when it comes to committing. Rather than playing games, we’ll be inclined to be direct and honest with what we require in partnerships. So, ramp up your profile on the dating apps, clear the cache, and get hyper-specific about what you’re looking for, because things are about to get interesting in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cuffing-season-relationship-experiences"">of cuffing season</a>.</p>



<p>Typically, the transit of Venus and Capricorn allows us to take a mature approach to romantic relationships. We state our intentions in the beginning to ensure that we’re on the same page with others. There are no hidden agendas or shadiness when it comes to what we’re giving and pulling in, meaning that our agenda is clear: we want to be a part of a union and take steps towards advancing it in the simplest ways without any drama. Building a life together, with our crush/boo, with structure and shared goals, is essential. We are willing to combine resources to create a strong foundation that can’t be broken.</p>



<p>When it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">comes to friendships</a>, we will not settle for the company of those who treat us unjustly and unkindly. Having people around us who respect and honor our time, as well as our qualities, is important. After all, we don’t want to give our energy to those who aren’t going to reciprocate fairly, which is another core theme of Venus in Capricorn. The earthiness of this aspect makes us feel super connected to our besties. Keep in mind that the focus is on material things, so we may desire shopping sprees, wine tastings, spa days, or decadent meals with our crew instead of hanging out at the local pub or coffee house.</p>



<p>From December 24, 2025, to January 17, 2026, Venus in Capricorn is making us believe in our visions of devotion. The presence of Neptune in Pisces adds a softer vibe, allowing us to fall head over heels. Luckily, Saturn gives us the strength not to go overboard. The caveat is that boundaries will be instrumental in how we move forward with others. If you get the opportunity to peek through your significant other’s iCal, resist the urge. If you opt to be nosy and get caught, it might cause major rifts. </p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the first of two Venus Star Points occurs on January 6, 2026 (the last one is cosmically slated for October 23, 2026. The term is coined by astrologer Arielle Guttman, who considers the meeting of the Sun and Venus in the same sign and degree (also known as “cazimi”) to bring about metamorphic changes. Venus becomes an evening star, making it hard to spot in the sky, but not in our spirit. Since this celestial union is in Capricorn, we are inclined to make pragmatic decisions about whom we commit. Get ready to adjust your relationship status on social media! </p>



<p>As a result, Venus in Capricorn pushes us to put the effort into our passions to ensure they become tangible and true. Roll up your sleeves and start working to get what you deserve when it comes to cultivating relationships. It’ll be worth the time and energy in the end. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951226.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Welcome to a major transition week, R29 babes. On December 21st, the solstice strikes and Capricorn Season officially begins, marking one of the most powerful energetic pivots of the year. In astrology, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">solstices are threshold moments</a>: they represent extremes of light and dark, visibility and invisibility, action and rest. This one ushers us into four weeks of self-dedication, sovereignty, and intentional effort. And because <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-capricorn-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Mars is already in Capricorn</a> as the sun changes signs, we haven’t entered this energy cold.</p>



<p>We’ve been acclimating to discipline, devotion, and long-term thinking for weeks now. What shifts at the solstice is not effort, but <em>orientation</em>: we move from Sagittarius’s freedom-seeking, exploratory energy into Capricorn’s grounded commitment to self, legacy, and responsibility. We’re also coming off the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-sagittarius-december-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Sagittarius New Moon</a>, making this an ideal week to set intentions if you haven’t yet, or to recommit to the ones that truly matter.</p>



<p>Before the sun even enters Capricorn, though, there’s an important emotional undercurrent. In the early hours of December 21st at 5:08 a.m. EST, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, creating a moment of tension between sensitivity and action. Jupiter in Cancer amplifies emotional truth, memory, and the need for safety, while Chiron in Aries exposes wounds around identity, courage, and self-assertion.</p>



<p>Collectively, this can feel like wanting to protect ourselves while also being asked totake bold steps forward. Old insecurities may flare up, especially around whether we’re  allowed to take up space or move decisively while still honoring our feelings. The entry into Capricorn Season acts as a grounding balm after this square, reminding us that we don’t have to choose between emotional honesty and forward momentum. We can build from both.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, the Capricorn influence deepens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to our relationships — romantic, platonic, and professional. Even during the holidays, the collective mood is less about small talk and more about substance. We’re thinking about money, security, generational wealth, and what (or who) is actually worth investing in. Standards are higher, patience is thinner, and performative connection won’t cut it. This is a powerful moment to turn that discernment inward first. How can you live according to the standards you expect from others? How can you embody the stability, integrity, and commitment you’re craving? Capricorn Season isn’t about deprivation — it’s about self-respect. And this solstice week sets the tone.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a potent internal–external tension. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your career, reputation, and long-term goals light up, asking you to take yourself seriously and step more fully into leadership. But just before that shift, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in your sign, bringing emotional material to the surface, especially around home, family, and your inner child. You may feel pulled between ambition and vulnerability, between showing up powerfully in the world and tending to old wounds that want your attention. This can be an uncomfortable but clarifying start to the week. The message is clear: true authority comes from emotional honesty. When you acknowledge where you still need care, you actually become more grounded and effective in your public life.</p>



<p>As the week continues, the focus sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and intensifying themes around professional relationships, long-term commitments, and the value you bring to the table. The second half of the week asks you to evaluate where your time, energy, and talents are going, and whether they’re being reciprocated in meaningful ways. This isn’t about chasing validation; it’s about alignment. You may feel less patient with superficial interactions and more drawn to connections that support your growth and legacy. Capricorn energy here reminds you that success isn’t just about achievement… it’s about building something you can stand behind with pride.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the solstice ushers in Capricorn season and activates your sector of higher learning, belief systems, and long-term vision, inviting you to zoom out and consider where you’re headed next. But this week doesn’t begin in purely practical territory. Just before the sun enters Capricorn, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional material in your subconscious and healing sector. Old fears, unspoken worries, or patterns you’ve kept buried may surface, especially around trusting yourself to move forward without having everything figured out. This square can feel disorienting, but it’s also liberating. You’re being asked to release limiting beliefs that have quietly shaped your decisions and to make room for a more compassionate inner narrative as you step into the next chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing clarity to what you want to commit to long-term. The second half of the week favors intentional planning, meaningful conversations about the future, and decisions that support growth beyond your comfort zone. You may feel drawn to travel plans, educational pursuits, or spiritual practices that offer both structure and inspiration. Rather than rushing, Capricorn energy encourages you to build your expansion thoughtfully. This is about choosing paths that feel both grounding and expansive — ones that honor your values while helping you grow beyond what’s familiar.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, cosmic beings, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with emotional depth and psychological insight. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to intimacy, shared resources, trust, and energetic exchange. But before that grounding takes hold, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tensions between your friendships, future goals, and deeper emotional wounds around belonging. You may notice sensitivities around who truly supports you, who drains you, and where you’ve overextended yourself socially or emotionally. This square can surface discomfort, but it’s also clarifying. It asks you to get honest about reciprocity, and to release group dynamics or obligations that no longer feel aligned as you prepare for a more intentional chapter.</p>



<p>As the week unfolds, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and deepening your desire for emotional and financial integrity. The second half of the week favors serious conversations around shared money, long-term commitments, or emotional boundaries. You may feel less inclined toward surface-level connection and more focused on building trust that’s earned, not assumed. Capricorn energy here supports mature intimacy — the kind that feels stabilizing rather than consuming. This solstice week reminds you that when your inner world is supported, your outer brilliance flows more freely.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> places relationships at the center of your attention. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your partnership sector is activated, bringing focus to commitment, collaboration, and emotional balance with others. Just before that shift, Jupiter in your sign squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your personal growth and professional or public-facing wounds. You may feel torn between honoring your emotional needs and showing up confidently in the world. Old insecurities around visibility or leadership could resurface, but they do so in order to be healed. This square asks you to trust that caring for yourself doesn’t weaken your ambition… it strengthens it.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and adding seriousness to your relationships. The second half of the week encourages you to assess which connections feel mutual, stable, and aligned with your long-term goals. You may feel less interested in keeping the peace at all costs and more committed to partnerships that offer real support. This is a powerful moment to redefine what commitment means to you: choosing relationships that feel grounding, respectful, and capable of growing with you.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> begins with a call to recalibrate your energy and priorities. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to work, health, routines, and the systems that hold your daily life together. But before that grounding fully settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating emotional material tied to rest, burnout, faith, and old beliefs about always having to be “on.” You may feel the tension between wanting to push forward and realizing your body or spirit needs more care. This is a powerful moment to listen to subtle signals — fatigue, irritation, or restlessness are all messages asking you to work <em>with</em> yourself, not against yourself.</p>



<p>As the week progresses, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing harmony and intentionality to your daily life. The second half of the week is ideal for refining habits, improving work dynamics, and committing to routines that support your long-term vitality. This isn’t about restriction… it’s about self-respect. You may feel more motivated to clean up your schedule, set clearer boundaries at work, or invest in practices that make you feel stronger and more capable. This solstice week reminds you that sustainable success starts with taking care of the engine that powers it all: you.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> activates themes of joy, creativity, and emotional honesty. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your sector of pleasure, romance, and self-expression comes into focus, inviting you to take what you love seriously. But just before that grounding energy settles in, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, surfacing deeper feelings around vulnerability, trust, and shared emotional or financial investments. You may notice where you’ve been over-giving, overthinking, or holding back out of fear of losing control. This square can stir discomfort, but it also offers healing clarity, especially around intimacy and what you truly need to feel safe opening your heart.</p>



<p>As the week continues, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing warmth, devotion, and maturity to matters of love and creativity. The second half of the week favors meaningful connection over casual interaction. Whether romantic or artistic, you’re drawn toward experiences that feel grounded, intentional, and worth investing in. This is a powerful time to commit to a passion project, deepen a relationship, or simply allow yourself to enjoy what you’ve worked so hard to build. The solstice reminds you that joy doesn’t have to be earned… it can be chosen.</p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “I said I was fine, but the body kept the receipts.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus turns inward to home, family, and emotional foundations. You’re craving comfort, stability, and maybe even a little nesting energy. But just before that grounding arrives, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, poking at the tension between your public image and your closest relationships. Translation: you might be killing it at work or showing up polished on the outside, while privately feeling misunderstood, under-supported, or low-key exhausted by certain dynamics. This could look like smiling through a family dinner you’d rather skip, or realizing you’ve been people-pleasing your way into burnout. The solstice asks you to be honest about where you actually need support instead of pretending you’ve got it all handled.</p>



<p>By midweek, the vibe shifts from emotional awareness to practical action. On December 24th, Venus, your ruling planet, enters Capricorn, joining the sun and Mars and turning your attention to what stability really looks like. The second half of the week is perfect for setting boundaries at home, having the “okay but how are we <em>actually</em> doing?” conversation, or making decisions that support your long-term peace, even if they’re not immediately popular. This is Capricorn energy with receipts: choosing rest over obligation, quality over quantity, and emotional safety over aesthetics. The glow-up here is subtle but powerful. You’re learning that balance isn’t about keeping everyone happy… it’s about creating a life that doesn’t drain you.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is delivering truths with zero fluff and no emotional cushioning. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your mind shifts into strategist mode. Communication, scheduling, boundaries, and logistics suddenly matter a lot more. But before you can fully enjoy the clarity, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring tension between your big-picture beliefs and the daily grind that’s been quietly wearing you down. You may realize you’ve been philosophizing your way around a very real problem, like saying “it’ll work out” instead of actually fixing your schedule, your habits, or your burnout. The solstice doesn’t judge you for this. It just hands you the clipboard and asks you to be honest.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves divine timing, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and upgrading your communication style from “intuitive and intense” to “clear, intentional, and impossible to misinterpret.” The second half of the week favors direct conversations, firm decisions, and cutting through emotional static. You’re less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in results. Think fewer dramatic monologues, more bullet points. This is a powerful moment to say what you mean, mean what you say, and stop entertaining dynamics that require you to over-function. Capricorn energy doesn’t ask you to be nicer — it asks you to be effective.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “freedom, but make it fiscally responsible.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to money, self-worth, and what you actually have to show for all those big ideas. But before you can fully lean into the budgeting era, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, stirring emotional stuff around shared resources, trust, and independence. You may notice a low-grade irritation about having to rely on someone else, or realizing you’ve been way too chill about an arrangement that deserves more structure. The solstice doesn’t cancel your optimism; it just asks you to back it up with a plan.</p>



<p>By the second half of the week, the tone sharpens. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and making it clear that your time, energy, and talents are not a charity. You’re more selective about how you spend your money and who gets access to you. This could look like saying no to last-minute plans, renegotiating financial terms, or finally admitting that “exposure” is not a currency. Capricorn energy here isn’t about being boring, it’s about valuing yourself enough to build something sustainable. The real freedom comes from knowing you’re not winging it anymore.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the solstice marks your official reset, and you feel it immediately. As the sun enters your sign on December 21st, the focus shifts back to <em>you</em>: your body, your boundaries, your identity, your direction. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, bringing up emotional tension between your public role and your private foundation. You may feel pulled between responsibility and vulnerability, between being “the strong one” and needing support yourself. Old family patterns or inner-child wounds could surface, not to derail you, but to remind you that leadership doesn’t mean emotional self-denial. This solstice asks you to define success in a way that includes your well-being, not just your output.</p>



<p>As the week continues, your presence sharpens. On December 24th, Venus enters your sign, joining the sun and Mars and adding magnetism, maturity, and seriousness to how you show up and what you attract. People notice you more now, but not because you’re performing. It’s because you’re embodied. The second half of the week is ideal for recommitting to yourself, refining your goals, and setting the tone for the year ahead. You may feel less interested in explaining yourself and more interested in alignment. The shadow here is over-identifying with productivity or carrying responsibility that isn’t yours. The power move? Choosing yourself without guilt. Capricorn Season doesn’t ask you to do more… it asks you to do what matters.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is giving “main character energy, but with emotional accountability.” As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, you slip into a quieter, more behind-the-scenes mode. This activates your rest, reflection, and subconscious sector, which already feels ironic given how visible your thoughts usually are. But before you can fully retreat, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, highlighting tension between your daily responsibilities and how you communicate your needs. You might realize you’ve been intellectually explaining your feelings instead of actually <em>feeling</em> them. Or pushing through exhaustion because “it’s fine.” The solstice gently (but firmly) calls that bluff.</p>



<p>Then, because the universe loves a slow burn, Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and reinforcing the message: rest is not optional, and boundaries are not rude. The second half of the week favors solitude with purpose: tying up loose ends, clearing emotional clutter, and quietly deciding what you’re no longer available for in 2026. This isn’t isolation; it’s preparation. Capricorn energy here asks you to stop leaking energy in places that don’t return it. You’re not disappearing…you’re conserving power. And honestly? That’s very on brand for the upgrade ahead.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-solstice-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">this solstice week</a> is quietly calling you out, in a loving, no-nonsense way. As the sun enters Capricorn on December 21st, your focus shifts to friends, community, and long-term goals. But before that clarity fully lands, Jupiter in Cancer squares Chiron in Aries, activating tension between joy, creativity, romance, and your relationship with money or self-worth. Translation: you might want to do what feels good, but there’s a voice reminding you that vibes alone don’t pay bills or sustain dreams. You could feel emotionally exposed around what you deserve versus what you’ve been settling for. The solstice doesn’t shame you for dreaming… it simply asks whether you’re willing to support those dreams with structure.</p>



<p>Then the tone firms up. Venus enters Capricorn on December 24th, joining the sun and Mars and bringing seriousness to your social life. The second half of the week is about discernment: who’s actually aligned with your future, and who’s just along for the ride? You may feel less available for emotional freeloading and more interested in connections that show up consistently. Capricorn energy here helps you mature your compassion, keeping your heart open without overextending yourself. You’re learning that boundaries don’t make you colder; they make your magic sustainable. And honestly? That’s the ultimate end-of-year glow up.</p>

rss,www.refinery29.com,https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/emma-mackey-jamie-lee-curtis-ella-mccay-trauma?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss,1766179814,"Emma Mackey & Jamie Lee Curtis On Grief, Trauma & What Comes Next","Emma Mackey & Jamie Lee Curtis On Grief, Trauma & What Comes Next

<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong>Is it actually possible to recover from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/inner-child-healing"">childhood trauma</a>, or will the effects linger forever? That’s the question <em>Ella McCay </em>asks, the new film from three-time Academy Award winner James L. Brooks (<em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>As Good as It Gets</em>). Following Ella McCay, played by Emma Mackey (<em>Barbie</em>, <em>Sex Education</em>), the 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles the grief of her mother’s death as well as a strained relationship with her father, with help from her caring Aunt Helen, played by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Jamie Lee Curtis (</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Freaky Friday</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">, <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>)</a>. </p>



<p>Ella exhibits signs of people-pleasing behaviour in both her work and personal life after watching her father repeatedly cheat on her mother. She seems doomed to repeat the cycle, trying her best to have a “normal” marriage with her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), which results in her overcompensating to make him happy. Principal psychologist <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carly Dober from Enriching Lives Psychology</a> tells <em>Refinery29</em> this could be due to a need to “establish a false sense of safety” and notes it’s a common trauma response. “People-pleasing can also be linked to emotional dependency. [This] occurs when someone has unmet psychological needs that they may try to satisfy within close interpersonal relationships,” Dober says. “[It] is a pattern of behaviours people may engage in to get others to like them, and to avoid rejection, criticism, or embarrassment. It’s linked to traits such as depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.”</p>



<p>Mackey confirms that <em>Ella McCay </em>is a study of the “human condition”, and tells us that’s partly what drew her to the role. “The film is very much about cycles and cycles being broken, or not in a few cases, and about what you decide to make of yourself,” Mackey tells <em>R29</em>. Throughout the film, her Aunt Helen acts like a driving force in her life, and calls out the behaviour of Ella’s husband. Mackey notes it can be “unsettling” to have somebody by your side pointing out flaws or truths you want to avoid, but in some ways, there’s a “comfort” to it as well. “She’s the truth sayer, and says the uncomfortable thing when I don’t want to hear it, and it’s absolutely spot on every time,” Mackey says. “And we all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and to make us think about it… and then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and make us think about it… then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.</p><cite>Emma MackeY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There’s one particular line in the family that gives audiences a closer look into Ella’s psyche, and that’s when she admits she adores her husband because he comes from a “normal family”. She deems it “normal” because his parents are still married, unlike Ella’s own experience. It’s telling that she prioritizes this above other traits he possesses, such as his manipulative tendencies. By making choices rooted in trauma, she’s ended up in the midst of another unhappy cycle. Curtis says these family dynamics and trauma portrayed in <em>Ella McCay</em> are what make this film feel so rooted in reality. “That’s what makes movies so relatable, and particularly family movies, is that you can sit there and watch a movie as a family and realise your family is different from the family you’re watching on screen, but there are a lot of similarities,” Curtis explains. “Hopefully, families have an Aunt Helen, that person in your life who champions you even though you’re getting battered.” </p>



<p>As difficult as it is to see Ella’s life crumble around her during the film, Mackey says it’s important to stumble at times so you can succeed in the future. “Unless you [stumble], you have no perspective, and you don’t know what’s important,” Mackey says. “You don’t want to seek or search what you’re curious about if you don’t stumble a couple of, or a lot of times.”</p>



<p>And while the drama-comedy tugs at the heartstrings, Curtis says she wants audiences to take away one thing. “There is no opposite word for trauma, but hope comes close,” she says, quoting the film. “That, to me, is where you understand that even with traumatic experiences, hope for the future, hope for your family, hope for the world, hope for potential. All of it comes pretty close to being a counterpoint to the bad things that have happened.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869365.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">LED face masks</a> are everywhere these days, but many seem more alike than not. It’s as if we have a <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> blue belt situation on our hands. So, when Shark Beauty unveiled its first foray in the skin tech space, I was intrigued — not only because I’m a fan of the brand, but because this wasn’t just <em>any</em> LED mask. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/cryoglow-tm-cooling-led-face-mask-P515543"">CryoGlow™ Cooling &amp; LED Face Mask</a> offers red and blue light therapy to help brighten, firm, and clear skin. However, it’s also equipped with cooling pads to depuff and wake up tired eyes. If that sounds like some seriously souped-up beauty tech, it’s because it is. Could this be the game-changer my routine needs? I set out to find out.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">Shark CryoGlow Under-Eye Cooling+LED Face Mask</a>, $349.99</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869244.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=756&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A189"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>What is Shark’s CryoGlow mask, and how do you use it?</strong></h2>



<p>Per the brand, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">CryoGlow face mask</a> was developed with dermatologists and clinical trials to back its claims of reducing the appearance of fine lines and reducing breakouts within weeks. It features something called iQLED Technology™ (aka, derm-developed treatment cycles of red, blue, and deep infrared light) distributed evenly throughout the inside of the mask. But as I hinted at earlier, perhaps the biggest point of differentiation is the Cryo-inspired cooling mechanism, which claims to visibly depuff the under-eye area post-use.</p>



<h2><strong>What makes Shark’s CryoGlow mask special?</strong></h2>



<p>My CryoGlow mask is a pretty shade of powder blue (it also comes in a muted lilac), with a matching satin pouch for storage. I love that it powers up via a remote control instead of an app. (Call me old school, but I miss the days when we didn’t have an app for <em>everything</em>.) You can cycle through four different treatments for various concerns  — acne, fine lines, a four-min express treatment, and one focused on tightening and brightening the under-eye area — which combine infrared light and red and blue LEDs (plus those cooling pads, which feel like heaven for tired, puffy eyes), so you can tailor your session based on what your skin is craving that day. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951829.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Is Shark’s CryoGlow mask worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>At $350, it’s among the more affordable LED masks I’ve seen —  it’s still expensive but solidly less so than other popular ones on the market. (For comparison, <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/spectralite-faceware-pro-P435378?skuId=2109718&amp;icid2="">Dr. Dennis Gross’ version</a> retails for $455, <a href=""https://us.currentbody.com/products/currentbody-skin-led-light-therapy-mask?variant=41833057157217"">CurrentBody’s Series 2</a> is $470, and <a href=""https://www.revolve.com/therabody-theraface-mask/dp/TRAG-WU16/"">Therabody</a>’s is $650. Hollywood aesthetician <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/shani-darden-by-deesse-pro-led-light-mask-P502216"">Shani Darden</a> launched an LED mask that retails for a whopping $1900.) The full-face mask feels durable but is shockingly lightweight, making it among the most comfortable ones I’ve tried, too. </p>



<p>I first started testing this mask out as part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding skin prep</a>, and now that I’m six months post-wedding (and almost an entire year into testing this out), I have to say: It’s still one of the most effective steps in my entire beauty routine. My biggest skin goals right now are keeping acne flareups at bay, enhancing my overall glow, and reducing inflammation. In the past, I’ve struggled with consistency in using LED masks, so they didn’t do a whole lot for me. My consensus now is that they can be a great addition to your skincare routine — but only if you commit. (It’s like sunscreen, in that sense: The best one is the one you’ll use everyday.) </p>



<p>Another unexpected benefit of LED masks that I don’t think gets talked about enough has nothing to do with skin. After weeks of carving out time at the end of my day for some LED therapy, I realized that it had become something I genuinely looked forward to, just to get a few minutes of not doing anything else. Sure, sometimes I’d scroll through Instagram while sitting through an eight-minute treatment, but most days, I’d just lay on my couch cuddling my dog (he doesn’t mind one bit that I’m giving <em>Iron Man</em>), or even close my eyes for a little meditative moment. The fact that I have healthier, happier skin to show for it? Simply a (really good) bonus.</p>

<p>Rejoice! The last days of 2025 bring the onset of Capricorn season. On December 21st, the sun officially enters Capricorn and it’ll be a potent moment of contemplation, meditation, deliberation, and aspiration. The reason is that we are entering the coldest time of the year, as the Winter Solstice marks the beginning of a new season on the same day the sun enters Capricorn. The start of Yule connects us with friends and families to celebrate the past year and look forward to the future. At this juncture, we can start <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifesting our dreams</a> by expressing our heartfelt intentions, which catapult us into the place and space we wish to be. </p>



<p>Since Capricorn energy is associated with working hard to make our desires come to fruition, we often put our best foot forward to seize the day at the office. Usually, we become rigid in our efforts to become the next CEO, get the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-flight-risk-job-promotion"">promotion we deserve</a>, or elevate our status. Capricorn energy climbs the corporate ladder with ease, skipping steps or resorting to manipulative tactics to win. Success is due to our tenacity in evolving and our desire for accolades. The goal of the month is to take charge and be a boss. Working hard is a must, but so too is playing hard. </p>



<p>With Capricorn season coinciding with a new year, we have hope and the incentive to start anew, recognizing that we can refine structure to improve situations and relationships. As a result of this thinking, we begin to discuss the concept of time and how much we can accomplish in the weeks ahead to leave a lasting legacy over the twelve months. It’s not that the vibe makes us competitive per se, it’s that we want to prove our power to the world to gain accolades and respect from those we care about. Building an empire and committing to projects that speak to our spirit define our lives — so grab your inner sea goat by the horns! </p>



<p>Capricorn is one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. They are the watery part of the Earth because they reside in both the ocean and on land. The sea goat has a very tender heart and will go to bat for anyone in their inner circle. They have an austere reputation due to their no-nonsense and mature attitude. Capricorn energy can be highly intuitive because it helps us align more closely with our gut feelings. In the weeks ahead, we will be able to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust our opinions and instincts</a>, knowing that we are choosing the right path for ourselves, even when we are torn between options. After a moment of reflection, we will be able to find guidance within.</p>



<p>This year, Capricorn season brings us face-to-face with our last chance to learn from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn in Pisces</a>. The karmic planet is going to be changing signs during Aquarius season, which is coming up, so we need to wrap up the story that we’ve been perpetuating over the past three years. Being that Saturn is the planetary ruler of Capricorn, it’s for us to see how we’ve grown since March 2023. When Saturn leaves Pisces for the next 27 years on February 13th, 2026, it will bring a major vibe shift. Consider how we can cultivate our spirituality, establish firmer boundaries with others, and commit to what we genuinely love. </p>



<p>The overall energy is quieter than in previous years, allowing us to heal and relax. Finding peace and solace in our hearts and lives will allow us to find serenity. It would be great to have a calm entrance into the new year, so we can take the proper steps to propel our passions forward. </p>
