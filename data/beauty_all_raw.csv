<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958724.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I can pinpoint the exact moment I knew I had to do something about my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10865365/masseter-reduction-botox-cost-effects"">jaw pain</a>. It was my birthday, and a friend cracked a joke so good that half the drinks on the table toppled as everyone doubled over laughing. I, meanwhile, could barely move my mouth; smiling, talking, even laughing felt like lifting weights with my face.  </p>



<p>That’s why I owe a lot to a beauty editor friend of mine, who told me she’d been in the same boat — and that masseter Botox, injected into the masseter muscle along the lower jaw, had completely changed her life.  </p>



<p>Within hours of talking to her, I’d booked an appointment with the injector she swore by, and a week later, I could eat, speak, and laugh again without my jaw snapping shut. The pain and tension — probably from stress-induced teeth clenching — had vanished, and I finally felt human again. But as I enjoyed my newfound freedom, I noticed a subtle change in my face. It had a slightly more oval shape, and I’m convinced the skin along my jaw felt a little looser than before. My experience isn’t unique — but it does raise some important questions. </p>



<h2>What is masseter Botox, and what are the benefits and downsides? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/preventative-botox-wrinkles-scam-myth"">While Botox</a> — a purified neurotoxin — is widely used for smoothing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-gf-solution-serum-review"">fine lines and wrinkles</a> by relaxing the muscles underneath the skin, more experts are recommending it as a solution for jaw pain, clenching, teeth grinding, tension, and clicking. Conversation around it is booming. On TikTok, the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/tag/masseterbotox?lang=en"">hashtag #masseterbotox</a> has amassed 158 million views and counting, with both experts and patients sharing their experiences. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As searches for masseter Botox increase, many people are also googling whether it can cause jowls.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href=""https://nycfacedoc.com/"">Dr. Moustafa Mourad, MD, FACS</a>, a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and masseter Botox expert, who did not perform my treatment, describes it first and foremost as a treatment with real functional benefits: “An aesthetic effect is a secondary bonus,” says Dr. Mourad. “Masseter Botox can be incredibly helpful for patients who clench or grind their teeth, deal with chronic jaw tension, or feel jaw pain and fatigue by the end of the day,” he adds. “By relaxing an overactive masseter, we’re reducing the force transmitted through the jaw and teeth, which often translates into less pain, less tightness, and fewer tension headaches.” </p>



<p>But it would be remiss not to acknowledge the aesthetics of it all. Dr. Mourad confirms that masseter Botox can reduce muscle volume. “When it’s done thoughtfully, this can create a more tapered lower face, which is why it’s popular in patients with true masseter hypertrophy,” he says — essentially an enlarged jaw muscle that affects the natural shape of your face. In my case, I had been grinding my teeth for so long that my masseter had become large and strong, giving my jawline a sharper, more rigid appearance.  </p>



<h2>Can masseter Botox give you jowls?  </h2>



<p>A more oval face isn’t the only change I noticed. I’m almost certain that masseter Botox contributed to a very slight shift in skin texture, making it look and feel a little looser — something I picked up on myself, rather than anything anyone else noticed. To the naked eye, the change was very minimal, but I’m not alone in this observation. As searches for masseter Botox increase, more people are also googling whether it can cause “jowls” or sagging skin along the jawline.</p>



<p>Dr. Mourad tells me that “jowling” after masseter Botox is not caused by Botox damaging the skin: “Rather, it is related to changes in facial support over time,” he explains. Loose skin isn’t something Dr. Mourad typically sees after one, two, or even three treatments. “It is more commonly seen in patients who have been receiving masseter Botox chronically over many years,” he tells me, adding that it’s only with sustained relaxation that true muscle shrinkage can potentially change the shape of the lower face. “[In this case], instead of a more defined, angular jaw contour, the lower face may appear softer and rounder,” he says. </p>



<p>In fact, Dr. Mourad notes that he usually only sees looser skin after masseter Botox in patients who already have existing skin laxity or are experiencing age-related collagen loss — a completely normal part of aging. In other words, the Botox itself is rarely, if ever, the cause.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958793.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of jowls can be minimized with careful planning and restraint.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>If jowls develop after masseter Botox, can they be reversed? </h2>



<p>Unlike filler, which you can dissolve if you don’t like it, Botox can’t be undone. It does wear off eventually, and the muscle goes back to normal, but that can take up to six months. Dr. Mourad says that as the muscle returns, some support can come back, too, which has been the case in my experience. With chronic atrophy, though, it could leave the lower face looking rounder and loose skin more noticeable.  </p>



<p>If you’re concerned, it’s worth seeing a qualified injector who really knows their stuff. Dr. Mourad says that in many cases, the risk of loose skin can be minimized with careful planning and restraint. “I am very deliberate about dosing and treatment frequency,” he says, stressing the importance of not over-weakening the muscle, spacing treatments properly, and reassessing the face over time. </p>



<p>He also evaluates each patient’s facial structure and the quality of their skin on their lower face before recommending long-term masseter Botox treatment. “In some patients, especially those who are aging or already showing early jowling, I will limit the use of masseter Botox or recommend alternative approaches to managing jaw pain that do not contribute to progressive muscle atrophy,” he adds. </p>



<p>If you’re committed to masseter Botox but have noticed some skin sagging and want to address it, Dr. Mourad suggests considering other treatments, like jawline filler or skin-tightening options <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">such as lasers</a>. </p>



<h2>Besides jowls, are there other long-term side effects of masseter Botox?  </h2>



<p>Dr. Mourad says that most other side effects of masseter Botox are mild and temporary, but it must be performed by a qualified injector. “Patients may experience localized soreness, swelling, or bruising, and some notice temporary difficulty chewing very hard foods as the muscle weakens,” he explains. Less common, but still possible — especially in underqualified hands — is the toxin spreading into nearby muscles, which can lead to temporary asymmetry, like a slightly altered smile, he adds. </p>



<p>While Dr. Mourad is a big fan of masseter Botox treatment — especially for relieving pain and tension — he emphasizes the importance of using it thoughtfully. “It should be revisited regularly, and not approached as an indefinite routine maintenance treatment,” he concludes. </p>



<p>I’ll definitely try masseter Botox again. We’re living in a stressful world, and for me, teeth grinding has become part of the deal. Next time, though, I’ll ask for a lighter touch — and work harder at managing my stress. Any subtle changes to my face shape are a trade-off I’ll take over the pain of constant clenching; like most treatments, it’s about weighing up the pros and cons. And yes, I’d still recommend it. It can be truly life-changing.</p>

It’s inspired by floriography, the Victorian-era art of using flowers to send secret messages. The violet is particularly layered, signaling both passion and strength. It makes sense, then, that Violette 30 packs a punch. Powdery violet, lush rose, all-encompassing incense, and heady patchouli make it a scent that demands attention, while delicate white tea and creamy cedarwood linger softly on the skin as the day goes on. <br /><br /><strong>Le Labo</strong> Violette 30 Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fviolette-30-eau-de-parfum%2F8802119%3F"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1104"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1328&amp;height=1104&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=83:69"" width=""1328"" /><figcaption><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fsublime-eau-de-toilette%2F8754105"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tory Burch Sublime Eau de Toilette, $138 <br /></a></h2><br />If you think you don’t like floral fragrances, this will make you think twice.

<p>When <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">Bad Bunny</a> leaped off the Levi’s Stadium field in Santa Clara, California, ending his 13-minute <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/02/10868981/super-bowl-2022-halftime-show-racism"">Super Bowl halftime show</a> chanting the lyrics of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9T_MGfzq7I&amp;list=RDv9T_MGfzq7I&amp;start_radio=1"">DtMF</a>,” the stadium erupted in fireworks. More than 2,800 miles away in Orlando, Florida, I saw the sky outside my window light up, too, flashing in brief bursts of color. In a city with one of the largest Puerto Rican populations in the contiguous U.S., some shop-owners shut their doors early so they could catch the show together with their families, others kept the lights on well into the night to host sold-out Benito Bowl watch parties, and others took to neighborhood roads, dancing with friends under street lights or illuminating entire neighborhoods with light shows. From the rolling hills of northwest California to the low wetlands of the Southeast U.S., we, distant neighbors, celebrated like patriots commemorating our beginning — because, for the millions of us who trace our histories across the American continent, we were.</p>



<p>For the estimated <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/life/2026/02/09/how-many-people-watch-the-halftime-show-2026-bad-bunny/88589346007/"">135.4 to 142 million viewers</a> who tuned in globally — figures that would make Bad Bunny’s halftime show the most-watched in history — it was an invitation to reclaim what it means to be an American, an identity and inheritance that for too long has been hegemonized by the U.S., even though it belongs to an entire continent.</p>



<p>After an energetic performance of a medley of hits like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr8K88UcO0s&amp;list=RDCr8K88UcO0s&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IFRpdMOtIE1lIFByZWd1bnRvoAcB"">Tití Me Pregunto</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtSRKwDCaZM&amp;list=RDGtSRKwDCaZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUYYmFkIGJ1bm55IFlvIFBlcnJlbyBTb2xhoAcB"">Yo Perreo Sola</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCQ_6XbATPc&amp;list=RDjCQ_6XbATPc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygURYmFkIGJ1bm55IFNhZmFlcmGgBwE%3D"">Safaera</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9XrXnfJPsk&amp;list=RDG9XrXnfJPsk&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUPYmFkIGJ1bm55IFBhcnR5oAcB"">Party</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;list=RDX2MGCIDOMZ4&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUeYmFkIGJ1bm55IFZveSBhIExsZXZhcnRlIFBhIFBSoAcB"">Voy a Llevarte Pa PR</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myDIeOjqQos&amp;list=RDmyDIeOjqQos&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUNYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVvT6AHAQ%3D%3D"">EoO</a>,” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;list=RD_PJvpq8uOZM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUQYmFkIGJ1bm55IE1vbmFjb6AHAQ%3D%3D"">Monaco</a>,” to name a few, Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, ended his performance invoking “God Bless America.” It was the first English words he uttered during a halftime show that was historic, in part, because it was the first in the NFL’s 60-year run to ever be performed predominantly in Spanish. With the flags of Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., among others, waving behind him, the Puerto Rican rapper then went on to name countries across the Caribbean and South, Central, and North Americas. When he ended with “my motherland, mi patria, Puerto Rico,” he cemented his performance, like a victorious touchdown, with a football stamped with the words, “Together, We Are America.” It was a message for all of us, those who have always traced their roots to the region, those who arrived centuries ago, violently and forcefully, on ships, and those who, generation after generation, have migrated to this corner of the world carrying a dream.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958687.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 8: Bad Bunny performs in the Apple Music Halftime Show during the NFL Super Bowl 60 football game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, at Levi’s Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>The words, the flags, and the faces of racially and ethnically diverse people encircling the Grammy award-winning artist sent a message to President Donald Trump and the ultra-conservative, who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-maga-backlash"">boycotted Bad Bunny’s halftime show</a> because of the rapper’s cultural identity and pro-immigrant politics: America is a continent, and his rendering of “God bless America” is a prayer for the people of every nation that stretches across it, not just the white U.S. citizens who have long positioned themselves as the primary beneficiaries of the label and land.</p>



<p>Transitioning to his native tongue to complete the blessing, like any other Latine church kid who speaks in English but prays in Spanish, Martínez Ocasio intoned an even more important invocation for migrants and their descendants: “seguimos aquí” — “we are still here” — a popular Puerto Rican refrain that marks our survival, presence, and refusal amid generations of political and natural disasters. </p>



<p>Some who boycotted the performance tuned into an alternative halftime entertainment event, the “All-American Halftime Show,” organized by the conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA. It aired live online at the same time as the NFL’s official halftime show, explicitly positioned as a protest of Bad Bunny’s performance. Roughly five million viewers (a fraction of the audience that watched Benito Bowl) tuned in to watch little-known country and rock artists like Kid Rock, Brantley Gilbert, Lee Brice, and Gabby Barrett. To them, Martínez Ocasio’s identity as a Puerto Rican artist, his use of his native Spanish, and his belief that “the only thing more powerful than hate is love” were framed as a threat to white American notions of “faith, family, and freedom.” </p>



<p>Ironically, it is the people of Puerto Rico, a U.S. colonial territory, who have been calling for freedom since the U.S. seized the archipelago in 1898. Their cries reverberated throughout Bad Bunny’s performance. </p>



<p>Bad Bunny commenced his historic performance with a stage set evoking Puerto Rican history, beginning with the brutal legacy of Spanish imperialism on the island. A man wearing a pava hat — the traditional hat of Puerto Rican agricultural workers, lovingly called jíbaros — strums the opening notes of “Tití Me Preguntó” and declares, “Qué rico es ser Latino.” Behind him stand sugarcane fields, where enslaved Africans and Indigenous Taínos as well as poor criollos once labored, enriching the pockets of the island’s first colonizers and giving rise to a shared Puerto Rican identity rooted in communal power and resistance to colonial systems.</p>



<p>Seconds later, Bad Bunny’s baritone resonates across the fields. Dressed in a cream collared shirt and tie, a sport-inspired jersey bearing his family name, Ocasio, and the number 64 (representing the birth year of his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio), and his signature BadBo 1.0 Adidas sneakers, he is flanked by actors: some, wearing pava hats, embody those Puerto Rican farmworkers of the past, while others dress in modern farmwear, portraying the contemporary Latine laborers who continue to toil across the harsh agricultural landscapes of the U.S. All of them hold machetes, a tool once wielded by formerly enslaved people to revolt against colonizers across the Caribbean.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958686.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>TOPSHOT – Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny performs during Super Bowl LX Patriots vs Seahawks Apple Music Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California on February 8, 2026.

<p>As he dances through the sugarcane fields, Bad Bunny brings us with him to modern-day Puerto Rico. Vendors sell coco frio, welitos play dominos, Black and brown women adorn themselves at a nail salon, and workers continue to rebuild after the devastation of Hurricane María. Benito then cools off from the blazing Caribbean sun with a piragua and tacos from the beloved L.A. taco shop, Villas Tacos, a nod to the street vendors across California and the U.S. who have been targeted and harassed amid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdowns. </p>



<p>Some of the scenes he portrays are painful, but there’s joy in his resistance and power in our cultural art forms and entertainment. Watching Bad Bunny evade punches from Puerto Rican boxer Xander Zayas and Mexican boxer Emiliano Vargas evokes the pride our families feel in our living rooms, watching our people represent us in sport. Seeing Latine artists like Cardi B, Karol G, Pedro Pascal, Young Miko, and Jessica Alba dancing en la casita — a life-size replica of a traditional pink Puerto Rican house that Bad Bunny has used as a stage during his historic 31-day <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">“No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí residency”</a> in Puerto Rico and on his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour to symbolize a pari de marquesina, those Caribbean garage parties nostalgic to so many of us — summons us to move through the structural violence we continue to endure with dance, too, just as our ancestors did. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958682.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Musician Bad Bunny performs during the Apple Music halftime show at the NFL Super Bowl LX football game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots at Levi Stadium on February 8, 2026 in Santa Clara, California.

<p>But instead of bomba and plena, traditional Afro-Puerto Rican musical genres born from protest and community, women in khaki miniskorts shake their asses as Bad Bunny raps the lyrics to his reggaeton hit “Yo Perreo Sola,” a song about bodily autonomy, independence, and the right to dance without harassment. “Las mujeres en el mundo entero, perreando sin miedo,” he says, assuring women everywhere they have the space to move freely and safely in the show he’s created. Bad Bunny then transitions smoothly into “Safaera,” where we, global fans, sing the words to a sexually explicit, and empowered, song he can’t rap on the largest stage in the world: “Si tu novio no te mama,” he sings, as countless viewers yell back, “el culo, pa eso que no mame. Baja pa casa que yo te lambo toa. Mami, yo te lambo toa.”</p>



<p>Welcoming millions of watchers to “la fiesta más grande en el mundo entero,” Bad Bunny knows his halftime performance will break streaming records. He has shattered records throughout his career, becoming <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-bad-bunny-top-artist-album/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spotify’s most-streamed artist worldwide</a> in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2025 and <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-breaks-record-most-watched-amazon-music-stream-1235432020/"">surpassing Amazon Music’s live-streamed concerts</a> during his “No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí: Una Más” finale. That’s because, as the world now knows, no one parties quite like folks from the Caribbean. There is protest, resilience, and freedom in the dips, sways, and wines that <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-calls-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show/story?id=129980124"">Trump labeled “disgusting.”</a> And through his performance of “VOY A LLeVARTE PA PR,” the Grammy award-winning “EoO,” and a medley tribute to reggaeton pioneers like Tego Calderón, Don Omar, and Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny invites the world to perrear como una puertorriqueña, to learn history and dance through Puerto Rican rhythms. </p>



<p>Ahead of his halftime show, Bad Bunny emphasized that language wouldn’t be a barrier to enjoying his performance. Speaking with Apple Music Radio hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden at the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/06/nx-s1-5563906/bad-bunny-super-bowl-performance-predictions"">Super Bowl LX Halftime Show Press Conference</a>, Martínez Ocasio urged those who’d be watching to dance from the heart, to relish a “heartbeat dance” — and heart was at the center of the entire show. </p>



<p>There was the moment Bad Bunny stared into a camera, pointed at the viewers watching from television sets, laptop screens, and portable projectors, and encouraged them to always believe in themselves because they are worth more than they know. There was the couple, kissing after “I do” in a white wedding gown and tuxedo, who <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47872442/bad-bunny-super-bowl-lx-half-wedding"">legally married during the halftime show</a>. There was Lady Gaga, one of Bad Bunny’s favorite artists, and Los Sobrinos, a Puerto Rican band who played on his most recent album, <em><a href=""https://music.apple.com/us/album/deb%C3%AD-tirar-m%C3%A1s-fotos/1787022393"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</a></em>, performing a salsa rendition of “Die With a Smile” as the newlyweds shared their wedding cake. And when Bad Bunny returned to the mic, there were moments of cross-generational care. First, while singing his hit “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Femq4NPxs&amp;list=RDa1Femq4NPxs&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUbYmFkIGJ1bm55IEJBSUxFIElOb0xWSURBQkxFoAcB"">BAILE INoLVIDABLE</a>,” he gently woke a child sleeping on two seats, an experience every Latine who grew up going to family parties that stretch well into the night knows. Then, during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5V5WZVcVE&amp;list=RDKU5V5WZVcVE&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUTYmFkIGJ1bm55IE51ZXZhIFlvbKAHAQ%3D%3D"">Nueva Yol</a>,” he gifted a child his Album of the Year Grammy trophy, kneeling to the ground, and whispering to him, “Cree siempre en ti.” The boy symbolizes Bad Bunny’s own inner child, Latine youth across the diaspora, and, perhaps, even <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/administration-seeking-expedited-removal-5-year-family-rep/story?id=129918648"">Liam Conejo Ramos</a>, the five-year-old Ecuadorian boy who was detained by ICE in Minnesota while coming home from school.</p>

<p>But Martínez Ocasio’s heart danced most passionately for his homeland — and for Puerto Ricans, whose population in the contiguous U.S. outnumbers that in the archipelago, home is often experienced differently, though no less authentically, throughout the diaspora. In “Nueva Yol,” Benito takes us to a Puerto Rican neighborhood in the Big Apple, with Puerto Rican flags hanging from store windows, women braiding each other’s hair outside of a barber shop, Brooklyn’s own Toñita, the beloved owner of the community anchor Caribbean Social Club, handing him a shot of rum, and Boricuas of every shade dancing in the street to a genre their Nuyorican ancestors co-created. </p>



<p>Ricky Martin then takes us back to Puerto Rico, now to the rural mountains, where he reinterprets Ocasio Martínez’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;list=RDuvfDaZ4ZT80&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUgYmFkIGJ1bm55IExvIFF1ZSBQYXPDsyBlbiBIYXdhaWmgBwE%3D"">Lo Que Pasó en Hawaii</a>,” a protest song against U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico and a call to its people to fight to preserve land, heritage, and culture at a time when tourism-driven colonial pressures aim to reshape the island. When Bad Bunny returns to the mic, it’s to perform “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdQEljUMCEM&amp;list=RDQdQEljUMCEM&amp;start_radio=1&amp;pp=ygUUYmFkIGJ1bm55IEVsIEFwYWfDs26gBwE%3D"">El Apagón</a>,” a sharply political song that uses the debilitating power outages in Puerto Rico to critique government corruption and displacement. Carrying a Puerto Rican flag and, at one point, scaling a sparking utility pole, Bad Bunny, through the song, urges Puerto Ricans to fight for the future and sovereignty of their land and people.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958688.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /><figcaption>SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA – FEBRUARY 08: Bad Bunny performs onstage during the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show at Levi’s Stadium on February 08, 2026 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as the music shifts from electro-reggaeton to plena, traditional Puerto Rican folk music, Bad Bunny extends his call. Walking off a set design of Puerto Rico that, in itself, should garner awards, and symbolically into the homes of those watching across the Americas, he names each country that makes up the Caribbean, South America, Central America, and North America — urging us all to reimagine American-ness, no longer restricted to the U.S.’s linguistic hegemony or make-believe colonial borders. Bound by shared histories, cultures, and resilience, he invites us to claim belonging and community that transcends nation-states and challenges centuries of imposed divisions.</p>



<p>This, of course, is the greatest threat to the ultra-right. It’s why Turning Point produced the All-American Halftime Show. It fears not just Bad Bunny but what his artistry is capable of: reimagination. </p>



<p>Through history, education, joy, dance, pleasure, and love, Bad Bunny’s music allows us to envision another reality — one where we, as marginalized people, understand our power and our worth, and where we fight lovingly for our undocumented neighbor in the house next door and for those enduring state repression in neighboring countries. </p>



<p>This is the cross-continental America we can create, the one where solidarity, justice, and dignity prevail for all of us, the one worth putting our hearts into and illuminating our skies for. After all, as Martínez Ocasio noted in a jumbotron during his final performance: “the only thing more powerful than hate is love.” <br /></p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958068.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>From the very beginning, <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sabrinaelba/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sabrina Elba</a></strong> has been clear about who she is creating for. In this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em> sponsored by <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and its Black History Month collection, which spotlights Black founders building with community in mind, the <strong><a href=""https://sablelabs.co/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22847971116&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAoySwxa6rLOwHWVWAJcsScPLRC9lL&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1czLBhDhARIsAIEc7uj5Kp50Tl2ZVUdqaZx83ZYTNqfBs6Q8LybIEocgYKH2ipcnetAgRzsaAsi-EALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">S’ABLE Labs</a></strong> co-founder breaks down what it means to build beauty intentionally, ethically, and with communities of color at the center rather than the margins.</p>



<p>At the heart of Elba’s approach is what she calls “A beauty,” a term rooted in African beauty knowledge passed down across generations. “It’s the passing down of knowledge, traditions, ingredients, customs, throughout the whole continent of Africa,” she explains. That history is not just inspiration. It is a framework for how she builds. African botanicals like shea, Black soap, and rooibos come from some of the world’s harshest climates, which Elba says makes them especially powerful for skincare. For Elba, purpose lives in how those ingredients are used, not just where they come from. </p>



<p>Purpose also shows up in how those ingredients are formulated. Elba is intentional about pairing traditional African botanicals with modern skincare science, creating products designed to support melanin-rich skin without irritation. “Everything is fragrance free,” she says. “I don’t want to irritate skin that has gone through it.” Her philosophy reflects a belief that starting with more sensitive, inflammation-prone skin leads to better products overall.</p>



<p>That mindset was shaped by personal experience. As a teenager, Elba struggled with products that damaged her skin barrier and failed to meet her needs. “It’s part of the reason I’m so frustrated with the beauty industry, frustrated enough to start a brand,” she says. Rather than adapting to what existed, she chose to build something new with intention.</p>



<p>Elba’s purpose extends beyond formulation into how her brand operates. As a UN Goodwill Ambassador, she brings the same care to sourcing, working directly with farming communities across Africa and prioritizing transparency, fair wages, and safe working conditions. “If a product doesn’t tell you where those ingredients are coming from, we need to question that,” she says. It is an approach that aligns closely with Target’s <em>Made With Purpose</em> initiative, where ethical practices are treated as essential, not optional.</p>



<p>The beauty founder also pushes back on the narrow way Black-founded brands are often framed. “You haven’t created a Black product,” she says. “You’ve created a better product period.” Starting with communities of color, she argues, raises the bar for the entire industry.</p>



<p>Listen to the full <em>Go Off, Sis</em> episode to hear Elba chat with Senior Content Director of Entertainment at Refinery29/Unbothered, Kathleen Newman-Bremang, Brand Partnerships Lead at Unbothered, Sandy Pierre, and Social Strategist at Unbothered, Jessika Hardy, about African beauty knowledge, clean formulation, and why the industry still has catching up to do.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958198.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>In the midst of all the chaos going on in the world, it’s nice to know that Venus in Pisces is bringing us a fairytale vibe. Venus in Pisces, which lasts from February 10th to March 6th 2026, is pulling out all the lovely stops, allowing us to feel confident in ourselves as well as relationships (both platonic and romantic). This is a moment of gentleness. We are finding solace and comfort through intimacy in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-lookbook-editor-letter-2025"">the depths of winter</a>. Whether we’re involved with others or not, it’ll be easy to feel the warmth and kindness regardless.</p>



<p>Venus in Pisces is in its “exaltation,” meaning the position of the planet in the water sign is favorable. The reason Venus thrives in Pisces is that the planet yearns to be unconditional, adaptable, tender, and creative. Venus in Pisces is all that and more — encouraging people to be forgiving and sacrificing for others. This transit encourages us to lead with the heart, ask questions later, and to understand those we care about through compassion. At times, Venus in Pisces can make us idealistic, but it’s only that we want to believe in the fantasy we set in our minds about what partnerships should be and look like. Anything less than that won’t suffice.  </p>



<p>On occasion, Venus in Pisces can be a tad mischievous, since the water sign is a mutable sign and absorbs the energy around it. People could take advantage of our goodwill, demanding more without reciprocating, and in turn, pushing us to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">call for boundaries.</a> Therefore, we have to be careful about what we allow in our lives and the quality of people we associate with. Be mindful of those who aren’t serving us anymore. </p>



<p>This time around, Venus in Pisces encourages us to be dreamy and artistic. Eclipse season and Mercury retrograde cross paths with Venus in Pisces, pushing us to focus on camaraderie and self-care more than anything else. Aligning with partners that are on the same page won’t be hard, although our desires are currently evolving and in flux. Three major aspects are essential to defining how Venus in Pisces will affect us. Fortunately, the North Node of Destiny, Jupiter, and Uranus are cultivating greatness for everyone. </p>



<p>Embrace switching up your style, if you want to. If you do, then use the weeks before February 26th, when Mercury turns retrograde, to ensure no regrets.</p>



<p>On February 17th, the same day as the Lunar New Year and annular solar eclipse in Aquarius, Venus aligns with the North Node of Destiny in Pisces. The karmic moment makes us more passionate and optimistic about relationships. Our confidence is high, pushing us to shoot our shot when it comes to asking out our crush, evolving commitments, and trying a new approach to dating. Since we’re feeling ourselves, we will not shy away from being bold and experimenting with different styles of expression, even acting through a leap of faith and believing the best in those we care about, regardless <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dating-red-flags"">of the red flags</a>.</p>



<p>Venus and Jupiter in Cancer bring luck on February 22nd. Both planets are two of the “greater benefics,” bringing positive energy and favorable news. Together, they can refine our ethics, promise abundance, offer security, and intensify our rizz. It encourages us to strive for the good life. We must listen to our gut. Intuition can be a lifesaver — now, more than ever. </p>



<p>Uranus in Taurus adds a streak of wildness and excitement to Venus’s cosmic mix on March 4th. If a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-situationship-relationship-dating-lessons"">situationship isn’t working</a>, we aren’t going to allow it to bring us down. We’ll break out and be free, helping us soar on the wings of love with someone who is worthy of our time. This could also mean that we are dating against our type to insert freshness into dating. And we lived happily ever after? Fingers crossed!</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11958552.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>We know where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/196438/nina-simone-rock-hall-induction-beyonce-tribute-lauryn-hill-sister-rosetta-tharpe"">Nina Simone</a> stood on political and social issues because she told us, vehemently, loudly, and often. She told us in her music with songs like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ25-U3jNWM"">Mississippi Goddamn</a>” and her cover of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-vBga68Xdc"">Strange Fruit</a>,” two songs about lynching and the brutalization of Black folks during the civil rights era. Simone made art like her purpose was pulsing through her, coursing through her veins and embedded in her bloodstream. It spilled out because it had to, she <em>had</em> to tell the world how she saw it and how it ought to be. <a href=""https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/04/the-radical-politics-of-nina-simone"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">She told us explicitly</a> through quotes like the one that’s been making its rounds on social media lately: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times,” Simone said in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99V0mMNf5fo"">an interview from the ‘60s</a><em>. </em>“How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</p>



<p>The quote has been used so much it’s been flattened into a meme and lost some of its impact. But it’s never been more true that there are few artists in 2026 who are as committed to reflecting the times. Sixty years after Simone, then one of  the most notable singers in the world, used her voice to denounce systemic racism, critique capitalism, and unequivocally support the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/190444/black-panther-movies"">Black Panthers</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/black-panther-style"">Black Power movement</a>, it’s hard to imagine more than a couple famous singers of her stature being as specific, bold, and unflinching in their activism and political outspokenness — within their music and outside of it. Silence is the standard. Sure, there are a few exceptions and after the Grammys, when multiple artists did speak out against <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/205854/abolish-ice-origins-twitter-undocumented-immigrants"">ICE (the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)</a>, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-2026-bad-bunny-political-references-halftime-show-11487269"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny’s blistering Super Bowl performance,</a> the energy seems to have shifted slightly. <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-grammy-boy/story?id=129980775"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTCn2cmfEgA"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kehlani</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/best-new-artist-grammys-lost-brits-1236174909/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Dean,</a> <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2026-02-04/shaboozey-responds-grammys-speech-backlash"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shaboozey</a>, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/sza-ice-grammys-1236170851/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SZA</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Eilish</a> all used their platforms at the Grammys to talk about how <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/presidential-debate-trump-harris-immigration"">ICE is dehumanizing immigrants</a> and terrorizing American communities. </p>



<p>To varying degrees of eloquence and effectiveness, these artists attempted to meet the moment at the Grammys, which came just a week after anti-ICE demonstrations erupted across the U.S. to protest the killings of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-transformed-federal-immigration-alex-pretti-renee-good-rcna256032"">Renee Good and Alex Pretti</a> in Minneapolis by ICE agents. People are being ripped from their homes, killed in the streets, and rights are being stipped away in real time. It didn’t start with these two murders, but like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/05/11402306/george-floyd-anniversary-jordan-neely-death"">George Floyd’s murder </a>in 2020, we’re at an inflection point where people are finally, collectively saying ENOUGH. The celebrity statements at the Grammys were met with overwhelming support online and applause from the audience, like everyone was waiting for celebrities to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/01/11954261/golden-globes-celebrity-pins-meaning-politics-speeches"">stop treating awards shows like it’s business as usual</a> and capitalize on the attention that comes with the stages they are afforded. For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p>



<p>On the red carpet for the Golden Globes last month, I asked<em> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Poker Face</a></em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTZH-OXCTkA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> star Natasha Lyonne</a> about the “ICE OUT” pin she was wearing. She mentioned Renee Good by name. That interview garnered over eight million views. And when I spoke to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTUB5W6jDwM/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">actress Jameela Jamil</a> on another red carpet about how she gets called “brave” when she speaks up about social issues while other celebs stay silent, she responded, “Am I brave or are they cowards?” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> For better and for worse, people want public figures to show us their values, to tell us where they stand, and if they have to engage in the pomp and circumstance of red carpets and awards shows while the world burns, the least they can do is acknowledge the flames.  </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Call it cowardice or bravery or anything in between, but what celebrities choose to say — or don’t — about the state of the world is always a hot topic. So, what do we <em>really</em> want to hear from artists in times of crisis? As <a href=""https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/11/15/toni-morrison-art-despair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Toni Morrison famously said</a>, “This is precisely the time when artists go to work.” It may be too simple to say that every single celebrity should be performing their activism on social media or during awards speeches. A social post is the bare minimum. And many of these artists do not have the range to engage in a productive political debate. There are many different ways to support causes you care about, and if you have money, funding movements, giving to organizers on the ground, or to victims’ families can be more powerful than simply posting an Instagram story. I don’t think it’s a useful pastime to litigate what each celeb has or hasn’t said on their personal social media accounts. But two things can be true. And we live in a time when celebrities wield more power and access than ever, with legions of stans ready to act on command. We know that when famous artists do speak up, it works. </p>



<p>Taylor Swift <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/09/22/1201183160/taylor-swift-instagram-voter-registration"">increased voter registration by 23 per cent</a> (the number of 18-year-olds registered more than doubled) in 2023 with a non-partisan plea for her followers to vote. Swift is an example of someone who, despite making a documentary that was heavily about her decision to start <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2020/01/24/taylor-swift-politics-miss-americana-donald-trump"">speaking out against Donald Trump</a>, has chosen to remain neutral in a time that demands partiality. Telling fans to vote without making it clear that their basic rights and freedoms are on the line is like inviting people to dinner without telling them the menu is a choice between hot dogs and razor blades. One option ain’t great; the other will kill you. But most artists try to toe the line. On one hand, Beyoncé will deliver an album (and a <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-black-panther-halftime-the-revolutionary-politics-behind-beyonces-super-bowl-performance/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl halftime performance</a>) that can be interpreted as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/04/11698236/beyonce-cowboy-carter-album-country-music-history-reaction"">searing critique of America</a> while highlighting oft-forgotten Black history and on the other, she’ll be spotted <a href=""https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/jadegomez510/beyonce-ivanka-jared-charity-dinner"">partying with members of an administration</a> hell bent on erasing that very history. In 2026, there are only a handful of celebrities who seem to be truly channeling the spirit of Simone. The rest opt into conversations about social justice when it’s comfortable, convenient, and popular. </p>



<p>The Grammys were proof of this. From the vague (Shaboozey) to the sincere (Olivia Dean and SZA) to the specific (Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish, and Kehlani), the show ended up being an unintentional showcase of the typical range of celebrity responses to social injustice. To be clear, I think it’s important and necessary that each of these artists chose to use their speeches to stand up for immigrants and stand against ICE. But if you are going to speak up, as <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/article/2026-grammys-review-politics.html"">Craig Jenkins put it for Vulture</a>, we’re going to need more “naming and shaming.” Jenkins wrote, “The ingredients for a broadcast that could brashly outline the regime connections in the building were in play, but any elephant in the room that was tacitly acknowledged was also rarely explicitly named and shamed.”</p>

<p>Take Shaboozey for example. “Immigrants built this country, literally. So this is for them,” the singer said as he accepted the Grammy for Best Country Group/Duo Performance. “For all children of immigrants, this is also for those who came to this country in search of better opportunities, to be part of a nation that promised freedom for all and equal opportunity to everyone willing to work for it.” It’s a nice sentiment, but Shaboozey didn’t say “ICE” once in his speech and his “immigrants built this country” line not only erases the labor of enslaved Black Americans, it also plays into the harmful idea that immigrants deserve to be treated fairly solely because of their labor, instead of the fact that they are human beings. <a href=""https://people.com/shaboozey-addresses-backlash-immigrants-built-this-country-remark-grammys-speech-11899304"">Shaboozey has since apologized</a> and clarified his statements. I’m sure that the risk of receiving backlash for clumsy comments is why many stars refuse to say anything at all, but the stakes are too high to be scared of some silly social media fallout. Plus, the potential repercussions — like losing followers or brand deals — are trivial concerns compared to the violence people are facing at the hands of ICE, and in the wake of the Trump administration’s tyranny.</p>



<p>Someone who seems to understand this is <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-show-reclaims-reimagines-america"">Bad Bunny</a>, and his career hasn’t suffered. Bad Bunny is also one of the few artists topping the charts in 2026 who actually incorporates his beliefs into his music — and he has for years. Bad Bunny speaks to the colonial violence America has enacted globally, and refuses to conform to the white supremacist ideals it continues to perpetuate. In a recent piece for NPR called “<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/05/nx-s1-5701460/where-are-the-protest-songs"">Where Are All The Protest Songs?</a>, Ann Powers writes, “Bad Bunny stands out in 2026 not only for his historic success as the first artist win album of the year for a Spanish-language album, but because DtMF does <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/bad-bunny-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-political-lines-explained"">explicitly enact resistance</a> in songs like “LO QUE LE PASÓ A HAWAii,” calling out American imperialism, gentrification and the displacement of his fellow Puerto Ricans.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s [Bad Bunny’s] clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In fact, Bad Bunny’s success hasn’t been hindered by his outspokenness, I think it’s added to it. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio is unapologetically himself, a proud Puerto Rican, and someone who believes in the power of art to be political <em>and</em> personal. “Before I say thanks to God,” Bad Bunny said in his acceptance speech for Best Música Urbana Album, “I’m gonna say ICE out… We’re not savages, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.” And when he won Album of the Year, Bad Bunny accepted in Spanish and dedicated his award to Puerto Rico. At the <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/bad-bunny-super-bowl-meaning-1235513218/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Bowl, Bad Bunny</a> displayed a sign that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love” and during “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCX_Aqzoo4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">El Apagón</a>,” a song which mentions the <a href=""https://www.providencejournal.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/09/19/bad-bunny-el-apagon-music-video-puerto-rico-hurricane-gentrification/10426694002/"">power grid issues Puerto Rico</a> has struggled with since Hurricane Maria (due in large part to the inaction of the U.S. government), the set featured Bad Bunny and dancers hanging from utility poles. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Bad Bunny also listed countries</a> across Latin America, the Caribbean, and North America in his Super Bowl set, speaking to our diasporic connection and bookended his performance with holding up a football with the words, “<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DUhQmVDDZ0Z/?img_index=1&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Together, We Are America</a>” scrawled on it, pushing the message that borders are imaginary and cultures are global. It was a moment that, as a Jamaican Canadian currently living in the U.S., brought me to tears. That’s only scratching the surface of the symbolism and spirit of revolt that Bad Bunny brought to the Super Bowl. When it was time to step up and say something, he did it with authenticity, integrity, history, conviction, and clarity. It’s this clear-eyed consistency that should be the standard and the blueprint for artists who wish to put their actions and words behind their values.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ask is for celebrities to show us their values, some of them will also show us their asses. Despite being dubbed “MAGA Barbie,” Sydney Sweeney has yet to specifically denounce the actions of the party she’s associated with (Sweeney is reportedly a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/sydney-sweeney-jeans-ad-republican-voter-registration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">registered Republican</a>). In a <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">recent interview with Cosmopolitan</a>, Sweeney said, “I’ve never been here to talk about politics. I’ve always been here to make art, so this is just not a conversation I want to be at the forefront of. And I think because of that, people want to take it even further and use me as their own pawn. But it’s somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” Later <a href=""https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a70001220/sydney-sweeney-interview-2026/"">in the Q&amp;A</a>, Sweeny vaguely defines her beliefs as being rooted in love by saying, “I’m not a hateful person” and doubles down on the idea that art is not political. </p>



<p>“I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am,” Sweeney told Cosmo. “I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form.” These statements are genuinely so stupid, I almost don’t want to give them the dignity of a rebuttal. The last time <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11924722/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-ad-controversy-republican-trump"">I wrote about Sweeney</a>, I swore it was the last time. But this notion that entertainment and politics should be segregated, that one has no bearing on the other, isn’t just a false belief held by Sweeney to justify her inability to emphatically condemn an image of herself she helped create. Since the Grammys, the sentiment has been echoed by <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/articles/why-don-t-stfu-mark-130425855.html"">Kevin O’Leary</a> and <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/ricky-gervais-celebrities-leave-politics-out-speeches-grammys-1236494483/"">Ricky Gervais</a>, two old white men no one should be paying attention to and yet, here we are. </p>



<p><a href=""https://ca.news.yahoo.com/kevin-oleary-slams-billie-eilish-173347556.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">O’Leary posted that Eilish</a> should “STFU [shut the f-ck up]” after she said “No one is illegal on stolen land” in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2UnPnOYHNM"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">speech accepting the Grammy for Song of the Year</a>. “I feel like we just need to keep fighting and speaking up and protesting, and our voices really do matter, and the people matter, and fuck ICE,” Eilish continued. Based on their recent statements, Sweeney, O’Leary, and Gervais seem to agree that the artists who spoke up at the Grammys should just “shut up and sing.” But art <em>is</em> political and it always has been. Every piece of art – a song, a movie, a TV show, an album — is created within the social context of its time. Sweeney ran an unsuccessful Oscar campaign for playing an abused lesbian boxer in <em>Christy</em>. Victims of domestic violence and members of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3lT_r0MYA"">LGBTQ community</a> are two vulnerable groups whose <a href=""https://time.com/7332225/domestic-violence-victims-shelter-trump-immigration/"">legal protections have been under attack</a> since Trump was elected again. </p>



<p>And while art has been used by governments to weaponize, propagandize, and manipulate populations, it has also been suppressed and censored to shut down resistance. Art can be a joyful act of defiance and a powerful instrument of protest. When Sweeney calls herself a storyteller without acknowledging how stories can push narratives, preserve history, propel representation forward or stereotype entire demographics, she’s either being wilfully ignorant or just illiterate (literacy is another example about how art is political). And when artists use art to lure in victims or cover up their crimes (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10634487/r-kelly-trial-allegations-charges"">R. Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/09/210844/bill-cosby-sentence-sexually-violent-predator-guilty"">Bill Cosby</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9539191/harvey-weinstein-sentence-23-years-prison-women-justice"">Harvey Weinstein</a>, the Hollywood elite in <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/a-list-of-powerful-men-named-in-the-epstein-files-from-elon-musk-to-former-prince-andrew"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the Epstein files</a>, I could go on), it’s impossible to say that the two are unconnected. </p>



<p>At the Grammys, country singer<a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/jelly-roll-allegedly-confronted-reporter-185644570.html""> Jelly Roll came under fire</a> for proclaiming that “people shouldn’t care to hear my opinion” because he’s “a dumb redneck.” This is also a common refrain from celebrities (and influencers). They claim not to be informed enough to speak on current events. If they are going to be given microphones, you’d think they’d put some thought and care into what they are going to say into it. There is a responsibility that comes with fame and feigning cluelessness isn’t a good excuse, it’s a copout. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MVP_fXt51Y"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jelly Roll can speak about Jesus</a> and preach about his religion, but he refuses to interrogate the teachings in the very Bible he totes around in order to stand up for the basic human rights of his neighbors. Jelly Roll’s comments probably didn’t come as a surprise. He’s a white country star and the genre tends to lean heavily conservative. The music industry is a business, and when the majority of your fan base is Republican, artists aren’t staying silent out of ignorance, they are choosing money over morals. </p>



<p>Money is the only explanation for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/06/nicki-minaj-maga-era-barbz-defend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj’s recent behavior</a> — even though her fanbase is overwhelmingly queer and Black. In the past, the Trinidad-born, New York-raised rapper hailed herself as a proud immigrant standing in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Now, she’s full MAGA. “I am probably the president’s number one fan, and that’s not going to change,” Minaj said last week at the<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/trump-accounts-nicki-minaj.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> U.S. Treasury Department’s Trump Accounts Summit</a>. “And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> My wish is for these artists to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Along with holding hands with Trump (shudder), Minaj “thanked the president for getting her a Trump Gold Card, a kind of visa for wealthy foreigners to help them secure expedited U.S. residency,” <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/nicki-minaj-trump-gold-card-husband-citizen-grammys-trevor-noah-don-lemon.html"">according to Slate</a>. “The visa normally requires a <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4q1lddj8go?accountMarketingPreferences=off"">$1 million contribution, plus fees</a>; Minaj… nabbed the Trump Gold Card for free.” There’s conflicting reports as to whether Minaj’s visa is legit, but it’s clear that cozying up to Trump is for her own personal gain. As digital creator and educator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUZnISvjqZl/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="">Raven Schwam-Curtis says in a video</a> posted to her @ravenreveals account, Minaj “has chosen to side with a president that uses the optics of Black women as ‘proof’ that his regime is doing good things for our communities while actively harming us,” she says. “Representation doesn’t equal liberation or solidarity. If anything it shows how easily representation can be weaponized by the right when your class position pulls you out of solidarity with regular Black folk.” Through her art, Minaj gained wealth, status, and standom that she has now leveraged to push her far-right agenda. And <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-fans-barbz-vote-republican-trump-11482667"">according to Newsweek</a>, legions of Minaj’s fans, dubbed “Barbz” are following her pivot to the Republican Party. </p>



<p>It’s already problematic that we live in a time when celeb worship is at an all-time high. We shouldn’t be looking to these people to tell us what to believe, but they are influential, whether we want them to be or not. If Minaj and Bad Bunny stand at two opposite ends of the celebs speaking up politically spectrum, they each represent the <em>dos</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of celebrity political activism. One is emphasizing how culture and community can combat oppressive regimes (Benito) and the other is proof that conformity and greed can make you complicit in upholding them (Minaj).</p>



<p>The Grammys, and the Super Bowl halftime show, served as hopeful examples of celebrities meeting the moment, even though they both still exist within institutions that sustain the status quo. My wish is for these artists — and anyone with a platform — to continue to speak up, not just when two white people are murdered and the country deems it socially acceptable to say something. And not just when it’s comfortable. Like Bad Bunny and Kehlani (who has been a <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@varietymagazine/video/7508887896628219178"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pro-Palestinian advocate</a> in her music as well as on social media), my hope for all public figures to use every avenue of their influence to try to shake the table and push back against powerful people who aim to snuff out dissension and stifle diversity.</p>



<p>“We’re too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of a statement in our country,” Kehlani <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suQNZoLVrdE"">told the Hollywood Reporter</a> on the red carpet at the Grammys. “I hope everybody’s inspired to join together as a community of artists and speak out against what’s going on, and I’mma leave this and say “‘Fuck ICE,’” she echoed during her speech. </p>



<p>I started this piece by quoting Nina Simone and as cliche as it may be, I’m going to end it the same way. Because Simone was decades before her time. And every artist (including actresses like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DURBiKkEoQZ/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kerry Washington</a>, <a href=""https://iop.harvard.edu/events/artist-public-life-sophia-bush-activism-artistry-and-courage-speak"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Bush</a>, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hacks-star-hannah-einbinder-criticized-ice-shouted-free-palestine-emmy-rcna231320"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hannah Einbinder</a>) who dedicate their platforms to advocacy for those whose voices need to be heard, are doing so because of the path Simone, and others like her, paved. I think their legacy should be more than just memes. So, I’ll leave you with Nina Simone’s full quote: </p>



<p><em>“An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I choose to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice. How can you be an artist and NOT reflect the times? That to me is the definition of an artist.”</em></p>

<p>Cosmic beings, this week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, a liminal checkpoint between what has already climaxed and what is about to be reborn. Last quarter moons are not about manifesting or initiating, they’re about editing. This one asks us to release what the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-full-snow-moon-in-leo-february-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Leo Full Moon</a> revealed is no longer sustainable, especially around power, control, emotional attachments, and unspoken resentments. You may encounter small speed bumps, emotional flare-ups, or moments of resistance. Instead of pushing through, pause and ask yourself: <em>What am I being asked to let go of so I don’t carry it into the eclipse?</em> Scorpio energy reminds us that release is rarely neat, but it is necessary.</p>



<p>Midweek, the emotional tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, a placement where Venus feels especially at home. Under this transit, compassion rises and defensiveness melts. With Mercury already in Pisces, conversations become more heart-centered, intuitive, and emotionally nuanced. This is a powerful week for forgiveness, creative expression, spiritual connection, and choosing love over fear, not in a bypassing way, but in a grounded, human one. As Pluto continues its work in Aquarius, reshaping collective systems and futures, Venus in Pisces reminds us that revolution without tenderness is unsustainable.</p>



<p>The emotional and spiritual weight of the week peaks on February 13th, when Saturn leaves Pisces and enters Aries, closing a chapter that began in March 2023. Cosmic beings, give yourselves credit. Saturn in Pisces asked for surrender, boundary repair, grief work, and deep spiritual accountability. Its exit may bring relief, but also unexpected emotion. This is the final full week of the Year of the Snake, and grief can surface alongside excitement.</p>



<p>Saturn in Aries begins a brand-new 29-year cycle at the very start of the zodiac, but this is <em>not </em>a race. With Mercury approaching its retrograde shadow and eclipse season arriving next week, this remains an in-between time. The momentum is real, but so is the need for gentleness. Trust that the tides are turning. You’re allowed to move forward slowly, intentionally, and with love for both yourself and the collective you’re helping to shape.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your sector of intimacy, shared resources, emotional debts, and energetic entanglements. For you, this is a clearing moment. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary"">Something tied to money</a>, power dynamics, trust, or emotional obligation is ready to be released. You may realize you’ve been carrying responsibility that isn’t actually yours, or holding on out of loyalty rather than alignment. The discomfort here is real, but so is the relief. This is about lightening your load before the eclipse ahead, not pushing through out of pride.</p>



<p>On February 10th, Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your spirituality, rest, and closure sector. This is a softer, quieter shift that asks you to slow your pace emotionally, even if your external life feels busy. You may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or open-hearted than usual. Old feelings, dreams, or memories can resurface, not to distract you, but to be integrated. This is a beautiful time for forgiveness, creative flow, and releasing what you no longer need to carry into your next chapter. You don’t have to fix everything this week. Some things resolve through compassion, not effort.</p>



<p>The major moment arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters your sign, beginning a brand-new 29-year cycle for Saturn and a defining chapter for you. Having Saturn in your sign is not always easy. It brings accountability, responsibility, and a mirror that asks you to take yourself seriously. You may feel more visible, more scrutinized, or more aware of the weight of your choices. But here’s the balance: Neptune is also in your sign, softening Saturn’s edges with vision, faith, and imagination. This combination asks you to build your dreams in real time. The spotlight is on you now, yes, but this is not about perfection. It’s about integrity. With great power comes great responsibility, and this week reminds you that you’re more than capable of rising to both.</p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, are you ready for a more social, emotionally open week than you’re used to? The energy shifts fast, starting with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, which activates your partnership and one-on-one relationship sector. This is a release point around dynamics that feel intense, imbalanced, or emotionally draining. A pattern in a close relationship may become impossible to ignore, not to provoke drama, but to help <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/casual-relationship-rules-boundaries"">you reset boundaries</a>. The invitation is to let go of power struggles and choose honesty over control. What you release now creates space for healthier connections moving forward. Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your friendship, community, and technology sector. This is a beautiful shift for you.</p>



<p>Conversations feel warmer, connections more compassionate, and social interactions less transactional. You may feel drawn to collaborate, reconnect with friends, or show up more authentically online. Creativity flows more easily when you’re surrounded by people who genuinely support you. Just be mindful of over-giving… Pisces energy loves to merge, but your energy is still precious.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your spirituality, healing, and subconscious sector. This begins a longer chapter of inner work, emotional accountability, and spiritual discipline. You may feel called to take your mental health, rest, or healing practices more seriously. While Saturn here can feel heavy at times, remember that Neptune is also in Aries, softening the experience by reminding you that healing doesn’t have to be harsh. This is about building trust with yourself, honoring your intuition, and releasing old fears gently rather than forcefully.</p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, are you ready to clean up your schedule and your energy at the same time? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your work, routines, and well-being sector. This is a checkpoint moment where something about your daily life clearly isn’t working anymore. You may notice burnout creeping in, ineffciencies piling up, or commitments that drain more than they give. Instead of pushing harder, this moon asks you to subtract. Let go of habits, tasks, or expectations that don’t actually support your health or focus.</p>



<p>On February 10th, the vibe shifts as Venus enters Pisces, joining Mercury in your career and public image sector. Suddenly, conversations at work feel softer, more emotionally intelligent, and less transactional. This is a great week to lead with empathy, creativity, and intuition rather than trying to logic your way through everything. You may feel more visible professionally or inspired to align your work with something meaningful. Just watch the tendency to overpromise. Pisces energy is generous, but clarity still matters.</p>



<p>The biggest internal shift comes on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This begins a period where you’re asked to take your dreams and social connections more seriously. Saturn here can feel like a reality check around who you’re building with and which visions are actually sustainable. Neptune’s presence in Aries softens the edges, reminding you that purpose and imagination can coexist. This is about committing to goals and communities that feel aligned, not just exciting.</p>

<p>Cancer, are you ready to get honest about what actually brings you joy versus what just looks good on the surface? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating your creativity, pleasure, and self-expression sector. This is a release point around old patterns in romance, fun, or creative pursuits that no longer feel nourishing. You may realize that certain ways of seeking validation or distraction aren’t giving you the fulfillment you crave. Letting go here creates space for joy that feels more genuine and less performative.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy lifts as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in your expansion, travel, and belief sector. This is a beautiful alignment for you, bringing emotional ease, inspiration, and a renewed sense of faith. You may feel called to learn something new, plan a trip, or reconnect with a spiritual practice that grounds you. Conversations feel more hopeful and heart-centered. This is a reminder that growth doesn’t have to be stressful. It can feel gentle and meaningful at the same time.</p>

This is not about hardening yourself. It’s about building something meaningful without losing your heart.</p>

<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, are you ready to soften without feeling like you’re giving up your power? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to home, emotional roots, and private foundations. This is a release moment around family dynamics, living situations, or emotional patterns that have been quietly influencing your decisions. You may feel called to let go of an old story about where you come from or what safety is supposed to look like. It’s not about cutting ties dramatically, it’s about loosening emotional grips that keep you from feeling fully free.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy deepens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging. Conversations may turn more vulnerable, and you might feel more open to trust, heal, or share parts of yourself you usually keep guarded. This is a powerful time for emotional honesty, but also for discernment. Compassion doesn’t mean overextending yourself. Let closeness feel mutual, not draining.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to growth, wisdom, and long-term vision.

<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, are you ready to stop explaining yourself and start trusting what you already know? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to communication, thought patterns, and daily exchanges. This is a release moment around how you speak to yourself and others. You may notice mental habits, assumptions, or conversations that feel draining or unnecessary. The invitation is to let go of overthinking and choose clarity over control. Not every thought deserves your attention.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a relational softening as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the zone of partnerships, collaboration, and one-on-one dynamics. This is a heart-opening influence that encourages empathy, compassion, and emotional presence in your closest connections. Conversations may feel more tender or vulnerable, and you may crave emotional attunement over logic. This is beautiful territory for healing, but remember to keep your boundaries intact. Connection doesn’t require self-erasure.</p>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, are you ready to get clear about what you truly value, not just what keeps the peace? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life connected to money, self-worth, and personal resources. This is a release point around financial habits, energetic exchanges, or beliefs about what you deserve. You may realize that something you’ve been tolerating out of comfort or fear is no longer aligned. Letting go here creates space for more intentional stability.</p>



<p>Midweek, the tone softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the part of your life tied to daily routines, work rhythms, and well-being. This is an invitation to bring more compassion into how you treat yourself day to day. You may feel drawn to slow down, care for your body, or approach work with more heart and less pressure. Productivity looks different under Pisces energy. It’s about flow, not force.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your relationship and partnership realm.

<div id=""scorpio""></div>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, are you ready to release the version of yourself that’s been holding it all together a little <em>too </em>tightly? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in your sign, moving through the core of your identity, body, and emotional truth. This is a powerful shedding moment. You may feel more sensitive, introspective, or aware of patterns you’ve outgrown. Something about how you show up in the world is ready to change, not through force, but through honesty. Let go of the need to control the narrative. What’s real will remain.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life tied to creativity, romance, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a beautiful counterbalance to the intensity you’re feeling. Inspiration flows more easily, and emotional connections feel sweeter and less guarded. You may feel drawn to art, intimacy, or moments of joy that don’t require explanation. Let yourself enjoy this. Healing doesn’t always come from doing the work… sometimes it comes from remembering how to play.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of your life connected to work, health, and daily responsibilities. This begins a longer chapter of learning how to structure your life in a way that actually supports your energy. Saturn asks for discipline and accountability, while Neptune in Aries adds sensitivity and intuition. You’re learning how to work smarter, not harder, and how to honor your limits without guilt. This week reminds you that power doesn’t come from endurance alone, it comes from sustainability.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, are you ready to slow down just enough to actually hear <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">what your intuition</a> has been trying to tell you? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life tied to rest, closure, and subconscious patterns. This is a behind-the-scenes release moment. You may feel more tired, reflective, or emotionally porous than usual, and that’s not a weakness. It’s information. Let go of habits, expectations, or internal pressure that keep you running on autopilot. This is a reset, not a setback.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a softer, more nurturing tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the area of your life connected to home, family, and emotional grounding. You may crave comfort, familiarity, or deeper emotional safety. Conversations with loved ones can feel more tender and healing, and you may feel inspired to make your space feel more like a sanctuary. Just be mindful of nostalgia pulling you backward instead of helping you integrate. Comfort is meant to restore you, not stall you.</p>



<p>The biggest shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating the realm of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This begins a longer chapter of taking what lights you up more seriously. Saturn asks you to commit to your passions, not just chase excitement. Neptune’s presence in Aries keeps the magic alive, reminding you that discipline doesn’t have to kill the fun. This week sets the tone for building a life that feels inspired <em>and </em>sustainable.</p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, are you noticing how your definition of success is quietly changing? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the part of your life connected to friendships, community ties, and long-term aspirations. This is a release moment around social dynamics or goals that no longer feel aligned with who you’re becoming. You may realize that certain group spaces, collaborations, or dreams need updating. Letting go here isn’t a failure, it’s refinement. You’re making room for more meaningful connections and intentions.</p>



<p>Midweek, the energy softens as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of communication, learning, and everyday exchanges. Conversations feel more heartfelt and less transactional, and you may find yourself speaking from intuition rather than strategy. This is a supportive time for writing, teaching, or reconnecting with people you haven’t spoken to in a while. Just be mindful of mixed signals. Clarity still matters, even when compassion leads.</p>



<p>The major shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn, your ruling planet, re-enters Aries, activating the area of your life tied to home, family, and emotional foundations. After years of Saturn pushing you to grow through responsibility and public-facing pressure, this marks a turn inward. You may feel called to restructure your private life, redefine stability, or take emotional boundaries more seriously. With Neptune also in Aries, this process is softened by imagination and sensitivity. You’re learning that true authority comes from being grounded internally, not just accomplished externally.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, are you ready to get honest about what kind of future you actually want to build, not just talk about? The week begins with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, activating the part of your life connected to career, reputation, and long-term direction. This is a release moment around professional expectations, public roles, or ambitions that no longer reflect who you are becoming. You may feel tension between where you’ve been visible and where you actually want to invest your energy. Letting go here isn’t dramatic, it’s strategic. You’re clearing space before a major reset.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a shift in tone as Venus enters Pisces on February 10th, joining Mercury in the realm of money, values, and self-worth. This softens your relationship with security and abundance, encouraging you to lead with intuition rather than anxiety. You may feel more compassionate toward yourself around finances or more open to receiving support. Creative or spiritually aligned income ideas can surface now. Just stay mindful of boundaries. Generosity is beautiful, but it shouldn’t come at the expense of stability.</p>



<p>The biggest shift of the week arrives on February 13th, when Saturn re-enters Aries, activating your communication, mindset, and learning zone. This begins a longer chapter of taking your ideas seriously and committing to your voice. Saturn asks for discipline and follow-through, while Neptune in Aries keeps imagination alive. You’re learning how to turn insight into impact. This week sets the tone for speaking with clarity, intention, and responsibility, knowing that what you say and how you say it carries more weight than before.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, are you ready to honor how far you’ve come instead of focusing on how much more there is to do? The week opens with the Last Quarter Moon in Scorpio, moving through the area of your life tied to growth, faith, and perspective. This is a release moment around outdated beliefs, limiting narratives, or paths you once thought you <em>had </em>to follow. You may feel called to let go of a version of the future that no longer resonates. Trust that releasing an old vision makes room for something more aligned to take shape.</p>



<p>Midweek brings a beautiful homecoming as Venus enters your sign on February 10th, joining Mercury already there. This softens everything. You’re more magnetic, intuitive, and emotionally open, and others are more receptive to your presence. This is a time for connection, creativity, self-care, and gentle honesty. Just be mindful of over-giving or absorbing other people’s emotions. Compassion is your gift, but boundaries are your anchor.</p>



<p>The biggest energetic shift arrives on February 13th, when Saturn leaves your sign and enters Aries, ending a demanding chapter that began in 2023. This week, you may feel both relief and reflection. Saturn in Aries activates your relationship with money, values, and self-worth, beginning a new phase of building stability from a more empowered place. With Neptune also in Aries, dreaming and doing begin to work together. This week reminds you that softness and strength are not opposites. You’re learning how to build a life that supports both.</p>
