<p>The world is both a literal and metaphorical hellscape right now, and no one knows that better than <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10221298/natalie-portman-sexualized-as-child-in-movies"">Natalie Portman</a>. The actress, vegan, and longtime <a href=""https://www.green4ema.org/press/natalie-portman-reveals-what-she-does-to-combat-climate-change-including-not-buying-new-clothes"">climate</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/02/9384364/natalie-portman-oscars-dress-cape-female-directors-names-dior"">activist</a> has been at the forefront of calls for climate change and awareness throughout her decades-long career. And now, she’s using animation to further the cause. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNUkW6ywV-c""><em>Arco</em></a>, a newly-released animated film from French director and illustrator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ugobienvenu/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ugo Bienvenu </a>and produced by Portman, audiences are introduced to the not-so-distant future. Except in this version of Earth, in the year 2075, those tsunamis and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wildfire-eaton-california-lost-homes"">wild fires</a> that are becoming increasingly frequent and more devastating? They’re essentially the norm; with homes outfitted with glass domes that offer protection during bouts of extreme weather. It’s here that we meet Iris, an adventurous 10-year-old looking for adventure out of her day-to-day. When, one day, she rescues Arco, a time-travelling kid transported from the future, it becomes a story on the power and impact of friendship, in more ways than one. </p>



<p>Because with him, Arco brings realities of the future. Due to the impact of climate change, Arco and his family — along with their neighbours — no longer live on Earth, moving up to tree branch-like homes in the sky that allow for the planet to repair and regenerate without human interruption. It’s a surprising, albeit not so hard to imagine reality; and one made even more impactful through Bienvenu’s use of animation, which is able to engage viewers while presenting an impactful message. </p>



<p>“Animation to me is one of the best mediums for storytelling,” Bienvenu, whose other works includes short films <em>Dolly Zero </em>and 2019’s <em>L’entretien</em>, tells Refinery29. This is for a very particular reason, specifically, the way animated films resonate with viewers, often re-watching from when they’re kids all the way up to when they become adults, and choose to share their favourite movies, be it <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>The Fox and the Hound</em> or <em>Coco</em>, with their own children. “[You watch] animation movies all over your life, they accompany you all your life. And making a movie is long, so I wanted to do something that could have a [long] impact on the people that would watch it.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943042.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=577&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A577"" /></figure>



<p>And in many instances, it’s kids who are going to change the world — often in inventive ways. This is a truth made clear as Iris tries to help Arco get home, all while navigating changing environmental elements (Arco needs very specific weather — sunny with rain — to time travel) and a society that’s essentially run by drones. On the surface, it may seem like an engaging and earnest story about the bonds of friendship – and it is — but there’s something deeper to it, too. </p>



<p>As Iris and Arco try tirelessly to set up the perfect environmental conditions for him to return home, covering Iris’s front lawn in pillows and couch cushions for Arco to jump into and setting the sprinkler to go off at the exact right moment, there’s an underlying frustration with their inability to do so, and with the knowledge that those conditions, now in this current climate, are unlikely to come naturally. Arco’s stranded; a feeling probably akin to what many young people feel today when it comes to thinking about our planet. </p>



<p>But Arco and Iris don’t give up. Instead, continuing to press forward, determined that there’s a way to help Arco get home. </p>



<p>It was this optimistic way of looking at challenges, so inherent in Bienvenu’s story, and children in general, that drew Portman to the project in the first place. The actress recalls seeing early animatics of <em>Arco</em> and talking to director Bienvenu about his vision for the film — one in which creativity and imagination can be put towards a better future for our climate. “With environmental concerns, it was [usually] an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring,’” Portman says of this perspective. “There was hope and active participation in making the future through creativity. And I thought that was a very beautiful, activating way to look at a situation that we’re often kind of fatalistic about.” </p>

<p>And rightfully so. With climate change expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year globally between 2030 and 2050, according to <a href=""https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health"">data from The World Health Organization</a>(WHO), it can be easy to count ourselves – and our planet — out; resign ourselves to give up trying to change our behaviour in the present, knowing that we’re already so far gone. But, Arco — and the team behind the movie — wants us to forget about the future, or more specifically, think that they know how the future will play out. Which is why, when Iris tries to follow Arco home, he encourages her to stay in the present, stating: “No one should know the future — ever.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>With environmental concerns, it’s usually an attitude of ‘it’s difficult,’ but look at what imagination can bring… [In Arco] there’s hope and active participation in making the future through creativity.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It seems like a surprising sentiment, given the fact most young people have grown up being told that, when it comes to the environment and climate change, the future is the only thing we should be thinking about — and how our actions now will impact our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren long after we’re gone.     </p>



<p><strong>“</strong>If you know the future, it gives you no agency in the present. You think, ‘Oh, that’s how it’s gonna be, so [there’s] nothing I can do about it,’” Portman says. “If you accept that you don’t know what the future’s going to be like, then you have a part in changing it and affecting it.”</p>



<p>Which is what we, as viewers, eventually see. While we don’t see what happens to Arco after he travels home, audiences do get a glimpse into what Iris takes from her time with her new friend; primarily, inspiration to go forth and make a difference for her own future. Through small glimpses at photos and sketches in Iris’ room, audiences see that the curious, intelligent, vivacious 10-year-old we’re first introduced to will go on to  use that curiosity and vivaciousness to try and create a better future for the planet, going on to calculate, sketch and create the more sustainable world Arco will one day inhabit. </p>



<p>It’s a lesson on the impact one person can have for both kids and viewers who are coming to the film as adults already. While <em>Arco’</em>s main audience demographic may initially seem to be those under 12-years-old, “we want to speak to the kids that are still in ourselves,” Bienvenu adds,” because we still are kids in a way; a big part of me is still a kid and I want to feed that part of myself.”</p>

<p>On November 3, Condé Nast — the media company that owns <a href=""http://vogue.com/""><em>Vogue</em></a>, <a href=""http://vanityfair.com/""><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com""><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, <a href=""https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk""><em>GQ</em></a>, and <a href=""https://www.wired.com""><em>Wired</em></a>, amongst other outlets — announced that <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com"">Teen Vogue</a> would be absorbed into Vogue.com. The news came two months after the publication was awarded the <a href=""https://rooseveltinstitute.org/event/2025-four-freedoms-awards/"">Roosevelt Institute’s 2025 Freedom of Speech and Expression Award</a>, and followed nearly a decade’s worth of coverage of politics and other important cultural topics in a way that was relevant and accessible to a primarily Gen-Z audience. </p>



<p>Beyond its categorically political reporting, Teen Vogue was lauded for its dedication to intersectionality, and the way it approached issues impacting Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) and marginalized groups more generally across all its verticals. Whether that be a piece holding fashion brands to account for <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/black-fashion-leaders-carrying-the-diversity-push-2020-2025"">diversity promises made in 2020</a>, an <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/rfk-jrs-autism-cure-tylenol-oped"">op-ed on Robert F. Kennedy</a> and autism, or choosing transgender model and social media star, <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/vivian-jenna-wilson-elon-musk-trans-youth"">Vivian Wilson, as its digital cover star</a> — giving her the opportunity to publicly admonish both her estranged father, Elon Musk, and his bestie, Trump. </p>



<p>The publication’s reorganization came with several notable layoffs. Editor-In-Chief <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/versharma/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Versha Sharma</a> and seven staff members lost their jobs, leaving Teen Vogue with zero Black women or trans folks on its staff. </p>



<p>In a post to her <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpAqOwCZm5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA=="">Instagram</a>, former Editor-In-Chief Elaine Welteroth, who presided over the magazine during its dedicated shift to political coverage circa 2015 and 2016, said the magazine “was a once-in-a-generation experiment in what happens when you hand the mic to young people from diverse backgrounds and take their voices seriously.” </p>



<p>This, against the backdrop of an industry in which just 15% of reporters who cover social issues and policy are Black, <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/04/us-journalists-beats-vary-widely-by-gender-and-other-factors/#journalists-beats-vary-somewhat-by-race-ethnicity"">according to a 2022 Pew Research study</a>. Those numbers drop to just 7% of entertainment and travel reporters, and 5% of those covering government and politics. At a time when diversity, equity, and inclusion gains are being clawed back or ignored completely in boardrooms and at a cultural level, the dismissal of such a talented newsroom begs the question: What necessary perspectives do we lose, and what questions go unasked and unanswered, when Black journalists are among the first to be seen as disposable on a masthead?</p>



<p>Among those let go at Teen Vogue last month was <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaitmcnab/"">Kaitlyn McNab</a>, an award-winning journalist and the outlet’s former Culture Editor. Her love for the outlet was homegrown, as it was one she regularly reached out to when she was a freelance writer, dating back to early winter 2020 when she first pitched a story for Valentine’s Day about diverse young adult love stories. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>What necessary perspectives do we lose, and what questions go unasked and unanswered, when Black journalists are among the first to be seen as disposable on a masthead?</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“[I was pitching Black stories] every single day. That has always been at the forefront of my beat and perspective as a journalist,” says McNab, who had also overseen writing and editing for Teen Vogue’s Identity section and served as its Entertainment Editor during her five-year tenure. “A lot of the work that I’m most proud of from my time at Teen Vogue are features and interviews that allowed Black women specifically, to feel safe enough to talk about their careers, lives, and experiences and also to trust me with asking harder questions.”</p>



<p>That included an<a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ice-spice-teen-vogue-cover-story-june-2023""> interview with rapper Ice Spice</a>, marking “one of the first where she talked to another Black woman and I think we were able to talk about things that she hadn’t touched on in other stories,” McNab explains. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/layoffs-2025-highest-level-since-2020-labor-market-jobs-report/"">layoffs are quite common</a> — 40% of workers will experience it at least once in their career.  But this current moment feels different, like it’s about more than just dollars and cents. In a year that has seen the president and his top advisors <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/27/trump-free-speech-charlie-kirk"">openly attack free speech</a> and slash funding for public broadcasting, the silencing, stifling, and degradation of diverse voices via trustworthy platforms is a harbinger of a larger, more sinister cultural shift. All of this is happening at a time where companies are <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/04/11/ibm-reportedly-walks-back-diversity-policies-citing-inherent-tensions-here-are-all-the-companies-rolling-back-dei-programs/"">rolling back DEI initiatives</a> and the administration <a href=""https://time.com/7261857/us-companies-keep-dei-initiatives-list-trump-diversity-order-crackdown/"">threatens others</a> to do the same. At a time where harmful <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/11/07/how-anti-black-ai-videos-harm-black-women-at-work/"">AI-generated videos</a> of Black women using SNAP benefits continuously show up online. At a time where <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/black-women-unemployment-rate/"">Black women overall lost the most number of jobs this year</a>.   </p>



<p>“When there are economic downturns, Black workers who are the so-called professional class — which just basically means people with a college degree — actually do worse in terms of wage downturns [than their white counterparts],” says Dr. Ofronama Biu, Chief Economist and Senior Research Director at <a href=""https://www.mavencollaborative.org/"">The Maven Collaborative</a>, a Black and brown woman-led organization working to create a new, inclusive economy. </p>



<p>Black women, historically, are cultural and economic indicators. Despite participating in the workforce at a higher rate than any other demographic, unemployment rates amongst Black women have been rising at twice the rate of white and Asian women, according to the <a href=""https://19thnews.org/2025/07/black-women-unemployment-jobs-warning-sign/"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. And after losing a job, Black women tend to remain unemployed for longer than other workers — a worrying trend that dates back to the <a href=""https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blackadultunemploymenttwoyearsrecovery_-_august201.pdf"">Great Recession.</a> “The hit that the economy [takes] gets turned on Black workers more than their white counterparts, and even more so when they’re in the professional class,” Biu explains. </p>



<p>Yet in spite of the hardship, Black women continue to shift the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/08/23/the-high-cost-of-ditching-dei-what-targets-boycott-fallout-reveals/"">economy</a> and culture. And we care deeply: about our communities, and the people in them, and the problems they face. In my opinion, writers often feel similarly because many of us entered this profession believing that it’s an honor to be entrusted with other people’s stories. And we feel a burden to handle those stories justly. But as a Black journalist, I sometimes find myself wondering: Why do we dedicate ourselves to an industry that seems so irreverent about us?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The hit that the economy [takes] gets turned on Black workers more than their white counterparts, and even more so when they’re in the professional class.</p><cite>Dr. Ofronama Biu, Chief Economist and Senior Research Director at The Maven Collaborative</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This isn’t just a Condé Nast problem. Changing winds are being felt all across the industry. Earlier this year, MSNBC (owned by NBCUniversal) did its own “reshuffling,” ultimately firing Joy Reid, a prominent Black political commentator and outspoken Trump critic, and canceling her <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/02/25/g-s1-50551/joy-reid-msnbc-fired"">award-winning primetime show</a>. NBCUniversal struck again in October, gutting 150 staffers from NBC News and announcing it would eliminate the teams dedicated to covering <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-layoffs-number-versant-split/"">marginalized issues</a>. That same month, VIBE, the long-running music magazine focused on rap, hip-hop, and R&amp;B coverage launched by music mogul Quincy Jones <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/business/business-news/vibe-rolling-stone-joining-forces-1236090544/"">announced that it would merge with Rolling Stone</a>. The statement speaks of plans to re-establish the magazine as a driving force for music reporting and amplify its presence across all platforms. It did not, however, say this: it all comes at the expense of VIBE’s almost entirely Black newsroom.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942983.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I didn’t know it was coming,” says former VIBE staffer and R&amp;B reporter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/myabriabe/"">Mya Abraham</a>. “I woke up one day and had a meeting on my calendar I thought was weird.” In that meeting, a human resources representative told Abraham that the company’s decision to restructure was not based on performance. Almost all of her colleagues, she says, got a similar call.</p>



<p>Also in October, CBS News laid off about 100 employees, including eight on-air correspondents and hosts — <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-layoffs-eight-women-b2855655.html"">all women, half of whom are people of color</a>. Under the newly-minted leadership of Bari Weiss — a former opinion columnist who has <a href=""https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/end-dei-bari-weiss-jews"">openly called for the end of DEI programs</a> – the network also axed its Race and Culture Unit, which was created in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd and ensuing surge of Black Lives Matter protests. Established newsrooms at <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/"">Pitchfork</a> and <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/huffpost-layoffs-january-2025/"">HuffPost</a> also saw substantial layoffs this year.</p>



<p>Are we noticing the pattern yet? This is not just economic anxiety — it’s cultural erasure, a rollback of DEI promises, and loss of platforms where Black and underrepresented voices are heard. The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p>



<p>Inclusion begets diversity. And diversity encourages accountability. That’s what makes these media layoffs especially troubling. As one of the most visible pathways for trusted information, the gutting of dedicated newsrooms represents the erasure of dozens of voices who can speak to BIPOC, queer, and underrepresented issues from a place of authority. Without a newsroom of writers and editors like Abraham and McNab, coverage loses its luster. What was once a kaleidoscope of perspectives runs the risk of suddenly becoming very dull. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>The exact places where we created spaces are being dismantled. In these layoffs, we’re not just losing recipes, we’re losing cooks, and access to kitchens too.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“I asked [Ice Spice] directly about the discourse around her success, colorism, and comparisons to other female rap artists, namely Flo Milli,” McNab points out. Her cultural awareness and sensitivity made the interview better. It also reignited a necessary conversation about the music industry’s more harmful beliefs and stereotypes.</p>



<p>While publications like <a href=""https://www.essence.com"">Essence</a>, <a href=""https://www.ebony.com"">Ebony</a>, <a href=""https://www.bustle.com"">Bustle</a>, and, of course, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unbothered"">Unbothered</a> still exist, full-time staff jobs are fewer and far between. In response to the increasing precarity of their chosen profession, many writers are choosing to put fate into their own hands. A recent <a href=""https://muckrack.com/research/state-of-creator-journalism"">study by Muck Rack</a> found that out of 1,515 surveyed journalists, more than a third of respondents independently publish their own content. Abraham will soon be one of them — she’s launching a podcast and Substack called “Play The B Sides”, dedicated to covering all things R&amp;B. McNab, though, isn’t sure the independent creator life is for her. </p>



<p>For all its flaws, the media industry “does, in a sense, give us stability,” she says. “Even though it’s so precarious, it gives us health insurance. It gives us a safety net.” For now, her immediate priority is to recuperate. “My therapist already dragged me for trying to think too far ahead. She was like, ‘You were dangerously burnt out and you need to take this time to rest right now.’”</p>



<p>Any work (no matter how glamorous the ‘00s rom-com makes it seem) is a job. It can be stressful, but it also provides a steady source of income. When that suddenly vanishes, there’s so much to practically consider: severance packages, contracts, figuring out how — or if — you’re going to be able to afford your life moving forward. Given the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/articles/disparities-for-women-and-minorities-in-retirement-saving/"">disparities for Black women</a> and other minorities regarding savings accounts and other safety nets, the loss of even one paycheck can feel catastrophic. After all, it’s hard to save money for the future when you’re being paid significantly less than your white counterparts to begin with. </p>



<p>For her part, Abraham started a <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-vibe-staff-after-layoffs"">GoFundMe</a> for herself and her ex-colleagues as they begin to figure out next steps. Despite receiving more than 21,000 views on X (formerly Twitter), the effort has only raised $1,100 of a $35,000 total goal. When I asked if she’s disappointed by that, she admits she is. “I’m just like, ‘OK, how hard do I have to fight to get this goal met?’,” she says. “There is still a whole team of Black journalists who don’t have a job anymore.” </p>



<p>But as a self-described optimist, Abraham remains hopeful — for her future, for the industry she loves, and most importantly, for her community. </p>



<p>“I’m just here to support everybody Black,” she says, invoking a now-famous Issa Rae quote. “That’s all I want to do — support Black things because we deserve it. We are the driving force of the culture. And I just want the world to remember that.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942861.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When it comes to legacy beauty founders’ second acts, Carisa Janes is in excellent company. From Bobbi Brown’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jones-road-beauty-makeup-review"">Jones Road</a> to Ali Webb’s Messy (her sophomore endeavor following Drybar), some of the most exciting beauty brands of the moment are coming from longtime tastemakers. </p>



<p>With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vegan-makeup-hourglass"">Hourglass</a>, Janes famously honed a luxury makeup POV with a focus on lit-from-within, sculpted skin powered by baked Ambient light powders that made the brand a household name. With her latest venture, <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/"">Outside In</a>, she’s not just creating more product for products’ sake. The brand is launching with just three products, a <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/silk-serum-foundation?variant=45146880573628"">Silk Serum Foundation</a>, an <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/serum-foundation-brush?variant=45374288527548"">accompanying brush</a>, and <a href=""https://theoutsidein.com/products/floral-reserve-face-oil?variant=45384314257596"">Floral Reserve Face Oil</a>. </p>



<p>The foundation notably features skincare-grade levels of active ingredients like niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, and the face oil features a base of sweet almond, sunflower seed, and meadowfoam seed oils. “I really want to surprise,” Janes says. “That’s what that drives me the most with Hourglass and Outside In: the opportunity to create something special.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942860.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the foundation: IMO, it’s much more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skin-tint-foundation"">skin tint</a> (but a <em>really</em> good one) than actual foundation, since it looks virtually undetectable on skin and actually feels like hydrating skincare that happens to have pigment in the formula. Available in 25 sheer shades, the formula combines the dewiness of a hydrating serum base with light-diffusing spherical powders for a visibly even complexion with a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"">blurred, soft-focus effect</a>. And while the bottle looks and feels incredibly luxe, it’s secretly sustainable, too. “What took the longest [in the process] was actually the packaging because it’s made from a rice husk-derived biomaterial, and recycled glass,” Janes tells me. The result? A beautiful, stone-like texture that you’ll want to proudly leave on countertops.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-face-oil"">Face oils</a> might be relegated to a final step of skincare to “lock in” preceding products, but not this one. Janes loves using this as a primer (!) for Silk Serum Foundation to create a hydrated, glowy base that doesn’t require illuminating products. (Which, ironically, one could say she has mastered with Hourglass.) “I want to challenge myself to create really unique products,” she tells me. Think: Vegan brushes with a limestone composite handle and a forthcoming brick-and-mortar store that brings an experiential aspect of the brand to life. (If the packaging doesn’t give it away, Janes is passionate about design and world-building via her products.) </p>





<p>Priced at $64 for the foundation, $52 for the brush, and $72 for the face oil, these are as far from cheap thrills as it gets. But just as you might invest in a luxury candle for your home or an investment coat to wear all season long, Janes is hoping to inspire a sort of keepsake-like longevity with Outside In. “I want the customer to have that feeling of desirability and like, ‘<em>This is something I really cherish and love</em>,'” Janes says. “That’s what I’m trying to do with every product launch with Outside In.”</p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>.

<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942659.png?width=733&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=733%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/athleta-simone-biles-collaboration-interview"">Simone Biles</a> isn’t ready to get back in the gym yet. The Olympic gold medallist is the most decorated gymnast of all time and undoubtedly one of the most dominant and greatest athletes to ever grace sports, but these days, she’s taking time for herself. After competing for 22 years, <a href=""https://people.com/simone-biles-reveals-daring-sport-shes-learning-during-gymnastics-break-exclusive-11847531"">Biles is on a “break”</a> from gymnastics. Now, she’s focusing on hobbies like horseback riding, ice skating, pilates and long walks with her husband, Chicago Bears safety, <a href=""https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4331768/jonathan-owens"">Jonathan Owens</a>. On NFL game day, you can find her on the field giving <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/YahooSports/posts/simone-biles-out-in-the-chicago-snow-supporting-her-husband-jonathan-owens-%EF%B8%8F/1433346048154147/"">Owens a good luck kiss</a> (his one pre-game superstition) and showing out in various football-appropriate ‘fits. </p>



<p>Lately, football Sunday has turned into a who’s who of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/what-are-wags-rcna124752"">WAGs (wives and girlfriends)</a> — celebs like <a href=""https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-russell-wilson-s-wife-ciara-channels-james-bond-s-007-energy-faux-leather-bodycon-slit-dress"">Ciara</a>, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1424616/hailee-steinfeld-on-josh-allen-marriage"">Hailee Steinfeld,</a> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/cuffing-season-taylor-swift-travis-kelce"">Taylor Swift</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DHM2vZWJ9Tq/?hl=en"">Normani</a> are all partnered up with players — and their fashion makes weekly headlines. For Biles, game days are “so fun” but over Zoom, she says the attention is stressful: “I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man.” It’s a good thing <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=3034725"">Biles has her own collection with Athleta</a> to keep her looking good on game days. She even teased a custom Athleta look for the Bears’ upcoming faceoff against the Minnesota Vikings this weekend.</p>



<p>Biles and Athleta have been partnering for years but this marks the Olympian’s second women’s <em>and</em> girls’ collection for the activewear brand. Like her last Athleta collab, the collection is affordable, size inclusive, and includes intergenerational styles as well as accessories. Whether you’re looking for soft hoodies, performance-ready tights (Biles told R29 that the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583530002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=Elation%207%2F8%20Tight#pdp-page-content"">Elation Ultra High Rise Shine 7/8 Legging</a> is one of her all-time favorites), barrel-leg sweats, or a new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">fall jacket</a> (the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=583465002&amp;vid=1&amp;searchText=sateen%20bomber#pdp-page-content"">Sateen Bomber</a> is another Biles must-have), Biles has you covered with pieces that are deserving of a game-day catwalk. </p>



<p>Throughout our chat, Biles’ excitement for the collection is palpable but so is her joy for this current moment in her life. She’s letting herself be bad at things (“I’m learning every day!” she says) and she’s soaking in a softer, more “selfish” life. To put it simply, Biles seems <em>free</em>. It’s beautiful to behold, and even more inspiring that the woman who landed the hardest vault in the world so flawlessly that <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/sports/simone-biles-nails-yurchenko-double-pike-vault-at-world-championships-now-named-after-her/4730964/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">they renamed it after</a> her is now happily losing at darts to her friends. After all of Biles’ <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/08/10611521/simone-biles-statement-mental-health-olympics"">public mental health struggles</a>, the normal, quiet contentment she describes to me feels like her biggest win yet. </p>



<p>Here, she talks more about her Athleta collection, how she <em>really</em> feels about being called a “WAG”, and supporting her friend and former teammate <a href=""https://www.intlgymnast.com/main/jordan-chiles-cha-cha-chas-her-way-to-dancing-with-the-stars-semifinals/"">Jordan Chiles on<em> Dancing With The Stars. </em></a></p>



<p><strong>Refinery29 Unbothered: Congrats on the collection! The pieces look so comfortable and chic. Tell me about this collection and how it aligns with how you approach working out.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Biles:</strong> It’s very different. It’s the boldest collection that we’ve had thus far. I’m obviously biased, but this is one of my favorite collections. We have followed some of the trends but really, I always say, that you can take it from the mat to conferences or whatever it is. It doesn’t have to be just for the gym. It’s my go-to travel style, as well as if I’m taking a pilates class with my husband. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942663.png?width=767&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=767%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>What are the pieces in the collection that everyone needs?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> There’s a couple. I’m going to start with the <a href=""https://athleta.gap.com/browse/sale/sale-accessories?cid=50012"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">sateen bucket bag</a>. That is just such a fashionable piece. It’s just a really cute accessory. And I think people are going to love to layer it, as well as the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shop/product/elation-ultra-high-rise-shine-7-8-legging-11781706"">Elation Shine Leggings</a>, those have a subtle zebra print, which you can’t really tell until you’re up close. It just adds something extra without being overpowering. That’s really, really cute and fashionable. We have the sateen bomber jacket that in the fall and the winter, I just put over everything. We also have the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBos7DTS2Nb/"">Forever Fleece sweatpants,</a> which are a barrel leg, and that is just so fun. What I love about Athleta so much is that everyone can wear it. We try to be inclusive — there’s extra extra small, all the way to extra large, as well as tall and petite sizing. And for me, at 4’8, that’s perfect. But then we got my girl, [Olympic swimmer] <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katieledecky/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Katie Ledecky,</a> over here, wearing tall. We don’t want it to be one size fits all. We want everyone to be able to rock it, especially through this fall and this winter weather. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p><cite>simone biles</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>For so many of us, working out and going to the gym is a hobby or something we do to stay healthy. For you, it’s been your job. How do you separate the work of staying active from the joy of it and doing it just because it makes you feel good? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Now, I’ve started to explore other hobbies that still include working out, but it just looks a little bit different. Right now, although I’m not in the gym 24/7, I’m in my horseback riding lessons, and I’m about to pick up ice skating lessons because I feel like gymnastics, although it was working out, it was just it was so much fun for me and you don’t even realize you’re exercising. So I wanted to feel that similar feeling. I took up horseback riding because going to a gym for me and doing pilates and all that stuff seems a little bit scary and daunting, but if you put it as a hobby, and say “I’m working out for an hour or so,” it feels a little bit easier. I’m about to start doing my ice skating lessons. I’ve already called the ice rink. I know they’re tired of hearing from me<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>What made you decide to do ice skating?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>The ​​rink is literally three minutes from my house and since I pass it all the time going to and from the airport, I’m like,<em> okay, that’s going to be a fun, little hobby.</em> I walk my dog and I have a weighted vest but just going on walks and seeing the leaves change in the fall is also fun for me. I don’t think I’m ready to just get into a gym just yet, unless it’s a girls’ activity and we’re doing pilates or we’re doing something cute. I don’t think I’m ready. I still want to have fun with it. Just random sidequests. </p>



<p><strong>I’m Canadian so I love to see Black girls doing winter sports. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yes! We can do it all. I’ve never seen as much representation as I have these days, and it’s so exciting. It’s inspiring me. At the end of the day, I don’t just have to be a gymnast. I can do it all because I’ve seen <em>us</em> do it all.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, you can. One thing we love seeing you do is show up on NFL game days supporting your husband. Will we be seeing a custom Athleta game day set soon?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah! It’s coming soon. We’re planning on not this weekend but the next weekend in Minnesota. A little custom bomber going on, okay! Got a little custom action coming. </p>



<p><strong>Take me through what goes on behind your game-day fashion. How do you put your outfits together for games? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I really try to base it on the weather and where they’re playing. My husband wants me to wear more navy and orange [for the team’s colors], but I’m always going with the blacks and the whites and the grays and the neutrals. I’m trying to implement a little bit more of the Bears’ colors. But other than that, I really base it off of the weather. I know later this year when we play in San Francisco, you can get a little bit more cute and fashionable, because for me, with my height, it’s so hard to be cute and look fashionable [in the cold] when I’m just going to walk around looking like a marshmallow. I try to implement certain things like that. But definitely, we have a couple things coming, and so I’m really excited about that. But weather first and foremost, and comfortability, comfortability, comfortability! And movement! </p>



<p><strong>I saw a headline today that said: ‘Is Simone Biles NFL’s Best WAG?’ How do you feel about that title? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I don’t know about that! We still got Ciara, we got Normani. We can all fit in that space! There’s room for all of us. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942671.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>It feels like there’s so much attention on WAGs, specifically football wives and girlfriends. How do you feel about the term WAG and being a part of that club with, as you said, with Ciara and Normani, and then there’s [Hailee Steinfeld and Taylor Swift] and all these people?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I don’t mind the word WAG, because really, I’m just showing up and supporting my husband. Although the fashion is so much fun to do, I’m really just there to go support my man, and that is really important that we get to show up and support one another. We’re always working so hard, and we have a limited amount of time with each other. We don’t know how long each of us are going to be professional athletes playing on a stage like this. So it’s really just fun for everyone to show up and support. I don’t mind sharing the space. </p>



<p>It’s so much fun. But again, there are a lot of eyes. I can wear a sweatsuit like this to a game, but I was telling my husband that every time I go on the field, even though I’m just supporting you, photos are everywhere. And that part stresses me out, because I just want to be relaxed. At the last game, I just did a messy bun, a sweat suit, and that was that. But you always have to pop off and I wish we didn’t. I wish we didn’t have to walk the runway so much. I’m just there supporting my man, but I know how much it is going to be highlighted.</p>



<p><strong>I can imagine that it gets stressful, especially because it’s every week. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I’m only on the field because that’s my husband’s good luck thing. He knows that he has to have me on the sideline. He said that’s his one thing. He’s not superstitious at all, but he’s like, “I know I have to have my girl on the field, get that good luck kiss, and then we’re good.” If not, y’all would never see me down there. I would be up in the stands hiding like y’all would never see me. But that’s my husband’s thing so that’s why I do it. </p>



<p><strong>That is really sweet!</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> I’d be hiding. I don’t like the attention — never have, and maybe never will. That stuff stresses me out so bad, I will be hiding as much as possible. I don’t like all of this attention but you get used to it, I guess. But it’s stress! Anxiety! I just want to just go do my thing and watch in peace and quiet. Next year, I think I’m going to stay home for the away games. I just can’t do it. I’m just so stressed. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes logistics that goes into it as well. It’s not the easiest to try to get me into a stadium, either.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> It’s really important to listen to your body and your mind, because that literally can change the trajectory of your life. Be selfish, show up for yourself. </p><cite>simone biles </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Speaking of stress, I’m also an anxious girlie. We’re Unbothered so we always like to do a Black girl mental health check in. You’ve been so outspoken about mental health and the importance of therapy, especially Therapy Thursdays. Is there a piece of advice or something you’ve learned in therapy that you can share with us, with our audience, who are mostly Black women? Give us some energy! We need it! </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>I would say the one piece of advice that I have is you have to take that mental time to yourself and those personal days, because it really does change how you feel, talk about yourself, what your life looks like. So I would say, take those personal days. It’s really important to stay in tune and to listen to your body and your mind, because that literally can change the trajectory of your life. Be selfish, show up for yourself. We’re so in tune with showing up for everyone else, but at the end of the day, we neglect a little bit of our personal space and our well being. You have to show up for yourself first and foremost. Put on your favorite tunes, some Cardi B. Women are so powerful. We can do anything we put our minds to. And showing up for yourself is a win. We have to put ourselves first.</p>



<p><strong>One of the things that is so inspiring about you is that you are the best. And in being the best gymnast in the world, the best athlete in the world, you inspire me to think I can be the best at what I do. But I also think of the pressure or expectation that comes with that. What’s something you’re just OK at, and is there freedom in being mediocre sometimes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Every day with me and my husband, we’re learning new recipes. Since I’ve done my craft for so long, over 22 years, it’s really hard for me. I love learning new things, but I’m always learning, and keen to keep learning. It never ends. I’m learning every day. I know I’m not going to be the best at it. We even did a wine and sip the other day. Did my painting look the best? Absolutely not. But I don’t care. I’m not trying to be the best. I didn’t train 22 years to paint so it looks like what it looks like, and every day when I’m doing new recipes in the house, because now I love to cook, I love to cook, it’s OK. </p>



<p>I’m even trying to get better at my makeup and my hair. I was just bugging one of my makeup artists yesterday, like, girl, you really try not to have me be great at makeup, because I keep asking you to send me the tutorial, and she finally sent it to me yesterday. So now today, I’m going to go look at it, and I’m going to go practice my makeup. We always have more to learn. I’m okay with that. I love playing darts. I love playing ping pong. At our new house, which we sign for next week, we have a ping pong table and a dart board. Am I the best at it? No, but it’s about making memories, having fun and just still learning.</p>



<p><strong>I love that but I can also picture the competitive spirit in you trying to come out at the paint and sip. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>You know, that’s actually so funny, because everyone thinks I’m going to be so competitive at whatever we do, but I literally don’t care if I’m last place. Every time, I’m still going to play, I’m still going to have a good spirit, good energy, because it’s about making those memories. Obviously for them, they’re like, “I beat Simone Biles at something!” I don’t care. I don’t care. Let’s just have a good time. Let’s kiki, have a good time, good conversation, good vibes, good energy. And that’s a win in my book, because we’re not going to be good at everything. I’m incredibly gifted, and to do what I do every day has been such a blessing and to come out on top. But I also know that’s not normal. I know that’s very rare. So I’m just incredibly blessed and thankful. </p>

<p><strong>That’s inspiring that Simone Biles can be so chill about losing or being bad at something. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Yeah, well I never wanted to be the best at gymnastics. I just wanted to go to college, hopefully get a college scholarship, and that was it. Obviously, the cards fell in place, and I got to do way more than my wildest dreams. But even as a young girl, did I want to go to the Olympics? No. Every one of my teammates said that. So I said it. I don’t even know what the Olympics was. I saw it in 2008 on the TV. And I was like, <em>Whoa. How’d they do that? </em>But I didn’t even want to go there. At that point. I saw the girls [gymnastics team] and they went to Italy. And I was like, <em>how do I go to Italy? I want to compete in Italy. </em>I never wanted to go to the Olympics. You just dream big and dream bigger.</p>



<p><strong>You were dreaming dreams you didn’t even know you had. Speaking of your teammates, you competed on Dancing with the Stars and now so is Jordan Chiles. She’s killing it. Are you watching? How proud of Jordan are you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>Oh my god, I’m so proud of her. She’s totally in her element. This is what she was made to do. She’s always been an entertainer, and obviously that goes hand-in-hand with gymnastics. On floor [routines], we do have to entertain a little bit, but this is her space completely. And she gets to be 100% herself. People get to see her personality shine. It’s a little glimpse of what we’ve gotten to see over the past couple of years, but now she gets to share it with the whole world.</p>



<p><strong>Did you give her any advice going into the season? </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB: </strong>She needed no advice. She is so confident in who she is, and her personality is so big. I was too shy for that. Now I think I’m a little bit more comfortable in who I am, but this is perfect for her. So there was no advice, just “good luck, have fun.” And I told her, “you’re going to be on that show one day.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” Girl, look at you now! I said “they’re going to keep asking you and bugging you to do it.” And she’s like, “No, I don’t think so.” And now she’s like, “why are you always right?” I know these things. It’s like a sixth sense.</p>



<p><strong>I love being the friend who’s always right. </strong></p>



<p><strong>SB:</strong> Yeah, I get badgered about that a lot. “You’re just always right!” OK. And am! </p>

<p>Two years ago, I was in a pretty bad place. I cried, like, every day. Not that you’d know it — I appeared on millions of Americans’ TV screens every Monday night with a smile plastered on my face, reminding everyone that summer should be fun. I was thrust into the national spotlight after being cast in a reality show. There, I met (and started dating) a man who was just…not very nice to me. But sometimes <em>really</em> nice. And then really <em>not</em> nice again. I think the kids call it a “toxic relationship.” So I was navigating that, which left me in a spiral of insecurity and depression and anxiety, and simultaneously dealing with snarky commentary from the millions of people watching it play out.</p>



<p>I felt like I was under a magnifying glass, with everyone on earth seeing the worst parts of my life up close. All I could think about was how I was perceived, so I started living my life according to what I thought these people thought of me. In short, I was living two lives: one of red carpets and toothy grins, which mostly felt disingenuous — and one that was more honest, but totally miserable. It was only when my relationship ended that I realized how much of a toll it had taken on me, both physically and mentally. There wasn’t anything wrong with <em>me</em>, I realized — there was something wrong with…well, <em>that</em>. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941604.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>So I decided to embark on a healing journey (insert sparkle emojis here). In November 2023, I overhauled my life, determined to “do the work.” Signs of trauma had already shown up in my body: I was inflamed, I was bloated, and my skin was breaking out. I researched anti-inflammatory nutrition and changed my workout routine accordingly. I took care of my inner self: I went to therapy, I journaled, I unpacked some hard stuff, I took breaks from social media, I spent quality time with friends and family. </p>



<p>Throughout this two-year journey, I learned to prioritize my mental and physical health. But the biggest takeaway was learning about health in a whole new light — one that’s not entirely accessible nor intuitive. There’s a dearth of health information written by women, for women, and about women. For example: the importance of lifting weights. I’m on a body recomposition journey (sounds intimidating, I know, but hear me out) that’s basically an effort to eat more protein, carbohydrates, and fats. All it really means is that I’m trying to gain muscle, because skeletal muscle mass is directly correlated to how long we live. Simply put: I want to be strong. I want to build muscle so that I can live longer, so that I can pick things up, so that I don’t get injured when I work out. So that even if my heart gets broken, my mind and body remain in one piece.</p>



<p>And to be completely honest, I can’t do it without my <a href=""https://www.sharkninja.com/ninja-blendboss-tumbler-blender-with-26oz-travel-tumbler-cyberspace/DB301CCY.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ninja BlendBOSS™</a>. I’ve always been a smoothie girly, but my protein shakes have become an integral part of my daily routine, especially once I discovered that I needed to drastically up my protein intake. Now I can hardly make it out the door without my stomach growling if I don’t start my morning by blending up a protein shake (mine tastes like dessert, I swear), and I can’t recover afterwards without my 100 ounces of water, powdered supplements, or my homemade electrolyte concoction.</p>



<p>The Ninja BlendBOSS™ is kind of like an everything-in-one product — it’s a blender, a tumbler, a bottle, conveniently housed in an easy-to-use (and super chic) vessel. It’s for the busy mom on the go, for the hydration queen whose emotional support object is her water bottle (me), for the fitness It girl who doesn’t like stray from her routine (also me). </p>



<p>If you’ve never fueled with a goal in mind, it’s hard to even understand what kind of a lifesaver this is. I always do a big existential sigh when women say they avoid lifting weights because they’re “afraid of getting bulky.” If only they knew how much food they’d have to eat to achieve such a thing. Since I’m trying to hit 125g of protein, 225g of carbs, and 50g of fat, adding protein powder, peanut butter, bananas, and Greek yogurt into a shake allows me to consume at <em>least</em> 30g of protein before I’m even out the door in the morning. Thanks to the Ninja BlendBOSS™, I’m hitting my numbers in a way that’s healthy <em>and</em> enjoyable. </p>



<p>For almost all my life, the driving force when it came to my physical appearance was to look a certain way for other people, to fit what I thought was the beauty standard…which, to be blunt, was skinny. As a kid, with my blonde hair and blue eyes, I grew up hearing that I looked like a doll, and I spent my whole life feeling like I was supposed to look the part. That meant being a size double zero, having visible abs, and making sure my hair, makeup, and nails were always done. </p>



<p>I should mention that I was a ballerina growing up, with the plan to go pro (I lost out to a career-ending injury at 16). Anyone who’s ever done ballet will know that many studios are breeding grounds for body image issues. Clad in light pink leotards and tights, dancers almost invariably hear “I can see your lunch,” (as in…they can see your stomach) more times than they hear “great work” before the age of 13.</p>



<p>Historically, women are trained to think that getting in shape means losing weight — and losing weight means more cardio and less food. For so long, that was <em>my</em> mindset, too. I used to frequent HIIT classes, which are optimized for higher heart rates and dropping pounds. But two of my trainers over the years — Taylor Rae Roman and Madison Feeney — both of whom I now consider friends, reshaped my thinking. Through them, I learned to prioritize strong over skinny.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941605.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ll confess: When I first set out to build muscle, I was terrified. As a dancer, creator, and public figure, I’ve always been hyper-aware of what my body looked and felt like. I thought: <em>What if I look in the mirror and don’t recognize myself? </em>I already know that there will be times I pick myself apart — pinching parts of me, second-guessing, and worrying what other people think. Those are habits you don’t unlearn in a day.</p>



<p>But the motivation to do this is for myself — not for other people. And it’s not easy, but if I’ve learned anything on this journey, it’s that <em>everything</em> worth doing is hard. Already, I’m seeing a difference. Just this morning, I noticed that my body looked a little bigger. But I also noticed something more important, more exciting: the voice inside my head that shouted out my wins drowned out the voice that whispered my fears. I picked up a 45-pound weight instead of a 40-pound one. I climbed the five flights of stairs to my apartment without feeling out of breath. I felt hungry for every meal, because, finally, I’m supporting my body with nutrients in a way that actually makes my metabolism go faster. It all feels so rewarding and encouraging, because it’s how your body is<em> supposed</em> to operate. To the untrained eye, these changes are too subtle to notice, but they’re a big deal to me.</p>



<p>You know the saying, “You have to love yourself before someone else can love you”? I really used to think it was BS. But I must say: I’m not sure it’s a coincidence that the first time I started to love myself — six-ish months into my healing journey — is also when my boyfriend and I started dating. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this is the healthiest, happiest relationship I’ve ever known. Every single thing that’s good in your life comes from loving yourself. If you take care of yourself, you can feel strong, powerful. Beautiful. Lovable.</p>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve made it this far, you must be wondering where I’ve ended up. To answer your question: I’m still in it. Because despite society convincing us that there’s a “before” and “after” for every journey, the truth is: It’s never really over. But I have settled on my destination. After all this soul searching, this healing, I feel like it’s my duty to share this message with other women who are going through the same things. I know how many of them are 30 minutes into their excruciating spin classes, thinking, <em>If I’m just one inch smaller, maybe someone will love me</em>. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to outsource your identity and self-respect to the opinions of others. It sucks. So if I can help even one person change that mindset, or even pursue a goal of being stronger and healthier for <em>themselves</em>, and no one else…then I’d go through all the pain again, so we could find ourselves here, together, now. It would all be worth it.</p>

The trio is sitting side by side (by side) in New York City during the movie’s press junket and their easy rapport and deadpan comedic timing is as pitch perfect offscreen as it is on the big screen. </p>

In this sequel, they reunite to recruit three new illusionists (Greenblatt, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dominic.sessa/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Sessa</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2aos_Xvq1H/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Justice Smith</a>) for their toughest job yet: the theft of the world’s biggest diamond. The timing of the release has made for some <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQF0cdDgfRX/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hilarious memes</a> as the internet continues to revel in the absurdity and fantasy of the real-life Louvre heist. In a time when <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/business/us-unemployment-rate-near-4-year-high-labor-market-hits-stall-speed-2025-09-05/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">unemployment is on the rise</a> and the rich are running amok and wreaking havoc on the poor — and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/us-supreme-court-trump-snap-food-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">social services in place to support them</a> — who doesn’t love the idea of rogue rascals sticking it to a bougie institution by running off with its crown jewels? That’s exactly what you see, and get, with <em>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. </em></p>



<p>Fittingly, the movie’s big bad villain is a white South African named Veronika Vanderberg (played by Pike who is having the time of her life as the delightfully devilish foe) and it’s full of the escapist eat-the-rich energy that seems to be permeating the zeitgeist now more than ever (recession indicator). Plus, the movie is about as anti-capitalist and anti-billionaire as a popcorn flick about magicians can be. </p>



<p>“Everyone needs a little bit of magic right now,” Fisher says when I ask about the film’s anarchist spirit. She’s right. This instalment is just as silly and entertaining as the previous two (with another twist you won’t see coming), which is exactly the vibe it feels like audiences are craving. And these three women from different generations who occupy three very different spaces in Hollywood — the Gen Z rising star (Greenblatt), the comedy queen primed for a comeback (Fisher), and the Oscar-nominated powerhouse (Pike) — are the perfect trio to pull off the impossible: sprinkling a little joy onto our timelines. </p>



<p>Here, along with gushing over Greenblatt, the stars talk about bonding with the stacked cast, the illusion of Hollywood, and decide which pop stars would make the best magicians. </p>



<p><strong>Refinery29: Isla, you are returning to this franchise after a decade while Rosamund and Ariana are new to it. How did you welcome the new cast to this world and did you give them any advice? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Isla Fisher: </strong>At the beginning, it was quite interesting. There was a bit of a divide. There were the old horsemen and we would go to set on time, no offense. Oh, we’d stand on our marks waiting, and we’d wait for the new ponies to show up, and they would be very suspicious of us and use words like “rizz” and “slay,” which we didn’t understand [<em>laughs</em>]. Then, finally, I think it was the time that actually <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/morganfreeman/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Freeman</a> showed up on set that we were able to join together, and then we became the best of friends. All of us get on so well and it suddenly went from being two organisms to one loving family.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist…. Who is this magical unicorn that exists?</p><cite>isla fisher on ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund Pike: </strong>That’s the first day I showed up on set and I didn’t know [what to expect]. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I knew, and have always been a massive fan of [Rosamund’s] so I was so excited that she was joining us, because obviously she’s the most brilliant actor. I felt very comfortable right away with her. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana Greenblatt:</strong> Justice [Smith] and I were so excited the day [Rosamund] showed up. So excited [and] so nervous. It was the queen arriving. Justice and I have this ongoing competition for your love that you don’t know about. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Well, you came to my play so you’re winning.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I supported her when I was in London, and it was the best thing ever. But yeah, I feel like Dominic [Sessa], Justice, and I were equally nervous to join this already existing family. And they really welcomed us with open arms. And it was a quick bond. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11942505.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>Rosamund Pike as Veronika in Now You See Me: Now You Don’t. Photo Credit: Katalin Vermes</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rosamund, your character Veronika Vanderberg is such a good villain. You’re very good at playing characters we love to hate like in <em>I Care A Lot </em></strong><strong>and<em> Gone Girl,</em></strong><strong> for example. What is it about those roles that you are drawn to? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP</strong>: I hesitated to do this because I thought, <em>maybe nobody needs to see me do that again</em>. And then I realized it wasn’t exactly again, because Veronica is different. I mean, basically because she’s got a different accent, which is good enough for me [<em>laughs</em>]. Once I decided that she could sound different, I thought,<em> yeah, I’m going to do this</em>. Ruben [Fleischer], our director, promised that I would have a great time on this film and people say that, but he was absolutely right. We had a great time. I was sad to leave it behind. These guys need a good adversary, don’t they? And with Veronica, I was interested in whipping her character into a shape where she was having fun, and then I hoped that an audience would have fun watching her demise, because the more arrogant she can be, and the more pleasure she’s taking in herself for the longest time, then the greater the glee when you know she falls apart if she does. </p>



<p><strong>Ariana, your character June has this great, dry, dark sense of humor. She’s really smart but constantly underestimated because of her size and she’s a young girl. Why do you think teen girls are consistently underestimated and what did you enjoy about getting to explore that? </strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>. June is the definition of underestimated. She doesn’t flaunt what she can do, and she doesn’t really have to prove anything loudly to people. She just kind of lets it speak for herself when needed. And I think that was the most fun for me with June. When the time comes and when there’s danger ahead, she’s good. She doesn’t need anybody else. That was really fun.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It’s an unfortunate male-dominated world and they see a five-foot girl and they’re like, <em>you can do nothing</em>.</p><cite>ariana greenblatt</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And she did a lot of stunts. I’m just gonna, like, blow her up for a minute. [Ariana] is the most precise stunt person.<em> [Ariana laughs]. </em>You don’t laugh at this! This is genuine. What she can physically do — her prowess in the fight sequences that she does in this movie were amazing. I’ve seen her do it in other films, but seeing you do it on set, and watching you, particularly when you climb the wall and just you’re deeply athletic, which is, of course, impressive, but it translates into her stunts being another level. It was so cool to watch. You could be like Tomb Raider! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> It’s precision and power and accuracy. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah! And it’s control. It’s also bravery. You have to silence that inner voice to really perform it. And she does it perfectly.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Thank you. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong> And you look cool doing it, whereas I think I can do stuff like that but when I do it, I just don’t look cool. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Yeah, it’s a wedgie for mom, it doesn’t go well for us. It’s just bingo wings and wedgies [<em>laughs</em>]. No one wants that.</p>



<p><strong>AG:  </strong>Thank you. I appreciate it. </p>

<p><strong>Isla and Rosamund, listening to you talk and hype up Ariana, I want to know if there’s something you wish you knew at Ariana’s age that you would go back and tell your younger selves?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Everything. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Everything. But she already knows it. And I knew that about her before I even met her, because I have daughters. And they would give me Ariana quotes and I’d say, “Who said that?” And they’re like “Mommy, the actress from Barbie. She’s so forward thinking, she’s so progressive, she’s such a feminist.” And I was like, “Who is this magical unicorn that exists?” Back in our day, we used to talk about which boys liked us, and it was just so brilliant to meet her and have the wealth of her very unique perspective. She’s such an original thinker. She lives her life authentically. I’m sorry, this has turned into a talk show about you<em> [laughs]. </em></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I didn’t have any of that sort of smarts or eloquence or ideas that were beyond my knowledge. I feel like Arianna is such a much more global citizen than I was at that age. Here we are in New York and I remember the first time I came to New York. I just didn’t know what to do with the city or how to be in this city. You’re so well traveled. And I just remember looking at a bowl of berries, which didn’t even exist in London, and thinking, “America!”</p>



<p><strong>Ariana, what does it mean to you to hear these two talk about you like that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> It’s amazing. It’s so validating, especially from women like these two, and they’re so talented and they’re so intelligent, and I just love being in their presence and being able to work with them. I kind of just soaked up everything and more. It’s incredible. I feel like I never know what I’m saying or doing at all. So from an outsider’s perspective, knowing that I could be on the right path or that I’m doing something correct is really, really nice. I tend to be an overthinker, so it’s nice to be validated by people I would dream to be validated by. </p>



<p><strong><em>Now You See Me </em></strong><strong>is all about illusion, nothing is as it seems. You could say the same about Hollywood. Was there something in this industry that maybe isn’t as it appears from the outside looking in that surprised you to find out once you were in it? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Yeah, men take way longer in makeup than women! </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> And then they act like they’re really alpha, but they’ve got mascara on. It’s like, honey, I would listen to your opinion, but you have a foundation line that ends at your chin. </p>



<p><strong>AG</strong>:<em> [laughs] </em>Absolutely! They need their snacks and their massages. And it’s like we’re wearing a corset. For me, obviously, [you’re shooting] for months, so there’s the time of the month when you’re a woman and you have heels on and a corset and you just have to live life like that’s normal. And I just remember being like<em> Ow, it hurts.</em> And no one understood, except my fellow girls. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> We get it. We get it! I feel like the biggest surprise for me was the red carpet piece being so corporate. I always thought it was a moment to express yourself and just wear something that you like, but it’s a lot. It’s a business. It’s more of a business than maybe it appears from the outside.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>For me, what was shocking was how many like stories that I’ve heard about how people mistreat other people, like they think that they are better than everyone else that’s making them who they are. I’ve been getting my hair and makeup done and I hear stories. It’s not in my nature to even think that that’s acceptable or okay. But the people that seem super gracious, unfortunately they mistreat people.</p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Are you looking at me? [<em>laughs</em>] Where’s my coffee! </p>

<p><strong>OK, we’re going to end on some rapid fire questions. Who’s most likely to pull off a heist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Rosamund, obviously!</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Ariana.</p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> The duo! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I’ll tell you how to do it and she’ll execute. </p>



<p><strong>Which one of you is driving the getaway car?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Isla’s driving the getaway car.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Isla, you’ve got the car. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> Correct.<strong> </strong>I’m very good with a minivan. I know, it’s sexy. </p>



<p><strong>If you could have any magic ability, which one would you pick?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Getting my kids to eat vegetables! </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Oh god, invisibility.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Yes! </p>



<p><strong>Which pop star would make the best magician? </strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Dua Lipa because she sings that song “Levitating.”</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Eminem.</p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I was gonna say Charlie XCX. Or Billie [Eilish], because she’s a siren so she’ll lure your brain like Merritt [McKinney, played by Woody Harrelson]. She’ll do some mentalism. </p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>That’s four horsemen right there. </p>



<p><strong>That’s a good lineup. The Louvre heist was pulled off in seven minutes. What could you pull off in seven  minutes? </strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>I couldn’t even get out of bed in seven minutes.</p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> You know what’s weird about this? I do a seven- minute workout. There’s this thing that you can Google, and it’s called a seven-minute workout. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> I told you you have the legs of a teenager. </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> Nothing’s getting done in seven minutes. </p>



<p><strong>Which star sign would make the best horsemen illusionist?</strong></p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Scorpio! Cunning, manipulative. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Gemini, because don’t you have to be like two different people?</p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Yeah, Gemini. </p>



<p><strong>What’s something that you would rant about for 29 seconds? What’s the thing you want to go off on?</strong></p>



<p><strong>RP: </strong>Okay, I’m ranting about those little foil things that you get at the end of a tube of toothpaste when you really need to brush your teeth and you need to be really fast, and then you get the cap off, and there’s one of those funny foil things, and you’ve got to get your nail under it. Those things really piss me off. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>I’m going to go with parent chat groups. I’m on one right now that’s done my head in. If somebody just writes, “Thanks,” your phone just vibrates for hours and hours. You don’t need to thank anyone. Just stop texting. And then when you ask something real, like, <em>“What day is book week?”</em> and <em>“Is it like pajama day?”</em> it’s silence, crickets. You can’t get anyone on there. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> And we should never say thanks to an AI either. It’s apparently using up loads and loads of energy just to say thanks to people. </p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>Or using it in general. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> Being polite costs masses and masses of wattage. </p>



<p><strong>IF:</strong> I thought if you weren’t polite, then when [AI] comes to take over us, they’ll just pick all the rude ones first.</p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong><em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>I want to rant about mean people on the internet and in real life. You’re not better than anybody. Seriously, like, learn some manners. I can’t stand it. </p>



<p><strong>RP:</strong> This is what we’re talking about. I’m talking about the silver foil at the end of a toothpaste and she’s talking about something global and relevant. I’m utterly selfish. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>You’ve just highlighted the generational difference<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>AG: </strong>There’s so much hatred. It’s so useless, it’s so annoying. It’s so much easier to just be chill. </p>



<p><strong>IF: </strong>Take the silver thing off the toothpaste! </p>



<p><strong>AG:</strong> And don’t say thank you to AI! And AI actresses don’t exist! </p>

rss,www.refinery29.com,https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mia-goth-frankenstein-costume-interview?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss,1762812840,Mia Goth Explains Hidden Details In Frankenstein Costumes: “That Was Deliberate”,"Mia Goth Explains Hidden Details In Frankenstein Costumes: “That Was Deliberate”

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2025"">newest adaptation</a> of Mary Shelley’s timeless novel <em>Frankenstein</em> has captivated audiences, with director Guillermo del Toro’s film being praised for being mostly faithful to the source material. Starring Australia’s own Jacob Elordi as The Creature and Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, somehow it’s Mia Goth, as Elizabeth Lavenza, who steals the show — adorned by Tiffany &amp; Co. jewels and 19th Century gowns. Her extensive wardrobe for <em>Frankenstein</em> came from the mind of Emmy Award-nominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/materialists-dakota-johnson-outfits-costumes"">costume designer</a> Kate Hawley, who has worked on projects such as <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> and <em>Crimson Peak</em>. Goth’s character Elizabeth has an interest in entomology and botany, so Hawley included nods to beetles and other insects through patterns and garment shapes. Along with wasp-waisted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/how-to-style-corsets"">tight corsets</a>, certain fabrics were also chosen to mimic paper-thin beetle wings.</p>



<p>“With the green dress… that design was inspired by butterflies, and the patterns on butterfly wings,” Goth tells <em>Refinery29 Australia</em>. “[This] was something that Guillermo and Kate were exploring a lot with Elizabeth and [with] all of the costumes, everything was thought through.” To create unique insect-like patterns, Hawley studied both cellular structures and the anatomy of beetles. “It’s all about echoing those insect and beetle-like qualities, just fitted to the period,” Hawley says in the production notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941847.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>Jewellery was also key to defining Goth’s character, with her blue outfit featuring a Tiffany &amp; Co. signature piece from the early 1900s. The Louis Comfort Tiffany necklace is made up of blue glass beetle motifs in a gold setting. “We wanted to pull pieces that were from the age of Mary Shelley so that you could study the choices our designers were making at that time,” Christopher Young, Vice President and Creative Director of Tiffany Patrimony and Global Creative Visual Merchandising, said in a <a href=""https://www.tiffany.com/world-of-tiffany/collaborations/netflix-frankenstein.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">press video</a>. The result is what jewellers describe as blurring the line “between jewellery and art”.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941846.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>One of Elizabeth’s most striking dresses is her final look, a white dress where white satin ribbons wrap around her arms. Made to resemble surgical bandages, it pays homage to both Elizabeth’s fate and The Creature’s origin. “That was deliberate,” Goth says. “That was there to mimic The Creature and his band aids that he has when he’s first born.” This white dress also features multiple layers of fabric that capture the light in an interesting way, a design element thought through by both the costume designer and director. “Guillermo wanted Elizabeth to be very ethereal, and there’s an iridescence and ephemeral nature to some of those colours and fabrics that helped us [portray this],” Hawley notes.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941845.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=682&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A341"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also a religious nod in many of Elizabeth’s outfits, particularly seen through the use of bonnets. “Religious language is a big part of Elizabeth’s character, and that bonnet is like a halo,” Hawley explains. “Mia has such an amazing, mercurial face  — one of the first fittings we had, we put that bonnet on her, and we put the yellow veil over her, and she just became this other creature.” While Goth jokingly tells <em>R29 </em>she couldn’t breathe in her restrictive wardrobe, stepping into the period pieces helped frame her performance as Elizabeth. “That was helpful, because that’s exactly how a woman in the Victorian world would feel, and it formed how I moved and how I sat,” Goth says. “I felt once I started to see where the costumes were headed, I found my character, Elizabeth, kind of from the outside in this time around. </p>



<p>“So, [by] seeing what they were doing with her on the outside, I was then able to kind of figure out what was going on in the inside.” </p>
