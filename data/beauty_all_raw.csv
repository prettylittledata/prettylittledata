<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead. </em></strong>There’s been a lot of talk about <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-spoilers-ending-explained-1236587506/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the door</a>. If you’ve seen <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Xubj7lazE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good</a></em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2Xubj7lazE"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">,</a> you know exactly which door I mean. During “<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/5shGj5OOnpmg4tQlFjyzZY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the movie’s title track, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GGs4fFd-kd0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ariana Grande’s Glinda</a> dramatically say their goodbyes to each other through a dilapidated barrier, and through tears, of course. At the end of this scene, <a href=""https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1425367/cynthia-erivo-reveals-wicked-for-good-unscripted-moment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glinda and Elphaba</a> exchange three words that — until now — <a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/awards/jon-m-chu-wicked-for-good-spoilers-ending-explained-1236587506/"">were forbidden</a> in the world composer Stephen Schwartz created: “I love you.” </p>



<p>The moment, like most things in director<a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Jon M. Chu’s </a><em><a href=""https://www.goldderby.com/film/2025/wicked-for-good-director-jon-m-chu-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked</a></em> universe, is devastatingly emotional, maximized to elicit big feelings from the audience, and anchored by two performances that, no matter how saccharine the material, pull the film back down to the ground. If “<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7569880837202758943"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Defying Gravity</a>” was a confrontation between a budding radical and a well-meaning white moderate about how power corrupts and divides, “For Good” can be read as the reconciliation between two people with different approaches to the same problem: fighting facism. But also, it’s simply about the power of friendship. It’s about how friendship molds you, how it can be the thing that heals and bonds, and the relationship that reorganizes the molecules in your brain, shifting everything you thought you knew about yourself and the world around you. Friendship is what makes us whole. It’s what makes us human. And, most importantly, <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2025/film/news/box-office-wicked-for-good-opening-day-1236588784/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good</a> </em>is about how Elphaba and Glinda are the great loves of each other’s lives. </p>



<p>If you didn’t get all that from two witches singing harmonies only celestial beings could hit, maybe <em>Wicked</em> isn’t for you. And that’s OK. Some of my fellow critics have had harsh reactions to <em>Wicked: For Good. </em><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2025/11/20/nx-s1-5612585/wicked-for-good-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo"">NPR’s<em> </em>headline reads</a>, “This could have all been one movie” and <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/movies/articles/wicked-good-review-finale-needlessly-170000405.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEOlEe0qKSwP09FIjZ8fkIvB65y1-yLw9Gwhlx9U5mBVejoizfBpQBPL9x8XJ6Xo0ddICnDXrBraIYpAn0iMZhqVawawoz_F5MjPKzI41Lr0TwMFvIg59D9-xSRYaX7_f1OewVAhCiaZham6CFIMDay2QscPapnsx2nkpDzEIZom"">IndieWire writes</a>, “Finale of a Needlessly Two-Part Movie Musical  Adaptation Doesn’t Go Out on a High Note.” <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/wicked-for-good-movie-review-23fe7244c429facf27442cbff470f67f"">AP News</a> went with a nod to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>: “sorry, my pretty, ‘For Good’ doesn’t delight.” <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/11/wicked-for-good-movie-review/685003/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Atlantic:</a> “Wicked: For Good Bursts Its Own Bubble.” <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-current-cinema/wicked-for-good-is-very-very-bad"">The New Yorker’s review by Justin Chang</a> is the most ruthless, calling the movie “very, very bad” while chiding its “dreadful filmmaking.” Every one of these reviews make some fair points about the clunky inclusion of Dorothy, her cohort, and the effectiveness of <em>Wicked</em> as a prequel to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/01/9321775/judy-garland-actress-true-story-life-death"">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, but most of these critics didn’t like the first one either. And since, famously, part two of the musical has never been revered as highly as part one, those reactions were inevitable. But what so many of these detractors see as <em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wicked: For Good’s </a></em><a href=""https://www.slashfilm.com/2031892/wicked-for-good-first-movie-biggest-weakness-not-resolved/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">weaknesses</a> — its sincerity, optimistic politics, tidy resolutions, and feel-good messaging — are actually its strengths. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>What so many detractors see as <em>Wicked: For Good’s </em>weaknesses — its sincerity, optimistic politics, tidy resolutions, and feel-good messaging — are actually its strengths. </p><cite>kathleen newman-bremang</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In a time when everyone’s a critic but no one’s an expert (an Amazon mic and a TikTok account do not a specialist make) and when standom has made it nearly impossible to share a dissenting opinion without heaps of hate, doxxing, and backlash, I’m never going to knock well-written, thoughtful criticism (even if I think some of these reviews are written by men who just don’t like musicals, or women emoting). But I can disagree. And I don’t think <em>Wicked: For Good</em> is a disappointment. It’s a pretty faithful adaptation of the second act of an ambitious musical that aims to please. The <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-for-good-movie-broadway-musical-differences-11852997"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">changes from the Broadway musical</a> to the big screen (like giving Glinda more depth and making <a href=""https://people.com/wicked-marissa-bode-teases-part-2-exclusive-8753054"">Nessarose’s arc less ableist</a>) absolutely work to make the narrative more cohesive, modern, and to deliver satisfying moments that make sure moviegoers get their money’s worth. </p>



<p>One of those moments is “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO8SiN8H6EQ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">For Good</a>,” the musical number we’ve waited a whole year for. Erivo and Grande have gotten flack for their <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/movies/wicked-for-good-2-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">joint press interviews</a> that people perceive as codependent, cloying, and overly emotional. But once you see these two sing<em> “Who can say if I’ve been/ changed for the better/ But because I knew you/ I have been changed for good”</em> it starts to make sense. First of all, they are theater kids. Being overly emotional is their whole thing. Also, it’s refreshing to see two performers care so deeply about their work that they can’t help but cry about it. I’d take this energy over indifference any day. To hear <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HRhj5zRKN4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Grande and Erivo tell it</a>, the parallels <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a69474524/ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-friendship-timeline/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">between their friendship</a> and the one we see on screen are vast, and since they’ve been sitting with this material for years, they’ve developed a bond that formed long before they locked fingers in a junket while <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/11/26/wicked-ariana-grande-and-cynthia-erivos-holding-space-meme-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">holding space for the lyrics of “Defying Gravity.</a>” And once you are sitting in the theater locked in on the culmination of Elphaba and Glinda’s saga, you’ll forget about the off-camera speculation and public perceptions and drift away to Oz to be serenaded by the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda The Good who have, against all odds, found their way back to each other. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944468.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Jonathan Bailey is Fiyero in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By the time we get to “For Good” in the film, Elphaba has been living in hiding attempting to expose the Wizard’s lies. She’s on a quest to free Oz’s animals who have been stripped of their voices and their rights. Her image (caricature posters depicting her with exaggerated features are so comically evil, they are reminiscent of <a href=""https://jimcrowmuseum.ferris.edu/coon/homepage.htm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jim Crow-era, anti-Black imagery</a>) is projected all over Oz as a symbol of hate and villainy. Conversely, Glinda has everything she’s ever wanted — she’s risen to fame as a beloved symbol of Goodness — but still doesn’t have any magic of her own. With the help of Madame Morrible (a consistently uneven <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7436842946059570478"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Yeoh</a>), she’s keeping up illusions to maintain the Wizard’s tyrannical rule. Glinda is literally living in a bubble to upkeep the lies. She’s everything Elphaba warned her of becoming in “Defying Gravity.” Glinda is about to marry Fiyero (played perfectly by <a href=""https://people.com/jonathan-bailey-is-sexiest-man-alive-2025-11842000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sexiest Man Alive, Jonathan Bailey</a>), now the captain of the Wizard’s guard, who hasn’t stopped his search for his real love, Elphaba. </p>



<p>It would be easy to read the dynamic between Elphaba, Fiyero and Glinda as just another literary love triangle, with two girls torn between a dashing prince, but as charming and <em>hot </em>as Fiyero is (I broke into a sweat during the chaste yet horny “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OdTKfYqBXY"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">As Long As You’re Mine</a>”), he’s really not that important. While it’s beautiful to see Elphaba find the romantic love she deserves, and the origin story of the Scaregrow is the strongest part of the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures"">Wizard of Oz</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/08/73723/wizard-of-oz-75-anniversary-pictures""> </a>tie-in, Fiyero mainly exists as a test of Glinda and Elphaba’s friendship. On her wedding day, Glinda has to process the fact that her ex-best friend and her fiancé are about to run away together. The tables have turned and now, <em>she</em> is Not That Girl. Glinda has lived a privileged life as the popular girl, always chosen, always winning, and now she’s lost not just her groom, but the bubble she so carefully constructed is also about to burst. Later, when Fiyero risks his life to save Elphaba by pointing a gun at Glinda’s face, you see her accept his love for Elphaba and her own. She calls his bluff, and resigns herself to the fact that they both love Elphaba. Of course they do. Grandé is heartbreakingly magnificent in this moment, playing Glinda’s conflict with painful awareness. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity and softness of platonic affection. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s clear that <em>Wicked: For Good</em>  is invested in Glinda’s redemption. She goes from self-serving mean girl to the arbiter of all things good. It’s fun to watch this transformation unfold, thanks in large part to Grande’s performance, but it’s also a fairytale (I like her but I still think Glinda is a spineless, mediocre fraud who ain’t shit). We know in real life that opportunists rarely change their tune, that white women who turn their backs on their Black (ahem, green) counterparts for their own self interests do so callously and with gleeful disregard for their humanity. But in a world of talking Tin Men and cowardly lions, why can’t the fantasy include the moral salvation of the girl who “groveled in submission/ to feed [her] own ambition”? It’s a nice story, even though it comes at the expense of Elphaba’s freedom.</p>



<p>If I have one major critique of <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>it’s that I wanted more for my girl Elphaba. It’s hard to watch her fall on her sword as Glinda gets the glory. Dorothy is now in Oz, after allegedly murdering Nessarose by way of a falling house (we later learn it was Madame Morrible who did the deed, inspired by a Glinda suggestion). Elphaba decides that Oz needs a villain, a foe to Glinda’s hero, and offers herself up as the symbol they need to shun. She’s made this decision out of hurt and frustration — Fiyero is arrested and would have been beaten to death if Elphaba didn’t cast a spell turning his bones into straw — and is done doing good deeds with zero reward. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944475.png?width=1024&amp;height=675&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A675"" /></figure>



<p>Many headlines about <em>Wicked: For Good</em> have <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/wicked-for-good-review-give-ariana-grande-the-oscar-now/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">focused on Grande</a>, and while it’s true she is great in this sequel and that it’s more Glinda’s movie than Elphaba’s, Erivo is still firing on all cylinders, delivering a timeless performance that is also worthy of unadulterated praise. Throughout <em>Wicked: For Good, </em>Elphaba<em> </em>goes from fugitive freedom fighter, to heartbroken friend and exasperated sister, to frustrated revolutionary, to lover in mourning, to resigned martyr. It’s a depressing arc that sees the optimism of progressivism dashed with a big dose of witch-melting water. The simplicity of the message — that doing good comes at a cost, that no matter your intentions, things don’t always work in your favor, and that facism may take on a new face but it’s an ever-present threat — is the point. I don’t love the optics of a Black woman (we’ve established that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/11/11816225/cynthia-erivo-wicked-review-elphaba-black"">Elphaba is Black</a>) giving up her freedom and her reputation to save a white woman who betrayed her once and a population who vilified her, but the lesson is about who you are when the choice is to do good without any benefit to yourself at all. Who are you in your darkest moments? What are your values, <em>really</em>?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> Let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In Chang’s New Yorker review, he references <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2025/11/21/wicked-for-good-book-series-gregory-maguire/87378037007/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gregory Maguire’s novel</a> the Broadway musical is loosely based on, which was an adaptation of Frank L. Baum’s children’s book, <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>: “Maguire’s novel was itself written in the spirit of a corrective; it aimed to bring a morally ambiguous modernism and a grownup, forthright sexuality to bear on Baum’s squeaky-clean demarcations of good and evil.” It’s true that <em>Wicked: For Good’s</em> political commentary may be clumsy at times and very much watered down from its source material (the characters are less overtly queer and some are literally whitewashed), but the musical still aims to take a stand against totalitarianism and teach audiences that a lying dictatorship uninterested in the truth and wielding power without checks and balances is bad, actually. And right now, I think that’s good, actually. </p>



<p>I understand the critiques, but let’s take the <em>Wicked</em> movies for what they are instead of what you hoped the stage musical would be. The movies were never going to be a radical reimagining of Maguire’s novel because that’s not what the musical is. It’s a big-hearted, campy, bold, funny, entertaining ride with a nice message. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944477.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=429&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A429"" /><figcaption>L to R: Cynthia Erivo is Elphaba and Ariana Grande is Glinda in WICKED FOR GOOD, directed by Jon M. Chu.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, ultimately, <em>Wicked</em> is about Elphaba and Glinda, two girls who grew together while figuring themselves out. It’s about the complexity, softness, and intensity of platonic affection. It’s about how all-consuming female friendship can be in your youth. And it’s about the door (the <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/cynthia-erivo-for-good-ad-lib-scene-wicked-rcna244955"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">“I love yous” were improvised, Erivo says</a>). There’s always been a chasm between the two witches — one is unusually and exceedingly peculiar and altogether quite impossible to describe, the other is blonde — and as they finally reach their farewell, the realization that they are better off because of their relationship hits, and it all coalesces in a gut wrenching declaration of mutual adoration, respect, and forgiveness. The fact that there is still a door between them in this moment, a physical divide between them as they grow into their most actualized selves, is exactly the ending these two characters should have, no matter how bittersweet. </p>



<p>It’s up for debate if Glinda and Elphaba ever see each other again, or if Glinda even knows her best friend is alive and wandering beyond the walls of Oz journeying to a new life with Fiyero (I think the answer is yes). In the <em>Wicked</em> cinematic universe, it’s also left unclear as to what kind of leader Glinda The Good becomes. In the absence of her evil overlords, does Glinda live up to the task Elphaba entrusts her with? Does she stay true to the final speech she gives to her fellow Ozians? Does she become who her best friend believed she could be? There’s hope in each of these questions. And when you look at it all through Elphaba’s eyes — the ones that saw the Good in Glinda before she did — it’s enough to move even the most cynical viewer. Even if you aren’t sobbing in the theater like I was, I promise if you open your heart, let go and embrace its earnestness, <em>Wicked: For Good </em>will change something in you for the better. </p>

It’s skin care that actually *cares* — and perhaps that’s the greatest gift of all. <br /> <br /><em>Shop </em><a href=""https://viceandvirtueskin.com/products/go-all-in""><em><strong>Vice &amp; Virtue</strong></em></a><br /><br /><strong>Vice &amp; Virtue</strong> Go All In Bundle, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fviceandvirtueskin.com%2Fproducts%2Fgo-all-in"">Vice &amp; Virtue</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1296"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11818699.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1296&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Lululemon Fleece Everywhere Belt Bag 1L</h2><br />Lululemon’s Everywhere Belt Bag has become one of the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-things-to-buy-at-lululemon"">hero products</a>, which means the athleisurewear-obsessed may already own the brand’s original nylon version.

<p>When it comes to beauty, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/is-korean-skincare-better-expert-advice"">Korea is in a league</a> of its own. Glass skin wasn’t created by accident; it’s all about careful, consistent care. But this meticulous approach isn’t limited to skincare — Korea is now bringing the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kundal-korean-shampoo-hair-treatment-review"">same precision to haircare</a>. Forget miracle shampoos and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rosemary-oil-hair-growth-benefits"">hair growth serums</a> for a second. This time, it’s treatments. Enter: hairline microblading.</p>



<p>Even if hairline microblading is completely new to you, I’m willing to bet you’ve at least heard of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/microblading-pigment-removal-trend""><em>brow</em> microblading</a>. You probably know someone who swears by it. The semi-permanent makeup treatment is famous worldwide for using tiny needles and natural-tone pigments to mimic fine brow hairs, essentially filling in sparse patches. Some microblading technicians can even create an entire brow from scratch. </p>

<p>Considering its ability to transform a face, it was only a matter of time before microblading made its way to the scalp. If Korea’s hair experts are anything to go by, it’s an excellent way to boost a thinning hairline quickly and effectively, outperforming tedious (and often questionable) hair growth serums.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about hairline microblading — and how to make it work for you.</p>



<h2>First of all, what causes a thinning hairline?</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.ukhairconsultants.com/eva-proudmans-clinics/"">Eva Proudman</a> FIT IAT, a leading consultant trichologist, says the hairline is the only place on our bodies that retains ‘baby’ or vellus hairs — essentially finer, wispier strands — so shedding there can appear more noticeable. A handful of factors can trigger hair shedding, also known as telogen effluvium. Think: hormonal shifts, stress, illness, weight loss, certain medications, and even high-tension hairstyles, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/09/11521323/sofia-richie-sleek-bun-hair-style"">slicked-back buns or tight ponytails</a>. </p>



<h2>What is hairline microblading, and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>Among professionals, hairline microblading is commonly referred to as scalp micropigmentation (SMP), says Proudman, who recommends it in the right circumstances. “It involves medical tattoos being applied to the scalp as small dots to give the illusion of follicles and hair.” Hairline microblading can be effective for certain types of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drinking-matcha-hair-loss-thinning"">thinning and hair loss</a>, adds Proudman, and it’s often used to disguise small areas rather than provide full coverage — but not everyone is qualified to perform it.</p>



<p><a href=""https://karenbetts.com/"">Karen Betts</a>, an authority in permanent makeup treatments and founder of Karen Betts Clinics, says hairline microblading requires a highly experienced hand. “Brow hairs are shorter, coarser, and more structured, but hairline hairs around the temples grow more sparsely and lie flatter,” she explains. As such, hairline strokes need to be softer, more diffused, and carefully placed to blend seamlessly with existing hair, adds Betts. Thanks to ultra-fine needles, it’s now easier to replicate fine hairs with ink, but it’s still essential to choose a practitioner who’s properly qualified in scalp microblading. </p>

<h2>What are the risks or challenges associated with hairline microblading?</h2>



<p>If TikTok is anything to go by, hairline microblading might seem like a miracle solution for those experiencing thinning, but it’s not without its downsides. Firstly, your skin type matters. Betts explains that some people have thinner scalp skin than others, which requires a much lighter touch to avoid irritation or tattooing too deeply — again, why it’s important to go to someone qualified to work on the scalp and who knows their stuff. </p>



<p>If your scalp tends to be oilier, this can blur the pigment, adds Betts, making hair strokes appear unnatural and affecting how long they last. Then there’s the color choice and stroke direction, all of which matter for seamless, natural results. Betts adds that for clients with darker skin tones, there may not be enough contrast between the pigment and the skin to show fine detail. “In these cases, the effect will look more like shading rather than distinct hair strokes,” she says. </p>



<p>Proudman warns that, like brows, the hairline is very visible. “Getting something that is too heavy or obvious, or sits below the natural hairline, is simply not a good idea, and you may come to regret it,” she says. Ultimately, hairline microblading should be a collaborative process with your chosen artist. “If there’s any uncertainty about how the skin will take the pigment, it’s wise to do a test area first to see how the color holds,” says Betts. “Pigment may also fade unevenly if the strokes aren’t applied carefully,” she adds. Betts emphasizes the importance of choosing a qualified professional and says it’s all about patience and restraint, enhancing the hairline in a subtle way, rather than trying to completely transform it.</p>

<h2>How does hairline microblading compare to hair growth treatments like minoxidil?</h2>



<p>While hairline microblading is popping off on TikTok, Betts isn’t entirely sure the trend will stick around. But given its growing number of fans, she suspects it’ll fare better than some other semi-permanent tattoo trends: “Think blush, freckles, or lining eyeliner and lips with white shades,” she says. “I’ve tried all of those and they don’t age well.”</p>



<p>If microblading doesn’t sound like one for you, Proudman says there are a number of treatments for the hairline. First up: Minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, which is clinically proven to stimulate hair growth and slow hair loss. “Diet also matters,” adds Proudman. “Make sure yours is packed full of protein.” You might also want to consider supplements to correct nutrient deficiencies, says Proudman. Ask your doctor for bloodwork to see if you’re deficient.</p>



<h2>How long does hairline microblading last, and how much is it?</h2>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t a one-and-done treatment; you might require a few sessions. While the results typically last anywhere between 12 to 18 months, Proudman suggests being prepared for maintenance: “This procedure isn’t permanent and will need care and attention,” says Proudman, including aftercare like keeping the scalp clean and moisturized, avoiding direct sun, and scheduling touch-ups throughout the years as the pigment fades. </p>



<p>Hairline microblading isn’t cheap. While the cost largely depends on the size of the area you want to treat, it can vary from clinic to clinic and, at the very least, is likely to start around $1,500. Top-ups will be cheaper.</p>

<h2>How else can you get your hairline back?</h2>



<p>Regardless of the treatment you choose, if your hairline is thinning, Proudman suggests getting a full, professional diagnosis from a trichologist or doctor first. “This will answer what condition you have. Is it stable or progressive? Can it be recovered? If so, to what extent?” asks Proudman. If the hairline isn’t stable or can be improved with treatments, she recommends waiting to see how things settle before opting for microblading. “In the end, this might not be necessary,” says Proudman, or worse, “it may become obvious once the hair grows in.” </p>



<p>At the end of the day, do your research thoroughly before opting for trending treatments like these — they may fade eventually, but you’ll be living with the results for a long while.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to “</strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/whats-good""><strong>What’s Good</strong></a><strong>,” a column where we break down the soothing, distracting, or just plain good film and TV with a “rooting for everybody Black” energy. This edition is all about </strong><em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irXTps1REHU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></strong></em><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irXTps1REHU"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">, starring Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XiI_wkZ6Ac"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen</a> and <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/callum-turner-interview"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Callum Turner</a>, in theaters on November 26. I spoke to Randolph about the film below.</strong></p>



<p><strong>What’s Good? </strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/11/11599737/davine-joy-randolph-the-holdovers-awards-interview"">Da’Vine Joy Randolph</a> is <em>so</em> good in everything she’s in, you just know if she shows up, the movie or TV show is going to be <em>really</em> good just by virtue of her presence. And there’s a <a href=""https://a24films.com/films/eternity"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moment in </a><em><a href=""https://a24films.com/films/eternity"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></em> — like in every movie where Randolph plays a supporting character — where you start to miss her when she’s not around. It comes after Larry (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/08/91932/miles-teller-esquire"">Miles Teller</a>) has died and gone to the Junction, the place where you have a week to pick where you want to spend eternity with the help of your Afterlife Coordinator (AC). Larry’s AC is Anna (played by Randolph) and from the moment they are thrust together in this delightfully bizarre and hilariously morbid setup, they are magic together.</p>



<p>Anna immediately clocks that Larry, a curmudgeonly old man transported back to his younger self, is in for a tough ride. His wife, Joan (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elizabeth-olsen"">Elizabeth Olsen</a>) is also dead and has to choose who to spend her eternity with: Larry or her first husband, Luke (Callum Turner). Luke died a war hero and has waited 60 years for Joan to come back to him. He’s also incredibly handsome (see Callum Turner). It’s hard to root for Larry in this scenario — Joan and Luke are long lost lovers reunited after he died tragically! And he’s so hot! — and Anna knows this. She tows the line between gently ribbing Larry about his competition and being the support he needs while he tries to win his wife back. Anna, the character, could easily fall into the magical negro trope, a one-note sidekick there in service of the white lead, but in Randolph’s hands (and thanks to her hysterical dynamic with Joan’s AC Ryan played by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/bejohnce/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Early</a>), she’s more than that. Anna is the film’s constant comedic relief, and she’s also its moral center, a grounding force that’s there to remind Larry of the life he built with Joan for decades, while making us laugh repeatedly. That’s the power of Da’Vine Joy Randolph. </p>



<p><strong>Who It’s Good For:</strong> One of my biggest pet peeves is when people mislabel a movie a “romantic comedy” when it is not, in fact, a comedy at all. I’m looking at you, anyone who calls <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9697003/love-and-basketball-20th-anniversary-gina-prince-bythewood"">Love &amp; Basketball </a></em>a rom-com. It’s a beautiful romantic <em>drama</em>, and that’s OK! Not everything that includes a love story is a rom-com, especially if it’s not even remotely funny (cough, <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7536286483540610335?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Materialists</a></em>, cough). <em>Eternity</em> is exactly as billed, a true romantic comedy that is very funny, thanks in large part to Randolph and Early. If you love rom-com classics like<em> It Happened One Night,</em> <em>The Philadelphia Story</em>, and <em>Notting Hill,</em> you’ll love <em>Eternity</em>. </p>



<p><strong>How Good Is It?</strong> There are a lot of things to love about <em>Eternity.</em> Teller and Olsen are operating at their highest, being charming and adorably clueless as old folks in young, beautiful bodies. They do their best work playing off of one another, and the familiarity that comes with building a lifetime with someone feels real. Turner is also great, playing the dashingly handsome hero with emotional depth. A romantic love triangle is as good as the difficulty of the choice, and in this case, the choice is <em>hard</em>. Ultimately, <em>Eternity</em> is about the nostalgia of young love vs. the coziness of a long marriage. Which one would you choose? And if you could choose when, where and with whom you are happiest, do you know yourself enough to answer honestly? </p>



<p>The film is full of those big, lofty questions and when I talk to Randolph about it, you can tell she’s had some time to think of the answers. Along with talking about where she’d spend eternity, her chemistry with Teller, and what life is like after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpGA2B_AgYw"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">winning an Academy Award</a>, Randolph shared the details on Anna’s magnificent wigs and her newfound status as a <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/2961627/davine-joy-randolph-best-red-carpet-fashion/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">red carpet style icon</a>. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943965.png?width=1024&amp;height=686&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A343"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Refinery29: I have to ask you one of the central questions of this film: at what age do you think you were at your happiest?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Da’Vine Joy Randolph: </strong>Now, to be really honest. I think it just keeps getting better the more that I work on myself and be true to myself and the things I want to do and doing that work, the work of being in alignment and true to myself. I then bring other people and attract other things — job opportunities, people —  that are also in alignment, and there’s that inner glow-up that comes the more that we are true to ourselves, everything else around you just starts to fall into place, and abundance comes your way. It doesn’t mean that things don’t become difficult or not everything goes your way, but how you handle it, how you navigate it, and bounce back, it hits different. I would say now, and I hope that if somebody asks me again [in the future], it’ll be then that I’ll be my happiest.</p>



<p><strong>The film also tackles this idea of what climate, what environment would you want to live in forever. So what eternity would you choose? </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>I’ve been telling everybody that mine would be a luxury yacht, Mediterranean cruise with all the spa amenities. I just think of idyllic summers that I’ve had where I’ve been fortunate enough to be in Spain or Italy or South of France, Greece, that whole Mediterranean. It would be phenomenal.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>There’s that inner glow-up that comes the more that we are true to ourselves, everything else around you just starts to fall into place, and abundance comes your way.</p><cite>da’vine joy randolph</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>A cruise is an interesting choice! I’m not a cruise person, but I get it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> I’ve never done a cruise in my life! But I like the idea of getting to hit [different spots] because I’m a Gemini. I can’t pick one. So I like the idea of we’re doing the Mediterranean, we make stops along the way. I get to get out, get to do things. Because otherwise, if I picked one eternity, I would not be a good candidate for that. I would be spazzing out because I don’t think I could do one thing for the rest of my life or eternity.</p>



<p><strong>It was stressful watching the movie thinking about what I would pick! So we’re all about astrology at Refinery29 and  you mentioned you’re a Gemini. What star sign could you spend eternity with and one you absolutely couldn’t?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> Hmm, see, I’ve always dated people who are the polar opposite of me. It just happened that way. I’m a Taurus Gemini because I’m the 21st so I’m a cuss baby, and I genuinely have both strongly in me. I would say maybe for what I wouldn’t do… I don’t know, because the Gemini in me can get along with everybody. But to be with, I think long term, a Leo or Cancer would get a bit much. Like you’re talking about eternity, but maybe like a Libra or Virgo would be a good one to be with, because it’d be like the ying to the yang. If I’m in my Gemini mode of being all over the place, they can be the checks and balances and organize and keep it all together.</p>



<p><strong>I’m married to a Libra, so, yeah I would recommend [</strong><strong><em>laughs</em></strong><strong>].</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>They ‘gon make sure the house is good!</p>



<p><strong>This is a romance and I’m sure there’s going to be a lot said about the chemistry between Miles, Elizabeth and Callum but my favorite part was the chemistry between you and Miles Teller, your characters Anna and Larry. How did you two develop that and why do you think it worked?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>We have the same agent. We had had conversations from afar, like Miles was talking to her and I was talking to her separately saying we should work together. He went to NYU, I went to Yale. We kind of had the same educational upbringing in regards to acting. We’re both from Philadelphia. There were those things in place, but we lucked out. I always say the casting is integral, but it’s a gamble, because I don’t think people realize that most of the time, we don’t know each other. We’re all in our own little worlds, and a lot of the time what people see [onscreen] is these friendships that blossom — nine times out of 10, it’s because they did a project together. Otherwise they’re not in our sphere of awareness. So we got really lucky that we immediately hit it off. </p>



<p>We respect each other’s talents. What you saw [onscreen] was us both supporting each other and encouraging each other to raise the bar when we were filming. Sometimes miles would be like, “Well, what if we tried this? And I was thinking about this, Are you cool with that?” And I’m like, “Yeah, let’s figure it out.” But it’s weird, because sometimes an actor will be like, “No. Let’s just do what?” So it was a very welcoming, artistic, creative environment. I think we both just felt comfy with one another, and I think that’s why it translated on the screen.</p>



<p><strong>OK, we gotta talk about the wigs. </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>Yes! I’m so excited you’re asking. </p>



<p><strong>Your character Anna is platinum blonde. When we talked about </strong><strong><em>The Holdovers</em></strong><strong> you told me that you “fought tooth and nail” to make sure that the hair was authentic. Tell me about the process for this and getting those wigs right. </strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>So during award season for <em>The Holdovers</em>, that was my blonde era and I still wanted to rock it a little bit. We knew we were going to go to ginger soon, but I was like, I want to rock [the blonde] a little bit longer. So my amazing hairstylist, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Ub3p3HbVY"">her name is Tai Simon</a>, had been on the press tour with me and she ended up doing this movie. I fought hard to get her on the project, and thankfully, we were able to make that work.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11943967.png?width=1024&amp;height=676&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A169"" /></figure>



<p>When we were talking about the character, I asked the director, “How long has she been around?” He was like, “I think she’s been around and in this job for a long time. Like, let’s say at least 100 years.” And so my brain then started to think of all of the spans of time as the people come into the Junction. Like when you’re in New York and walking down the street, you’re seeing the latest trends and they’re coming in and she’s clocking it. And so when they showed us the set, at first we were like, we’re going to show a different hairstyle per decade. We really wanted to have fun with it. And then when they were like, well, we kind of want the junction to have kind of a timeless, ‘60s kind of vibe. We were like, “okay, great, we’re gonna go <em>in</em>.”</p>

<p>I knew that I wanted to have a new hairstyle every single scene, every time you see her. I wanted a new look, which is an insane thing for me to ask for, but I knew if anyone could do it, it would be my hairstylist. So Tai and I pulled tons and tons of images and inspo, and we really just planned and prepared. And we used like, five or six wigs, different wigs, and it just took a lot of planning and prepping, and she just worked so hard to make it seamlessly happen. But I knew behind the scenes she was working her butt off to make this work, and she just cranked out. It is the most beautiful hair I’ve ever had in a movie, and now I’m addicted, and I have to have [Tai] for every movie, because it was, it makes a difference. It’s a part of storytelling and she really knocked it out of the park.</p>



<p><strong>Since the last time we talked, you won an Academy Award. Congratulations! Now that you’ve won, is there anything about this post-Oscar life that you’re living that surprised you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR: </strong>No, I didn’t really know specifically what to expect, but I imagined that my life would just become bigger and <em>more</em>, a sense of more on all levels and that is exactly what it has been. I’m from Philadelphia. I’m a very grounded person. And so I just have to work more at maintaining that humility and groundedness, because it affects my work. I don’t think I would do well if I got caught up in all of this, in the smoke and mirrors of it all. I love a good glam and I love getting dressed up. That’s my favorite part. I love seeing other artists and their work. I love the creative mindset. That is what I’m 100% down for. All the other stuff I’m very mindful of what I interact with, because I want to stay in this [industry] as long as possible, and I don’t want to burn out. So it’s a lot more of everything times 10, but I try to really be mindful of what I engage in, so that I can go the distance. </p>

<p><strong>I love what you just wore to the <em><a href=""https://wwd.com/pop-culture/celebrity-news/gallery/eternity-los-angeles-premiere-photos-1238338858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eternity</a></em><a href=""https://wwd.com/pop-culture/celebrity-news/gallery/eternity-los-angeles-premiere-photos-1238338858/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> LA premiere</a>. You’ve been called a red carpet style icon. I know when it comes to style and red carpets, Black women aren’t often put in that space. How are your red carpet looks a love letter to curvy Black women?</strong></p>



<p><strong>DJR:</strong> I think it’s a love letter to women and women of color, specifically, because of just what you said. I’m very mindful of how I put things together, how I do my makeup, my hair, the clothes. Because, you know, Charlize Theron could wear this haircut, and it looks a certain way. We do this all the time with hair that we’re like, “Okay, now, if Charlize wore this, what would the vibe be? And if I wear this, what would it be? Different things can get projected onto [your looks]. In no way do I deny who I am and where I come from. I’m very, very proud of it. But there’s also a level of elevating [beauty and fashion] and presenting it in a way that’s not neglectful of who I am, but something that people can digest and get into. There is nothing wrong with you authentically showing up as yourself as well, Read the room, you know what I mean? What I would wear to the Golden Globes is different from what I would wear to the Oscars or what I would wear to a premiere. </p>

<p>I’m very intentional, and at the same time, I love to have fun. And there’s something that my stylist said the other day that made me so excited. I was like, “I really like this one outfit and we go on to do London press after this. Maybe we should save it for London.” He was like, “we don’t save clothes, wear them. We’ll never run out of clothes.” And so it’s just about being yourself. Have fun! Don’t be scared and don’t be worried about what you think people are going to think. What I love is that I’m in control of my brand and what I’m putting out there, right? And so that’s really exciting and fun. I just want to encourage all women, but especially women of color, especially Black women, and especially curvy women to wear [whatever you want] and have fun with it, because you’re not going to know unless you experiment. You know how you have some girlfriends where they’ve locked into, like, “purple is my color,” and that’s all they do. Or, like, power suits, and they look amazing in it, but  also just want to encourage women to try other things too, because you might be surprised that other things look great on you too. I really love to encourage a sense of play and going out of your comfort zone because you’re just conquering more territory.</p>

<p>In his recent cold-weather trend report, hair artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomsmithhd/?hl=en"">Tom Smith</a> predicted that muted mid — essentially “soft, neutral-warm shades that sit between blonde, brunette, and copper” — will reign supreme. “It’s a fusion of all the recent trends, but intentionally subtle and noncommittal,” says Smith. Think Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift, and Madelaine Petsch — or content creator <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DDsFPXUNEPd/?hl=en"">Zoe Hayes</a> here. Shades like this are low-maintenance, versatile, and chic, adds Smith. “Simply ask for a natural earthy undertone to your shade of choice and maintain it with glossing treatments to keep the finish refined and the color looking shiny and intentional.” We swear by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglazehair.com%2Fcollections%2Fsuper-gloss"">Glaze’s Supergloss</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/seanmichaelhair/?hl=en"">Sean Michael</a>, a Boston-based balayage specialist and owner of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thesalonbeau/?hl=en"">Salon Beau</a>, identifies “cherry cola brunette” as the brooding shade to watch this winter. “It’s all thanks to the rich depth and understated hint of cherry tone,” explains Michael, much like this shade on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DMYY3uhofIy/?img_index=1"">Alice x T</a>. “It gives dark hair a moody, polished glow without tipping into a full red, making it a great choice for brunettes who want something new.” Fortunately, cherry cola brunette suits everyone. “Ask your stylist for a deep brunette base enhanced with soft violet-red lowlights or a cherry-toned gloss to create that cola-inspired richness,” advises Michael.</p>

<p>This delicious hue combines chocolate and amber tones, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jesstheebesttcolor"">Jess Gonzalez</a>, Pravana color expert and celebrity colorist, creating a rich, expensive result — exactly like this one by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/deetoohollywood"">@deetoohollywood on Instagram.</a> Think of it as the chocolate lava cake of hair colors. “On brunettes, these shades bring out natural glow, depth, and shine without having to undergo a drastic change,” says Gonzalez. “It still has dimension and luminosity, and it’s low-maintenance, too.”</p>

<p>“Honey butter blonde is poised to dominate winter because warm, creamy shades are finally taking the spotlight again,” says Michael. This shade is defined by a “soft candlelit glow” that adds brightness and shine to hair during an otherwise moody season. “To get the look, ask your colorist for a warm-neutral blonde with subtle golden dimension and a glossy finish to enhance that buttery warmth,” Michael says. We love this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPoeddQCPeU/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Fatima Ezzahrae Najib</a>.</p>

Jacob used Schwarzkopf Professional’s Vario Blond SuperPlus and BlondMe Premium Lightener 9+ to create a handful of face-cupping highlights and lighter ends. The pièce de résistance was toning the lengths with Igora Vibrance, giving the color a more effortless vibe.

<p>In his trend report, Smith describes gothic brunette as an “ultra-dark, almost inky brunette with intense depth and shine,” like this color posted to Instagram by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DROY7h_Ebg4/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Ryenne Snow</a>. This shade works best for those with a naturally dark base, he explains, suggesting you ask your colorist for an espresso- or black cherry-toned gloss to take your natural color a shade or two deeper. The darker the hair, the glossier it appears as it catches the light. Look to Margaret Qualley, Kendall Jenner, and Nicola Peltz Beckham for inspiration.</p>

<p>Gonzalez pinpoints golden strawberry blonde as the hair color to watch, thanks to its luminosity and sunshine vibes — something we seriously lack in the drab winter months. “This shade combines the brightness of blonde with copper warmth, creating a glowing look that feels fresh,” explains Gonzalez, adding that it’s great for blondes who want warmth and depth, or brunettes ready to go a little lighter. “Just ask for a warm honey base with golden copper undertones or face-framing pieces,” says Gonzalez. This shade created by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFFMyfGST6U/"">Sophie Malic</a> is beautiful.</p>

<p>“This hair color technique involves low-commitment demi-permanent glosses that deepen your natural base by one or two levels, while keeping your existing highlights visible,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/treehousehair/?hl=en"">Travis Ogletree</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.moroccanoil.com%2F"">Moroccanoil</a> colorist ambassador. He notes that many of his clients flirt with the idea of going darker but don’t want to lose the effortless, lived-in dimension they’ve built. “An all-over gloss is the perfect middle ground,” says Ogletree. “It adds shine, tone, and depth without feeling heavy.” In the salon, Ogletree reaches for the <a href=""https://moroccanoilprofessionals.com/products/color-calypso-demi-permanent-gloss-cream/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Moroccanoil Color Calypso Demi-Permanent Color</a>. “The Gloss and Cream options are both perfect for this.” Look to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DN-ytYcDZbg/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Rachel Redd</a>’s post on Instagram for inspiration. </p>

<p>“At some point, most of us have said that our hair looked its best when we were kids,” says Ogletree, “so ‘born blonde’ is more of an ideology than a trend because it’s based on what naturally suited you — whether that was bright blonde, sandy tones, or soft pops on the ends.” All you need to do? Bring in a photo of yourself as a child. “Those small details help your stylist recreate a version that feels authentic and flattering,” says Ogletree, who turns to Moroccanoil’s Blonde Voyage portfolio of lighteners, specifically Clay and Cream, to lighten clients’ hair. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPo9gyigrgF/?hl=en"">Marco Gilento</a> nails this shade here.</p>

<p>Schwartz describes light suede blonde as a “luminous,” bright shade that frames the face and adds soft depth through the lengths — think of the way a suede bag subtly glistens in winter sun. “It’s setting the tone for one of the season’s most coveted blondes,” he says.

<p>Michael touts this earthier shade as a “cool-neutral blend” that adds dimension and gives brunette hair an expensive look — much like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGuKJk4v6TN/"">this creation by @a_knack_yuna</a>. It’s all about the soft, smoky gradient, Michael says. “This flatters a wide range of skin tones and grows out seamlessly, making it perfect for anyone who wants low-maintenance color that still feels modern.” Michael recommends asking your colorist for a neutral brunette base with ashy balayage throughout. “This will create that seamless mocha-toned transition,” he says.</p>

<p>This hair color trend draws from eras past. “It’s a honeyed but muted blonde that feels retro and nostalgic, yet still fresh,” says Smith in his trend report. Perfect for colder months, it adds a subtle warmth. “This works best for natural blondes or brunettes looking to add warmth in a mature, elegant way while keeping depth and medium contrast,” he explains. Smith recommends asking your colorist for a “muted golden balayage” or a warm gloss after highlights to bring richness back into your strands.

<p>Greige occupies a cozy space between grey and beige, says Smith, adding, “It honors natural silver while brightening and warming the complexion.” Greige is a perfect middle ground for those who want to embrace, rather than cover, their natural hair, he notes, while the added richness from blonde highlights keeps it feeling fresh and dimensional.

<p>“Muted blonde sits between bright blonde and light brunette,” says Gonzalez. “Think soft beige, sandy, or mushroom shades of blonde rather than high-lift platinum. It balances warm and cool undertones for a gentle ‘lived-in’ effect.” If you have light-to-medium blonde hair or light brown lengths and want to soften your color a bit, Gonzalez says a simple salon gloss can get you there. This color by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DFehTNpzQbw/?hl=en"">Diane Gorgievski</a> is stunning.</p>

It’s a chemical exfoliator (derived from sugarcane) with a small molecular size, which makes it powerful and able to penetrate deep into the layers of your skin. It essentially works by ungluing dead skin cells from each other, working to resurface and smooth the skin.

<p>Between the shopping trips, flash sales, and donation requests, the holidays are often prime time for scammers. Inboxes can be filled with “urgent” updates and texts about surprise account issues, making it harder to determine what’s real and what’s a trap. The truth? Scammers know that this time of year comes with — distractions, increased generosity, and likely rushing to get things done — the perfect recipe for a slip-up. “The holidays are a busy time for scammers,” says Diedra Porché, Head of Community and Business Development at Chase. “They know people are buying more, booking trips, and making donations, so they often use fake websites, delivery scams, and even phony charities to dupe consumers out of their money.”</p>



<p>At the root of so many scams is impersonation — the art of pretending to be someone, says Porché. “Scammers will impersonate known businesses, financial institutions, or government agencies, alerting consumers to a problem with their account or an urgent issue, to dupe them out of personal information and money,” she says. You might get an email from what looks like your bank, a text from a “shipping company,” or even a call that appears to be from a legitimate number. “Pause before clicking any links or providing sensitive information over the phone,” Porché advises. “When in doubt, hang up and call back at a verified number. If it’s your bank, call the number on the back of your card.”</p>



<p>The bottom line: Scammers rely on urgency, fear, or too-good-to-be-true deals to make you act fast. The best defense? Slow down, verify, and trust your instincts. Here are three of the most common scams making the rounds this season — and how to avoid them.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>1. The Social Media Shopping Scam</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever seen an ad for the latest winter must-have or viral gadget that’s suspiciously cheap, you might have encountered this one. During the holidays, social media scams can skyrocket. “They involve fake ads for popular items, paired with cloned retailer websites that are designed to steal your payment information,” says Porché. The setup feels legit — the branding matches, the photos are crisp — but once you check out, either the item never arrives, or worse, your card information ends up in the wrong hands.</p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Always verify a retailer’s legitimacy before buying. “If the deal isn’t listed on the retailer’s official website, it’s likely a scam,” Porché advises. And resist clicking on random ads — some may contain malware that can compromise your personal data.</p>



<h2>2. The Gift Card “Emergency”</h2>



<p>This one preys on generosity (and panic). A text or call comes in from someone claiming to be a friend or family member — they’re in trouble and ask that you buy a stack of gift cards right now. Sometimes, the scammer spoofs their phone number or uses voice cloning to sound convincing (and just like your loved one). “Gift card scams are especially popular during the holidays,” Porché notes. “If someone asks you for a gift card out of the blue, it’s likely a scam.” </p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> No legitimate person or company will ever ask you to pay with gift cards. Take a breath before reacting to urgent requests, and if something feels off, reach out to the person directly through another channel.</p>



<h2>3. The “Too Good To Be True” Vacation Rental</h2>



<p>Scrolling for a cozy cabin or beachfront villa for the holiday season or for a gift of a trip? Be careful. Property scams often involve fake listings on travel sites offering major discounts — usually on high-demand holiday destinations. Scammers may pose as property owners and move communication to text or personal email, asking for upfront payment via wire transfer or Zelle<sup>®</sup>. “These scams lure holiday travelers with deals that feel too good to be true,” says Porché. Another red flag is when vendors ask for personal documentation or direct payment outside trusted booking platforms. </p>



<p><strong>How to avoid it:</strong> Book through reputable travel sites with secure payment options and verified listings. Never send money via wire transfer, Zelle, or cash to someone you don’t know personally.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<p>So, how can you spot — and stop — a scam before it happens? Sometimes, the warning signs are hiding in plain sight. Porché recommends watching for these red flags: spelling or grammar errors in ads or websites (real brands rarely make those), unverified URLs (always look for “https://” in the address bar), pressure tactics (anyone urging you to act immediately to reset a password, send money, or share info is likely trying to manipulate you), and sketchy or no reviews (search the company name with terms like “scam” or “complaints” to see what comes up). And remember: Trust your gut. “If a deal feels too good to be true, it probably is,” Porché says.</p>



<p><strong>How to help protect yourself this holiday season</strong>: Beyond staying alert, there are tools that can add an extra layer of protection. “Digital banking tools have tons of features to help safeguard your wallets from scams during the holidays,” says Porché. Chase customers, for instance, can use the Chase Mobile<sup>®</sup> app to track purchases as they happen and can help you catch unusual activity early. Even better? Chase Credit Journey<sup>®</sup> offers free credit and identity monitoring for everyone — you don’t even have to be a Chase customer. The tool sends alerts if your data appears in a breach or on the dark web, helping you act fast if your info’s been compromised.</p>



<p><strong>What to do if you’ve been scammed:</strong> First, don’t panic — and don’t feel embarrassed. “Scams can happen to anyone,” says Porché. Here’s what to do next: Stop contact immediately with the scammer and document everything — emails, screenshots, or messages can help when filing reports. Call your bank using the number on the back of your card to report the issue, file a police report, and make an inquiry with the FTC. Next, change your passwords across all accounts. Lastly, it may help you feel better and find community (as well as warn others) by sharing your experience, says Porché. </p>



<p>Staying safe this season doesn’t mean being paranoid — it means being proactive. After all, the best gift is peace of mind (and a non-compromised bank account). </p>
