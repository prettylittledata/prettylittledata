<p><strong><em>Mild spoilers ahead. </em></strong><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/06/11022903/metaverse-concerts-charlie-xcx-experience"">Charli XCX </a>hates being famous. She’s also terrified of becoming irrelevant. She loves pop music but couldn’t care less about being a pop star. She thinks the word “cunt” is cool, but “bitch” is cringe. Well, at least this is the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charli_xcx/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charli XCX</a> we see in <em><a href=""https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6932fa7fbd8651ab9260fa08"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Moment</a>, </em>a satirical mockumentary that takes aim at the music industry, standom, and how both treat the artists at their center. As a heightened version of herself in the Aidan Zamiri-directed film, Charli XCX is at once a decisive musician who knows exactly what her image should be, and a distressed pop pawn torn between label requests and capitalistic endeavors to turn her viral “brat summer” into a booming brand. <em>The Moment, </em>which premiered this weekend at the <a href=""https://festival.sundance.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sundance Film Festival</a> in Park City, Utah, finds Charli XCX at a crossroads; she’s ready to say goodbye to her seminal <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">2024 album </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">Brat</a></em> but anxious about what comes after your entire career has been whittled into a neon(ish) shade of green and an indescribable aesthetic. What happens when you become a punchline? </p>



<p>The answer, according to Charli and the team behind A24’s <em>The Moment</em>, is to start making the jokes yourself. <em><a href=""https://a24films.com/films/the-moment"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Moment</a></em> is at its best when it doesn’t take itself seriously, when it leans into being a searing commentary on fame and stardom, and when it makes fun of <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/music/what-is-brat-summer-charli-xcx-rcna163061"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brat Summer,</a> a concept that (aside from the music, which was very good) already feels like it was a fever dream/ recession indicator of a lost era, even though it was just about 20 months ago. Brat Summer existed in the “post-pandemic” rarified space of hopefulness America seemed to have before Trump was re-elected, when partying was back, and our feeds felt less dystopian. Lest we forget, a core tenet of the <em>Brat</em> era was that it was <em>fun</em>, and for the most part, <em>The Moment </em>is too. The film takes us back to 2024, right before Charli XCX is to tour the album, when the <em>Brat</em> phenomenon is on its last legs. The film is ruthless in its depiction of record execs, the business side of the music industry, and the commodification of artists — as it should be. As her image is being chopped, skewed, and sold for parts, Charli (a genuinely good actor) toggles between aloof disinterest and manic frustration. So how much of the real Charli XCX is in <em>The Moment</em>? </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p> The fact that it’s all a performance is very telling. I think the tension lies in trying to find out the truth. Do you ever know anyone? Every day people are performing who they are, and this movie is a commentary on that.</p><cite>‘the moment’ co-star Tish Weinstock</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The thing about Charli is… she’s so authentically herself, and she’s not afraid to open up and show you all the moving parts inside of her,” Charli’s <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT6hyP2j6XQ/?igsh=ZDJncThtaGFzcnpi"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">co-star, Isaac Powell</a>, said on the <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7599017448859258143"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sundance red carpet</a> at the premiere of <em>The Moment. </em>“I felt like I got to know the real [Charli] and you’ll see the real her in this movie. She’s an open book. I don’t think anyone will be surprised by anything.”</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956250.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>The most surprising thing about<em> The Moment</em> isn’t who Charli is — or isn’t — pretending to be, but who she says she’s not. Charli XCX isn’t the kind of pop star who likes pyrotechnics or stunts where she’s suspended in the air wearing sparkles and harnessed to an apparatus. Sound familiar? Charli XCX is probably never going to confirm or deny if the jabs at packaged pop princesses that are made in the film are direct hits on <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/charli-xcx-taylor-swift-feud-explained-1235440158/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Taylor Swift (who allegedly dissed Charli</a> on her most recent album), but it was surprising to me how unsubtle they were. Swift has produced many over-the-top concert films. When a trailer for Charli XCX’s fake music film drops in <em>The Moment</em>, it looks like it’s ripped from the Disney Plus discover page trying to redirect you to watch the <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;cid=DSS-Search-Google-23350434458-&amp;s_kwcid=AL!8468!3!787715553960!e!!g!!189444688026-2455688837471&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23350434458&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACzWEUHHGgWvGnLHGCqxuKWhArkTx&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvtzLBhCPARIsALwhxdqO-p34rCejad6X0vz-Gz_Qxm-qo8cguVDAhjg4hIHRvBoEcdsP-jIaAiQTEALw_wcB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eras Tour.</a> It’s very Swift-coded to say the least. But Swift isn’t the only pop star to make a concert doc, and she’s not the only one who dons a sequinned mic and suspends in the air over her fans during her acts. She’s not the only billionaire poster child for how pop music has become a marketing machine more concerned with bottom lines than quality music. It could just be a coincidence, right?  — or Charli XCX and Taylor Swift are engaged in a pop star petty-off. I, for one, am here for it. If Swift can (allegedly) throw shots at Charli XCX, why shouldn’t she shoot back? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956252.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=576&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=16%3A9"" /><figcaption>Charli xcx appears in The Moment by Aidan Zamiri, an official selection of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute.</figcaption></figure>



<p><em>The Moment</em> star <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tishweinstock/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tish Weinstock</a> said the confusion over what is a performance and what’s not in the film is the point. “The fact that it’s all a performance is very telling,” Weinstock said at the premiere. “I think the tension lies in trying to find out the truth. Do you ever know anyone? Every day people are performing who they are, and this movie is a commentary on that.”</p>



<p>Charli’s performance of who she is in<em> The Moment </em>isn’t always a flattering one. When she blows off her creative director (played excellently by Hailey Benton Gates, giving a nuanced, exasperated yet restrained performance that sometimes outshines its material) in the middle of tour rehearsals to go to a wellness spa in Ibiza, Charli XCX is being a brat — and not in the coked-out, absurdist chic way she intended. Charli is running from fame, and she runs into <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kylie-jenner"">Kylie Jenner,</a> naturally (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DT6vs4eEeix/?igsh=MTg1OGpld3hwa2Mxbw=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Sennott</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tiktok-ugly-trend-julia-fox-feminism"">Julia Fox</a> also deliver strong cameos). It’s a bit on the nose to include a Kardashian, the first family of being famous for fame’s sake, but somehow it works. Jenner surprisingly holds her own while presumably also playing a heightened version of herself. She’s passive aggressively pissed at Charli for stealing the in-demand director Kylie and her sister (she didn’t specify which one) wanted for their own project. This causes Charli to spiral, and to call her team demanding they give the hotshot director, who has been tapped for Charli’s concert film, anything he wants. The director, Johannes, is played by <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/lets-all-be-normal-about-alexander-skarsgards-sexuality"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexander Skarsgärd</a> who is having the <em>time of his life</em> in this role.</p>



<p>Johannes acts as a stand-in for all the shitty men women in music have to deal with, the ones who condescend, belittle, mansplain, and gaslight. He does all that cloaked in therapy speak and bad clothes. Skarsgärd is truly hilarious — albeit disturbing — in the role. It’s in the scenes with Johannes, the gaggle of other bros, and Rosanna Arquette’s clueless record executive, who each are attempting to sell, monopolize and destroy Charli’s image, that the movie finds its footing. The movie is a ridiculous takedown of how silly this industry is, and how unserious Brat Summer was. When she’s at her most self-deprecating, <em>The Moment</em>’s Charli XCX is extremely likeable, and the world she’s critiquing is all about extremes. </p>



<p>“Fame is sacrificing your privacy but also getting everything that you want,” Weinstock said when asked to describe fame and the film’s explanation of it. “Deal with it.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956254.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>As Charli XCX deals with it, she’s grappling with having it all while wanting none of it. The last act of the film could be interpreted as a sincere rumination on the mental toil of massive success, and the loss of creative freedom, but it’s also where the movie’s message gets muddled. It may seem hard to feel bad for someone who got everything she wanted, but the genuine emotions that Charli the actress delivers help you root for this anti-heroine, even when you’re rooting for her multi-million dollar <em>Brat</em> credit card deal not to fall through. The viewer gets just as caught up in the allure of Chari XCX as the parasocial stans she’s referencing. But Charli XCX is taking the piss out of herself, her fans, and their co-dependency. She can leave the sincerity for the sparkly pop stars. </p>



<p><a href=""https://deadline.com/2026/01/the-moment-review-charli-xcx-sundance-1236690970/""><em>Deadline called The Moment</em></a><em> </em>a “spiritual sequel to <em>Spice World</em>” and I’ll go further and call it<em> Spice World </em>meets <em>Uncut Gems. </em>Complimentary! Ultimately, Charli XCX’s fans will love her irreverent approach and newcomers will be endeared by her self awareness. There’s a scene near the beginning of the film where Charli asks one of her team members if something related to Brat Summer was too cringe. They reply, “It’s all cringe.” Making a meta anti-concert film to say goodbye to an era that had cable news debating whether the Vice President was “brat” is a little cringe. <em>The Moment’s</em> Charli XCX would lean into it. Sure, it’s all cringe, but cringe sells, and that’s all that matters. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, the week opens under the influence of a first quarter moon in Taurus on January 25th, a moment that often brings the first real tests of the intentions we set at the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-moon-in-capricorn-2026-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Capricorn New Moon</a> one week earlier. First quarter moons tend to surface friction, delays, or reality checks that ask us to adjust rather than abandon our goals. In Taurus, those roadblocks can feel especially personal, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-diary"">touching on money</a>, security, self-worth, or comfort. </p>



<p>The shadow here is digging in too hard, insisting it’s your way or the highway, or confusing stability with stubbornness. But the gift of this lunation is learning how to stay committed without becoming rigid. Progress now comes from flexibility, patience, and choosing long-term alignment over short-term control. </p>



<p>The most defining shift of the week arrives on January 26th at 12:34 p.m. EST, when Neptune enters Aries, beginning a brand-new thirteen-year chapter for the collective. This marks a major transition away from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>, which emphasized dreaming, dissolving, and spiritual sensitivity since 2011, sometimes without follow- through. Neptune in Aries is about initiating the dream, embodying it, and fighting for a vision rather than passively hoping for one. We’re moving out of the influencer era and deeper into a protagonist era, where more people feel called to live their own stories instead of consuming someone else’s. </p>



<p>On a global level, this transit carries weight. Aries is ruled by Mars, and Neptune here can inspire movements, conflicts, and ideological battles driven by belief as much as reality. The shadow is dreaming up chaos, glorifying dominance, or leaders competing to prove who is strongest, especially as Saturn prepares to join Neptune in Aries next month. The invitation, both personally and collectively, is to dream new worlds responsibly. To believe in yourself enough to take action without turning that fire into destruction. To choose courage without self-sabotage, and passion without violence. </p>



<p>The week closes by pointing us toward what comes next. February begins with a fiery Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, a striking contrast to the Earth, Air, and Water-heavy energy that has dominated January. Where January opened with a cleansing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cancer-new-moon-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">Cancer Full Moon</a>, February begins with bold, expressive fire. This Leo Full Moon illuminates confidence, creativity, leadership, and the desire to be seen. At its best, it reminds us that playing small no longer serves anyone, and that joy, pride, and self-expression are not selfish. </p>



<p>The shadow of this full moon is ego, control, or needing all eyes on you at the expense of others. The work is finding the balance between honoring your needs and remembering that true leadership inspires rather than dominates. This Full Moon asks one simple but powerful question as we move forward: where are you finally ready to take up space, unapologetically and with heart? </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, welcome to your <em>main character era</em>, officially unlocked. This week marks the start of one of the most important transits of your lifetime as Neptune enters your sign on January 26th, where it’ll remain for the next thirteen years. This is huge. Neptune in Aries is about turning dreams into action, and for you, it feels like the universe handing you the creative director chair of your own life. Your intuition sharpens, your vision expands, and suddenly the future feels less abstract and more achievable. You’re being asked to dream boldly and act bravely, but the challenge is staying grounded while you do it. </p>



<p>Neptune can blur lines, so there may be moments where you feel invincible one minute and impatient the next when things do not move fast enough. Pace yourself. Manifestation is not a sprint. When you pair faith with follow-through, your ability to bring your dreams to life is far stronger now than it was even a few weeks ago. </p>



<p>The fire only intensifies as the week leads into a Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your sector of fate, romance, creativity, and joy. This is a chef’s-kiss moment for self-expression, passion projects, and heart-led decisions. You may experience a breakthrough in love, feel seen for your talents, or finally give yourself permission to take up more space without apology. </p>



<p>At its best, this Full Moon reminds you that you deserve a life that excites you. The shadow of this lunation, however, is assuming everything should go your way instantly or taking setbacks personally. Confidence is magnetic, but entitlement blocks the flow. Let this Full Moon fuel your courage, not your ego. When you stay open, playful, and patient, this fiery week sets the tone for a powerful, purpose-driven chapter ahead. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week is quietly powerful, even if it doesn’t scream for attention at first. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your subconscious, rest, and healing sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is less about loud manifestation and more about deep internal rewiring. Old fears, patterns, and self-sabotaging habits are ready to dissolve, but only if you are willing to slow down and listen to what your inner world has been trying to say. </p>



<p>Dreams may feel more vivid, intuition stronger, and your need for rest more non-negotiable. The magic here is subtle but real. When you give yourself permission to unplug, heal, and trust your instincts, you are laying the foundation for a future version of yourself that feels lighter, clearer, and more aligned. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, illuminating your home, family, and emotional foundations sector. This can bring a turning point around living situations, family dynamics, or your sense of belonging. You may feel ready to take up more space in your personal life or finally advocate for what you need emotionally. </p>



<p>The shadow of this Full Moon is reacting from pride or stubbornness instead of vulnerability. Not every battle needs to be won, and not every feeling needs to be defended. Let this moment remind you that strength can look like softness too. When you balance emotional honesty with flexibility, this week helps you feel more secure, rooted, and at peace with where you are headed.  </p>

<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, your social life and long-term dreams are entering a whole new era. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your friendship, community, and future-goals sector gets a major glow up that lasts for the next thirteen years. This transit invites you to dream bigger about the kind of people you want around you and the impact you want to make. </p>



<p>During Neptune in Aries, you may feel inspired to build something meaningful with others, whether that’s a creative collective, a business idea, or a cause you actually care about. The magic here is believing in the vision without losing yourself in it. Neptune can blur boundaries, so be mindful of overcommitting or idealizing people who have not shown consistency yet. Dream big, but choose your circle wisely. </p>



<p>The week crescendos with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and self-expression sector. This is a powerful moment for speaking your truth, sharing your work, or finally saying the thing you have been holding back. Confidence is high, creativity is flowing, and your voice carries extra weight right now. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this Full Moon is talking just to be heard or letting ego override empathy. Let this Full Moon remind you that your words have power. When you speak from the heart instead of the highlight reel, people actually listen. This is your moment to be seen and heard, just make sure it’s for the right reasons. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this week marks a major turning point in how you dream about your future and your role in the world. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your career, purpose, and public image sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is big. You are being invited to envision a version of success that feels meaningful, intuitive, and aligned with who you actually are, not just what is expected of you. </p>



<p>Under Neptune in Aries, you may feel more inspired about your path, but also more sensitive to whether your work truly reflects your values. The magic here is learning to trust your vision while staying grounded in reality. Neptune can blur lines, so avoid romanticizing a role, title, or opportunity without checking whether it’s sustainable. When you pair intuition with discernment, your dreams become achievable rather than overwhelming. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your money, self-worth, and abundance sector. This Full Moon asks you to own your value without shrinking or over-explaining. You may experience a financial breakthrough, a confidence boost, or a moment where you finally realize you deserve more than you’ve been settling for. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this Full Moon is tying your worth too tightly to external validation or spending impulsively to prove a point. Let this Full Moon remind you that abundance starts with self-trust. When you believe in yourself unapologetically, others follow your lead. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week is quietly redefining what expansion and purpose mean for you on a soul level. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your sector of travel, higher learning, spirituality, and belief systems is activated for the next thirteen years. Translation: your worldview is about to get a serious upgrade. You may feel called to explore new philosophies, spiritual practices, creative studies, or even literal new places. </p>



<p>Neptune in Aries is a long-term invitation to dream bigger about your life and trust that growth does not always come from staying comfortable. The challenge here is staying grounded while you explore. Neptune can blur direction, so it is important to stay curious without getting lost in fantasy. Think inspired, not impulsive. </p>



<p>Then comes the moment you were born for. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lands in your identity and self-expression sector, putting you front and center. This is a powerful checkpoint around confidence, visibility, and authenticity. You may feel ready to claim space, be seen, or finally stop dimming yourself for the comfort of others. </p>



<p>At its best, this Full Moon reminds you that you deserve to lead with heart and creativity. The shadow of the Full Moon in your sign is falling victim to ego overload, control issues, or needing constant validation. Let this be a moment of embodied confidence rather than performance. When you show up as your real self, not just the highlight reel, your light hits different. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, this week marks the start of a deep, transformative era that asks you to trust what you cannot fully control. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional merging is activated for the next thirteen years. This is about redefining how you share, trust, and open yourself up, financially, emotionally, and energetically. You may feel more sensitive around boundaries or more aware of where you’ve been over-giving. The magic here is learning that vulnerability does not equal weakness. The challenge is staying clear-eyed while you open your heart. Neptune can blur lines, so honesty, transparency, and self-trust are essential as you step into deeper connections and commitments. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, illuminating your rest, healing, and subconscious sector. This Full Moon invites you to slow down and listen to what your body and spirit have been trying to tell you. You may experience emotional releases, vivid dreams, or a realization about what you are ready to let go of. </p>



<p>The shadow of the Leo Full Moon is ignoring the need for rest or trying to “optimize” your healing instead of feeling it. Let this moment remind you that renewal does not come from doing more. When you honor rest as part of your process, you emerge clearer, stronger, and more aligned for what comes next. </p>

<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, this week oﬃcially changes the way you approach love, partnership, and commitment for the long haul. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your relationship sector is activated for the next thirteen years. Yes, thirteen. This is a major reimagining of how you connect, collaborate, and share your life with others. You may feel more romantic, idealistic, or hopeful about love and partnership, but Neptune also asks for discernment. </p>



<p>The magic of this transit is believing in deep, soul-aligned connections without losing yourself in them. The challenge is not projecting fantasies onto people who have not shown up consistently. Over the next chapter, you are learning that true partnership supports your independence rather than replacing it. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This Full Moon brings clarity around who is really in your corner and which connections energize your future. You may feel ready to step into leadership within a group, celebrate a collective win, or finally distance yourself from social dynamics that feel draining. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this moon is people-pleasing or craving approval instead of honoring your truth. Let this Full Moon remind you that belonging does not require shrinking. When you show up authentically, the right people naturally rise to meet you. </p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week is about redefining what it means to show up for your life on a daily basis. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your work, wellness, and routine sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is a long-term invitation to stop running on autopilot and start aligning your everyday life with your deeper values. You may feel more sensitive to burnout, uninspired routines, or work that drains you without meaning. </p>



<p>The magic of Neptune in Aries is learning to design a life that supports your energy, not just your ambition. However, you should beware of falling prey to escapism or avoiding structure altogether. Neptune wants flow, but Aries demands action. The sweet spot is intuitive discipline, building habits that feel purposeful rather than punishing. </p>



<p>The energy crescendos with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your career, reputation, and public image sector. This can bring a moment of recognition, visibility, or clarity around your professional direction. You may feel ready to step into leadership or finally own your authority. </p>



<p>The shadow of the Leo Full Moon is getting caught up in power struggles, ego clashes, or feeling pressure to perform instead of lead authentically. Let this Full Moon remind you that confidence does not require domination. When you lead from integrity and emotional intelligence, your presence speaks louder than control ever could. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week flips a major creative switch for you. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26, your sector of joy, romance, creativity, and self-expression is activated for the next thirteen years. Yes, thirteen. This is huge main-character energy around doing what lights you up and actually believing you deserve a life that feels inspiring. </p>



<p>You may feel more artistically driven, more romantic, or more willing to take risks for the sake of passion rather than practicality. The magic of this auspicious transit is trusting your creative instincts and letting play be productive. The shadow is chasing dopamine instead of fulfillment or romanticizing something that does not have real substance. Dream big, but stay honest with yourself about what is truly nourishing versus just exciting. </p>



<p>The week builds toward the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your travel, growth, and belief sector. This Full Moon can bring a breakthrough around purpose, perspective, or a bold decision about your future. You may feel ready to say yes to an opportunity that expands your world or finally let go of a belief that has been keeping you small. </p>



<p>The potential pitfalls of this full moon is thinking you have all the answers or pushing your truth onto others. Let this moment remind you that wisdom grows when curiosity stays alive. When you lead with openness and confidence, the next chapter unfolds naturally. </p>



<div id=""capricorn""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week marks the beginning of a deeply emotional and transformative era around home, family, and your inner foundation. With <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Neptune entering Aries</a> on January 26th, your sector of roots, living situation, and emotional security is activated for the next thirteen years. This is not surface-level change. You’re being asked to reimagine what “home” means to you, not just physically, but emotionally and energetically. </p>



<p>With this new Neptune era, you may feel more sensitive to your environment, family dynamics, or where you truly feel safe. The magic of Neptune in Aries is learning that stability does not have to be rigid. The challenge is not escaping discomfort by staying busy or emotionally distant. Over this long chapter, you are learning how to build a life that feels supportive from the inside out, not just impressive from the outside. </p>



<p>The energy peaks with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional vulnerability. This Full Moon asks you to go deeper rather than harder. Conversations around trust, money, or emotional honesty may come to a head, oﬀering clarity about what needs to shift. </p>



<p>The shadow side of this lunation is control, pride, or trying to manage feelings instead of feeling them. Let this moment remind you that real power comes from allowing yourself to be supported too. When you soften where you normally armor up, you create space for deeper connection and long-term healing. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, your mind is entering a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">whole new era</a>. With Neptune entering Aries on January 26th, your communication, ideas, and mindset sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is big “thought leader” energy. Your words, ideas, and perspectives carry more imagination, influence, and emotional resonance than before. You may feel inspired to write, teach, speak, create content, or share ideas that feel deeply personal and purpose-driven. </p>



<p>The magic that Neptune in Aries brings is learning to trust your voice without over-editing yourself. The shadow is confusion, overthinking, or starting ten ideas without grounding any of them. Neptune wants vision, Aries wants action. When you commit to one idea at a time, your message actually lands. </p>



<p>The week culminates with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your relationship sector and bringing clarity to one-on-one dynamics. This Full Moon puts a spotlight on partnerships, situationships, collaborations, and even creative rivals. You may realize who is truly cheering you on and who feels more competitive than supportive. </p>



<p>The danger of this full moon is making everything about ego or control, either yours or someone else’s. Let this moment remind you that the best relationships celebrate individuality without turning love into a power struggle. When mutual respect leads, everything else falls into place. </p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week marks a major turning point in how you build security, confidence, and self-worth. With Neptune, your ruling planet, entering Aries on January 26th, your money, values, and self-esteem sector is activated for the next thirteen years. This is huge. You’re being asked to stop romanticizing struggle and start believing that you can be both spiritual <em>and </em>supported. You may feel inspired to pursue new income streams, charge what you are worth, or redefine what stability looks like for you. </p>



<p>The magic of Neptune transiting Aries is trusting that you deserve more than survival mode. The shadow side of this transit is drifting, underpricing yourself, or hoping things will “just work out” without action. Neptune brings vision, but Aries demands courage. When you back your dreams with initiative, your relationship with abundance begins to change for real. </p>



<p>The week builds toward the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your work, wellness, and daily routines sector. This Full Moon shines a light on how you are showing up for yourself day to day. You may realize that certain habits, commitments, or work dynamics are no longer sustainable. </p>



<p>But beware, Pisces, as this Full Moon could lead to you pushing through exhaustion for the sake of proving something. The breakthrough comes when you choose self-respect over self-sacrifice. Let this Full Moon remind you that you do not have to earn rest or care. When your daily life supports your energy, everything else flows more easily.</p>

As such, they’re ideal for wearing alone during the daytime or even layering with other perfumes to create a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signature-scent-perfume-every-human-ai"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">bespoke result</a>.<br /><br />Not only is this a bourgeoning trend within perfumery, but it’s one that has made its way into R29 editors’ own routines for a much-needed moment of grounding and centering calm. Below, 12 tea-infused fragrances that we're spritzing nonstop until further notice. <br /> <br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

<p>If there’s one thing to know about me, it’s that nothing makes my beauty editor heart beat faster than finding a drugstore diamond in the rough. I’ve always been that way; my first makeup memories were in the aisles of CVS and Target, and I still gleefully peruse the stacks while waiting for a prescription to be filled.  </p>



<p>My latest discovery comes in the form of <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/conceal-perfect-blur-out-skin-tint-stick-pimprod2049385?sku=2635876"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick</a>, which I found via <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOoWoSLifRN/?igsh=MXd3ZDd1ZW9kcnI3eA=="" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">makeup artist Alexandra French’s</a> (whose celebrity clients include Katy Perry, Mary Beth Barone, and Victoria Pedretti) rave review (an essential follow, BTW!).

<h2><strong>What is Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick, and what are the benefits? </strong> </h2>



<p>It’s all in the name, really: Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick is a solid, cream-based product with the sheer, buildable coverage you would expect from a skin tint (and I’ve <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">tried several!</a>) with a soft-matte finish. Many products claim to lend a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blurred, filter-like effect</a>, but this one truly does — my pores and texture are almost undetectable when I have this on. It feels super lightweight on the skin, but is formulated with ingredients like moisturizing murumuru butter, strengthening vitamin E, and guava extract for a brightening boost of vitamin C.  </p>



<h2><strong>What makes Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick special? </strong> </h2>



<p>From the first swipe, I knew Milani’s Conceal + Perfect skin tint stick was something special — I audibly gasped when I saw the flawless shade match and sophisticated demi-matte finish. A little goes a long way (I’ve been testing mine for maybe two months now and still have plenty of product left), so the value aspect of this is also a major plus.  </p>



<p>I’ve tried a few high-end skin tint sticks ranging from Charlotte Tilbury to Dior, and Milani’s is by far my favorite — and the least expensive. What I love most about it is that it really does have an optical blurring effect — seriously, where did my pores go? — and a matte, but not flat finish that my oily skin loves. You can also layer this for extra coverage depending on how much you apply, but I usually will use a separate concealer in tandem with this if I’m craving more coverage around my forehead, chin, or nose.  </p>



<h2><strong>What to know about Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick: </strong> </h2>



<p>– Available in 25 shades . <br />– Sheer, buildable coverage with a soft-matte finish. <br />– Packed with moisturizing skincare ingredients and antioxidants. </p>



<h2><strong>How do you use Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick, and is it worth it?</strong> </h2>



<p>After prepping my skin with my morning skincare routine — serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen — and letting it absorb, I like to swipe Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick on the sides of my face, forehead, and chin. Then, I blend it out either with clean fingers or a fluffy brush like <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/flawless-face-brush-xlsImpprod14521237?sku=2500415"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f.’s Flawless Face Brush</a>. It sets within a minute or so, but if you’re extra oily or want it to stay in place all day, I recommend finishing with strategically placed loose powder and/or setting spray. (Again, this is totally optional!) My current favorites are the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/veil-translucent-setting-powder-P430240?skuId=2691046&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p430240:product"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hourglass Veil Translucent Setting Powder</a> and the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/airbrush-flawless-matte-blurring-waterproof-setting-spray-P516899"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Matte Blur Setting Spray</a>. </p>



<p>At $18.49, it performs like a much more expensive product; it glides on smoothly but doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. The coverage is also really customizable, allowing me to wear it as a true skin tint or as a more comprehensive complexion product. While it won’t completely mask active breakouts or hyperpigmentation, it does do an excellent job filtering out things like texture and pores. </p>

<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong> </h2>



<p>The best compliment I can give Milani’s Conceal + Perfect Blur Out Skin Tint Stick is that it’s not just a good product at a competitive price point; it’s a good product that will upgrade your makeup routine <em>period. </em>It checks so many of my boxes (not super expensive, inclusive shade range, doesn’t break me out, long-lasting) and is just so good, I genuinely can’t believe more people aren’t talking about it — well, until now, that is. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955752.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=732&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A183"" /><figcaption>Digital illustration of the universe and galaxies</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Elusive and empathetic Neptune is re-entering <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/january-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Aries on January 26th</a>, offering us a second chance to understand the journey ahead. This time around, we’ll go full throttle in Aries to find our path until March 2039. The nearly 14-year transit is augmenting the world and our lives. </p>



<p>To understand how transit affects us, it’s essential to look to the past to gain a clearer perspective. When Neptune was previously in Aries, we’ve seen reformation, uprisings, and advancements in society, particularly in the medical and scientific fields. Empires have risen, and others have fallen in history when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune has been in Aries</a>. To sum it up, the good comes with its challenges — that is how Neptune rolls.  </p>



<p>Last year, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/neptune-in-aries-horoscope-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Neptune made a quick entrance into Arie</a>s from March 30th to October 22nd, then moonwalked back into Pisces.  In questionable times, people have sometimes turned to mysticism to give them a sense of control and order amidst the political chaos. Spiritual Neptune urges us to take action to change our lives by any means possible. We can expect more magic until 2039. </p>



<p>One of the most important astrological transits of the year occurs on February 20th, when Neptune and Saturn link up in Aries. This planetary connection is set to bring sweeping changes to the collective, ushering in a new state of mind. A new era of creativity, innovation, and societal transformation is unfolding. The 1989 Neptune and Saturn conjunction in Sagittarius coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the onset of the Velvet Revolution. Although the alignment of these two celestial entities occurs approximately every 36 years, it has been centuries since they last came together in Aries. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment of Neptune and Saturn in Aries is making our dreams a reality, as long as we approach our progress with pragmatism and remain committed to the cause.  </p>



<p>Take note: July is going to be a stellar month for Neptune in Aries! Neptune and Uranus in Gemini harmonize on July 15th, changing the way we communicate with others. Neptune and Jupiter in Leo gently touch each other on July 20th, enhancing our compassion and artistry. Neptune and Pluto in Aquarius spark each other up on July 25th, rebirthing our ideology with novel perspectives. We’ll use our voice to fight authoritative forces and trust our intuition to guide us through challenging situations and choices.  </p>



<p>The following 13 years are going to intensify the effects of Neptune in Aries. But 2026 is going to bring us into a higher state of consciousness. We have until 2039 to figure out our next steps. For now, we must prioritize ourselves. We hold the ultimate power over our own success. Don’t forget that! </p>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"">favorite manicures of the moment</a> are loosely inspired by Cupid, flowers, and all things love. But just like the poppy-red Sezane cardigan in your wardrobe, these nail looks are timeless and a little flirty. </p>

<p>Having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/combination-imbalanced-skincare-routine"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">combination skin</a> is like bringing all your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">different friendship groups</a> together on your birthday — but instead of enjoying yourself on the karaoke machine, you’re making sure they get along. Keeping every personality happy at once is no easy feat, and the same goes for managing two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-cleansing-routine-skin-type"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin types</a>. In my experience, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-moisturizer-for-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moisturizers for dry skin</a> tend to be unctuously thick, which can trigger breakouts, while those made for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oily skin</a> are often too light to make a difference. So when I find a product that does it all — quenching dry patches and delivering hydration without a greasy feel — I have to shout about it. Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s new Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. </p>



<h2>What is The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Don’t be fooled by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. At first glance, it looks like one of the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">many serums</a>, and while it boasts a lightweight, milky consistency and comes in a dropper bottle, this product is actually a moisturizer. </p>



<p>The Ordinary drew inspiration <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">from K-beauty</a>, specifically milky skincare textures, when developing this moisturizer, and its star ingredient — rice lipids — also nods to Eastern beauty rituals. You might be familiar with rice water in skincare, but lipids are a little different. NYC-based dermatologist <a href=""https://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/"">Joshua Zeichner, MD</a>, explains, “Rice lipids are natural fats derived from the outer layer of the rice grain known as the bran, and they have emollient benefits.” This, adds Dr. Zeichner, means they “fill in cracks” between cells on the surface of the skin. As a result, Dr. Zeichner explains that rice lipids can soften the outer skin layer, or what is known as the skin barrier.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, $13</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955647.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-ectoin-hydro-barrier-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ectoin, a skincare ingredient</a> that’s finally getting its dues in skincare. “Ectoin is a naturally derived compound that helps maintain a healthy skin barrier and protects skin from the environment,” says Dr. Zeichner. He adds that it’s naturally found in bacteria that live in extreme conditions, helping those bacteria to survive. “In skincare, it improves hydration and provides antioxidant benefits to prevent inflammation,” continues Dr. Zeichner. If your skin feels rough, flaky, or tight after cleansing, then ectoin is for you. Even better? It has a soothing effect on inflamed skin, and over time, it can help improve uneven skin texture.  </p>



<p>For the ingredient buffs, hydrating electrolyte molecules and amino acids — the building blocks of skin-strengthening proteins — are also present in this milky moisturizer. These are both present in the skin anyway, but sometimes our reserves run low, resulting in dry skin. But there’s good news: “These ingredients have been replicated and used in skincare products,” says Dr. Zeichner, “and they pull hydration into the skin.” As someone currently using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength retinol</a> and really feeling the effects of cold weather and central heating, this sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What makes The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion special? </h2>



<p>Lightweight moisturizers can be hit or miss. In fact, my bathroom cabinet is lined with gel-cream products that keep my oily T-zone happy but just don’t cut it on my dry patches, so I slotted this into my routine the day it landed at my door — and I’m so glad I did.  </p>



<p>I started using it after ditching a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength acid</a> that wrecked my skin barrier, and within just a couple of days, my skin had already recovered. It was less red and angry; the dry skin around my mouth had disappeared, and there was a subtle dewy sheen that meant I didn’t want to wear as much foundation. I ended up dropping my thicker moisturizer and shelving my hydrating serum, too, because this does it all. I even take it up to my eyes and use it as an eye cream — it’s that moisturizing. </p>



<p>Besides the powerhouse ingredients, how the moisturizer is made is pretty special. Without boring you with the science, the formula goes through microfluidization, a high-pressure mixing technique that blends light, water-based ingredients with slightly heavier, oil-based ones. The result? A lightweight, comfortable moisturizer that absorbs quickly but is substantial enough to hydrate even dry skin. </p>



<h2>What to know about The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion </h2>



<p>• Reduces visible skin redness after one use. </p>



<p>• Provides hydration for up to 24 hours and repairs a weakened skin barrier. </p>



<p>• Can be used in the morning and evening and comes in 60ml and 120ml bottles. </p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and is it worth it? </h2>



<p>My skincare routine is pretty simple. In the morning, I wash my face with a cream cleanser, apply a pipette-full of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin</a>, then finish with three finger lengths of sunscreen. In the evening, I double cleanse to remove all traces of makeup and sunscreen, apply Rice Lipids + Ectoin, and finish with my retinal serum. I find that, even though this moisturizer is featherlight, it provides a nice cushion for retinoids and helps reduce irritation and flaky patches of skin. </p>



<p>Because it’s such an all-rounder, I’ve happily and easily recommended it to anyone looking for a simple moisturizer that transcends seasons. While it’s working wonders on my skin this winter, it’ll be just as brilliant come spring and summer, thanks to its quenching feel and lack of any slippery residue. Better still, a 60ml bottle is only $13. If you love it as much as me, you grab the 120ml bottle, which is $22.50.  </p>



<h2>Where can you get The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion? </h2>

<p>“Every January, L’Oréal unveils a mascara to rival the previous year’s, and I’m convinced it’s impossible to beat the last one — but I’m always proven wrong. Big Deal is a serious upgrade on the Panorama Mascara, which scooped the top spot in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">2024’s Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a>, and I’ve barely gone a day without it. Most mascaras are too wet on the first swipe, but this one is perfect from the get-go. The springy, conic brush boasts two types of bristles to capture and thicken lashes in one swipe, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how easily it slips on. Just like its predecessor, it stays put until you decide to remove it at the end of the day. Smudges? Where?!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“My bathroom cabinet is lined with oils promising growth, shine, and 101 other benefits, but this is the one I always come back to — and the only oil I actually finished last year. I run a quarter of a pipette through towel-dried hair before blow-drying, and it leaves my hair shinier, softer, and healthier, without even a hint of heaviness. That’s thanks to glycolic acid, which smooths the hair cuticle to reduce frizz, plus hydrating hyaluronic acid suspended in a nourishing yet lightweight oil base. When I skip it, I really notice the difference. Even better, the subtle rose and sandalwood notes mean it doubles as a hair perfume.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve never met a heat protectant that didn’t make my hair feel greasy and look dull — until this. While it’s deeply conditioning thanks to a blend of plant oils and strand-strengthening proteins, it offers lightweight heat protection up to an impressive 450°F. I use it knowing it shields my hair from my flat iron without ever weighing it down, even if I accidentally apply too much. I recently gave a bottle to my mom, who has very dry, bleached blonde hair and usually relies on Olaplex, and she hasn’t stopped raving about how soft it leaves her hair — and how much easier it is to style. She’s a total convert.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“This no-frills cleanser is the skincare product I bought most in 2025. It feels like a lightweight lotion but transforms on contact with water into a silky milk that dislodges mascara and melts foundation, all without leaving skin feeling stripped or tight. The star ingredient is 5% rice milk, a key component in many dew-giving Korean skincare products, along with hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin. It does the job of an expensive cleanser at a fraction of the price, and it’s so quick I no longer dread washing my face at night. That’s no small feat!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“If you’ve asked me on any given day what lipstick I was wearing last fall, it was almost certainly this one. I usually never wear matte liquid lipsticks, and for a few reasons: Too many of them are uncomfortably dry, go on patchy, or migrate at first bite or sip. I was already a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.violettefr.com%2Fproducts%2Fpetal-bouche-amour-fou%3Fvariant%3D43587553755325"">Violette_FR’s iconic Petal Bouche</a> matte liquid lipstick, but its newer addition, Plume Lip, is even better. It has the most incredible whipped texture that effortlessly glides onto lips, and doesn’t feel like dry cement once it sets. I audibly gasped after I swatched the rosy brown Châtaigne Grillée (aka my new go-to for everyday wear) — <em>that’s </em>how stunning she is IRL. Because I’m in my soft girl era, I’m especially loving Plume Lip’s diffused, blurred finish, which is just so pretty and romantic.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“Another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lancome-lip-idole-juicytreat-gloss-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">breakout favorite among R29’s beauty editors</a> appeared in the form of Lancôme’s JuicyTreat Lip Oil Gloss, which proved that lightning can indeed strike twice. (This, said by a girl who keeps a Juicy Tubes in every bag.) I’m convinced the magic is in the hydrating, naturally plumping benefits, thanks to the squalane-packed formula. Any gloss can sit atop lips with a shiny finish, but true ‘juiciness’ comes from lips that are soft and nourished, then made even better by gloss.

<p>“I’ve lost count of how many blushes — from pressed powders to creams — landed on my desk in 2025, but this is the only one I used consistently. It’s a chunky product, so you only need a single swipe, and it has a subtle iridescence that makes my skin look alive. When I have to join a last-minute virtual call, it’s the product I reach for to look fresh in seconds. I pop it on my cheeks, lids, and lips, and I’m always impressed by how well it stays put, even though it’s a cream.

<p>“I recently donated a foot of my hair, and while I love my new bob, the styling learning curve is real. For days when I don’t feel like using a curling iron to enhance my natural waves, I’ve been using mousse as an easy air-dry hack, and my favorite from recent history is, without a doubt, Crown Affair’s Texturizing Air Dry Mousse. It’s easily the most sophisticated mousse I’ve ever tried, and I’m convinced it’s the closest thing to what clouds must feel like. The weightlessness, airy foam has none of the crunch I knew (and hated) from back in the day, and the soft scent (Crown Affair’s signature blend of bergamot, yuzu, and lemongrass) is clean and refreshing. I finger-comb three or four pumps of the stuff into damp strands and watch as my hair air-dries in soft, tousled waves with just the right amount of bounce.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-builder-gel-manicure-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Builder gel manicures</a> are a salon staple for good reason, and we have Olive &amp; June to thank for bringing the technology in an easy, user-friendly format that you can do right at home. I’m a reformed anxious nail biter with notoriously brittle nails as a result, and Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel has been a game-changer for my natural nail journey. Designed in tandem with the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">existing DIY gel system</a>, Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel polishes (retailing for $12 each) are thicker in texture than traditional gel polish, creating a strong, supportive barrier to help grow your natural nails. My go-to is <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/products/creme-caramel-builder-gel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crème Caramel</a>, a gorgeous sheer, warm beige, and <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-builder-polish/products/soft-tint-builder-gel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Soft Tint</a>, a your-nails-but-better sheer veil with a hint of sparkle.

<p>“Last June, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">best skin tint</a> for people with olive skin, and I stand by it — I’ve been using it ever since. I’ve tried multiple high-end skin tints and foundations over the past year, but I always come back to this one. It’s more substantial than other tints I’ve tried, yet the coverage is perfect — not too thick, but pigmented enough to blur dark circles and acne marks. It blends in seconds, leaves my skin looking healthy and radiant, <em>and</em> has mineral protection in the form of SPF 50.

Cosmetics’ Halo Glow Skin Tint</a> was my go-to for most of last year, besting several formulas (including those double the price) in my extensive collection. Nothing I’ve tried (and I’ve tried what feels like hundreds) compares to its lightweight hydration and sheer veil of coverage. (Added SPF 50 is a welcome bonus, even if it doesn’t replace sunscreen as a separate step — say it with me!) I also want to shoutout the niacinamide and bisabol in the formula, two ingredients that my notoriously breakout-prone skin loves. Anything with ‘glow’ in the name tends not to suit my oily complexion, but Halo Glow actually has a wearable, not greasy, finish that genuinely looks like you don’t have makeup on. Between this and the brand’s beloved <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpower-grip-primer-pimprod2030073%3Fsku%3D2591795"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Power Grip Primer</a> (another personal go-to of mine), I’m racking up e.l.f. faves like Infinity Stones — and don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“ghd is my go-to hair tool brand any day of the week, especially its Curve wand, which gives me the loose, S-shape bends of my dreams. Now, it’s bigger and better. Enter: the new Chronos Max Curve, a larger-barrel wand designed to make light work of thick, long hair. Waving hair can feel like a chore, but this lets me take bigger sections and finish in half the time. What I love about ghd tools is that they deliver results without frazzling your hair — they’re capped at 365°F — yet my waves still last, and my hair always looks incredibly shiny.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“In Paris last August, this scent seemed to follow me everywhere — from the Louvre to Montmartre — and even back to London. It’s become the ultimate European perfume, with people literally chasing strangers to ask what they’re wearing (<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@sasscarella/video/7549550575688437006"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this TikTok alone has 2.8M views</a>). I had to get my hands on a bottle, and I can confirm it’s incredible. It’s equal parts spicy and floral, thanks to creamy jasmine and clean sandalwood, while the ‘solar’ notes make it warm and comforting, like cozying up in your favorite cashmere sweater.

<p>“Last week, I left the house without this and had to turn back to get it — even though I was already a 20-minute walk away by the time I realized. That’s how I knew it deserved a Beauty Innovator Award. One swipe delivers a sheer wash of color, and while it feels like a lip gloss at first, it dries down to a comfortable, moisturizing balm that leaves my usually parched lips feeling soothed and soft. That’ll be the shea butter and plant oils. I’m convinced the subtle shimmer makes my lips look more plump.

<p>“I’ve really put this hairspray through its paces. The first time I used it was before a 10-hour flight that turned into a 24-hour travel day thanks to delays. Even though I slept in it, my waves didn’t budge an inch — so much so that my travel companions were convinced I’d packed a portable curling iron and redone my hair in the airport bathroom. While it delivers a strong hold, there’s no hint of crispiness. Instead, hair stays glossy, flexible, and completely resistant to humidity. Better still, you can brush it out, and it’s like it was never even there. No flakes, no stickiness, nothing.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I was a big fan of Kosas’ debut mascara, The Big Clean, which packed lash serum-like ingredients in an inky black, volumizing mascara.

The brand’s<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Soulgazer Mascara</a> was indeed an improvement in every sense.

<p>“Call me biased, as I’m a Brit, but UK skincare brand Medik8 really broke the mold with this moisturizer. It’s packed with all the ingredients skin needs to maintain bounce, radiance, and strength. Think peptides that help preserve the skin’s collagen reserves, keeping it soft and supple; polyglutamic acid, which hydrates far more deeply than hyaluronic acid; and growth factors to further support collagen and elastin, the two key proteins that give skin structure and help prevent fine lines.

<p>“I finished this body wash months ago, and I’m still thinking about it. While its main job is to cleanse, the added ingredients make it feel like a treatment. Glycolic acid (an AHA) gently exfoliates and helps fade the marks left by body breakouts, while salicylic acid (a BHA) prevents clogged pores from forming in the first place. Despite a satisfying lather, it’s deeply moisturizing thanks to shea butter and glycerin — I often skipped body lotion altogether.

<p>“I’ve been a ZIIP devotee ever since getting a facial from founder Melanie Simon several years ago; I’ll never forget seeing my skin visibly lifted and brighter after one session with her, and continued to use the brand’s hero product, the Halo, to help tone facial muscles, address uneven tone, and treat breakouts — that’s right, it does it all, thanks to the power of nano- and microcurrent. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ziip-dot-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ZIIP’s latest device, the Dot</a>, brings the same technology in a palm-sized, acne-focused tool that retails for half of the Halo. Within weeks of regular use (I alternate every other day), I noticed fewer acne and clogged pores, and brighter, more radiant skin to boot. (I’ve found that it’s especially effective at targeting cystic acne, which is notoriously hard to treat with topicals alone.) All in all, if you’re looking to boost your acne skincare routine, I can’t think of a better addition to your arsenal.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“When this launched, it was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">talk of our editor Slack channel</a>. I love Tatcha’s original Dewy Moisturizer, but my skin adores this lightweight version even more — so much so that I’ve gone through two bottles in the past year. That’s saying something considering how many moisturizers I need to try for my job. While it’s thinner than its original counterpart, it still delivers a hydrating punch. And the dew? Unrivaled. My skin feels happier and healthier for using it — fewer breakouts and fine lines, better radiance, and a perfect base for makeup. It isn’t greasy or sticky and feels comfortably moisturizing.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I loved this fragrance so much that I wore it on my wedding day last year. (It is now stored in a cool, dark room so I can treasure it forever.) The crisp mix of citrus, white florals, and musk is undeniably romantic, but not super girly or feminine. At first spritz, the bright bergamot and orange blossom are invigorating and clean, but as the scent dries down, I pick up on the lingering floral notes left behind. (This is also a scent that will stay for hours, from getting-ready to dancing the night away.) As the name suggests, it’s an olfactive interpretation of snowy slopes and the cozy appeal of <em>après-ski </em>— fitting as we said ‘I do’ at our favorite ski mountain.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“ICYMI, Shark has been absolutely crushing it in the beauty tool space, and its latest hair innovation is no exception. Meet Shark Glam, which combines the same wet-to-dry technology you loved from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the FlexFusion</a> with faster dry time, shinier results, and less heat damage than its predecessor. Myriad attachments — including curling barrels, smoothing brushes, and a straightener — grant you endless style possibilities. I’m a fan of the Glossi brush attachment, which takes damp, clean hair to smooth and bouncy in a matter of passes.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>
