<h2>Best Work Tote Bags</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953190.png?width=806&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=403%3A512"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tote-bags"">Tote bags</a> have cemented their status as a standout choice for work, and for good reason. The spacious style can carry so much, and, when designed for work, have extra compartments, pockets, pouches, and zippers to help organize your belongings. We’re partial to leather totes because of their chicness and longevity, but less expansive alternatives like nylon and polyester make a case for durability. Whether you opt for a boxy or bucket shape, any of these options will surely become your go-to work companion.  </p>

<h2>Best Work Laptop Bags</h2>

<p>If you really mean business, opt for a laptop bag with handy dividers, sleeves, and compartments. From totes to briefcases, these designs keep <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">your tech</a> secure, your accessories perfectly organized, and your on-the-go style sharp. (Many are also available in multiple sizes to fit 13-inch or 16-inch laptops.)  </p>

<p>Looking to get a work bag that’ll last you many years to come? It may be worth investing in a luxe leather style from a designer brand. From Polène’s bestselling Cyme sculptural bag to Mansur Gavriel’s signature <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mansur-gavriel-candy-bag-review-promo-code-deal"">Candy hobo bag</a>, some iconic handbags prove they’re very versatile and can be worn from work to dinner. Seek out oversized styles, high-quality leather, and sturdy straps to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Best Work Backpacks</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953240.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-bags-belt-crossbody-tote-duffle"">Backpacks</a> are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Consider tried-and-true, water-repellant (and washable!) fabrics in streamlined designs or more sophisticated pebbled leather and quilted fabrics to upgrade your look. Features like adjustable shoulder straps, metal hardware, laptop sleeves, and water bottle pockets are the cherry on top of a commuter-friendly and work-appropriate backpack. </p>

<p>When it comes to business trips, bags with suitcase sleeves are a must. And these zippered options — from oversized totes to mini duffle bags — combine organized interiors with travel-smart features, like water-repellant fabrics and tons of compartments. Ideal for navigating terminals and heading straight to meetings, these travel work bags are the perfect blend of style and functionality. </p>

<p>Channel the sophistication of the ’30s to ’60s with structured top-handle bags, curved (trendy) bowling bags, or slim briefcases that blend vintage charm with modern refinement. And thankfully, many of these styles come with detachable straps so you can also wear them as shoulder and crossbody bags. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953299.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve always heard that Singapore has one of the most beautiful airports in the world, but what no one told me is that I’d fall in love with everything else, too. From the food and architecture to the people and its overall vibe, Singapore completely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/portugal-reminded-me-i-deserve-luxury"">exceeded my expectations</a>. When I landed, I was already plotting my return flight. Honestly, I’d go back tomorrow if I could. </p>



<p> But let’s start at the beginning. The most daunting part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-travel-pants"">journey was the flight</a>. Eighteen hours nonstop from New York is no joke. It’s the longest nonstop flight in the world. I was nervous, to say the least. But flying Singapore Airlines in business class changed everything. I slept like a baby. No exaggeration, this was the most comfortable I’ve ever been on a plane. The service was flawless, and the food menu felt more like dining at a restaurant than airline meals. If you’re making the trek, I highly recommend splurging on business class. Your body will thank you.</p>



<p>I was also worried about the weather. Singapore is known for its heat and humidity; and humidity and me do not mix. Thankfully, I packed light, breathable fabrics that didn’t betray me when the sweat arrived. Preparation is everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 1: First Impressions &amp; Instant Obsession</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953400.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>After a long but incredibly comfortable flight, we landed in Singapore and headed straight to <a href=""https://www.qthotels.com/singapore/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=gmb""><strong>QT Singapore</strong></a>. The hotel was gorgeously decorated for the holidays, modern, chic, and thoughtfully designed down to every last detail. After a much-needed nap, we kicked things off at <a href=""https://www.marinabaysands.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=GMB&amp;utm_campaign=hotel_info_main""><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong></a>, which is a hotel, mall, restaurant hub, and convention center all in one. The scale alone is jaw-dropping.</p>



<p>Lunch felt like the right place to start, so we <a href=""https://www.jumboseafood.com.sg/en/home""><strong>went to Jumbo</strong></a>, famously known for its chili crab. We didn’t get to try that dish, but everything we ordered was still a hit. After some light shopping, we wrapped the evening with <a href=""https://www.marcys.sg/""><strong>dinner at Marcy’s</strong></a>, a popular Italian spot where the food was a solid 10/10. For drinks, we ended the night at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sagohouse.sg/?hl=en""><strong>Sago House</strong></a>, where hip-hop and R&amp;B played all night. I was genuinely surprised by how at home I felt.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 2: Tourist Mode (Happily) Activated</strong></h2>



<p>We leaned all the way into sightseeing, starting at <a href=""https://www.visitsingapore.com/neighbourhood/featured-neighbourhood/marina-bay/merlion-park/""><strong>Merlion Park </strong></a>for the iconic photo with the half-lion, half-fish statue. One of my favorite parts of traveling is doing things I’d never do at home. Times Square? Absolutely not. But in Singapore, even locals visit the landmarks and everything is spotless. (Fun fact: littering is illegal.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953344.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>Next up was Chinatown, which exists everywhere in the world and still manages to feel special in every city. It was the perfect place to grab souvenirs. We continued our city tour with a temple visit, matcha stops (very American of us), and dinner at <a href=""https://www.thecoconutclub.sg/""><strong>Coconut Club</strong></a>, where the food was another easy 10/10. I ate a lot of meat and rice but somehow didn’t feel bloated. Back home, I’d be reaching for Tums immediately.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 3: Culture, Food &amp; Feeling Safe</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953347.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>This day was all about understanding Singaporean culture, starting with a food tour at a local hawker center. Think open-air food courts with multiple vendors serving traditional dishes and here’s the kicker: most Singaporeans don’t cook. Eating at hawker centers is cheaper and more convenient than cooking at home. We tried dish after dish, but my favorite came from a Michelin-starred chef named <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cheflup_roasted/?hl=en""><strong>Chef Lup</strong></a>. I’m still thinking about that roasted pork.</p>



<p>One of the most fascinating cultural differences I witnessed: Saving seats. People simply leave a personal item on a chair or table, and no one takes it. That would never work in New York. I felt incredibly safe the entire time, which is something that truly stood out as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-british-women-travel-self-esteem"">Black woman traveling abroad</a>.</p>



<p>That evening, we had dinner at<strong> </strong><a href=""https://sg.celavi.com/""><strong>CÉ LA VI</strong></a>, a rooftop spot with sweeping city views. Between the skyline and the fact that Singapore is 13 hours ahead, it genuinely felt like I was in the future. We were standing in one of the tallest buildings in the world, taking it all in.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 5: Thrills, Screams &amp; R&amp;B</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953348.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>We spent the day at <a href=""https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/play/universal-studios-singapore""><strong>Universal Studios Singapore</strong></a>, fully embracing our inner kids. I’ll admit, I am not a roller coaster person. But I said yes anyway and immediately regretted it. The Revenge of the Mummy ride had me questioning every life choice I’ve ever made. My boyfriend was having the time of his life while I screamed and held on for dear life. Still, it was worth it just to say I went to Universal Studios on another continent.</p>



<p>That night, we headed to dinner at <a href=""https://www.mamadiamsg.com/menu""><strong>Mama Diam</strong></a>, a speakeasy disguised as a corner store that opens into a sleek, modern space playing R&amp;B all night. I love a speakeasy night out. It’s one of my favorite activities in New York. Singapore really knows how to make you feel at home, even when you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<h3><strong>Day 6: Gin, Spa Bliss &amp; Caribbean Roots</strong></h3>



<p>Our final day might’ve been my favorite. We visited <a href=""https://brassliondistillery.com/pages/gin-school?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=22936484064&amp;utm_content=183877836945&amp;utm_term=gin%20workshop%20singapore&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22936484064&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACcdwB9T2T9MiR5AdB9q73dTtlrAf&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EpJnOlG9TFjP426InfGx5mEV29gkCyo0PTXr29KrIngL81tzS87iekaAv42EALw_wcB""><strong>Brass Lion Gin</strong></a>, the first Singaporean gin distillery, where we learned how to make gin from scratch in three hours. I’ve never been much of a gin girl (outside of the occasional French 75), but that changed quickly. I created a floral gin blend that is beautifully sitting on my bar car. And yes, I brought a bottle back to the U.S., where it’s not even sold yet.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953401.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>After one too many taste tests, it was time to unwind. I booked a spa treatment and got the best massage of my life. The masseuse climbed on the table to get every knot out of my body. I wanted to pack her in my suitcase and bring her home.</p>



<p>We ended the trip on the highest note with dinner at <a href=""https://www.campcaribbean.co/""><strong>Camp Caribbean</strong></a>, a Black-owned Jamaican and Trinidadian restaurant. As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11116863/nurse-turned-chef-healthy-recipes-boundaries"">Caribbean American</a> woman, seeing my culture reflected in Singapore meant everything. I was very impressed by how good the food tasted. The head chef traveled the world cooking before settling there and it was the perfect full-circle moment to close out the trip.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Singapore Belongs on Your Bucket List</strong></h3>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953399.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve traveled to many countries, but Singapore stands out. As a Black woman, it’s one of the safest places I’ve ever visited, and the people are genuinely welcoming. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11929596/tracee-ellis-ross-solo-traveling-mexico-travel-diary"">traveling solo,</a> planning a baecation, or organizing a group trip, Singapore truly has something for everyone. If you needed a sign to book that flight, this is it.</p>

<p>The moment I stepped into adulthood, my after-school routine of endless dance and drama classes fell entirely by the wayside. Instead, once I started working full time, I’d go to the pub and then head home for my all important <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9889706/social-media-sleep-deprivation"">looking-at-phone-in-bed time</a>. </p>



<p>This summer though, I finally decided to dip my toe back into the world of organized fun by <em>casually</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9670512/best-yoga-mat"">taking up yoga</a> with the intention of simply helping myself unwind in a healthy way. My semi-regular relationship with the activity means that I still set up my mat at the back of class, don’t know the proper Sanskrit names for the poses, and mostly copy the person in front of me. But that’s exactly what keeps me engaged with the practice: The blissful, no-pressure, low intensity of it all (especially in January).</p>



<p>For 28-year-old Refinery29 writer Esther Newman, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/embroidery-hobby-coming-out-bisexuality"">taking up embroidery</a> without the pressure to get better at it has been a big plus for her mental health. “I find it really soothing and calming, having something to channel my nervous energy into, especially something that’s physical and not screen related,” she explains. “I like having something creative and artistic that’s all my own and that I don’t have to qualify through its performance or a rating judged by someone else. It’s just me who gets to say whether something works or needs a different approach.” </p>



<p>For many others though, the approach to hobbies is more all or nothing. Research from <a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2019/january/britains-hobbies-have-a-shelf-life-of-16-months"">The British Heart Foundation</a> shows that the shelf life of adult hobbies in the U.K. is 16 months, noting that work commitments, busy family lives, and lack of motivation are the main reasons we let them slide. The societal pressure to be instantly great at something is likely a contributing factor in our apathy towards hobbies. How many times have you heard someone saying <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/running-for-beginners-tips"">they want to start running</a>, only for every conversation to become about Fitbits and training for a half marathon? The very idea that you don’t have to be brilliant at everything you do seems to have gotten lost in our never-ending grind culture.</p>



<p>But why can’t our hobbies just be… Fun? In a world where we’re constantly on the clock or our iPhones, measuring our successes to our timelines and group chats, shouldn’t hobbies simply be a space for relaxation? According to therapist and <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Counseling Directory</a> member Rose Fisher, engaging in hobbies on a more chilled basis is not only more enjoyable, but it can also be a major win for our minds. “Taking up casual hobbies simply for the joy of it is important for our overall mental health and wellbeing,” she tells Refinery29. The benefits of engaging in an activity for no other reason than fun allows us to achieve what she calls a flow state: That is, engrossed and focused on a single task, according to Fisher, which allows us to be fully present and rid ourselves of self-consciousness.</p>



<p>This, she adds, in turn, helps to calm down our “thinking mind.” “The prefrontal cortex decreases in activity when an individual reaches a state of flow and this reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex enables us to be more creative and also think more freely,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>While it might seem like a strange concept for our overstimulated brains, it is possible to go back to picking up and putting down hobbies when and if we feel like it. Just because we might have invested time into something, it doesn’t mean we have to force ourselves to continue with an enjoyable routine. The idea of having to commit fully to something, reach goals and engage with it “properly” is exactly what moves us away from the flow state, creating a feeling of unnecessary expectation and guilt if we don’t reach those markers.</p>



<p>Getting back to that source of exploration was something that 27-year-old aerial performer <a href=""https://www.rubylauren.com/"">Ruby Baker</a> has experienced since taking up piano last month. “I love learning something new for the sake of it. There’s no pressure and it allows me to take my mind off all the other things I have to do,” she says. “I’m a bit of a perfectionist so it’s really good for me to try something I’m not good at and have a laugh with it. It takes away any self-criticism and judgment and reminds me that there’s no right or wrong when you’re creating art.”</p>



<p>One of the main reasons that hobbies began to feel so much like work is due in a large part to the evolution of the side hustle. Bolstered by never-ending COVID lockdowns, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10942275/good-interesting-tiktok-accounts"">TikTok feeds</a> where everyone seems to be turning their knitting hobby into cold hard cash, for many the opportunity to make money has come at the price of falling out of love with their chosen activity. “Adding financial pressures to a passion, or setting high goals for a hobby can have a negative impact on our fulfillment, as it takes away the simplicity of engaging with the task just for the pleasure of it,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>Just because yoga brings me joy by engaging with a hobby in a casual, friends-with-benefits kind of way doesn’t mean I don’t feel the ongoing threat to commit and level up. In <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/no-cost-of-living-raise-paycheck-budget"">a cost of living crisis</a> where extracurriculars are increasingly expensive (my membership is $50 a month), the feeling that activities must be productive to be worth doing has never felt stronger, which is precisely what keeps most of us from taking them up or sticking to them.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For 29-year-old radio presenter <a href=""https://www.marymandefield.com/"">Mary Mandefield</a>, this is one of the reasons her recent bouldering hobby has been kept casual. “I’m a big believer in not making money from the things you really love. As soon as something turns into a hustle or a career, it can suck the joy from it. I used to be a dance teacher, and as much as I loved making some extra money from dancing around with my mates, I quickly learnt that having to think about insurance, marketing, and GDPR [general data protection regulation] made it less fun,” she tells Refinery29.</p>



<p>“It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things,” Fisher explains. “These activities help us to remember that our worth does not depend on what we can do, and we don’t have to prove ourselves to be impressive, valuable, or useful in every aspect of our lives.” </p>



<p>24-year-old designer Georgina<strong>*</strong>, who previously went out running every day, recognizes her relationship with the activity is much better now that it’s more relaxed. “It used to feel like a chore and I believed that if I missed a run then everything would be ruined. Not only my progress… It was more like: okay, that was a wasted day because I didn’t run my five miles,” she says. “Now, I don’t want to run because I ‘planned’ it, but just do it when I feel I need it. I actually enjoy it without the demand of getting better and I really don’t want to spoil that magic. It’s so comforting to do something just for yourself without any kind of pressure, whether that be internal or external.”</p>



<p>While it might take some mental reframing to break free of our overachieving mindsets, seeing hobbies as less of a routine-orientated practice and more as a source of play is a start. According to therapist and Counseling Directory member <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellors/rosalind-miles"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rosalind Miles</a>, the social aspect is also incredibly important. “Hobbies often bring people together who share similar interests,” she says. “Joining clubs or participating in group activities related to your hobby can foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for people to get out and about and make new friends.”</p>



<p>As January brings with it unending conversations about what we want to “achieve” this year, giving ourselves permission to engage with activities we like on a “when we feel like it” basis seems like one way to actually keep going with them. The inherent shame of being average at something is stopping us from engaging with anything — when really we all know that doing a little bit of something that we find fun is better than avoiding it entirely for fear of not being able to achieve anything of significance. Stepping out every so often to take part in something is a win in itself and it’s time we were all reminded of it. </p>



<p>My next venture for the new year? Roller skating. Here’s hoping for more laughs than broken bones.</p>

As much as we love diving headfirst into the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">latest fashion trends</a>, there’s no denying the magnetic pull of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-free-people-fp-movement-sets-co-ords"">matching set</a> — from sweatsuits to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-loungewear"">loungewear</a> — especially <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">during the winter</a>. They’re cozy, comfy, cute — and, when made with quality and care,  built to last. Plus, they’re versatile! Toeing the line between <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">sporty athleisure</a> and polished co-ords, sweatsuits are the ultimate shortcut to looking casual yet put-together. <br /><br />Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit for running errands, going to workout classes, or attending a football game. Working remotely and need to feel slightly more “dressed” than your pajamas? Problem solved. And on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-travel-pants"">travel days</a>? Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. (Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you <em>actually</em> want to plan an outfit.)<br /><br />If you’re ready to retire those ratty, hole-y sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve <em>all</em> got <em>that</em> pair), consider yourself covered. Ahead, discover 21 cotton sets, waffle knit co-ords, and fleece layers for indoor hibernation mode <em>and</em> outdoorsy winter activities from retailers we love and trust, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lululemon-boxing-day-sale"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Lululemon</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Free People</a>.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

<p>One of my favorite things about this job is getting to hunt for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-nail-manicure-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">manicure inspiration</a> and call it work. In the past few weeks, I’ve spotted (and promptly booked) <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/polka-dot-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cat-eye polka-dot nails</a>, not to mention <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle sweater nails</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-manicure-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">deer-print nails</a> — a cute winter alternative to tortoiseshell. But as I’ve been tracking the coolest trends, one color combination keeps coming up. Enter: blue and brown. Actually, I’m calling it blue suede. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: it’s not the most obvious color pairing, and on paper, it shouldn’t work. But judging by Instagram’s nail artists, the duo is surprisingly dynamic, and it’s quickly becoming one of their most requested designs. </p>

<p>In the same way that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/argyle-sweater-nails-manicure-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">argyle pattern</a> has transcended fashion and made its way onto our nails, Griffiths thinks that our obsession with these shades comes from a small tweak we’re making to our closets: “I think recently a lot of people have been replacing black with chocolate brown as a softer wardrobe staple,” she says, adding, “Brown and blue as a nail combo will be trending as it’s a fun way to wear color, but it still somehow feels like you’re wearing neutrals as they match so easily to the clothes that most of us already have in our wardrobes.” It’s further proof that blue denim really does go with everything. </p>

<p>If you want to switch things up, some manicurists are replacing brown tones with rich burgundy, and while seeming like an unusual match, the various creations posted to Instagram prove otherwise.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11615068.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve never been the sort of person who <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-journals"">keeps a diary</a>. There was that fluffy padlocked notebook in my tweens, but I only ever occasionally remembered its existence. If I could find it now in the ruins and cardboard boxes of my childhood, it would likely be 85% blank pages, 10% doodles, and 5% “spy notes” about my family (nothing quite like scribbling down all of your loved ones’ movements, eh?).</p>



<p>Still, like countless others, I’ve spent a lot<em> </em>of time watching influencers’ morning and evening routines on social media. A <em>lot</em> of time. And, yes, I’ve noticed that almost all of them include <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ordinary-habit-for-now-wellness-journal-review"">a journaling session</a> or two. It makes a lot of sense: Studies have repeatedly shown that engaging in <a href=""https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=4552&amp;ContentTypeID=1"">regular journaling can help reduce stress</a>, manage anxiety and depression symptoms, enhance self-awareness, promote emotional regulation, provide opportunities for positive self-talk, and even strengthen resilience in the face of challenges. If you can stick to it. </p>



<p>Intrigued by all of the above, and keen to see if it could help me get a better handle on my own stresses and worries, I decided to give it a go for myself — but not before consulting with the experts. And, as you’ve likely guessed already, it turns out my snarky tween diary <em>definitely</em> wouldn’t cut it when it comes to reaping the myriad psychological benefits of this popular pastime. </p>



<p>“Journaling is essentially another way of saying ‘putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper,’ giving them a place to exist outside of our heads,” explains mental health advocate, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Therapy-Magic-essential-life-changing-experiences-ebook/dp/B08YD5JLWL""><em>Therapy Is…Magic</em></a>, and trainee psychotherapist <a href=""https://www.jolove.co.uk/"">Jo Love</a>, describing it as a “tool that allows us to process our emotions and creates an opportunity for self-reflection.”</p>



<p>“Its effectiveness varies based on individual preferences and psychological needs,” adds author, psychologist and certified therapist, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">Kalanit Ben-Ari</a>, <a href=""https://www.kalanitbenari.com/about"">PhD</a>. “Reflective journaling is particularly beneficial for emotional release, processing feelings and thoughts, and reducing anxiety. It enhances self-awareness; as one writes, reads, and perhaps edits or adds to their entries, they create a psychological space between themselves and their thoughts and feelings. This process allows for framing experiences and opens the door for processing and reframing.”</p>



<p>Reassuring me that there are no set rules for how to journal “properly,” Love notes that “there are thousands of helpful ideas and prompts out there if you find yourself staring fruitlessly at a blank page.” </p>



<p>“The main thing is to ditch the guilt about achieving perfection,” she adds. “Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.”</p>



<p>“Personal preference absolutely plays a role,” agrees Dr. Ben-Ari. “Some find it beneficial to write in the morning to set intentions and establish a positive mindset for the day, while others prefer journaling before bed, which helps in reflecting on the day and calming the mind for a good night’s sleep.”</p>



<p>With their advice in mind, I dug an unused notebook out from the back of a drawer, scoured the house for a pen (a fruitless task: I wound up buying a pack of biros at the corner shop), and positioned them artfully beside my bed.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Even if all you do is write a single line, then that is totally OK.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Reader, I won’t lie to you: I found it incredibly difficult to think of anything to write for the first few nights and mornings. The words of my university’s creative writing tutor rang in my ears, however — <em>just start writing, and the words will come </em>— and so that’s what I did. I wrote banal little sentences about my day: about what I’d eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. About how delayed the trains had been. About the <em>weather</em> (how incredibly, painfully British of me). Unsurprisingly, I began to view the journaling as a chore to be ticked off, rather than as valuable time for myself. </p>



<p>This is normal: as humans, we are notoriously bad at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/8903068/how-to-change-habits"">forging new habits</a>. In fact, research shows that 23% of people <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/why-new-years-resolutions-fail"">quit their resolutions</a> by the end of the first week, and <a href=""https://insideoutmastery.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/"">43% quit by the end of January</a>. “Like resolutions, you might start journaling with great intentions and goodwill, but find they often fade within a few weeks,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “People might find it hard to stick to a journaling schedule, as it doesn’t offer the same benefits for everyone’s mental and emotional health.”</p>



<p>Thankfully, both of my experts had some tips on how to get more out of my tentative journaling experiment — in the hope that I might be able to keep the good habit in place for longer.</p>



<p>“Treat your journal as a private exploration space just for you and no one else,” suggests Love. “Take some time to reflect on your day, important events in your life, or decisions you’ve made. You might want to jot down anything you’re worried or bothered about. It can be helpful, too, to think about what has made you feel good or proud of yourself. And a letter to your past or future self can be a truly powerful experience.”</p>



<p>Dr. Ben-Ari, meanwhile, had another suggestion with regards to what to write. “In my clinic, I encourage clients to keep a dream journal, as dreams, which are easily forgotten, carry messages from our inner wisdom and unconscious,” she told me. “Writing them down serves three functions: remembering the dreams; learning about the dreams narratives and themes; and noticing the psychological shifts they reflect in therapy.”</p>



<p>I began taking a cup of chamomile tea up with me to bed and sipping it as I noted down all of my thoughts and feelings in a bid to make my head — and world — feel that little bit clearer. I’m the sort of socially anxious person who worries over every perceived slight, so I used my journal to explore these fears rather than lying awake obsessing over them. And, as someone whose inner critic is her biggest bully, it was genuinely lovely to take a moment each night to pay attention to the things I’d done well — no matter how small. </p>



<p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. And, as someone who usually spends a great deal of time tossing and turning and fretting before eventually plunging headfirst into a series of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9659134/having-vivid-dreams-coronavirus"">anxiety-fueled dreams</a> (dreams which I’m now making a point of committing to paper, I hasten to add), I’m happy to report that I found myself falling asleep more quickly after journaling, too. The dreams have proven as erratic as ever, mind you, but I’m hoping that keeping this habit up will help to improve them over time. <br /><br />If I’m being completely honest, my inner cynic wanted this experiment to prove a failure. I’ve never been fond of elaborate morning and evening routines — especially when they reek of “wellbeing washing” — and all of the “click to buy” links on people’s social media made me assume it was nothing but a cash grab. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>As time ticked on, I found myself looking forward to curling up in bed with my journal. </p></blockquote></figure>



<p>I also found that buying myself an extra-special sparkly notebook added a sense of occasion to proceedings, but anything will do the job in a pinch. All you really need is a few minutes each day: Yes, many people aim to write for 15 or 20 minutes, but starting small is honestly the best way to set a habit in motion (and, if you’re anything like me, you’ll find that you wind up writing more and more as the weeks tick by).</p>



<p>If you need some help getting started, Love suggests that you try something like “a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gratitude-journal-prompt-ideas"">‘gratitude journal’</a> and jot down three things you’re grateful for, or a ‘one sentence a day’ approach to help take the pressure off, particularly for those who find writing hard or are out of practice. “Writing about whatever events, thoughts or feelings that came up that day can be another simple entry point to journaling,” she adds.</p>



<p>Just one word of caution: While this activity has proven incredibly beneficial to many people, and while I myself have been won over, it’s important to pay attention to how the activity makes <em>you </em>feel. Everyone is different.</p>



<p>“Reflective journaling, when feeling overwhelmed, offers a space to make sense of experiences and feelings, helping to calm the mind,” says Dr. Ben-Ari. “However, I generally don’t recommend journaling ‘to-do lists’ as they can add stress or distract from deeper issues that need attention. Also, writing that dwells excessively on negative events or feelings, a process known as over-rumination, can lead to increased stress. Concerns about privacy can also impact the honesty needed for reflective journaling.”</p>



<p>Adding that “it’s also important to note that not everyone enjoys writing,” Ben-Ari notes that its benefits can still be reaped “through art, drawing or other creative means as a way to process feelings.” We just need to remember that it is a tool, and use it in a way that works best for us as individuals.</p>



<p>On that note, I’m off to bed — and, yes, you’d best believe I’ll be journaling about the experience of writing about journaling. Things are about to get incredibly meta…</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10675277/coolest-tv-characters"">Sophie Turner</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/saltburn-emerald-fennell-interview"">Archie Madekwe’s</a> newest <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/amazon-prime-video"">Prime Video</a> show <em>Steal</em> centers around a major heist where billions of pounds are stolen from a London pension fund. Without giving any spoilers (there’s a <em>lot</em> of twists revealed throughout the show), the series broadly focuses on how much wealth in society is controlled by a small percentage of people, how it affects all of us workers in the capitalist regime, and what lengths people will go to for money.</p>



<p>Turner plays Zara, your regular office worker who barely earns a living wage while working at a swanky office in London’s wealthy financial district. The show depicts the fallout after thieves hold the office workers hostage and steal billions of pounds from people’s pensions. As Zara and her friend Luke (Madekwe) try to solve the mystery, things get complicated, and lives are at stake.</p>



<p>Madekwe tells <em>Refinery29</em> it’s “very dangerous” to have so much wealth controlled by so few people, which he believes <em>Steal </em>conveys well. “It’s incredibly prevalent right now… I think the show kind of explores that in a lot of ways, but of course, it’s awful,” the actor says. “I think people can relate to [the show]. I think everybody is feeling [stuck], you know? And everybody feels helpless, and there are people [who] could change the situation, and don’t… the disparity [in wealth] is huge, and it isn’t fair. And yeah, it’s anarchic.”</p>



<p>Turner adds that <em>Steal </em>shows how desperation, when it comes to money, can push people to the limit. “We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close. I wish I could do something about it, but I just can’t,” she says. “But that’s what I like about the show, as well. It explores why good people do bad things, and it is for reasons like this. So that’s what I love, exploring that.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We’ve got too many billionaires and the cost-of-living crisis [means] the disparity is too big, and the gap’s got to close.</p><cite>Sophie Turner</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For Turner, she’s previously played fantasy characters like Sansa Stark (<em>Game of Thrones)</em>, Jean Grey (<em>X-Men: Apocalpyse</em>) and more recently, 1980s character Joan (<em>Joan</em>). It’s no surprise that for a show tackling topics like wealth inequality, her role as Zara in <em>Steal</em> hits closer to home, with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/emma-mackey-jamie-lee-curtis-ella-mccay-trauma"">family trauma</a>, a messy love life, and other relatable traits. But rather than missing an extravagant wardrobe or hours in makeup, she relished the chance to tell a story in a different way. “I don’t think I’ve ever played a character quite as messy as her and it was really fun because I felt like I could just show up.. it’s just very relieving when you don’t have to wear a corset and your shoulders aren’t pulled back, you don’t have to talk in a certain way,” Turner says. “I could just kind of flop about, I don’t know how else to explain it. I felt so free in playing her, I think that’s what I mean,” she adds. “[She’s the] closest to me as any character I’ve played.”</p>



<p>While her character Zara is more ordinary than most others she’s stepped into, being held at gunpoint is anything but. While you’d imagine being put through your paces by masked thieves would be taxing, Turner actually just saw that action-packed day as another day in the office… literally. “I really thrive on days when it is a high-stakes day where it’s a lot of drama and a lot of emotion, and I actually find it quite cathartic,” the actor says. “I go home feeling much better about myself than I did walking in. I think that’s what acting is for me, is therapy. I always feel better going home and it’s easy to step out of it.”</p>



<p>And even though the actors might not take home the anxiety or emotions from set, <em>Steal’s</em> fast-paced show could very well induce it in viewers. But Madekwe notes that’s the reason viewers watch heist shows in the first place. “It’s like fun, escapism,” he explains. “I always love [watching] things that make me kind of physically feel something. And if something gets your heart racing, kind of builds anxiety in that way like a show like this does, and you’re able to create that in your own home, then I think it’s so exciting. And this show, I think, really succeeds with that.”</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">the bob</a> to the bixie, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"">short haircuts</a> have become the style of choice in salons up and down the country. Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance. </p>



<p>For those who don’t like the idea of booking in for a monthly trim, a midi, shoulder-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp — it’s also being touted as one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/haircut-trends-2026"">biggest hair trends for 2026</a>. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown-out bob,” says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “This year, we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.”</p>



<p>On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> are also championing shoulder-length haircuts with curtain bangs, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/concave-layers-hair-trend"">concave layers</a>, and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for shoulder-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently.</p>

<p>Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast, but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/neilmoodie/?hl=en"">Neil Moodie</a>, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make shoulder-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style by hairstylist <br /><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicolasfloreshair/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Flores</a>.</p>

<p>“As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Moodie. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual.

<p>You’ve heard of the wolf cut (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/sachel-haircut-trend-the-rachel"">a variation on the shag</a>, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jordanoliverhair/"">Jordan Jones</a>, stylist and color technician at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/taylor_taylor_london/"">Taylor Taylor London</a>. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.”</p>



<p>So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jones. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jones says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/frankie_inv/"">Francesca Inverarity</a>.</p>

<p>“As we move into spring and summer, I think we’ll be seeing a lot more natural afro and curly hair in medium lengths,” says celebrity hairdresser <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lorraine_dublin/?hl=en"">Lorraine Dublin</a>, much like this beautiful, fluffed-out afro on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKuhBkDRzk/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Diliana van Rijn</a>. “In the colder months, hair thrives better in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/braids-protective-natural-hairstyles-damage"">protective styles,</a> so as the weather heats up, we’ll be seeing afro hair in its natural state — with bold colors, too.”</p>

<p>“Another trend that will continue to be popular is the half-up, half-down style,” says Lorraine, “especially with hair extensions.” She continues: “You can add an ombre hair color to the ends and combine this with a natural, soft, body wave.” <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gemmamurphyhair/"">Gemma Murphy</a> from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dylanbradshawdublin/"">Dylan Bradshaw, Dublin</a>, totally nails the cute in-between style here.</p>

<p>“The collarbone cut is so popular right now,” says Tyler Moore, stylist at <a href=""https://livetruelondon.com/"">Live True London</a>. He prefers a blunt edge and no layering, but the look works equally well with a little bit of texture. “This style can be paired with a fringe for an ultra chic look, and it works great on both straight and wavy or textured hair.” We love this look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DKVl2Isx1dr/?img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessenia Robayo</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thehairbros/"">The Hair Bros</a> say a shoulder-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy haircut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone who wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived-in feel, like this cut on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRkc3d-jAqf/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alexia Colombo</a>. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. </p>

<p>The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere again this year, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from <em>Friends</em>. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/the.labartory?hl=en"">@the.labartory</a> on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured.</p>

<p>“Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern shoulder-length cut by hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/liamrussell.hair/"">Liam Russell</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/didntcatchthat/"">Ruby Tuesday Evers</a> has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed-up fringe give the medium length great shape.</p>

<p>The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CXn-azRMw9R/"">Emily Kingston</a>, stylist and colorist at <a href=""https://bluetitlondon.com/salons/clapton/"">Blue Tit Clapton</a>. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone.</p>

<p>The flipped side bang perfectly accentuates a shoulder-length cut, says Jones, like this style on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DGgb_HuORC3/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Billie Brown</a>. “Curtain bangs have moved on, and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side, or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.”</p>



<p>Jones says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend, it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.”</p>
