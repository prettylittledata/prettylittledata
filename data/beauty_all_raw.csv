(And not just because it’s giving major garden soirée vibes.) With its bright notes of osmanthus, ylang ylang, and apricot skin, not to mention You’s signature ambrose and ambrette base, You Fleur is without a doubt the most romantic scent choice this holiday season.<br /><br /><strong>Glossier</strong> You Fleur Duo, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glossier.com%2Fproducts%2Fglossier-you-fleur-duo%3Fvariant%3D47045563121909"">Glossier</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946077.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Yves Saint Laurent Libre Vanille Couture Limited Edition Perfume<br /></h2><br />Leave it to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ysl-beauty-review"">YSL</a> to make a modern classic even more intoxicating with the addition of everyone’s favorite gourmand note: vanilla. Libre Vanilla Couture is not only a must-buy for any packaging snob (the opaque gold flacon is more like an objet d’art than a perfume bottle) but it’s a great fall-winter alternative to the brighter, orange blossom-forward profile of the original Libre.<br /><br /><strong>Yves Saint Laurent</strong> Libre Vanille Couture Limited Edition Perfume, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Flibre-vanille-couture-limited-edition-perfume-pimprod2054994%3Fsku%3D2646038"">Ulta Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946080.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Sabrina Carpenter Bite Sized Coffret Eau de Parfum<br /></h2><br />If you or someone you know is still mourning the end of Sabrina Carpenter’s <em>Short n’ Sweet</em> tour (no more Juno positions?), this fragrance quartet is a perfect consolation gift.

With notes of airy freesia, skin-like musk, and creamy sandalwood, it’s a complex and warm scent that’s the olfactive equivalent of a hug from your favorite person.<br /><br /><strong>Kayali</strong> FREEDOM MUSK SANTAL | 34 Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ffreedom-musk-santal-3-4-oz-P518288%3FskuId%3D2909695"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946085.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1400&amp;height=1400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1400"" /><figcaption><h2>Rare Beauty Rare Eau de Parfum<br /></h2><br />Selena Gomez’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rare-beauty-fragrance-review"">debut fragrance for Rare Beauty</a> is a no-brainer choice for the Sephora girl on your list. With its warm, gourmand base featuring notes of caramel and sandalwood, it’s a modern classic in the making, and if you <em>really</em> want to knock their socks off, include one or two of the brand’s fragrance layering balms for a personalized touch. <br /><br /><strong>Rare Beauty</strong> Rare Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frare-eau-de-parfum-P517178%3FskuId%3D2888188%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap517178%3Aproduct"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946090.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Parfums de Marly Delina 3-Piece Fragrance Gift Set<br /></h2><br /><br />Parfums de Marly’s Delina is one of those fragrances that sounds almost too saccharine on paper, but once it meets skin? The result is a soft, sweet scent — thanks to notes of cashmeran, musk, lychee, and vanilla — that’s the perfect choice for the ultimate romantic in your life. No wonder she’s made it big on TikTok.<br /><br /><strong>Parfums de Marly</strong> Delina 3-Piece Fragrance Gift Set, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fparfums-de-marly-delina-3-piece-fragrance-gift-set-612-value%2F8552236%3Forigin%3Dcategory-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FBeauty%252FFragrance%252FGifts%2520%2526%2520Sets%26color%3D000"">Nordstrom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1196"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946093.png?auto=webp&amp;width=780&amp;height=1196&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=15:23"" width=""780"" /><figcaption><h2>Marc Jacobs Daisy Fragrance Set<br /></h2><br />If you know someone (or <em>are</em> that someone) who’s dreamed of frolicking in a field of wildflowers ever since first seeing Marc Jacobs’ Daisy ads, this festive set is a steal at under $100 — not that your recipient would ever guess.

December opens a prophetic window for us. It is a transitional pause and an opportunity to integrate all the lessons we’ve gathered throughout the year and lock it in before moving onto the new year portal. Here we get to rest, recalibrate our energies, and focus on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/manifest-goals-zodiac-sign-2025"">setting intentions</a> for the new year. It is a moment between endings and beginnings, and if we are silent enough, we can hear Spirit’s whispers on what’s next. <br /><br />This month’s tarotscopes reveal the frequency you’ll be walking into in 2026: the blessings you’ve earned, the lessons that are wrapping up, and the energy that will define your next chapter. You are always the energetic architect of your present and future. Now allow these tarotscopes to guide you toward alignment. <figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946629.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Capricorn: 3 of Pentacles <br /></strong><br />It’s time to level up your foundation and your standard in every area of your life. If 2025 has taught you anything, it’s that you deserve it all, but you have to embody it and start making choices that reflect that reality. Review your foundations in all areas of your life: spirituality, health, relationships, finances, career, beauty, and more. Evaluate what worked versus what didn’t, and what is the next level for you in these areas of your life. You’re no stranger to effective work and dedication. Everything that you’ve been applying yourself in 2025 will blossom in 2026. The 3 of Pentacles reminds you that collaboration is your currency, so don’t hesitate to ask for help or resources. You don’t have to do a whole rehaul of your life alone. Let Source do the heavy lifting for you and bring you the right people, places, and opportunities. Let your excellence be seen. This is your year to master your craft and be rewarded for it.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946624.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aquarius: 2 of Wands<br /></strong><br />This is your year to push your limits in terms of being seen and allowing your brilliance and genius to shine. The coming year will encourage you to expand in every area of your life; you must be fearless and confident with your momentum. In 2026, you will find yourself in new territory that requires a more regulated nervous system. You are worthy and capable of having and maintaining all of your desires. Nothing you encounter will be familiar, but it will be elevated. Your task is to not fall back into old patterns. Instead, decide and commit that you will raise your vibration as the new standard. It is time to move differently because you’ve outgrown so much in your life and you’re now ready for what you deserve. The world is literally opening up for you, and now is the time that you take advantage of all the inner work and effort you’ve done. It is all up to you. You get to choose your path and adventure.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946633.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Pisces: 3 of Swords</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>The new year requires that you continue to release and cleanse from inside out. It is the karmic release that brings sweet blessings and makes space for the life you truly deserve to live, but it cannot pour in if you are subconsciously or even consciously still holding on to energies that you’ve inherited ancestrally or baggage that weighs you down. What is being cleared from your life will free you to focus on your purpose and projects that have been brought to your attention. This is purification, not punishment. Cut emotional cords and ties to old stories, people, places, past lives, habits, and even obligations that you’ve outgrown. Update your life with immense clarity. You know what you don’t want, and this can help give you insight on what you do. Focus on that and fine-tune the details on what that looks and feels like in every area. Don’t bind yourself to things that no longer bring pleasure or require labor in a way that doesn’t expand you. Update the way you do things and the way you frame your life. You must live your truth by all means necessary.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946627.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Aries: King of Swords<br /></strong><br />This is the year of implementing a great strategy and upgrading your education and knowledge. Investing in yourself will be key to your growth and success. This coming year calls for clarity, precision, and mastery over your mind. Your words will carry profound weight, so this is the time to speak things into existence or create a journal practice where you can script things into existence or release emotions through the process. If you’ve failed to advocate for yourself, you will be bolder, sharper, more direct, clearer, and confident when negotiating in all areas of your life and discerning what you truly deserve versus what is being presented to you. Do not settle. Honesty is key this year. It’s best to stick to what you have decided to commit to and not stray off the path. In 2026, you will not be reactive but responding from your power and ability to see into the future. Refine your voice and leadership abilities. Trust that you know what is best for you, and the world will follow your direction. Leave the ego behind and leverage your superpowers. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946636.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Taurus: Queen of Wands<br /></strong><br />This is a year of radical independence, sexual energy, and potent power. The Queen of Wands is your reminder that confidence <em>is</em> a currency and the more you flaunt it, the more your desires will gravitate to you. This is an unstoppable time when your spirit is finally aligned with an elevated identity. There’s nothing that you cannot have, be, or do. Your magnetism and charm require that you delegate and make your life simple, so that the “work” you do is more easeful and impactful. Stop playing small with your gifts and allow your free spirit to lead. You no longer need permission to be the fullest version of yourself. In this timeline, you are safe and abundant — trust that. Expect radical expansion in your business or career, finances, sex life, confidence, spiritual journey, and femininity. You will inspire many others to take up space.  </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946630.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Gemini: Page of Swords<br /></strong><br />This is the year you invoke more curiosity and play. You will be reinventing yourself in ways that will shock others. Your ingenuity and ability to not only adapt to the time but shift it for the better is memorable and will forever change your life. You are not here to follow. Instead, you are here to lead and be an example for so many that want to break free from their limitations but need “permission” to do so. Your ability to flip the script and explore what now suits you versus what no longer applies will create a new identity for you that generates more wisdom and abundance and expands on your legacy. You are invited to stay teachable, lead with intellect and discernment, and use your innate spiritual technology that lives within you to reinvent ways of living that are efficient and needed. Great expansion lies in entrepreneurship and possibly the writing industry. Fresh ideas will come fast, so capture them before they fade. Just be mindful not to overthink. Learn as you go. Spirit’s saying: Your voice is evolving, so let it. What you study, share, and speak this year becomes the foundation of a new identity.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946628.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Cancer: 9 of Pentacles<br /></strong><br />Cancer, 2026 is your soft life era, fully earned and fully embodied. The 9 of Pentacles confirms that your discipline and devotion are paying off. You can finally rest and let things come to you energetically rather than working toward a greater legacy. Everything you’ve built and worked on will manifest tenfold this year, so prepare to be in total overflow. This is the time to invest in upleveling your beauty, inner confidence, and luxury overall. Invest in yourself by pouring into you in ways that you were hesitant before. The luxury you will claim is rooted in self-worth, not validation from others. Your connection to the Divine is so unshakable that you have no doubt where your Source lies. Everything you touch will bloom. There is no limit to your magic and expansion.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946631.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Leo: 8 of Cups<br /></strong><br />Leo, 2026 is your walk-away year, a period where you continuously choose yourself until that energy is locked into your DNA and you act from a space of Royal Sovereignty and opulence. This means that you are in a continual space of releasing not only that which you’ve outgrown but also what no longer resonates with you. You’ve found the secret of rapid quantum leaping, and it will seem like you’re jumping from one timeline to the next. This constant leap of transition marks that you are expanding your soul and are increasing your capacity to have more in every area of your life. The theme of 2026 is do not settle. You will have it all and more, and then you’ll realize that you deserve even more than what you initially thought. Flow with the momentum your inner Source and GPS is leading you on. You are not in perpetual cleansing and releasing but rather in perpetual becoming. You are no longer loyal and committed to things you did not choose for yourself. You are no longer holding space for energies and patterns you’ve inherited but have had no say on. Drop the struggle and the load. The journey ahead is about becoming light and sustaining it. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946637.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Virgo: Judgement<br /></strong><br />Your spiritual glow up and understanding of where your own inner Source is leading you to are undeniable. You have no choice but to step ahead, regardless of your own irrational fears. Your higher calling is presenting itself to you and it is divine time that you answered. The Judgement card marks a rebirth: You’re shedding old versions of yourself, stepping into full purpose, and hearing Spirit loud and clear, as a lifestyle. Everything that felt confusing in 2025 suddenly aligns, and the rewards come through because you’re ready to live in truth and not illusion. Your ancestors are calling you into greater service in so many ways, to lead, to heal, to teach, and to transmit your wisdom. You will not have the space to second-guess yourself, and you won’t even think of it because your connection to Source will be so undeniable that you will let Source take the wheel and do the heavy lifting. This is your awakening year, and the miracles will overflow. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946632.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Libra: Queen of Cups<br /></strong><br />This is the year when you soften further and rest in your divine feminine energy. It is a year of ease, peace, comfort, and radical self-trust. The Queen of Cups invites emotional mastery, not through control but rather through surrender. You will have the resources to process any emotion skillfully and also activate your psychic and intuitive gifts on a new level. This is a non-negotiable. You’re learning that sensitivity is strength and that your intuition is your most reliable currency. Allow it to speak to you in ways it hasn’t before and use it more actively. This year, your healing, creativity, and compassion become magnetic forces that open new doors in love and purpose. Spirit’s asking you to pour from a full cup, not a fractured one. Where you once overgave, that stream is now closed for your own use. Spirit will be speaking to you loudly, and the more you indulge in your own sweetness and softness, the more things will flow in your favor. </figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946635.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Scorpio: The Emperor  <br /></strong><br />Scorpio, 2026 is all about embodying authority and creating the systems, routines, and discipline that will take you to the next level. The Emperor shows that you’re no longer playing with your potential; you are utilizing your masculine energy to build a structure that is the epitome of long-lasting wealth. It is a year when every area of your life is about to massively expand, but this comes with you enforcing strong boundaries and getting very clear on what it is you want. You won’t have time to entertain anything that isn’t for you or is underneath you. Own your power and claim the spotlight. You will have to become the leader that you’re seeking. There is no blueprint for your life; you are creating it along the way. Manifest your empire through organization and clarity. You’ve done enough dreaming.</figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2400"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11946634.png?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2400&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=5:6"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><strong>Sagittarius: 5 of Swords<br /></strong><br />Sagittarius, 2026 will pull you into radical honesty and will reveal all of your energetic leakages — or rather where you are being drained energetically in all areas of your life. Prepare to rid yourself of people, ways of being, and potential trajectories you thought you’d be on, and embark the journey of uncertainty. This year asks that you allow Spirit to take the wheel and provide the next steps and resources for you. This requires that you surrender and have faith in the journey unfolding. Don’t battle yourself. Preserve your energy for things that enhance and excite it. Playing small, over-explaining yourself, entertaining energetic vampires, and engaging in drama will no longer play a vital role in your life. You are clearing out old wounds and acting from a space of deliberate intention. Peace over everything — that’s how your blessings unfold. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

On Wednesday evening (05.11.2025), the largest full moon of the year can be seen over Germany – a so-called supermoon. According to the Association of Astronomers (VDS), the moon will then appear particularly large because it will only be around 356,400 kilometers away from the Earth at 11.16 pm. At other times, the moon is more than 400,000 kilometers away from the Earth. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As we come nearer to closing out 2025, the Cold Moon in Gemini on December 4th serves up some positivity for us all in the midst <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">of Sagittarius season</a> — putting us in an excellent mindset. In short: It is the vibe shift we’ve been waiting for. </p>



<p>This is the second-to-last <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/super-beaver-full-moon-in-taurus-horoscope-november-2025-meaning-effects"">supermoon in the series</a>; the next one occurs on January 3rd 2026. A supermoon occurs when the moon is in proximity to the earth in parity. When this happens, we feel the effects of illumination more deeply and intensely as the moon appears to be fuller, brighter, and shinier.</p>



<p>The last Full Moon of 2025 is asking us to make crucial decisions before New Year. We are torn between two different directions, offering us the chance to evolve or stay the same. The caveat is that we may not be ready to move forward, as numerous loose ends need to be addressed. These issues have been swept under the rug because we’ve been lost in a sea of emotions this past month, when five planets were retrograde, tugging at our heartstrings and making us yearn for the past. It’s no wonder we’ve been in a haze.</p>



<p>As we dust off the stale vibes, the Full Moon calls upon us to be more open with our emotions and discuss them with others. Since the Nodes of Destiny are squaring the lunation, we need to be ready to state our opinions. There can be issues in communication, causing problems with others. Still, if we mentally grow and use this opportunity to be more direct and not hold back, then we will be able to move past the internal conflict and tension that we are feeling. Letting go of our old patterns will be challenging, and we may fluctuate throughout the process. It’ll take a minute, even though we are starting the journey now.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-sagittarius-scorpio-november-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury is still in its “retroshade”</a> phase since the planet ended its retrograde on November 29th. Mercury is still dealing with situations brought on by the retrograde until December 16th, when it clears the post-shadow zone. As a result, we may still be dealing with issues from then, as Mercury is revisiting that timeline. Therefore, it’s essential to think before speaking and not act impulsively, as there may be sensitivities that others feel, including ourselves. Being kind and compassionate is always crucial in times like these, especially since the mutable Supermoon takes on the sentiments of those surrounding them.</p>



<p>Remember that three planets are currently moonwalking in the sky: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/jupiter-retrograde-in-cancer-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2025"">Jupiter in Cancer</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/uranus-retrograde-gemini-taurus-september-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Uranus in Taurus</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/neptune-retrograde-in-aries-pisces-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Neptune in Pisces</a>. While they don’t have an intense or immense impact on us, they’ll reveal the motives of others. They are helping us to understand the importance of living our best lives — no matter what’s gone down in the recent past. The future seems to be prosperous and infinite, giving us an optimistic push toward our aspirations.</p>



<p>This energy is highlighted by the presence of the star Cursa (fixed stars add seasoning to the flavor of planets), which plays an important role during this lunation. Being that Cursa is beneficial and lucky, we’ll be able to get through problems without a hitch. The universe is offering us the opportunity to enhance our fortune by giving us an abundance of love and kindness. Cursa is making us extremely sociable and wanting to connect with others. Beware that it can unlock scandals, so don’t repeat rumors that may or may not be valid. </p>



<p>Even though things may seem grim before the Full Moon, the energy will give us the motivation to tap into the power within ourselves. This is an opportunity for us to make things better — especially for ourselves and those we care about.</p>

<p>Amid all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cyber-monday-deals"">Cyber Monday sales</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift season frenzy</a>, and new <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-dresses-2025-latina-brands"">holiday collection drops</a>, the shopping landscape may feel like an avalanche of <em>too many</em> new and shiny things to cart up. But we’re briefly plowing back all of that to shine a light on H&amp;M’s latest (and coveted) collaboration. This time, the reader-favorite retailer has teamed up with luxury ski and lifestyle brand <a href=""https://www.perfectmoment.com/us/en"">Perfect Moment</a> on an après-ski-inspired winter collection. <br /><br />“Après-ski has always had a certain energy: relaxed, comfortable, social, playful, and glamourous,” said Perfect Moment co-founder and creative director Jane Gottschalk, in a press release. “Together [with H&amp;M], we’ve curated a collection that brings the spirit of both brands to life. The pieces are young, fun, [and] sporty, with a winter heartbeat and a nod to the mountains, but belong just as much in the city.” <br /><br />The <a href=""https://www2.hm.com/en_us/ladies/shop-by-feature/2003-perfect-moment-hm.html"">28-piece capsule collection</a> spans versatile knitwear, down-filled outerwear, and statement accessories — like cozy hats and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-puffer-boots"">puffer boots</a> — in a chic winter color palette of black, white, silver, rich burgundy, and icy blue.<br /><br />“We’re thrilled to be collaborating with Perfect Moment on this winter collection — it’s unexpected, dynamic, and sure to spark excitement,” said H&amp;M creative advisor and head of womenswear design, Ann-Sofie Johansson, in the release. “The silhouettes are glamorous yet laid-back — just like après-ski — but also have a real edge with the leather, faux fur, and textured knits.”</p>

<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">editor-favorite skincare brand Medik8</a> is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/h-e-o-mask"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">This two-step mask</a> is a saviour for dry winter skin — just don’t let the duo of products put you off. It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

Ah, Christmas. A time when we string colored lights around our homes, whip out Christmas stockings, bake gingerbread and gorge ourselves on, well, everything. But what's a Christmas without sitting in front of the TV with a glass of champagne in hand, devouring a wholesome, corny or just <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/186063/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">so bad-it's-good Christmas movie</a>? <br /><br />Whatever you're looking for — a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/christmas-movies-toxic-men"">cheesy rom-com</a> to play in the background while you ice some gingerbread people, a thrilling Christmas <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scariest-movies-of-all-time"">horror with an edge</a>, a Christmas musical that'll have you singing along, or you only want to see <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/set-visit-netflix-knight-before-christmas"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> in another outlandish Christmas film, we've got you covered.<br /><br />Ahead, the very best <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11946456/7-christmas-movies-tv-netflix"">Christmas movies</a> of all time.<figure><figcaption><h2>It's A Wonderful Life (1946)</h2><br />Universally hailed as <em>the</em> best Christmas film to watch each year, <em>It's A Wonderful Life</em> has come to define the genre. It stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has become suicidal. But he's soon visited by an angel who shows him what really matters in life and what life would be like without his existence. A compelling, moving and heartwarming masterpiece, courtesy of Frank Capra. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Die Hard (1988)<br /></h2><br />Sparking arguments and transforming friends into enemies, <em>Die Hard</em> reinvigorated the discussion on what is meant to be a Christmas movie (and for the record, it definitely is one). Set on Christmas Eve, it follows an NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) as his Christmas plans are interrupted thanks to a group of terrorists (featuring the late Alan Rickman). In true Bruce Willis fashion, he's the only one that can save the day (and Christmas!).  </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)<br /></h2><br />Is it a Christmas movie? Is it a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/10/11572922/amazon-prime-halloween-movies-horror"">Halloween movie</a>? Who cares. When you've got a gorgeous stop-motion film as charming as this, you'll be wanting to make your Christmas morning as macabre as possible. Written by the notable Tim Burton, a visit to Christmastown should be on the cards every year (just don't forget to sing along). </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Gremlins (1984)<br /></h2><br />If you think all Christmas movies need to be peppy and upbeat, think again. <em>Gremlins</em> pumps us full of Christmas cheer, but not without the help of some demonic creatures.  This horror-comedy follows a father who finds an extra special Christmas gift for his son, but with a proviso — don't expose it to bright light, never add water, and only feed it after midnight.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Elf (2003)<br /></h2><br />A Christmas staple. Will Ferrell excels in this classic as Buddy, a childish adult/large elf who searches for his biological father in New York City. As he navigates the human world, we're treated to instantly quotable lines and enough laughs to give us an ab workout.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989)</h2><br /><br />Written by John Hughes (best known for classics like <em>Ferris Bueller, Pretty in Pink</em>, and<em> The Breakfast Club</em>), <em>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</em> is a bible on how to do a flawless Christmas comedy. Clark Griswold (Chevy Case) wants the perfect Christmas and plays it safe by staying at home, but things go wrong pretty quickly after his hick cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his family show up without an invite. Watch this, then treat yourself to the other five <em>National Lampoon's Vacation</em> movies, just because.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Carol (2015)<br /></h2><br />Say it with me: more queer Christmas films! <em>Carol</em> has easily cemented itself into the Christmas movie rotation of many thanks to the bittersweet love it portrays. Starring Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, it follows two women as they fall in love and have a forbidden affair. And while it's just an objectively good movie, it also features plenty of Christmas hats, cookie decorating, and Christmas cheer to fill that festive hole in your heart.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Batman Returns (1992)<br /></h2><br />Batman in a Christmas movie? Well, almost. While Bruce Wayne doesn't exactly don Christmas getup head to toe, <em>Batman Returns</em> landscape is spectacularly festive. With a huge Christmas tree in the centre of Gotham, plenty of decorations to go around, and even a Grinch-esque character in the form of Max Shreck and Penguin, this is the perfect Christmas movie for comic book fanatics.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)<br /></h2><br />Have you heard of Whoville? If not, you're in for a treat. It's one of the most wonderfully blissful and friendly places that'll have you returning for your dose of Christmas cheer, every year. We all know who The Grinch is — he's a bloody grouch. He doesn't believe in Christmas and most certainly won't be participating in any local decorating competitions. But things change when he meets six-year-old Cindy Lou. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bad Santa (2003)<br /></h2><br />Dark comedy and Christmas is an unexpected match made in heaven, seen nowhere better than in <em>Bad Santa</em>. The star of the show, Billy Bob Thornton, stars as a gross, vile, alcoholic, chain-smoking and horny shopping centre Santa Claus ripoff — and we love him for it. Just don't make the mistake of showing this one to the kids. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holiday (2006)<br /></h2><br />You've got your <em>Love Actually </em>girlies, and you've got your <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11596077/is-the-holiday-a-christmas-movie"">The Holiday</a> </em>girlies. Whatever side you fall on, you'll still appreciate this as one of the best Christmas movies of all time. It follows two women (played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz) who swap lives and their perfect homes for a fortnight to escape their problems and heartbreak. Jack Black and Jude Law also star in this fan favorite. Someone bring out the mistletoe, stat. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silent Night (2021)<br /></h2><br />An apocalyptic dystopian Christmas film starring Keira Knightly? Sign me up. After a couple invites their friends over for Christmas dinner, they soon discover that it's their last night on Earth, thanks to a toxic cloud sweeping across the planet. Coined as a ""<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">f*cked up </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/christmas-horror-film-silent-night"">Love Actually</a></em>"" by Refinery29's own Maybelle Morgan, this gem is satirical, self-aware, and well worth a rotation on your telly over the holidays. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Actually (2003)<br /></h2><br />While <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/love-actually-is-the-worst"">polarizing, <em>Love Actually</em></a> is still a firm favorite among many lovers of Christmas movies. With a stellar ensemble cast including Emma Thompson, Jude Law, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Hugh Grant and more, this 2003 film shows different aspects of love through ten separate stories. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holidate (2020)<br /></h2><br />Starring Emma Roberts and our own Aussie Luke Bracey who decide to be each other's holiday dates, Holidate is a rom-com with all the predictability and cheesiness we crave come Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Lord Of The Rings (2001)</h2><br />If <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>wasn't a Christmas movie, then why was it released on Boxing Day every year? Checkmate. A tradition in the Koster residence and our Christmas movie of choice every year, prep yourself to settle down for 10+ hours of Middle Earth shenanigans. One movie for Christmas Eve, one movie for Christmas Day, and one movie for Boxing Day. You're welcome.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Love Hard (2021)<br /></h2><br /><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">Love Hard</a></em> combines romance with the holiday spirit. Starring <em>The Vampire Diaries</em> actress Nina Dobrev, the Netflix original Christmas film sees her character Natalie get catfished when she thinks she's chatting to a dreamy guy, Tag (Darren Barnet from <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/07/10586990/most-underrated-line-never-have-i-ever"">Never Have I Ever</a></em>), but it's actually Tag's childhood friend Josh (Jimmy O. Yang).<br /><br />This movie is just as much about the challenges of dating in the online world as it is about our desire for love and connection, especially during the festive season. It's also a big win for Asian representation in Hollywood. As <em>Refinery29 Australia</em> writer Maggie Zhou puts it, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/11/10736711/jimmy-o-yang-love-hard"">casting of Jimmy O. Yang as a potential love interest</a> welcomes a change from the problematic stereotypes about Asian men that have so often been perpetuated in Hollywood over the years. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey (2020)<br /></h2><br />With visuals that look like they've been plucked from a storybook, <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/12/10222779/jingle-jangle-best-black-christmas-movies"">Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey</a></em> is a cute and fresh Christmas flick from Netflix. It follows a toymaker (Forest Whitaker, no less) and his apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key), who steals one of his prized inventions. It's up to his granddaughter (Madalen Mills) to save the day and reignite the magic. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992)<br /></h2><br />With Michael Caine as Scrooge, Gonzo the Great as Charles Dickens, and a whole bunch of Muppets, <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol </em>has easily cemented itself as one of the most easily recognizable and well-loved Christmas movies out there. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Princess Switch (2018)<br /></h2><br />In what is the best work by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/10/10698806/vanessa-hudgens-nude-photo-leak-2007-reaction"">Vanessa Hudgens</a> since <em>High School Musical</em>, this movie is perfect if you're looking for a 90-minute happily ever come Christmas time. You'll be seeing double because Hudgens plays two women: Stacy DeNovo, a baker who runs a popular pastry shop in America, and Lady Margaret Delacourt, Duchess of Montenaro in Belgravia, London. When they meet, they do their best <em>Parent-Trap</em> style swap of sorts and switch places. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Falling For Christmas (2022)<br /></h2><br />Speaking of <em>The Parent Trap, </em>the Lindsay Lohan renaissance is upon us! And I, for one, welcome our new overlord. <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/11/11185134/falling-for-christmas-lindsay-lohan-netflix"">Falling For Christmas</a></em> is a fresh Christmas flick in which Lohan plays a spoiled heiress who loses her memory after a skiing accident. She falls (literally) into the arms of a supremely hot widower. You can probably guess what happens next.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Violent Night (2022)<br /></h2><br />An R-rated Christmas movie? Yes, please. Starring everyone's daddy, David Harbour, this black comedy action flick features a heroic Santa Claus who must step in to save the day after a group of mercenaries attack the estate of a wealthy family.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Home Alone (1990)<br /></h2><br />Another John Hughes classic, <em>Home Alone</em> is a holiday essential. Featuring Macaulay Culkin as the sadistic kid we knew him as, Kevin ends up being left home alone after his preoccupied parents head off on a holiday. Soon, he has to protect his house against burglars — a feat which he accomplishes in a very creative fashion.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lethal Weapon (1987)<br /></h2><br />In <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover gift us with an action-packed thriller that's chock-full of blood and violence. Doesn't quite sound Christmassy? Let this movie convince you otherwise. Shane Black, the MVP of writing screenplays that always somehow involve Christmas, has done it again. This time, it's with two cops on a mission to take down drug dealers — on Christmas, of course. If <em>Die Hard</em> is a Christmas movie, <em>Lethal Weapon</em> should definitely get a seat at the table. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Single All The Way (2021)<br /></h2><br />In an attempt to avoid judgement from his family for being single, Peter (Michael Urie) convinces his bestie, Nick (Philemon Chambers), to pretend that they're in a relationship. Aaaand, cue the romance. If the fake-dating trope isn't enough to reel you in, perhaps some Jennifer Coolidge might do the job.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Tangerine (2015)<br /></h2><br />If you haven't noticed yet, queer Christmas films are excellent. And <em>Tangerine</em> is no exception. Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a pair of transgender women (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor), a pair of sex workers who search for a heart-breaking pimp. Shot entirely on an iPhone, it's a cinematic feat as well as just a bloody good Christmas film.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Story (1983)<br /></h2><br />A cult classic, <em>A Christmas Story</em> tells the tale of a young boy who tries to convince his parents, teacher, and Santas Claus that a BB gun is the perfect Christmas gift.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Krampus (2015)<br /></h2><br />Who says Christmas movies can't also be horror? Not us! <em>Krampus </em>is a scary goodie. It features Toni Collette and Adam Scott as they deal with a festive Christmas demon who has been summoned into their home. And you thought Christmas dinner with your conservative uncle was bad.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe (2005)<br /></h2><br />The MVP of cosy movies, <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> embodies childhood joy. Based on C.S. Lewis' novel, we see four children enter a magical, snowy land through a wardrobe door. Father Christmas even makes an appearance (plus James McAvoy as a very hot half-faun/half-human). <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001)</h2><br />Whilst not explicitly Christmassy, I'm sure many will agree that Harry Potter's first instalment just gives off that fuzzy, Christmas morning feeling. If you don't mind, we'll just be off pretending that we're unwrapping gifts at Hogwarts on Christmas morning.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Knight Before Christmas (2019)<br /></h2><br />In a strange turn of events, Vanessa Hudgens is now known as <em>the</em> Christmas movie star. I know, I didn't see it coming either. In <em>The Knight Before Christmas, </em>she meets a hot medieval English knight (Josh Whitehouse) who magically time-travels to present-day America.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Scrooged (1998)<br /></h2><br />Based on Charles Dickens' novel, <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, <em>Scrooged</em> features Bill Murray as a cynical, mean television exec who's visited by three spirits. Here, they give him a chance to right his wrongs — all on Christmas Eve. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Black Christmas (1974)<br /></h2><br />After a group of sorority girls plan to go away for the Christmas holidays, they're soon confronted by a terrifying stalker. An intelligent, unnerving Chrissie slasher that's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-horror-movies"">a must for any horror fanatic</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>In Bruges (2008)<br /></h2><br />If you're hankering for a not-so-Christmassy Christmas movie, <em>In Bruges</em> should be at the top of your list. Set in Bruges, Belgium, we're treated to a wonderfully festive landscape. The plot, however, isn't as festive — two Irish hitmen, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), head to Bruges to hide out. But things get complicated when their boss (Ralph Fiennes), asks Ken to kill Ray.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)<br /></h2><br />In possibly the cutest addition to this list, <em>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer </em>is the epitome of Christmas joy. It's the story we all know and love, but artistically, it's way beyond its years. With groundbreaking stop-motion animation using puppets, you'll find it hard to wipe the smile off your face. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Polar Express (2004)<br /></h2><br />This animated musical adventure is based on the 1985 book of the same name, and as cliché as it sounds, it reminds me of the magic of Christmas that you beautifully embrace as a child and then look back on fondly as an adult. You'll never feel too old to watch this movie, where a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole aboard the Polar Express train. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Meet Me In St. Louis (1944)<br /></h2><br />Is it even Christmas if you don't listen to a bit of Judy Garland? In this musical masterpiece, we meet four sisters as they learn about life and love, and face their childhood fears.  It makes for perfect background viewing while some gingerbread people decorating, thanks to its stellar soundscape. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Little Women (2019)<br /></h2><br />Set during two life-changing Christmases, Little Women is the perfect Christmas movie. In this soul-crushing and spellbinding adaptation, we follow the March sisters (played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen), as they enter womanhood. With snowy landscapes, Christmas parties, pine trees and fireplace-laced stockings, it's hard to not consider this one of the Christmas greats. Just maybe skip over <em>that</em> marriage proposal scene if you want to keep the mood light. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Eyes Wide Shut (1999)<br /></h2><br />For the anti-consumerist Christmas critics among us (hello!), <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> is the perfect way to get into the festive spirit. Stanley Kubrick's last film, considered his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema"", follows Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), after she admits to dreaming of having an affair. Everywhere you look, it's hard to ignore that the spirit of Christmas is rife — holiday parties, strung-up lights, toy stores, and mall Santas. But it's not without its criticism. Instead of whimsical, Kubrick presents Christmas as critique of the Western world's obsession with consumerism. File under: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/holiday-movies-sex-scenes"">Christmas movies to watch when you're horny.</a><br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Night Before (2015)</h2><br />A Christmas movie for those who flock to stoner comedy (read: any Seth Rogan film), <em>The Night Before</em> features the man himself, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie as they say goodbye to their years of Christmas traditions in anticipation of fatherhood. With one last night of debauchery, they head to New York and hunt down the elusive Nutcracka ball. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965)<br /></h2><br />An icon in itself, this <em>Peanuts</em> Christmas film tackles Christmas materialism in a lighthearted way as Charlie Brown tries to find a deeper meaning to Christmas. We love some Charlie Brown existentialism!<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Santa Clause (1994)<br /></h2><br />After Tim Allen accidentally causes the death of Santa, he magically transforms into the new big man. A cornerstone of any 90s kid's Christmas,<em> The Santa Clause</em> is a heartwarming story of a dad repairing his relationship with his family.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Happiest Season (2020)<br /></h2><br />Another queer Christmas movies, <em>Happiest Season </em>stars the likes of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/kristen-stewart-spencer-interview"">Kristen Stewart</a>, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, Dan Levy and more. It follows a woman who struggles to come out to her conservative parents while she and her girlfriend visit them during the Christmas holiday. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Man Who Invented Christmas (2017)<br /></h2><br />In <em>The Man Who Invented Christmas</em>, we take a deep dive into how Charles Dickens wrote one of the most quintessential Christmas tales — <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. Anyone who's had writer's block will resonate.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Four Christmases (2008)<br /></h2><br />There's <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/why-we-love-bad-christmas-movies"">something about objectively bad Christmas films that make them so good</a>. I'll be straight with you — this is not a good movie. But it is a good movie for Christmas. Featuring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, a couple spends Christmas Day jumping between family get-togethers after their holiday to Fiji is cancelled.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Dolly Parton's A Christmas On The Square (2020)<br /></h2><br />Everyone's Christmas could do with a little more Dolly Parton. In this campy song-and-dance story, a Scrooge-y woman who's planning on selling off a small town, receives a visit from an angel (Dolly Parton, of course).<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966)<br /></h2><br />In the original 1966 rendition, Dr. Seuss' classic is told to us true to form as a cartoon spectacle. This Christmas movie is like watching the book come to life. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Spirited (2022)<br /></h2><br />Starring Christmas legend Will Ferrell, and everyone's boyfriend, Ryan Reynolds, this fresh festive flick is a musical version of Charles Dickens' famous story. But with a cast like this, there's no way it's the same story we've seen time and time again.   <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Christmas Prince (2017)<br /></h2><br />With a Hallmark essence that's so bad it's good, <em>A Christmas Prince</em> follows a young reporter who is sent abroad to get the scoop on a very hot, very vanilla prince. With a whopping IMDb rating of 5.8/10, it's the perfect bad Christmas film to watch these holidays.<br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Miracle on 34th Street (1994)<br /></h2><br />Young Susan (played by Mara Wilson of Matilda fame) doesn't believe in Santa. When an elderly man is called in by Susan's mother to replace an intoxicated department store Santa, things start to change. Introducing himself only as Kris Kringle, he claims he's the real Santa Claus, leading to locals trying to sabotage him and landing him in a court case. There's a heartwarming message in this movie about the beauty in believing and Christmas wishes. The 1947 original is also well worth a viewing. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)<br /></h2><br />Set during Christmas in Los Angeles, this film looks closer to a Christmas in Sydney than it does in a winter wonderland US. In true Shane Black fashion (a la <em>Lethal Weapon</em>), the Christmassy elements are just background noise. But that doesn't make it any less fun. Featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Michelle Monaghan in a sexy Santa suit, <em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang </em>is a witty crime comedy that doubles as a murder mystery. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Last Holiday (2006)</h2><br />Queen Latifah shines in this early naughties movie that sees her as a saleswoman and budding home chef named Georgia Byrd. After receiving a terminal illness diagnosis, she then uses her life savings to fly to Czechia and spends the last few weeks of her life like a lavish billionaire. <br /></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>The Holdovers (2023)<br /></h2><br />While Christmas time often invites us to watch downright <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2023/11/11605440/cheesy-christmas-movies-on-netflix"">bad holiday flicks</a>, The Holdovers cannot be considered in this category — it's a great Christmas film. In fact, it's a great film, period. Directed by Alexander Payne (of <em>Nebraska</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>), <em>The Holdovers</em> follows a cranky instructor (Paul Giamatti) who's forced to remain on campus during the Christmas holidays to babysit the kids who have nowhere to go. Expect tears.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Best. Christmas. Ever! (2023)</h2><br />Starring Brandy (!) and Heather Graham, Netflix's new Christmas movie, <em>Best. Christmas. Ever!</em> is so bad it's good. Honestly, you don't even need to know the plot of this one to add it to your queue list. It has Brandy in it!

<p>I look forward to December every year, simply for the chance to sit in the lounge and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-australian-christmas-movies"">binge Christmas movies</a>. I love the classics, from <em>Home Alone</em> to <em>Love Actually</em>, but there’s always a new set of films that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/8-tv-film-netflix-watch-december"">appear on Netflix</a>. The streamer has come out with some gems over the past few years, like <em>Love Hard</em>, <em>Hot Frosty</em> and <em>Klaus</em>, so I’ve been eagerly awaiting their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/best-christmas-movies"">holiday slate</a>.</p>



<p>From Alicia Silverstone’s new <em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em> to <em>Jingle Bell Heist</em>, there’s some great festive options to pull up on your screen. If you prefer lifestyle shows over movies, Meghan Markle has conjured up a special holiday edition of her show <em>With Love, Meghan</em>. To take a look at the best Christmas content coming to Netflix, read on.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><em>A Merry Little Ex-Mas</em></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>After Kate (Alicia Silverstone) and Everett (Oliver Hudson) decide to “consciously uncouple”, the exes must navigate one last perfect family Christmas together before moving on. With the addition of some younger flings (Jameela Jamil and Pierson Fode), chaos ensues and nothing goes to plan.<br /><br /><strong>When:</strong> Streaming now<br /><strong>Watch if you like:</strong><em> Hot Frosty</em>, <em>Our Little Secret</em></p>

<h2><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em></h2>

<p><em>Jingle Bell Heist</em> shot to number one on Netflix’s most-watched movies list just hours after it was released, it’s one to watch.

It’s about a woman named Layla (Christina Milian) who is on a quest to meet James, the man of her dreams (Kofi Siriboe), so she races across New York City with a Christmas concierge (Devale Ellis) hoping to find a ticket to a sold-out Pentatonix Christmas concert.</p>

Makeup is one of the easiest ways to embrace the grandeur of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">party season</a>, and <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">some <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/katie-jane-hughes-naked-beauty-interview"">makeup looks</a></span> are simply synonymous with this time of year. Glitter eyeshadow? Tick. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/11/78055/taylor-swift-red-lipstick-looks"">Red lip</a>? Check. However, while crimson pouts and shimmery eyelids might be <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/subtle-christmas-nail-art-designs"">Christmas and New Year’s Eve</a> classics (for good reason), they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to winter party makeup.<br /><br />This time of year provides the perfect excuse to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">up your beauty game</a>. Inspiration for new looks isn't always the easiest to find, though, especially in the hectic holiday haze of party planning and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">gift shopping</a>. So, if you're on the hunt for some festive inspiration, we’ve got you covered. Whether you're a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-makeup-skincare-gifts"">beauty enthusiast</a> or more of a novice, a glitz and glam lover or a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025"">makeup minimalist</a>, we scoured Instagram to bring you 32 holiday party makeup looks to suit all budgets and preferences.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. All product details reflect the price and availability at the time of publication.

Bonus points if you have a light champagne-coloured eyeshadow to pair with your look, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glossier.com%2Fproducts%2Flidstar%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopyfpy2XNrxavXSR5Rlz8-haE29BTCthGEwIH4nADwG8fKMmreG"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossier Lidstar in Moon</a>, or <a href=""https://fave.co/3VwJOZD"">Rare Beauty All of the Above Weightless Eyeshadow Stick in Integrity</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Après-Ski Flush</h2><br /><br />Look as if you are fresh from the snowy slopes — no runny nose required. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/patrickta/"">Patrick Ta</a> gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gigihadid/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gigi Hadid</a> a faux cold-weather flush with a matching berry cheek and lip. The key here is to make the blush and lip colour you apply appear soft and blurred. Pro tip: Use your fingers to soften the pigment by gently patting your lips. For a diffused look on your cheeks, add a very slightly lighter blush around the outside of your main tint, and blur the edges using a brush or your fingers.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Cinnamon Spice Soirée</h2><br />Pumpkin spice season may start in the fall, but it stretches all the way into winter sweater weather. Use pumpkin pies and cinnamon rolls as your inspiration for a delicious, smoky, bronzed eyelid, such as this example from makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/racheltzairi_makeup/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Tzairi</a> on Instagram. Finish with glossy lips via <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsummer-fridays-lip-butter-balm-P455936"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm,</a> in Iced Coffee.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Red &amp; Razor Sharp</h2><br /><br />If Santa were into glam eye makeup, this is what he would wear. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexandraafrench/"">Alexandra French</a> gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/then0t0ri0usvip/"">Victoria Pedretti</a> this winged red eye look that’s perfect for a holiday party. To achieve this festive eye makeup, make sure to reach for bold pigmented eye colours that are easy to diffuse and soften with a brush, like the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fdanessa-myricks-colorfix-24-hour-cream-color-P468353"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Danessa Myricks Beauty Colorfix Liquid Pigment in Primary Red</a>. Want to look even edgier? Fluff up your brows with a clear brow gel like the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2F24-hr-brow-setter-P409242"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Benefit 24-Hour Brow Setter</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Snow Angel Wings</h2><br /><br />If you’re looking for something outside of more traditional and glam makeup, consider this more abstract wintery eye look. Draw the outline of a big, oversized wing in white and leave it at that. If you want a sharper siren eye, look to this example on Ashley Park by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/makeupvincent/"">Vincent Oquendo</a> and line your inner corners, as well. We love <a href=""https://fave.co/3ONPdHW"">Stila Stay All Day Waterproof Liquid Eye Liner in Snow</a>, for easy application and ultra precision to draw the sharpest wings possible.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Velvet Eyes</h2><br /><br />‘Tis the season to wear velvet. Instead of just having it adorn your holiday party outfit, add it to your eyes, as well. Look to this sultry example on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/simoneashley/"">Simone Ashley</a> as done by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/babskymakeup/"">Alex Babsky</a>. Reach for a creamy and buildable eye shadow in an opulent, velvety shade, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-lid-lustre-trio"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Beckham Beauty Lid Lustre in Midnight</a>. To complete the look, tightline your top and bottom lids with black eyeliner (<a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsatin-kajal-liner"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Beckham Beauty</a> is a safe bet when it comes to eyeliner, too).</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Purple Frost</h2><br /><br />Statement shimmery eyes aren't limited to just gold and silver metals. Try opting for a frosted purple metallic look, like the one here on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/fkatwigs/"">FKA Twigs</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/raoulalejandre/"">Raoúl Alejandre</a>. Not only is there glitter on the eyes, but subtle sparkles all over her face, too, along with a very <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-glitter-y2k-comeback"">Y2K glittery lip</a>. Use a soft glittery eyeshadow that can double as full-face shimmer, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmakeup-by-mario-master-crystal-reflector-tm-P33257988"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Makeup by Mario Master Crystal Reflector</a>, and a sparkly lip colour like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftom-ford-sun-spark-lip-balm-P516416"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford Sun Spark Lip Balm</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Holly Wreath Green</h2><br /><br />Red gets a lot of the attention when it comes to makeup during the holiday season, but green is equally as festive. This example by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/allanface/"">Allan Avendaño</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/LanaCondor/"">Lana Condor</a> is a great example of a bright, holly-hued eye that will shine at any festive occasion. In this look, Avendaño uses eyeshadow from <a href=""https://www.patmcgrath.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pat McGrath Labs</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Christmas Cat Eye</h2><br /><br />Avendaño gives <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/genneyawalton/"">Genneya Walton</a> a classic black cat eye, cherry red lip, and the kind of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-prickly-pear-serum-review"">glowing skin</a> you can never go wrong with — no matter the time of year. The trick to achieving the glowing skin here is mixing some <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/drunk-elephant-d-bronzi-drops-dupes"">beauty glow drops</a> — we love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fhalo-glow-liquid-filter-pimprod2036949%3Fsku%3D2604924"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Cosmetics' Halo Glow Liquid Filter</a> — in with your foundation, or even apply it solo for a festive glow that isn't from the Christmas tree.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Crimson Christmas</h2><br /><br /><br />Unlike how we look after a sleepless night, this crimson-coloured eye look is one we actually want to be seen with everywhere. A red eyeshadow moment can feel intimidating, but don't let it be; makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amberdmakeup/"">Amber Dreadon</a> uses the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patmcgrath.com%2Fproducts%2Fmothership-v-bronze-seduction"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pat McGrath Labs Mothership V: Bronze Seduction Palette</a>, to create this look for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiegavs/?hl=en"">MUNA’s Katie Gavin</a>. <br /><br />Just remember that some red pigments can stain the skin, so make sure to use an eye primer like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Feyeshadow-primer-potion-tube-original-P284716"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion</a>, or a colour-correcting concealer like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2F3c-color-correcting-concealer-palette-xlsImpprod12011171%3Fsku%3D2283240"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">NYX Professional Makeup 3C Palette</a>, beforehand.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Embellished Inner Eyes</h2><br /><br />If you’re after something both minimal and festive, look no further than this example by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iammaeng/"">makeup artist Maeng</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zuhazana/"">Kazuha of K-pop</a> group <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/le_sserafim/"">LE SSERAFIM</a>. The main focus, of course, is the sparkly ice-blue dots of colour in the inner corners of the eyes, but the look is made complete with simple, thin winged liner and a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/rhode-pocket-blush-review"">subtle, glowy blush</a>. For this particular look, Maeng uses the cult-favourite <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetlemonhead.com%2Fproducts%2Fspacepaste%3FzCountry%3DGB"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lemonhead LA Spacepaste Glitter Concentrate</a>, for the inner eye glitter and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/ETUDE-Blusher-Grapefruit-Long-Lasting-Application/dp/B0CFXN7LZG"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Etude Lovely Cookie Blusher in Grapefruit Jelly</a>, for the blush.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Haute Chocolate</h2><br /><br />Not every gorgeous makeup look requires using vibrant colours and bold textures. Utilise the matte browns and taupes already in your collection to create <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-makeup-tips-professional-artist"">a natural look</a> that works for day or night, like this one on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zoesaldana/"">Zoe Saldaña</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/makeupbyvera7/"">Vera Steimberg</a>. It’s perfect for going from the office Christmas party to the office Christmas after-party... and maybe even the after-after-party. Oh, and if you don’t have brown eyeshadow to hand, cheat your way to this look by using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bronzer-application-tips-makeup-artist"">your go-to bronzer</a> instead.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Ice Queen</h2><br /><br />Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/carlygiglio/"">Carly Giglio</a> must be a Michelle Trachtenberg fan because this silvery, icy makeup look embodies the feeling of a winter blizzard. The cool-toned grey/blue shadow and brick shade of blush, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fflush-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Merit Flush Balm Cream Blush in Fox</a>, paired with a fluffed bushy brow, is just cool enough to keep you warm at any festive event.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Pearl Princess</h2><br /><br />Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kirinstagram/"">Kirin Bhatty's</a> dreamy pearl look created for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lola.tung/"">Lola Tung</a> is a perfect winter party look. It's a little unexpected and playfully ornate, but not over-the-top. Not to mention, it’s actually pretty easy to replicate and a dream for those who may not be the most handy with a makeup brush, but still want to serve a true festive look. We adore the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhalfmagicbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fface-pearls-1%3Fvariant%3D44040857977009"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half Magic Face Pearls</a>, to create a style like this. You can use tweezers for more precision, but your hands will work fine for applying the pearls, too.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Vixen Isn't Just A Reindeer</h2><br /><br />The vixen eye, also called the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/viral-tiktok-eyeliner-trends"">fox or siren eye</a>, in which you line the inner triangles of your eyes, has easily become one of the most popular eyeliner trends of the past few years. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nicolaannepeltzbeckham/"">Nicola Peltz Beckham’s</a> vixen eye done by Alejandre is paired with pearly white eyeshadow and a creamy pink blush using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fyves-saint-laurent-nu-lip-cheek-tint-balm%2F7393643"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">YSL Beauty NU Lip &amp; Cheek Balmy Tint</a>. For a similarly rosy flush, some other options are <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frare-beauty-by-selena-gomez-soft-pinch-liquid-blush-P97989778"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsaie-dew-blush-liquid-cheek-blush-P469825"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Saie Dew Blush.</a></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Classic Christmassy Glam</h2><br /><br />When all else fails, go for the gold standard; a shimmering gold eyeshadow and red lipstick is <em>the </em>archetypal Christmas makeup look. As done by Avendaño, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/StephanieHsuOfficial/"">Stephanie Hsu</a> dons an example of this festive classic with a twinkling champagne gold eye and a ruby red lip. For a similar look, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elfcosmetics.com%2Ffine-as-fleck-glitter-eyeshadow%2F300243.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f Fine as Fleck Glitter Eyeshadow in It’s Glit</a><a href=""https://fave.co/49qlmit"">,</a>  and <a href=""https://fave.co/3D7guCH"">Armani Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick in Four Hundred</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Espresso Martini Eyes</h2><br /><br />This take on the halo eyeshadow look by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kdeenihan/"">Kelsey Deenihan Fisher</a> on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/maudeapatow/"">Maude Apatow</a> is perfect for getting together with friends over espresso martinis this holiday season. This old Hollywood sultry look comes from softly blending a dark brown on the outer edges of the eye with a shimmery caramel gold on the centre of the lid. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/smoky-brunette-hair-color-trend"">smoky look</a> is completed with a brown eyeshadow pencil drawn and smudged in the inner and outer corners of the eyes, crease, and lower lash line.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Ethereal Disco Party</h2><br /><br />Bring the party to you à la makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lindahallberg/"">Linda Hallberg</a>’s iridescent disco-ball creation. To master a similar look this festive season, try <a href=""https://fave.co/41oSEMM"">Danessa Myricks Beauty Infinite Chrome Flakes</a>, and an eye gloss like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcosmic-collection-eye-gloss%2F7863607"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmic Collection Eye Gloss</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Y2K Snow Queen</h2><br /><br />This ethereal snow queen look Alejandre <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ROSALIA.VT/"">gives Rosalía</a> is straight out of the early 2000s with its white and silver glitter eyeshadow and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dior-lip-oil-review"">pink glossy lip</a>. The <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolourpop.com%2Fproducts%2Fblue-moon-eyeshadow-palette"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ColourPop Pressed Powder Eyeshadow Makeup Palette in Blue Velvet</a>, has all the colours you need to achieve this icy eye look. And for lip gloss, we love the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fgloss-bomb-universal-lip-luminizer-P67988453"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Gold Foil Eyes</h2><br /><br />We love this <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bronzer-application-tips-makeup-artist"">gentle bronzed blush</a> look paired with a cool-brown lip and gilded eye. For a play on the classic brightening inner-corner highlight, add a golden metallic to your inner eyes. Avendaño proves this festive makeup add-on will brighten up your entire face, as shown on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/isabelamerced/"">Isabela Merced</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Bejeweled Wings</h2><br /><br />We think gems and crystals can be worn for non-editorial, casual makeup looks,  and we're obsessed with this sharp bejewelled vibe <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/gabbriette/"">on Gabbriette</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kalikennedy/"">Kali Kennedy</a>. Place the gems on top of an exaggerated cat eye and add some below your brows for extra effect. We love using dynamic styles and shapes of crystals like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fself-adhesive-face-gems-pimprod2040549"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Half Magic Iridescent Sparkle Self-Adhesive Face Gems</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Burgundy Moment</h2><br />We're still undecided on what we love more from this look by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ash_kholm/"">Ash K Holm</a>: Shay Mitchell's sultry taupe eyes or her creamy (and right on trend) burgundy-coloured lipstick. While we try to make up our minds, you can achieve a similar wine-coloured lip with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bobbibrowncosmetics.com%2Fproduct%2F2342%2F106434%2Fmakeup%2Flips%2Flipstick%2Fluxe-lipstick%2Ffh22%23%2Ffamily%2Fall"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bobbi Brown Luxe Lipstick in Your Majesty</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fk-i-s-s-i-n-g-lipstick-P433531"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Tilbury K.I.S.S.I.N.G Lipstick in Night Crimson</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Glittery Graphic Eyes</h2><br /><br />Want a more graphic eye look this Christmas? Use your glittery outfit as inspiration when you're in a makeup rut and extend a shimmery colour out towards your temples in a wing-like shape. Finish with a smaller black wing and lashings of mascara — look to this photo of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dovecameron/"">Dove Cameron</a> for inspiration.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Rose Gold Champagne</h2><br /><br />Move over gold and silver. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katiejanehughes/"">Katie Jane Hughes</a> pairs this gentle rose gold shimmery shadow with a bright, true red lip, and it screams Christmas without feeling like you belong in a Hallmark movie. What really makes this look stand out is the mascara. We love <a href=""https://fave.co/3Bo1hg3"">YSL Lash Clash Mascara</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Filiabeauty.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproducts%2Ffullest-volumizing-mascara"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ILIA Fullest Volumizing Mascara</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Cozy Caramel</h2><br /><br />This caramel-coloured makeup on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/indyamoore/"">Indya Moore</a> by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emilychengmakeup/"">Emily Cheng</a> is almost better than a cup of warm hot chocolate. We said <em>almost</em>. To achieve a similar matte eyeshadow look in one product, a liquid eyeshadow is your best friend. <a href=""https://fave.co/3OKVc0g"">ILIA Liquid Powder Eye Shadow Tint in Tannin</a>, and <a href=""https://us.lisaeldridge.com/products/gaia-liquid-silk-liquid-eyeshadow?variant=50406424903983"">Lisa Eldridge Liquid Silk Eyeshadow in Gaia</a>, will give you everything you need.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>A Very Camo Christmas</h2><br /><br />Camo-coloured clothes are here to stay, and this olive-toned shadow look on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alexademie/"">Alexa Demie</a> by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaleteter/"">Kale Teter</a> will definitely make you stand out from the crowd. Add a juicy lip oil, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkosas.com%2Fcollections%2Fwet-lip-oil-gloss%2Fproducts%2Fwet-lip-oil-gloss"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kosas Wet Lip Oil Gloss</a>, to really make your eyes pop.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Oxblood Red Holiday</h2><br /><br />When you're getting ready for a holiday party, consider a deep oxblood lip colour. It’s just different enough from the standard red. Babsky uses <a href=""https://sergelutens.com/products/letoffe-du-mat-rouge-a-levres-mat-m3"">Serge Lutens Matte Lipstick in M3</a>, on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tayrussell/"">Taylor Russel</a>, but we also love <a href=""https://fave.co/4fbA266"">Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick in Festival Magic</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silver Meets Gold<br /></h2><br /><br />If you can't choose between a gold eye or a silver look this holiday season, why not have a little bit of both? Gunmetal shadow is instantly more interesting when paired with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cowgirl-copper-hair-color"">a copper-coloured</a> liner like the one worn by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jackieaina/"">Jackie Aina</a>. That gentle pop of brown really elevates the look as a whole.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Lively Lavender</h2><br /><br />We're not gonna lie — we've already started tucking away our vivid pastel colours from summer, but this lavender liner Babsky uses on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/negga.ruth/?hl=en"">Ruth Negga</a> is proof that pastel is still in, even in the wintertime. It's topped off with the perfect nude shimmery lip.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Neon Hot Winter</h2><br /><br />A bright neon pink might feel off-season when it comes to our wardrobes, but this look on Dove Cameron by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kaleteter/"">Kale Teter</a> is proof that it works on eyelids all season long — especially when using negative space. <a href=""https://www.glistencosmetics.com/products/strawberry-wet-liner"">Glisten Cosmetics Wet Liner</a>, is easy to use when recreating this look at home.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Cranberry Wine</h2><br /><br />It's officially time to pull out your vampy purples and make a huge statement at your New Year's Eve party. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/monicastylemuse/"">MonicaStyleMuse makes</a> a strong case for the vampy, plum wine lip with this look, which you can try for yourself using <a href=""https://fave.co/4ipfSbL"">Gucci Rouge a Levres Satin in Virginia Fleur de Lis</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Festive Smoke</h2><br />Upgrade your basic smoky eye to a sultry one by adding a pop of color in your lower lash line, similar to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/itsmyrayeraye/"">Raye Boyce</a>'s. Under eyeliner has become a huge trend, especially for those with hooded eyes. Some of our favorite colored liners include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fretractable-long-lasting-mechanical-eyeliner-pencil-xlsImpprod4141599%3Fsku%3D2242431"">NYX Retractable Long-Lasting Mechanical Eyeliner Pencil</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fline-artist-pimprod2034386"">about-face Line Artist</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Neon Hot Winter</h2><br />A bright <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-makeup-products-barbie-movie"">neon pink</a> might feel off-season when it comes to our closets, but Lily Aldridge is proof that it works for our eyelids, all season long — especially when smudged with champagne-colored shadow. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmake-up-for-ever-aqua-resist-color-ink-24hr-waterproof-liquid-eyeliner-P483474%3FskuId%3D2552396"">Make Up Forever's Aqua Resist Color Ink 24HR Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner in Pink Blaze</a> and <a href=""https://www.suvabeauty.com/collections/hydra-fx/products/doodle-dee"">Suya Beauty's Hydra FX Liner in Neon UV Pink</a> are two sides of the pink eyeliner spectrum, whether you want something more subtle, or a full neon sign on your face.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Glittery Wings<br /></h2><br />Bored with your basic wing? Avendaño adds some glitter in the middle of Olivia Rodrigo's cat eye to dress it up. This is a gorgeous, refreshing take on the negative space eyeliner trend that never seems to go away. We love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fmoondust-liquid-glitter-eyeliner-xlsImpprod5870114"">Urban Decay Moondust Liquid Glitter Eyeliner</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fglitterpill-eye-paint-eyeliner-pimprod2040563%3Fsku%3D2611474"">Half Magic Glitterpill Eye Paint + Eyeliner</a> to make this look shine.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Winter Mermaid</h2><br />Pack on a shimmery blue shadow in the center of your onyx smoky eye, like Avendaño does for Isabela Merced, to give it a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermaid-manicure-nail-art-trend"">mermaid vibe</a>. Our favorite shimmery blues for a look like this include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcolorful-shadow-P430932%3FskuId%3D2372209"">Sephora Collection Sephora Colorful Eyeshadow in Astral Blue</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ficonic-london-glaze-dual-ended-eyeshadow-crayon-P478279%3FskuId%3D2630234"">Iconic London Glaze Dual Ended Eyeshadow Crayon in After Hours</a> and the shades in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fafrogalactic-eyeshadow-palette-pimprod2040910%3Fsku%3D2616344"">Juvia's Place Afrogalactic Eyeshadow Palette</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Simple Festivities</h2><br />Keep a brick-colored lipstick (similar to this one Cheng used on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/03/145494/yara-shahidi-age-blackish-young-hollywood-actress"">Yara Shahidi</a> for the 2018 SAG Awards) in your purse or desk for when you need to quickly vamp up your look before a date.

In addition to a standard eyeliner wing, continue adding graphic lines above and below your lids in a way that accentuates your natural eye shape. This look can be done with any number of colors, but we especially love the gunmetal lines and subtle neutral shimmer that makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/allanface/?g=5"">Allan Avendaño</a> gives Cara Jade Myers. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Subtle Shimmer </h2><br />Glitter doesn't have to be plastered all over your face to make a statement (but if that's what you're into, we also love that). Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennakristina/"">Jenna Kristina</a> gives Zoey Deutch this soft rosy brown glam that has the smallest hint of shimmer to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/golden-hour-makeup-tiktok"">make her face glow</a>.

This gorgeous orange and pink sunset eye paired with a magenta lip color on <em>The Daily Show's </em>Dulcé Sloan will still bring the summer even during the winter solstice.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Silver Sparkling Snow</h2><br />Megan Fox has nailed looking like a snow angel thanks to an abundance of silver glitter and fluffy lashes. Try the <a href=""https://getlemonhead.com/products/spacejam?variant=39485658660952#Image28390079856728"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lemonhead LA Spacejam in Interstellar</a>. </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Golden Creases</h2><br /><br />We love this <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/natural-makeup-tips-professional-artist"">gentle bronzed blush</a> look paired with a super bold eye. A play on the classic brightening inner-corner highlight, this look will completely up your game by adding an eye-catching yellow gold arch that extends from the inner corner of the eye along your crease. Makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lilly_keys/"">Lilly Keys Westbrook</a> proves this festive makeup add-on will brighten up your entire face, as shown on Melissa Barrera. To achieve this look, start with a layer of sunny yellow eyeshadow, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvictoriabeckhambeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Feyewear%3Fvariant%3D41020610576418"">Victoria Beckham EyeWear in Sunflower</a>, and top it with a warm gold, such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maccosmetics.com%2Fproduct%2F13840%2F363%2Fproducts%2Fmakeup%2Feyes%2Feyeshadow%2Feye-shadow%3Fshade%3DIf_It_Ain%2527t_Baroque"">MAC Eye Shadow in If It Ain’t Baroque</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Feye%2Feyeshadow%2Fultimate-glow-shots-liquid-eyeshadow%2F800897225414.html"">NYX Ultimate Glow Shots Liquid Eyeshadow in Lemon Slayed</a>.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Glam And Gorgeous</h2><br />Want to be the <em>extra </em>cousin at the family party? Just show up in deep purple lipstick and a bold cut crease look like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/arshiamoorjani"">Arshia Moorjani</a>. Add a tiny bit of sparkle using a glitter shadow from <a href=""https://www.bodyography.com/collections/best-sellers/products/glitter-pigments"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bodyography</a> or <a href=""https://toodbeauty.com/products/bioglitter-tigers-eye"">TooD Beauty</a> and dazzle everyone in your sights.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Magenta Magic</h2><br />Pair a line of hot-pink liner, such as <a href=""https://www.makeupforever.com/us/en/eyes/eyeliner"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Make Up For Ever Aqua Resist Color Ink Liquid Eyeliner</a> like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kingmalimagic/"">Mali Magic</a> did on Ashley Blaine Featherson with a matching <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-pink-lipsticks-for-warm-cool-undertones"">magenta lip color</a>, such as <a href=""https://www.violettefr.com/products/petal-bouche-matte"">Petal Bouche Matte Liquid Red Lipstick</a> from Violette_FR to make your face the center of attention at Christmas dinner. We're dreaming of a pink Christmas, indeed.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><h2>Grunge Glitter </h2><br /><br />Not into clean-cut eye makeup looks? No problem. This festive look by makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/babskymakeup/"">Alex Babsky</a> for Lucy Boynton brings grunge <em>and</em> glitter. Start with a smudged smokey eye (the more unkempt, the better) and top it with some glitter in the center of the eye on both the upper and lower lids. Opt for either a less precise splash of sparkles or a more deliberate vertical line of glitter  — think chic clown makeup.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?
