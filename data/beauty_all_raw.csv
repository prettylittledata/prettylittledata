<p><strong>Spoilers ahead. </strong>Is it actually possible to recover from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/inner-child-healing"">childhood trauma</a>, or will the effects linger forever? That’s the question <em>Ella McCay </em>asks, the new film from three-time Academy Award winner James L. Brooks (<em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>As Good as It Gets</em>). Following Ella McCay, played by Emma Mackey (<em>Barbie</em>, <em>Sex Education</em>), the 34-year-old lieutenant governor juggles the grief of her mother’s death as well as a strained relationship with her father, with help from her caring Aunt Helen, played by <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Jamie Lee Curtis (</a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">Freaky Friday</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/freakier-friday-movie-fashion-costumes"">, <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>)</a>. </p>



<p>Ella exhibits signs of people-pleasing behaviour in both her work and personal life after watching her father repeatedly cheat on her mother. She seems doomed to repeat the cycle, trying her best to have a “normal” marriage with her husband Ryan (Jack Lowden), which results in her overcompensating to make him happy. Principal psychologist <a href=""https://enrichinglivespsychology.com.au/about"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Carly Dober from Enriching Lives Psychology</a> tells <em>Refinery29</em> this could be due to a need to “establish a false sense of safety” and notes it’s a common trauma response. “People-pleasing can also be linked to emotional dependency. [This] occurs when someone has unmet psychological needs that they may try to satisfy within close interpersonal relationships,” Dober says. “[It] is a pattern of behaviours people may engage in to get others to like them, and to avoid rejection, criticism, or embarrassment. It’s linked to traits such as depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.”</p>



<p>Mackey confirms that <em>Ella McCay </em>is a study of the “human condition”, and tells us that’s partly what drew her to the role. “The film is very much about cycles and cycles being broken, or not in a few cases, and about what you decide to make of yourself,” Mackey tells <em>R29</em>. Throughout the film, her Aunt Helen acts like a driving force in her life, and calls out the behaviour of Ella’s husband. Mackey notes it can be “unsettling” to have somebody by your side pointing out flaws or truths you want to avoid, but in some ways, there’s a “comfort” to it as well. “She’s the truth sayer, and says the uncomfortable thing when I don’t want to hear it, and it’s absolutely spot on every time,” Mackey says. “And we all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and to make us think about it… and then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.”</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>We all need one of those people in our lives just to bring us back to what’s real and make us think about it… then we’ve got to work with it, work through it.</p><cite>Emma MackeY</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>There’s one particular line in the family that gives audiences a closer look into Ella’s psyche, and that’s when she admits she adores her husband because he comes from a “normal family”. She deems it “normal” because his parents are still married, unlike Ella’s own experience. It’s telling that she prioritizes this above other traits he possesses, such as his manipulative tendencies. By making choices rooted in trauma, she’s ended up in the midst of another unhappy cycle. Curtis says these family dynamics and trauma portrayed in <em>Ella McCay</em> are what make this film feel so rooted in reality. “That’s what makes movies so relatable, and particularly family movies, is that you can sit there and watch a movie as a family and realise your family is different from the family you’re watching on screen, but there are a lot of similarities,” Curtis explains. “Hopefully, families have an Aunt Helen, that person in your life who champions you even though you’re getting battered.” </p>



<p>As difficult as it is to see Ella’s life crumble around her during the film, Mackey says it’s important to stumble at times so you can succeed in the future. “Unless you [stumble], you have no perspective, and you don’t know what’s important,” Mackey says. “You don’t want to seek or search what you’re curious about if you don’t stumble a couple of, or a lot of times.”</p>



<p>And while the drama-comedy tugs at the heartstrings, Curtis says she wants audiences to take away one thing. “There is no opposite word for trauma, but hope comes close,” she says, quoting the film. “That, to me, is where you understand that even with traumatic experiences, hope for the future, hope for your family, hope for the world, hope for potential. All of it comes pretty close to being a counterpoint to the bad things that have happened.”</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869365.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"">LED face masks</a> are everywhere these days, but many seem more alike than not. It’s as if we have a <em>Devil Wears Prada</em> blue belt situation on our hands. So, when Shark Beauty unveiled its first foray in the skin tech space, I was intrigued — not only because I’m a fan of the brand, but because this wasn’t just <em>any</em> LED mask. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/cryoglow-tm-cooling-led-face-mask-P515543"">CryoGlow™ Cooling &amp; LED Face Mask</a> offers red and blue light therapy to help brighten, firm, and clear skin. However, it’s also equipped with cooling pads to depuff and wake up tired eyes. If that sounds like some seriously souped-up beauty tech, it’s because it is. Could this be the game-changer my routine needs? I set out to find out.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">Shark CryoGlow Under-Eye Cooling+LED Face Mask</a>, $349.99</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11869244.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=756&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A189"" /></figure>



<h2><strong>What is Shark’s CryoGlow mask, and how do you use it?</strong></h2>



<p>Per the brand, the <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P515543"">CryoGlow face mask</a> was developed with dermatologists and clinical trials to back its claims of reducing the appearance of fine lines and reducing breakouts within weeks. It features something called iQLED Technology™ (aka, derm-developed treatment cycles of red, blue, and deep infrared light) distributed evenly throughout the inside of the mask. But as I hinted at earlier, perhaps the biggest point of differentiation is the Cryo-inspired cooling mechanism, which claims to visibly depuff the under-eye area post-use.</p>



<h2><strong>What makes Shark’s CryoGlow mask special?</strong></h2>



<p>My CryoGlow mask is a pretty shade of powder blue (it also comes in a muted lilac), with a matching satin pouch for storage. I love that it powers up via a remote control instead of an app. (Call me old school, but I miss the days when we didn’t have an app for <em>everything</em>.) You can cycle through four different treatments for various concerns  — acne, fine lines, a four-min express treatment, and one focused on tightening and brightening the under-eye area — which combine infrared light and red and blue LEDs (plus those cooling pads, which feel like heaven for tired, puffy eyes), so you can tailor your session based on what your skin is craving that day. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951829.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Is Shark’s CryoGlow mask worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>At $350, it’s among the more affordable LED masks I’ve seen —  it’s still expensive but solidly less so than other popular ones on the market. (For comparison, <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/spectralite-faceware-pro-P435378?skuId=2109718&amp;icid2="">Dr. Dennis Gross’ version</a> retails for $455, <a href=""https://us.currentbody.com/products/currentbody-skin-led-light-therapy-mask?variant=41833057157217"">CurrentBody’s Series 2</a> is $470, and <a href=""https://www.revolve.com/therabody-theraface-mask/dp/TRAG-WU16/"">Therabody</a>’s is $650. Hollywood aesthetician <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/shani-darden-by-deesse-pro-led-light-mask-P502216"">Shani Darden</a> launched an LED mask that retails for a whopping $1900.) The full-face mask feels durable but is shockingly lightweight, making it among the most comfortable ones I’ve tried, too. </p>



<p>I first started testing this mask out as part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding skin prep</a>, and now that I’m six months post-wedding (and almost an entire year into testing this out), I have to say: It’s still one of the most effective steps in my entire beauty routine. My biggest skin goals right now are keeping acne flareups at bay, enhancing my overall glow, and reducing inflammation. In the past, I’ve struggled with consistency in using LED masks, so they didn’t do a whole lot for me. My consensus now is that they can be a great addition to your skincare routine — but only if you commit. (It’s like sunscreen, in that sense: The best one is the one you’ll use everyday.) </p>



<p>Another unexpected benefit of LED masks that I don’t think gets talked about enough has nothing to do with skin. After weeks of carving out time at the end of my day for some LED therapy, I realized that it had become something I genuinely looked forward to, just to get a few minutes of not doing anything else. Sure, sometimes I’d scroll through Instagram while sitting through an eight-minute treatment, but most days, I’d just lay on my couch cuddling my dog (he doesn’t mind one bit that I’m giving <em>Iron Man</em>), or even close my eyes for a little meditative moment. The fact that I have healthier, happier skin to show for it? Simply a (really good) bonus.</p>

<p>Rejoice! The last days of 2025 bring the onset of Capricorn season. On December 21st, the sun officially enters Capricorn and it’ll be a potent moment of contemplation, meditation, deliberation, and aspiration. The reason is that we are entering the coldest time of the year, as the Winter Solstice marks the beginning of a new season on the same day the sun enters Capricorn. The start of Yule connects us with friends and families to celebrate the past year and look forward to the future. At this juncture, we can start <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/manifest-goals-2025-zodiac-signs"">manifesting our dreams</a> by expressing our heartfelt intentions, which catapult us into the place and space we wish to be. </p>



<p>Since Capricorn energy is associated with working hard to make our desires come to fruition, we often put our best foot forward to seize the day at the office. Usually, we become rigid in our efforts to become the next CEO, get the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-flight-risk-job-promotion"">promotion we deserve</a>, or elevate our status. Capricorn energy climbs the corporate ladder with ease, skipping steps or resorting to manipulative tactics to win. Success is due to our tenacity in evolving and our desire for accolades. The goal of the month is to take charge and be a boss. Working hard is a must, but so too is playing hard. </p>



<p>With Capricorn season coinciding with a new year, we have hope and the incentive to start anew, recognizing that we can refine structure to improve situations and relationships. As a result of this thinking, we begin to discuss the concept of time and how much we can accomplish in the weeks ahead to leave a lasting legacy over the twelve months. It’s not that the vibe makes us competitive per se, it’s that we want to prove our power to the world to gain accolades and respect from those we care about. Building an empire and committing to projects that speak to our spirit define our lives — so grab your inner sea goat by the horns! </p>



<p>Capricorn is one of the most sensitive signs of the zodiac. They are the watery part of the Earth because they reside in both the ocean and on land. The sea goat has a very tender heart and will go to bat for anyone in their inner circle. They have an austere reputation due to their no-nonsense and mature attitude. Capricorn energy can be highly intuitive because it helps us align more closely with our gut feelings. In the weeks ahead, we will be able to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">trust our opinions and instincts</a>, knowing that we are choosing the right path for ourselves, even when we are torn between options. After a moment of reflection, we will be able to find guidance within.</p>



<p>This year, Capricorn season brings us face-to-face with our last chance to learn from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/saturn-retrograde-in-aries-and-pisces-horoscope-july-2025-meaning-effects"">Saturn in Pisces</a>. The karmic planet is going to be changing signs during Aquarius season, which is coming up, so we need to wrap up the story that we’ve been perpetuating over the past three years. Being that Saturn is the planetary ruler of Capricorn, it’s for us to see how we’ve grown since March 2023. When Saturn leaves Pisces for the next 27 years on February 13th, 2026, it will bring a major vibe shift. Consider how we can cultivate our spirituality, establish firmer boundaries with others, and commit to what we genuinely love. </p>



<p>The overall energy is quieter than in previous years, allowing us to heal and relax. Finding peace and solace in our hearts and lives will allow us to find serenity. It would be great to have a calm entrance into the new year, so we can take the proper steps to propel our passions forward. </p>

<p>Of all the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charlotte-tilbury-makeup-skincare-review"">makeup brands</a> — and there are far too many to count — only one consistently dominates beauty editor conversations. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">Enter: Merit.</a></p>



<p>If one of us has impossibly <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"">dewy skin</a>, plumper lips, or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-lash-curl-finisher-review"">longer lashes</a> than usual, the question is always the same: Is it Merit? I even know one editor who insisted her makeup artist use entirely Merit products on her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice"">wedding day</a>, and for good reason. It’s one of the few brands that makes makeup look like it’s simply part of you — like you’re wearing it, not the other way around. </p>



<p>Think of the brand as a step above <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-makeup-trends-2025"">no-makeup makeup</a>. It keeps things natural with sheer textures and effortless sticks, yet everything can be layered for a bolder, more striking look. But with both editors and TikTok beauty enthusiasts singing its praises, which Merit products are actually worth your money? </p>



<p>I put $380 of Merit makeup and skincare to the test, and here’s my honest verdict.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-uniform-spf-45"">Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 45</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951651.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>In May, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf-50-review"">best tinted sunscreen</a> I’d ever tried, and months later, I still stand by that. In fact, I’ve been using it ever since I discovered it. Unlike others, which can feel thick or chalky, this goes on and absorbs like a lightweight moisturizer, with medium coverage that’s enough to conceal my breakouts and dark circles. The finish sits somewhere between matte and dewy. Most tinted sunscreens fade after a few hours, but not this one. Its staying power is impressive for something so featherlight, and it always feels comfortable. That said, I don’t rely on it for sunscreen alone — I always layer it over a dedicated SPF.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-minimalist"">Merit The Minimalist Perfecting Complexion Stick</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951789.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>I’ll be honest: I didn’t think I’d enjoy using this, but it’s quickly become my go-to concealer. As someone with acne-prone skin, I’ve always been told to avoid creamy stick products because they often contain pore-clogging waxes. While this does have some waxes on the ingredient list, it remarkably doesn’t break me out. I usually use it to spot-conceal, tapping it in with my fingers, and I’m always impressed by the coverage and how well it tucks away redness. When I’m feeling too lazy for “proper” makeup, I scribble it all over my face and blend with a dense, fluffy brush. The result feels like a light tint with the pigment of a foundation, but it always looks like my skin, and never like a mask.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fflush-balm"">Merit Flush Balm Cheek Color</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11951684.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>I’ll admit I wasn’t a big fan of Flush Balm the first time I tried it — but that was because I had the completely wrong shade. My advice: go slightly darker than you think. Since the product is pretty sheer, it needs to be built up if you want a bolder blush look. Here, I’m wearing Le Bon Bon, a stunning fuchsia pink, and I’m starting to think I’ll never go back to the other blushes in my makeup bag. It gives my cheeks the most natural, just-come-in-from-the-cold flush. My partner even noticed and complimented my makeup. Thanks to the creamy texture, it doesn’t last quite as long as I’d like, but a quick layer of translucent powder fixes that. If you don’t want to swipe it directly onto your foundation (I hate transfer!), tap a dense brush over the dome of the product and apply it that way.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbronze-balm%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3Dbronz%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"">Merit Bronze Balm Sheer Bronzer</a></h2>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how effortlessly this glided onto my skin and how quickly it blended — the texture is that silky. Sometimes foundation can flatten my features, but this product brings depth back in. I use it in the hollows of my cheeks to define my bone structure, down the center of my nose, and across my temples for a sun-kissed glow, and even on my eyelids as a natural-looking eyeshadow. It layers beautifully under Flush Balm, though if you want it to last all day, a setting powder is a must.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fday-glow"">Merit Day Glow Highlighting Balm</a></h2>

<p>I usually skip highlighter, but the marbled look of this domed stick was so mesmerizing, I had to try it — and I’m glad I did. It literally looks and feels like dewy skincare, thanks to moisturizing squalane and skin-healing vitamins and amino acids. It contains ultra-fine pearl pigments but never looks dusty or glittery. Instead, it gives a gorgeous, natural gloss that only improves as your skin’s oils blend with it throughout the day. Here, I applied some in the inner corners of my eyes, and I’m convinced it makes me appear more awake. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsolo-shadow"">Merit Solo Shadow</a></h2>

<p>Ok, this is my new favorite eyeshadow. I can never be bothered with two or three shades, and smoky eyes are absolutely not my skill set, but a single wash of color can take my makeup from meh to next level, tying together blush, bronzer, and lips in perfect harmony. Here, I’m wearing Studio, which the brand calls a “cool taupe.” It leans slightly bronze without any orange, so it looks like it belongs on my eyes. The best part, though, is how effortlessly it applies. You could use your finger, but I go with a fluffy brush — the blend is seamless, and it takes just 10 seconds to create this look. Even better? It lasts much longer than other cream eyeshadows I’ve tried, and because it dries down to a soft powder, it barely creases.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrow-1990"">Merit Brow 1990 Sheer Gel Pencil</a></h2>

<p>I wasn’t sure how I’d get this pencil through my thick brows — it’s that fine — but it’s exactly what I needed. Using it actually made me realize how bad the pencil I was using before really was. Because it’s so precise, you can fill in the gaps, mimicking the finest, softest brow hairs without anything looking blocky. The spoolie on the end lets you feather it out if you go a little heavy. Just don’t press too hard, or you’ll snap the nib in half and lose it down the sink.</p>

<p>Brow pomades are usually too wet and messy, but this one is just right. My brows are naturally quite dark, but this adds the perfect finishing touch after the pencil, locking my thick hairs in place without making them feel stiff or greasy like others. On lazy days, I’ll just run the brush through, and it instantly gives my brows more volume. I also love that the tapered brush lets you define the inner and outer corners without any smudging.</p>

<p>Because this lip liner is so sheer, it doesn’t stick around for very long. That said, it’s so moisturizing that reapplying is easy. Sometimes I don’t even bother looking in the mirror; I just scribble it on and smudge it out with my fingers. My lips are chronically dry, and most liners only make that worse, but this one glides on beautifully, thanks to the jojoba oil. Most days, I use this as my lipstick, enlisting a fluffy brush to blend it out and blur the edges. </p>

<p>To me, this feels more like a tinted lip balm than a true lipstick — the name says it all, I guess! It glides on easily, giving a satin-like veil of color that feels moisturizing, thanks to squalane and sunflower seed oil. It only lasts a couple of hours on me, but because it’s so soft and lightweight, I just swipe it on like a balm. Here I’m wearing Slip, though I tend to prefer the pinker shades on my olive skin. I also wish the packaging felt a bit more luxe. </p>

<p>This mascara takes a bit of work — three to four coats in my experience — but the result is the most naturally fluttery lashes. It has an old-school bristle brush that requires slow, deliberate combing to build up layers, rather than a silicone brush that deposits product instantly. That actually worked in my favor, because it didn’t leave any clumps. Instead, my lashes looked long and fluffy, almost like falsies. The best part is that it’s a tubing mascara that comes off with just warm water. Tubing formulas are also less likely to smudge or flake, and this one never does. I’m already on my third tube.</p>

<p>Most lip oils I’ve tried feel like a lip gloss in disguise, but this one is different. It isn’t sticky at all, so you don’t have to worry about it trapping hair when you step outside. Quinoa seed oil is the star ingredient, acting like skincare for your lips by deeply moisturizing and supporting the skin barrier — the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out. The tint is subtle but lovely, and I like layering it over lipstick for a soft, glossy boost. Because it’s an oil rather than a gloss, it sinks in fairly quickly, so to pop in your purse for touch-ups.</p>

<p>This is such a quenching moisturizer, and even though it’s designed to prime skin for makeup, I often wear it on its own for a glow boost. Moisturizing glycerin and hydrating hyaluronic acid are the stars, while skin-strengthening peptides support healing, and collagen and elastin help keep skin supple. It doesn’t contain any reflective pigments, but you wouldn’t guess that, considering the natural dew it gives dry skin. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s much less likely to clog pores or cause breakouts. When I use this, my makeup lasts noticeably longer than it does over other moisturizers. </p>

<p>I’ve wanted <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perms-in-style-trend-types"">a perm</a> for years now, but with the amount of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/igk-antisocial-midnight-silk-mask-review"">damage my hair</a> went through with multiple bleaching sessions (I had a pastel pink phase), I had to wait until I had a full head of virgin hair. When I told one of my best friends I was finally about to get a Korean digital perm, she was horrified and said I would probably regret it. Look, I get it. The perm is controversial. You probably instantly think of giant fluffy ’80s hairdos or tight ringlets. But unlike traditional perms, the Korean style uses heat technology to create softer curls, which appear more natural. </p>



<p>My hair is naturally straight with a slight wave that becomes more obvious the shorter it is. I also have incredibly thick and heavy lengths, so when I use a curling iron, I have to douse my hair in hairspray to ensure the curls don’t fall out. As somebody who’s always wanted curly hair, getting a Korean digital perm was an easy decision. Both my older brother and sister have perms, so I was confident going in. I went to my hairstylist Chloe Choi at <a href=""https://www.chloehair.com.au/"">Chloe Hair &amp; Beauty</a>, but Korean perms are becoming more popular in salons worldwide. Together, we discussed what could be done while looking at some photos I’d brought along for inspiration. She confirmed that my hair type is frizzy with a slight natural wave, and we settled on a direct digital perm to create some tighter curls. </p>

<p>There are a handful of benefits to a Korean perm: “Normal perms mean sometimes you can’t see definition in the curls, but with digital perms you can,” said Choi, who used to work at a salon in Myeong-dong, South Korea, before moving to Sydney. Before we started with my perm, Choi recommended starting with a Japanese Tokio Treatment, which helps repair hair from the inside out. By replenishing it with keratin, it strengthens, moisturizes, and smooths each hair strand. “A lot of people really like this brand,” Choi explained. “It’s a repairing treatment, and it adds moisture to your hair. Some people will come back after their perms get dry and then have another Tokio Treatment,” she told me.</p>



<h2>What is a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947860.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11947861.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Choi started by washing my hair and applying the Tokio Treatment, before setting up an additional hot steam treatment to help hydrate each strand of hair. The steam “opens” up the hair cuticle, allowing moisture and products to absorb. After getting a small trim where Choi enhanced my layers, my hair was rewashed with a pH-balancing shampoo. She then followed this with a Korean product that protects the hair from the typically harsh perming chemicals used to break and reset the protein bonds in the hair. It’s this which results in a curl or wave. </p>



<p>Next, Choi placed the digital perm lotion directly onto my hair and rolled sections tightly into curlers to take shape, then plugged each curler in, allowing them to be set by heat. Choi told me that my hair was “strong”, so we had to wait over 20 minutes before it started to set. Then we headed back to the basin where my hair was washed with a neutralizer, snapping the protein bonds back into place. Et voilà! I was now a member of the curly hair club.</p>



<h2>How do you style a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>To style my hair, Choi gave me a slight side part, which created a more voluminous look from the scalp. She added some curl cream to define the waves and recommended investing in some good products. Her top tip? “If you have frizzy hair and you want to style it while it’s dry, mix curl cream with a little bit of water in your palms before using it on your hair,” she said. “This helps get rid of the frizz and also hydrates it.”</p>



<p>Styling a digital perm at home isn’t too difficult, either. I have a sensitive scalp, so I’ve purchased some sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfate-free products will also prolong the perm’s results. I wash my hair with lukewarm water in the shower before scrunching up the curls with a microfiber towel. Next, I add curl cream to define my curls and continue to scrunch them upwards, before using my <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.laifentech.com%2Fproducts%2Flaifen-se-2-high-speed-hair-dryer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Laifen Hair Dryer</a> (a Dyson dupe) with a diffuser to blow-dry the perm in place. </p>

<h2>How long do you have to wait after a Korean perm to wash your hair?</h2>



<p>Your stylist will let you know how long you should go without washing your perm à la <em>Legally Blonde</em>. For me, I had to wait a minimum of 48 hours before washing my hair after getting my digital perm.</p>



<h2>Can a Korean digital perm cause damage to your hair?</h2>



<p>A digital perm uses chemicals that alter your hair structure and heat to set it in place, so most hairstylists recommend doing it on virgin hair. They also recommend steering clear of perms if your hair is bleached, chemically straightened, or very fine. Bleach in particular weakens the hair by breaking its bonds, which means perm solutions don’t interact well with it. Ultimately, the hair often lacks the strength to hold a set shape, making the process more likely to fail.</p>



<h2>How do you take care of your Korean perm?</h2>



<p>Getting a perm might increase frizz if your hair is prone to it. This is because when the chemical process weakens the hair, it also lifts the cuticle. I’d recommend investing in a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fslip-pure-silk-pillowcase%2F4186794%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopqmzmVbIIqoypAqEzT6eEntgnIoFgt2xwHEu4gn-JL76f3n-bF"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk pillowcase</a> or a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fwomens-mulberry-silk-bonnet-with-long-ribbons%2F8701502%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">silk bonnet</a> to help keep the frizz to a minimum. Also try a moisturizing leave-in hair product like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fk18-hair-molecular-repair-hair-oil-P505266"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil</a>, which contains peptides, avocado oil, and squalane to help smooth and repair the broken bonds that lead to frizz. </p>



<h2>How do you ask for a Korean digital perm?</h2>



<p>Doing your research and choosing a properly qualified expert is key. I would also recommend bringing reference photos so your stylist can see which kind of curl you are after. It’s also important to discuss your hair health and type, and whether a perm will cause extra frizz or breakage for you. </p>



<p>I can safely say that having a digital perm has led to more conversations about my hair than I’ve had in years — and it looks <em>much</em> healthier than my pastel pink or purple-silver combo. I’m able to wake up with voluminous hair ready to go, and if I need to style it a little bit, I can just use some curl cream, which also helps hydrate my hair. It’s less maintenance than colored hair, so I’m convinced I’m a perm girl for life. </p>

Season-less, versatile, and always pulling their weight, they work just as well with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/abercrombie-fitch-fall-sale"">jeans</a> as they do with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fall-wedding-guest-dresses"">wedding guest dresses</a> (and they especially make for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">thoughtful holiday gifts</a>). Whether you’re into dainty huggies or chunky tubes and other <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/heart-shaped-earrings"">statement styles</a>, there’s a gold hoop for every mood.<br /><br />Some outfits call for the barely-there charm of petite hoops that hug the lobe, while others practically demand extra-large, look-at-me designs. Of course, nothing beats the classics: 14-karat yellow gold and white gold hoops — especially when they’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tarnish-free-gold-jewelry"">tarnish-free</a> — because they’re as reliable as your favorite white T-shirt. <br /><br />Ahead, we’ve rounded up the best gold hoops in every trending category.

<h2>14K Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940584.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The perfect blend of luxury and wearability, true 14k gold hoops are an investment that deliver timeless sophistication. Whether you choose Mejuri’s sleek pair, Kinn’s lightweight everyday option, or Angara’s unique square hoop shape, these are your forever earrings — versatile for coffee runs <em>and</em> soirées alike.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Huggies &amp; Small Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940585.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Small gold hoops may be subtle, but these pint-sized pieces bring just the right touch of shine to any look. Huggies also, well, hug your lobes just right, offering maximum comfort while still adding a polished touch to your outfit. Given their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-petite-workwear-ann-taylor"">petite size</a>, you can easily stack them to climb your ear or wear them solo. From twisted tubes to diamond accents, there’s a huggie for every sartorial vibe.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>White Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940586.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If all the viral <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/teddy-blonde-hair-color-trend"">color analysis videos</a> have convinced you that you’re more of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/silver-nails-manicure-trend-ideas"">silver gal</a> (but you still want the luxe durability that gold provides), white gold is the cool-toned twist you need to own. Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940587.png?width=960&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=15%3A16"" /></figure>



<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette. Either way, they effortlessly elevate everything from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-street-style"">minimalist outfits</a> to<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cardigan-sweaters""> cozy cardigans</a>. And sure, bigger can certainly be better, but that doesn’t always mean more expensive — these styles all come in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/free-people-under-100-gifts"">under $150</a>.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Large Gold Hoop Earrings </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940588.png?width=818&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=409%3A512"" /></figure>



<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<em>This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-art-of-giving"">here</a>.</em><br /><br />‘Tis the season for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">holiday parties</a>, and we’ll be remiss if you show up to these celebrations empty handed. It’s also time for visiting family (and perhaps over-staying your welcome) so it’s thoughtful to offer up some goodies as a “thank you.” Or maybe you have someone on your shopping list who just moved into a new place (or is the self-proclaimed homebody of your friend group). In any of these cases, we’ve curated a list of host and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-housewarming-gifts"">housewarming gifts</a> that’ll elevate your giftee’s spaces.<br /><br />Depending on your budget (and how generous you’re feeling this holiday season), this guide features a range of products between $20 and $200 for white elephant exchanges and holiday soirées. For homebodies, consider luxe Quince robes, artsy Piecework puzzles, and eclectic Fellow tea kettles. For the new resident, opt for a smart Hatch alarm clock, viral Anthropologie glassware, and money plants. And for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hosting-friends-at-home-socializing"">holiday party host</a>, you can cart up sweet treats, unsuspecting board games, non-alcoholic drinks. <br /><br />And maybe it’s no surprise that a majority of these gifts deal with gathering around the table — from Le Creuset mini cocottes and Lenox cream and sugar sets to Caraway bar accessories and BonBon candy boxes — because food is universally the way to the heart.<br /><br />Be sure to also check out our related gift guides, like for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-luxury-gifts-under-50"">luxury gifts under $50</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gifts-for-woman-who-wants-nothing"">for the woman who wants nothing</a>, for suggestions on more home décor and cooking gifts) Just get to shopping, because most retailers' shipping cutoffs are <strong>December 18</strong> for Christmas arrivals.<br /><br /><em>All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
