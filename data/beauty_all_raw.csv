<p>As someone who grew up <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/misogyny-towards-fandoms-fangirls"">in fandom,</a> the <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/6-netflix-tv-movies-january"">People We Meet On Vacation</a></em> screenwriter Yulin Kuang knows the importance of a good <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/book-to-tv-movies-adaptations-2026"">book-to-screen adaptation</a> more than most. As a teen, she would journal pages of angst about how upcoming adaptations needed to be faithful, lest they “ruin her whole childhood.” As she’s become more successful in her career as a screenwriter and director (Kuang is currently adapting and directing Emily Henry’s <em>Beach Read</em>), she’s come to realize that the best adaptations can’t be a direct copy of the book. So yes, the <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em> movie is different from Emily Henry’s novel  — in a satisfying way.</p>



<p>“I schemed my way into a position of power and influence over my favourite books so that I could rectify and do justice to all [of them]. And I think early on in my career, I was very fixated on trying to keep things as close to the book as possible,” Kuang tells <em>Refinery29</em>. “But the reality that I’ve kind of learned over the period of time is that you can’t actually just film a novel. They’re very different things. They’re very different mediums. And so to me, the task of the adaptation is not to be 100% faithful to the book.”</p>



<p>This means die-hard book fans won’t see every single scene from the Emily Henry novel play out on screen, but while some have been removed, fresh new scenes have been introduced. Kuang says there are book scenes she would have loved to include, but it’s impossible to fit everything into the script. And even if she writes the scenes, they don’t always make it through the final edit. “They end up on the cutting room floor for whatever reason, and each one of those is a small tragedy for the book purist who resides deep within my heart,” she jokes. “But I think we also brought in a lot of things that I hope people will love too.” </p>

<p>There’s one particular scene near the start of the film which book fans won’t recognize, and it came about after the writers received feedback from Netflix. “I was really excited about that [new scene], because it felt like getting to construct Poppy (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emily_bader/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emily Bader</a>) and Alex (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tomblyth/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Blyth</a>) fanfic,” she says. “There’s definitely stuff that [book purists will] miss, because I miss it, but there’s also stuff that I hope will bring joy and delight as well.”</p>







<p>Kuang is one of Henry’s close collaborators, and while she can’t tease too much about the upcoming <em>Beach Read</em> movie (they’re currently casting, and she just had a VFX meeting), she says their working relationship was “a dream” from the start. Henry has been generous with her energy, time and thoughts, allowing Kuang to connect with the source material on a deep level. “[She would] provide me with these character maps of the characters that were always very helpful about, what’s driving them? What’s the fear?” she says. “She was so trusting, which I think, looking back now, that was such a gift.”</p>



<p>Kuang is reluctant to confirm whether book purists will embrace <em>People We Meet On Vacation</em>, and quickly knocks on wood. “I hope they do, but you can never be too prescriptive,” she says. “I <em>can </em>say this. This film by everybody, by Emily, by Brett Haley, our director, by me and the other writers, Amos and Nunzio, it was all done with so much love and care and respect for this source material… it has to stand as a work on its own that hopefully feels like a love letter to the book.”</p>

<p>Isa Briones is best known for her standout performances in the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">medical drama </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/09/11936018/the-pitt-season-2-characters-storyline-release-date"">The Pitt</a></em> and as a series regular in <em><a href=""https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/star-trek-picard/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Star Trek: Picard</a></em>. Yet, what defines her just as much as her screen presence is her fierce advocacy for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanned-skin-south-asian-beauty-standards-sunscreen-myth"">Asian community</a>, a commitment that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lions-gate-portal-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">manifests</a> not only in the nuanced characters she chooses to play, but in her vocal stance against the rise of <a href=""https://www.amny.com/news/asian-american-figures-launch-video-campaign-as-part-of-stopasianhate-national-day-of-action-and-healing/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hate crimes against Asian Americans</a>. </p>



<p>In the critically acclaimed HBO series <em>The Pitt</em>, Isa Briones plays Dr. Trinity Santos, a character with a name that, much like Briones’ own, carries the weight and pride of a heritage often left in the periphery of mainstream television. For Briones, the role isn’t just another credit; it’s a long-overdue correction to the medical drama genre.</p>



<p>“I find it so strange that up until now there has not really been a lot of Filipino representation in medical shows,” Briones tells <em>Refinery29. </em>It’s a gap in the narrative that feels particularly glaring when you look at the reality of the healthcare system. “It’s insane because Filipinos make up one of the biggest populations of medical professionals in this country.”</p>



<p>For Briones, the importance of this visibility hit home during the very first moments of the series. “It was really exciting once I learned that there were two Filipino nurses,” she reflects. “In the first five minutes of episode one, they’re speaking Tagalog. It brought me to tears the first time I saw it.”</p>



<p>That emotional connection to the script wasn’t accidental, it started through Briones’ own advocacy. When she was first cast, the production knew they wanted an Asian doctor, but the specifics of her heritage were still unknown. When she saw the initial name assigned to her character, she knew it didn’t fit.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I saw it as a chance to represent my heritage along with Filipino people in healthcare in a small way by changing [Dr. Santos’s] name.</p><cite>Isa Briones</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>That “small” change resulted in Dr. Trinity Santos, a name that resonates with the Filipino community. “Even though it’s small, it’s still impactful,” Briones explains. “I’ve talked to a lot of Filipino nurses and doctors who are just like, ‘Yeah, we never see ourselves even though we are such a big part of this community.’ It feels very cathartic to be represented and to see the beauty of it.”</p>







<p>Briones was also determined to showcase the joy and the specialised competence of her community, from the high-stakes life-saving to the quiet, cultural textures of the workplace.<br /><br />“We have the funny scenes of the nurses having their gossip time, but also seeing just competent Filipino doctors and nurses is really important,” she says.”A lot of the Filipino nurses that are here in this country are doctors back home. Getting to show that experience is really beautiful.”<br /><br />Since its debut, <em>The Pitt</em> has carved out a space as a raw, unfiltered, and deeply real look at the American healthcare system. Season 1 didn’t just show us the hospital; it threw us into the deep end of a high-stakes, 15-hour shift. We watched as the staff’s resilience was pushed to a breaking point in an intense finale that left us in absolute shock. </p>



<p>“The stakes feel so much higher this time,” Briones notes, leaning into the shift for the newest season. “Because the world is already established, we’re hitting the ground running. Everything feels way more personal.”</p>



<p>What we do know is that Season 2 is doubling down on the grit, with even more gore and high-octane drama than before. Picking up ten months after the finale, the story unfolds over a chaotic Fourth of July weekend proving that in this hospital, there’s no such thing as a holiday.</p>



<p>“I think you’re going to see some cracks in the armour for Santos,” Isa explains. “It’s an actor’s dream to play someone that the audience loves to hate, but this season we get to see what’s underneath that defence mechanism. I just want people to feel something viscerally.”<br /><br /><strong><em>Season 2 of The Pitt premieres on January 8th on HBO MAX </em></strong></p>

<p>Just in time for the cozy, chilly months, NYX launched a cool brown beauty staple: its Suede Matte Lip Liner in <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Flip%2Flip-liner%2Fsuede-matte-lip-liner%2FNYX_355.html%3Fdwvar_NYX__355_color%3DOG-Brew&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fnyx-og-brew-paloma-sanchez-collaboration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">OG Brew</a>. If it sounds familiar, it’s because the new lip liner is a reimagining of its original formula for the consumer-favorite <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyxcosmetics.com%2Flip%2Flip-liner%2Fsuede-matte-lip-liner%2FNYX_355.html%3Fdwvar_NYX__355_color%3DCold%2520Brew&amp;sref=refinery29.com%2Fnyx-og-brew-paloma-sanchez-collaboration"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cold Brew</a>. So when OG Brew hit shelves on January 3, it sold out in five hours. And fans of the beauty essential have one particular person to thank for its return: <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@whor3chata_?lang=en"">Paloma Sanchez</a>.</p>



<p>Since September 2024, the beauty content creator has been grieving the loss of her favorite lip liner. At the time, she, like countless consumers, took to TikTok to share that something was up with the cosmetic staple. Cold Brew’s formula update shifted the color tone and texture of the original cool-brown color and creamy finish. And the Mexican creator hilariously (and very seriously) never got over the switch-up. For more than a year, she <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@whor3chata_/video/7430624151150365994"">lamented the formula change</a>, testing hundreds of luxury and drug-store lip liners in an attempt to replace her beloved original Cold Brew, but she never quite found any product that matched it.</p>



<p>“When I set out to find my ideal lip liner, I discovered Cold Brew and it immediately stood out. I loved how it looked on my complexion and how effortlessly it worked with so many different lip products. It was also affordable without sacrificing performance, which made it even more special,” Sanchez tells Refinery29 Somos. “Cold Brew was genuinely one of the only lip liners I used, so when I repurchased it, I immediately knew something had changed.”</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953806.png?width=1024&amp;height=716&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A179"" /></figure></div>



<p>Sanchez noticed that the texture of the lip liner was drier and the shade had a tint of warm orange. So she did what 20-somethings are increasingly doing when a product doesn’t quite meet their expectations: she shared her thoughts online. Except, she had an audience of hundreds of thousands — and many of them felt the same. </p>



<p>“I made the video out of pure sadness and frustration after realizing a product I truly loved had changed so drastically,” she says. “As someone who is very passionate about product development, I had a genuine curiosity about why such a staple, affordable product would be altered in such a way.”</p>



<p>Her first video, Part 1 of now 28 attempts of finding a dupe of NYX’s Cold Brew, went up on TikTok on September 28, 2024 and has more than 190,800 likes and hundreds of comments from folks who echoed her calls for NYX to bring back the original formula. </p>



<p>“I did not expect the reaction it received. I was simply sharing an honest emotional response, and it clearly resonated with people,” Sanchez says.</p>



<p>The humorous episodic videos eventually got the attention of Tracy Allen, NYX Professional Makeup’s Director of Global Product Development. “We always strive to bring you the very best,” Allen tells Somos. “Sometimes, our products need a little update, whether it’s because certain ingredients are banned or discontinued, or we’ve moved to a new manufacturing home. While we aim for perfection, unfortunately, these updates can occasionally lead to slight variations in shade or texture.” </p>



<p>But as Sanchez’s dupe-search videos went viral, Allen’s team noticed that not everyone was a fan of some of the changes, and they tuned in to Sanchez’s year-long series to hear what she and her audience missed about the original lip liner. A year later, in 2025, Allen and her team invited Sanchez to work with them on a new product launch: the OG Brew. Sanchez headed to the NYX Professional Makeup headquarters in El Segundo, California, with the tiny remains of her original Cold Brew lip liner and worked with product developers to carefully test and assess various swatches until landing on a shade she loved. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953803.png?width=796&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=199%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<p>That lip liner, OG Cold Brew, is out now, and if you ask the girls on TikTok, Sanchez and NYX delivered. “NYX Cold Brew is so back,” one creator said. “Everyone, let’s go say thank you to Paloma,” another added.</p>



<p>The collaboration is the latest in a growing trend of brands responding to creator feedback on specific beauty formulas. In May of 2025, Beauty Crop Cosmetics teamed up with creator <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@itsurgrlaisha_?lang=en"">Aisha Asunramu</a> to co-design a lip kit after the latter voiced a need for shades tailored to deeper tones. Later that year, Tower 28 worked with TikToker <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@bonitravo?lang=en"">Toni Bravo</a> to co-create two high-pigment powder blush shades after the creator also stressed the need for shades for people with deeper skin tones.</p>



<p>It’s clear that beauty brands don’t just hear social media feedback, some of them also listen, even inviting everyday experts (the consumers!) into their headquarters to create products their shoppers actually want.</p>



<p>“We love our community. At NYX, your voice truly matters to us, which is why we are constantly referencing your social media content and reviews throughout our development process to create products you’ll love,” Allen tells Somos. “When Paloma called out a visible discrepancy in her favorite shade, we jumped at the chance to listen to her feedback and make things right.”</p>



<p>And now, beauty lovers can shop both NYX’s OG Brew and Cold Brew lip liners.</p>

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping.

Applying it feels like instant relief, thanks to a trifecta of moisturizing, hydrating ingredients. First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out. I must be on my fifth tub by now. <br /><br /><strong>The Inkey List</strong> Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1918"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953779.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1534&amp;height=1918&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=767:959"" width=""1534"" /><figcaption><h2>U Beauty The Super Hydrator<br /></h2> <br />If you’re going to invest in a high-end moisturizer, make it this one. In winter, cleansing my skin can leave it feeling so tight and rough it’s as though it might crack, but when I use this consistently, that never happens. U Beauty promises hydration for up to 48 hours, and it’s all down to five sizes of hyaluronic acid molecules that hydrate every layer of the skin. It doesn’t stop there, though. Skin-strengthening peptides and smoothing shea butter support repair and deliver deep moisturization. Two pumps is enough to cover the entire face, and while it takes a moment to absorb, the glow is truly unrivaled. <br /><br /><strong>U Beauty</strong> The SUPER Hydrator, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fubeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fthe-super-hydrator%3Fvariant%3D32599731994724"">U Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1426"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953785.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1426&amp;height=1426&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1426"" /><figcaption><h2>First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair® Cream Intense Hydration <br /></h2><br />For very dry skin, it has to be First Aid’s Ultra Repair Cream.

Beneath the simple packaging, it feels and performs just like a high-end moisturizer. I’d expect nothing less — it’s Korean, after all. This cream cocoons dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin with ceramides, which act like scaffolding to reinforce the skin barrier without leaving a greasy residue.

It’s more of a lotion than a thick cream, but don’t underestimate it. A blend of hydrating hyaluronic acid, antioxidant-rich grape water, and soothing chamomile extract is complemented by nourishing glycerin and shea butter. Even though it’s packed with all the goof stuff, I find it sinks in quickly, leaving behind a hint of dew. Even better, it’s non-comedogenic, so it’s unlikely to clog pores. <br /><br /><strong>Caudalie</strong> VinoHydra Sorbet Cream Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcaudalie-vinohydra-sorbet-cream-moisturizer-with-hyaluronic-acid-P472454%3F"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953792.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>Vichy Minéral 89 100H Rich Cream Fragrance-Free<br /></h2><br />I’ve lost count of how many dermatologists have told me they rely on this cream; it’s often one of the first they mention when I ask for recommendations for dry skin. It sits in a comfortable space between a lightweight lotion and a rich face mask, spreading easily and quenching skin instantly.

(That’s not a riddle — it’s just this cream.) Beauty director Jacqueline — who has acne-prone skin — always has a tub of this on hand for sub-zero temperatures. “It’s the only thing that quenches my parched skin without triggering breakouts.

It makes my skin gleam without appearing oily.” <br /><br /><strong>Tatcha</strong> Chilli Oil on Everything 250ml Pourer Jar, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fdewy-skin-cream-replenishing-and-plumping-moisturizer%2FCA06310T.html%3F"">Tatcha</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1080"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953315.png?auto=webp&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1080&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1080"" /><figcaption><h2>BeautyStat Universal Pro-Bio Moisture Boost Cream</h2><br />This cushiony cream from cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson's beloved brand, BeautyStat, is perfect for sensitive skin types since it has biofermented reishi mushroom extract and a ceramide-powered complex to deliver soothing moisture that lasts. <br /><br /><strong>BeautyStat Cosmetics</strong> Probiotic 24HR Moisture Boost Cream Moisturizer, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fprobiotic-24hr-moisture-boost-cream-moisturizer-pimprod2030151%3Fsku%3D2594546"">Ulta Beauty</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?

<p>Until a few weeks ago, I was faithfully using a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">prescription retinoid</a> recommended by a trusted dermatologist — and my skin had never looked worse. My first mistake was assuming that, having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glow-recipe-blackberry-retinol-blemish-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">used retinol before</a>, I wouldn’t experience the harsh side effects of a stronger formula. But when my skin wouldn’t stop peeling, my breakouts got worse, and I was almost out of the tube, I knew something was off. So when The Inkey List’s new <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fadvanced-retinol-us-P520381%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> landed on my desk, promising a fast yet gentle experience for retinoid users, I knew I had to give it a try. </p>



<h2>What is The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2% Retinal, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Without getting all lab-coat on you (and before I get into the nitty gritty), it helps to know the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">difference between retin<em>al</em> </a>— the star ingredient in The Inkey List’s new serum — and retin<em>ol</em>. Both are members of the retinoid family, but they work a little differently.  </p>



<p>Esthetician <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alicia.lartey/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alicia Lartey</a> previously explained to R29 that when retinol is applied to the skin, it <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">goes through several steps</a> before being converted into retinoic acid, which triggers all the amazing skin benefits, like improving texture and tone, minimizing fine lines by boosting collagen production, and reducing breakouts by renewing skin cells. Retinal, on the other hand, requires fewer steps to become retinoic acid, so it works faster — 11 times faster, according to The Inkey List. It’s the retinal that gives this serum its striking yellow color, but don’t worry — it hasn’t gone bad, and though it’s a little reminiscent of a turmeric face mask, it absorbs instantly and won’t stain your skin. I can vouch for that.  </p>

<h2>What makes The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal special? </h2>



<p>Even better, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s retinal</a> is encapsulated, meaning it’s wrapped in tiny moisturizing molecules that release it gradually into the skin. This way, you get all the benefits of a high-powered ingredient with far less irritation — no soreness or painfully dry, flaky patches here.  </p>



<p>Just when I thought this product couldn’t get any smarter, it also features 1% symsitive, a soothing ingredient that supports the skin barrier (the outer layer that keeps moisture in and bacteria out). This is a relief, as retinoids can easily damage the skin barrier if used incorrectly or too often. Plus, there’s 2% sirtalice, an algae-derived ingredient that helps firm the skin in minutes, making it appear juicy and plump.  </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>What to know about The Inkey List’s 0.2% Advanced Retinal serum</h3>



<p>— Features 0.2% encapsulated retinal, a high-strength ingredient that works faster than retinol with minimal irritation. </p>



<p>— Targets dark spots, rough skin texture, fine lines, and breakouts. </p>



<p>— Designed for evening use: two to three times a week at first. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>How do you use The Inkey List’s Advanced 0.2 Retinal, and is it worth it?  </h2>



<p>I’ve been using <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP520381"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Advanced 0.2% Retinal</a> for a few weeks now (a pea-sized amount three nights a week, right after cleansing and before a simple moisturizer), and my skin is already much happier. It’s clearer, bouncier, smoother in texture, and more even in tone, thanks to the retinal helping minimize the red marks left behind by breakouts. Here, I’m wearing a light touch of concealer and blush, and can comfortably skip foundation.</p>



<p>With my skin feeling less dry, the fine lines under my eyes and across my forehead have eased up, too. I even bring it down my neck to help zap the occasional hormonal zit. My neck is the first place to feel sensitive when I use retinoids because the skin is thinner here, but so far, I’ve not experienced any irritation. </p>



<p>It’s a lightweight serum, so you’ll want to make sure the moisturizer you apply on top in the evening is fairly simple and doesn’t contain high-strength actives like exfoliating acids. Good options include <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fsos-daily-skin-barrier-redness-recovery-moisturizer-P506470"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tower 28 SOS Daily Skin Barrier Redness Recovery Moisturizer</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ordinary-deciem-natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-P427414"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid</a>. I’m also a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-inkey-list-bio-active-ceramide-repairing-plumping-moisturizer-P509315"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s Bio-Active Ceramide Repairing and Plumping Moisturizer</a>. </p>





<p>My top tip for anyone using this serum is to continue using a high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen in the daytime because retinoids make skin more sensitive to sunlight. Yep, even in the fall and winter months. </p>



<p>You can always count on The Inkey List not to leave anyone out, and there’s good news for retinoid beginners, too. Alongside its buzzy new retinal, the brand has also unveiled a <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starter Retinol Serum</a>, just as affordable at $14. With 1% granactive retinoid (a gentler, also encapsulated form) and 0.01% retinal, it’s kinder on sensitive skin — even for those with rosacea — thanks to additional soothing ingredients like glycerin and symrelief 100 (made from chamomile and ginger root). While it’s pretty new, the five-star reviews speak for themselves. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tote-bags"">Tote bags</a> have cemented their status as a standout choice for work, and for good reason. The spacious style can carry so much, and, when designed for work, have extra compartments, pockets, pouches, and zippers to help organize your belongings. We’re partial to leather totes because of their chicness and longevity, but less expansive alternatives like nylon and polyester make a case for durability. Whether you opt for a boxy or bucket shape, any of these options will surely become your go-to work companion.  </p>

<p>If you really mean business, opt for a laptop bag with handy dividers, sleeves, and compartments. From totes to briefcases, these designs keep <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-designers-fashion-technology"">your tech</a> secure, your accessories perfectly organized, and your on-the-go style sharp. (Many are also available in multiple sizes to fit 13-inch or 16-inch laptops.)  </p>

<p>Looking to get a work bag that’ll last you many years to come? It may be worth investing in a luxe leather style from a designer brand. From Polène’s bestselling Cyme sculptural bag to Mansur Gavriel’s signature <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mansur-gavriel-candy-bag-review-promo-code-deal"">Candy hobo bag</a>, some iconic handbags prove they’re very versatile and can be worn from work to dinner. Seek out oversized styles, high-quality leather, and sturdy straps to ensure you’re getting the most bang for your buck.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-bags-belt-crossbody-tote-duffle"">Backpacks</a> are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Consider tried-and-true, water-repellant (and washable!) fabrics in streamlined designs or more sophisticated pebbled leather and quilted fabrics to upgrade your look. Features like adjustable shoulder straps, metal hardware, laptop sleeves, and water bottle pockets are the cherry on top of a commuter-friendly and work-appropriate backpack. </p>

<p>When it comes to business trips, bags with suitcase sleeves are a must. And these zippered options — from oversized totes to mini duffle bags — combine organized interiors with travel-smart features, like water-repellant fabrics and tons of compartments. Ideal for navigating terminals and heading straight to meetings, these travel work bags are the perfect blend of style and functionality. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953299.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve always heard that Singapore has one of the most beautiful airports in the world, but what no one told me is that I’d fall in love with everything else, too. From the food and architecture to the people and its overall vibe, Singapore completely <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/portugal-reminded-me-i-deserve-luxury"">exceeded my expectations</a>. When I landed, I was already plotting my return flight. Honestly, I’d go back tomorrow if I could. </p>



<p> But let’s start at the beginning. The most daunting part of my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-travel-pants"">journey was the flight</a>. Eighteen hours nonstop from New York is no joke. It’s the longest nonstop flight in the world. I was nervous, to say the least. But flying Singapore Airlines in business class changed everything. I slept like a baby. No exaggeration, this was the most comfortable I’ve ever been on a plane. The service was flawless, and the food menu felt more like dining at a restaurant than airline meals. If you’re making the trek, I highly recommend splurging on business class. Your body will thank you.</p>



<p>I was also worried about the weather. Singapore is known for its heat and humidity; and humidity and me do not mix. Thankfully, I packed light, breathable fabrics that didn’t betray me when the sweat arrived. Preparation is everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 1: First Impressions &amp; Instant Obsession</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953400.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>After a long but incredibly comfortable flight, we landed in Singapore and headed straight to <a href=""https://www.qthotels.com/singapore/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=gmb""><strong>QT Singapore</strong></a>. The hotel was gorgeously decorated for the holidays, modern, chic, and thoughtfully designed down to every last detail. After a much-needed nap, we kicked things off at <a href=""https://www.marinabaysands.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=GMB&amp;utm_campaign=hotel_info_main""><strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong></a>, which is a hotel, mall, restaurant hub, and convention center all in one. The scale alone is jaw-dropping.</p>



<p>Lunch felt like the right place to start, so we <a href=""https://www.jumboseafood.com.sg/en/home""><strong>went to Jumbo</strong></a>, famously known for its chili crab. We didn’t get to try that dish, but everything we ordered was still a hit. After some light shopping, we wrapped the evening with <a href=""https://www.marcys.sg/""><strong>dinner at Marcy’s</strong></a>, a popular Italian spot where the food was a solid 10/10. For drinks, we ended the night at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sagohouse.sg/?hl=en""><strong>Sago House</strong></a>, where hip-hop and R&amp;B played all night. I was genuinely surprised by how at home I felt.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 2: Tourist Mode (Happily) Activated</strong></h2>



<p>We leaned all the way into sightseeing, starting at <a href=""https://www.visitsingapore.com/neighbourhood/featured-neighbourhood/marina-bay/merlion-park/""><strong>Merlion Park </strong></a>for the iconic photo with the half-lion, half-fish statue. One of my favorite parts of traveling is doing things I’d never do at home. Times Square? Absolutely not. But in Singapore, even locals visit the landmarks and everything is spotless. (Fun fact: littering is illegal.)</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953344.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>Next up was Chinatown, which exists everywhere in the world and still manages to feel special in every city. It was the perfect place to grab souvenirs. We continued our city tour with a temple visit, matcha stops (very American of us), and dinner at <a href=""https://www.thecoconutclub.sg/""><strong>Coconut Club</strong></a>, where the food was another easy 10/10. I ate a lot of meat and rice but somehow didn’t feel bloated. Back home, I’d be reaching for Tums immediately.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 3: Culture, Food &amp; Feeling Safe</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953347.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>This day was all about understanding Singaporean culture, starting with a food tour at a local hawker center. Think open-air food courts with multiple vendors serving traditional dishes and here’s the kicker: most Singaporeans don’t cook. Eating at hawker centers is cheaper and more convenient than cooking at home. We tried dish after dish, but my favorite came from a Michelin-starred chef named <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cheflup_roasted/?hl=en""><strong>Chef Lup</strong></a>. I’m still thinking about that roasted pork.</p>



<p>One of the most fascinating cultural differences I witnessed: Saving seats. People simply leave a personal item on a chair or table, and no one takes it. That would never work in New York. I felt incredibly safe the entire time, which is something that truly stood out as a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-british-women-travel-self-esteem"">Black woman traveling abroad</a>.</p>



<p>That evening, we had dinner at<strong> </strong><a href=""https://sg.celavi.com/""><strong>CÉ LA VI</strong></a>, a rooftop spot with sweeping city views. Between the skyline and the fact that Singapore is 13 hours ahead, it genuinely felt like I was in the future. We were standing in one of the tallest buildings in the world, taking it all in.</p>



<h2><strong>Day 5: Thrills, Screams &amp; R&amp;B</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953348.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>We spent the day at <a href=""https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/play/universal-studios-singapore""><strong>Universal Studios Singapore</strong></a>, fully embracing our inner kids. I’ll admit, I am not a roller coaster person. But I said yes anyway and immediately regretted it. The Revenge of the Mummy ride had me questioning every life choice I’ve ever made. My boyfriend was having the time of his life while I screamed and held on for dear life. Still, it was worth it just to say I went to Universal Studios on another continent.</p>



<p>That night, we headed to dinner at <a href=""https://www.mamadiamsg.com/menu""><strong>Mama Diam</strong></a>, a speakeasy disguised as a corner store that opens into a sleek, modern space playing R&amp;B all night. I love a speakeasy night out. It’s one of my favorite activities in New York. Singapore really knows how to make you feel at home, even when you’re halfway across the world.</p>



<h3><strong>Day 6: Gin, Spa Bliss &amp; Caribbean Roots</strong></h3>



<p>Our final day might’ve been my favorite. We visited <a href=""https://brassliondistillery.com/pages/gin-school?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=22936484064&amp;utm_content=183877836945&amp;utm_term=gin%20workshop%20singapore&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22936484064&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACcdwB9T2T9MiR5AdB9q73dTtlrAf&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EpJnOlG9TFjP426InfGx5mEV29gkCyo0PTXr29KrIngL81tzS87iekaAv42EALw_wcB""><strong>Brass Lion Gin</strong></a>, the first Singaporean gin distillery, where we learned how to make gin from scratch in three hours. I’ve never been much of a gin girl (outside of the occasional French 75), but that changed quickly. I created a floral gin blend that is beautifully sitting on my bar car. And yes, I brought a bottle back to the U.S., where it’s not even sold yet.</p>

<p>After one too many taste tests, it was time to unwind. I booked a spa treatment and got the best massage of my life. The masseuse climbed on the table to get every knot out of my body. I wanted to pack her in my suitcase and bring her home.</p>



<p>We ended the trip on the highest note with dinner at <a href=""https://www.campcaribbean.co/""><strong>Camp Caribbean</strong></a>, a Black-owned Jamaican and Trinidadian restaurant. As a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/09/11116863/nurse-turned-chef-healthy-recipes-boundaries"">Caribbean American</a> woman, seeing my culture reflected in Singapore meant everything. I was very impressed by how good the food tasted. The head chef traveled the world cooking before settling there and it was the perfect full-circle moment to close out the trip.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Singapore Belongs on Your Bucket List</strong></h3>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11953399.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’ve traveled to many countries, but Singapore stands out. As a Black woman, it’s one of the safest places I’ve ever visited, and the people are genuinely welcoming. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/08/11929596/tracee-ellis-ross-solo-traveling-mexico-travel-diary"">traveling solo,</a> planning a baecation, or organizing a group trip, Singapore truly has something for everyone. If you needed a sign to book that flight, this is it.</p>

<p>The moment I stepped into adulthood, my after-school routine of endless dance and drama classes fell entirely by the wayside. Instead, once I started working full time, I’d go to the pub and then head home for my all important <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9889706/social-media-sleep-deprivation"">looking-at-phone-in-bed time</a>. </p>



<p>This summer though, I finally decided to dip my toe back into the world of organized fun by <em>casually</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/04/9670512/best-yoga-mat"">taking up yoga</a> with the intention of simply helping myself unwind in a healthy way. My semi-regular relationship with the activity means that I still set up my mat at the back of class, don’t know the proper Sanskrit names for the poses, and mostly copy the person in front of me. But that’s exactly what keeps me engaged with the practice: The blissful, no-pressure, low intensity of it all (especially in January).</p>



<p>For 28-year-old Refinery29 writer Esther Newman, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/embroidery-hobby-coming-out-bisexuality"">taking up embroidery</a> without the pressure to get better at it has been a big plus for her mental health. “I find it really soothing and calming, having something to channel my nervous energy into, especially something that’s physical and not screen related,” she explains. “I like having something creative and artistic that’s all my own and that I don’t have to qualify through its performance or a rating judged by someone else. It’s just me who gets to say whether something works or needs a different approach.” </p>



<p>For many others though, the approach to hobbies is more all or nothing. Research from <a href=""https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-the-bhf/news-archive/2019/january/britains-hobbies-have-a-shelf-life-of-16-months"">The British Heart Foundation</a> shows that the shelf life of adult hobbies in the U.K. is 16 months, noting that work commitments, busy family lives, and lack of motivation are the main reasons we let them slide. The societal pressure to be instantly great at something is likely a contributing factor in our apathy towards hobbies. How many times have you heard someone saying <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/running-for-beginners-tips"">they want to start running</a>, only for every conversation to become about Fitbits and training for a half marathon? The very idea that you don’t have to be brilliant at everything you do seems to have gotten lost in our never-ending grind culture.</p>



<p>But why can’t our hobbies just be… Fun? In a world where we’re constantly on the clock or our iPhones, measuring our successes to our timelines and group chats, shouldn’t hobbies simply be a space for relaxation? According to therapist and <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Counseling Directory</a> member Rose Fisher, engaging in hobbies on a more chilled basis is not only more enjoyable, but it can also be a major win for our minds. “Taking up casual hobbies simply for the joy of it is important for our overall mental health and wellbeing,” she tells Refinery29. The benefits of engaging in an activity for no other reason than fun allows us to achieve what she calls a flow state: That is, engrossed and focused on a single task, according to Fisher, which allows us to be fully present and rid ourselves of self-consciousness.</p>



<p>This, she adds, in turn, helps to calm down our “thinking mind.” “The prefrontal cortex decreases in activity when an individual reaches a state of flow and this reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex enables us to be more creative and also think more freely,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>While it might seem like a strange concept for our overstimulated brains, it is possible to go back to picking up and putting down hobbies when and if we feel like it. Just because we might have invested time into something, it doesn’t mean we have to force ourselves to continue with an enjoyable routine. The idea of having to commit fully to something, reach goals and engage with it “properly” is exactly what moves us away from the flow state, creating a feeling of unnecessary expectation and guilt if we don’t reach those markers.</p>



<p>Getting back to that source of exploration was something that 27-year-old aerial performer <a href=""https://www.rubylauren.com/"">Ruby Baker</a> has experienced since taking up piano last month. “I love learning something new for the sake of it. There’s no pressure and it allows me to take my mind off all the other things I have to do,” she says. “I’m a bit of a perfectionist so it’s really good for me to try something I’m not good at and have a laugh with it. It takes away any self-criticism and judgment and reminds me that there’s no right or wrong when you’re creating art.”</p>



<p>One of the main reasons that hobbies began to feel so much like work is due in a large part to the evolution of the side hustle. Bolstered by never-ending COVID lockdowns, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10942275/good-interesting-tiktok-accounts"">TikTok feeds</a> where everyone seems to be turning their knitting hobby into cold hard cash, for many the opportunity to make money has come at the price of falling out of love with their chosen activity. “Adding financial pressures to a passion, or setting high goals for a hobby can have a negative impact on our fulfillment, as it takes away the simplicity of engaging with the task just for the pleasure of it,” Fisher explains.</p>



<p>Just because yoga brings me joy by engaging with a hobby in a casual, friends-with-benefits kind of way doesn’t mean I don’t feel the ongoing threat to commit and level up. In <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/no-cost-of-living-raise-paycheck-budget"">a cost of living crisis</a> where extracurriculars are increasingly expensive (my membership is $50 a month), the feeling that activities must be productive to be worth doing has never felt stronger, which is precisely what keeps most of us from taking them up or sticking to them.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>For 29-year-old radio presenter <a href=""https://www.marymandefield.com/"">Mary Mandefield</a>, this is one of the reasons her recent bouldering hobby has been kept casual. “I’m a big believer in not making money from the things you really love. As soon as something turns into a hustle or a career, it can suck the joy from it. I used to be a dance teacher, and as much as I loved making some extra money from dancing around with my mates, I quickly learnt that having to think about insurance, marketing, and GDPR [general data protection regulation] made it less fun,” she tells Refinery29.</p>



<p>“It is very important to have some experiences in life that are not about achieving goals, proving ourselves, or winning at things,” Fisher explains. “These activities help us to remember that our worth does not depend on what we can do, and we don’t have to prove ourselves to be impressive, valuable, or useful in every aspect of our lives.” </p>



<p>24-year-old designer Georgina<strong>*</strong>, who previously went out running every day, recognizes her relationship with the activity is much better now that it’s more relaxed. “It used to feel like a chore and I believed that if I missed a run then everything would be ruined. Not only my progress… It was more like: okay, that was a wasted day because I didn’t run my five miles,” she says. “Now, I don’t want to run because I ‘planned’ it, but just do it when I feel I need it. I actually enjoy it without the demand of getting better and I really don’t want to spoil that magic. It’s so comforting to do something just for yourself without any kind of pressure, whether that be internal or external.”</p>



<p>While it might take some mental reframing to break free of our overachieving mindsets, seeing hobbies as less of a routine-orientated practice and more as a source of play is a start. According to therapist and Counseling Directory member <a href=""https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/counsellors/rosalind-miles"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rosalind Miles</a>, the social aspect is also incredibly important. “Hobbies often bring people together who share similar interests,” she says. “Joining clubs or participating in group activities related to your hobby can foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for people to get out and about and make new friends.”</p>



<p>As January brings with it unending conversations about what we want to “achieve” this year, giving ourselves permission to engage with activities we like on a “when we feel like it” basis seems like one way to actually keep going with them. The inherent shame of being average at something is stopping us from engaging with anything — when really we all know that doing a little bit of something that we find fun is better than avoiding it entirely for fear of not being able to achieve anything of significance. Stepping out every so often to take part in something is a win in itself and it’s time we were all reminded of it. </p>



<p>My next venture for the new year? Roller skating. Here’s hoping for more laughs than broken bones.</p>
