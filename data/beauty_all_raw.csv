<p>The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly anticipated savings event is back for 2025. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nocturnal-polar-night-serum-review"">luxe serum</a>, Sephora’s <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">Holiday Savings Event</a> is the time to do just that.</p>



<p>Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9843677/sephora-beauty-insider-cash-rewards-program-update-2020"">Beauty Insider membership tier</a> (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge, depending on how much you spend annually), you can get <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/beauty/savings-event"">10, 15, or 20% off</a>, respectively. The sale is officially open to the public as of November 4, and <em>all</em> tiers have until November 10 to use the promo code <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from October 31 to November 10, no code needed.) </p>



<p>As with previous years, there’s some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to two Dyson items (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"">choose wisely</a>), three <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"">Shark Beauty</a> items, three The Ordinary products, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount. But, a <em>major</em> perk of Sephora’s holiday savings event: Snapping up gift sets at a discount.</p>



<p>Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glam-flexstyle-for-straight-to-wavy-hair-in-french-gold-P519274"">Shark Glam™ Hot Tool Air Styling &amp; Drying System</a>, $449</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940138.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>We<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review""> reviewed Shark’s FlexFusion</a> last year, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. This year, we’re eyeing the Glam —Shark’s latest innovation, which includes curling barrels, a smoothing brush, finishing tool, straightener, and a concentrator nozzle to achieve a variety of looks.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-cheat-lip-liner-P433516?skuId=2765618"">Charlotte Tilbury Lip Cheat Lip Liner</a>, $26</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940228.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Charlotte Tilbury’s iconic Lip Cheat pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. From the iconic Pillow Talk rosy nude to rich reds, this makeup artist-favorite liner is a lip combo essential.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/patrick-ta-major-headlines-cream-powder-blush-duo-P458747"">Patrick Ta Major Headlines Double-Take Crème &amp; Powder Blush Duo</a>, $38</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940112.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta’s blushes are still among Sephora’s bestsellers, and with more shade duos than ever, don’t miss out on restocking (or picking up a fresh shade for fall) at a rare discount.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/glazing-milk-P519160?skuId=2898419"">Rhode Glazing Milk</a>, $32</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940176.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Rhode entered Sephora doors this year, and you know what that means: All your dewy skincare essentials are available to shop during the Holiday Savings Event for the first time ever. If you can only choose one product, make it the Glazing Milk essence, which is perfect for adding extra hydration as the weather cools down.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/advent-calendar-us-P518496?skuId=2907772"">Sephora Collection Advent Calendar</a>, $55</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940188.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This blockbuster advent calendar by Sephora Collection is 30% off during the entire duration of the Holiday Savings Event, bringing the price tag down to $38.50. With a value of $163.50 in products, this is a serious steal that we predict won’t stay in stock for long.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lightwork-vii-the-freedom-makeup-palette-P518415"">Danessa Myricks Beauty LIGHTWORK VII The Freedom Makeup Palette</a>, $128</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940117.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that this Danessa palette will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Create endless dazzling looks using the entire assortment, or pop out each six-pan palette, remove the magnetic logo mirror in the center, and take it on the go.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/P517217"">LORE Disfruta Eau de Parfum</a>, $88</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940102.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>If you love niche, luxury fragrance, here’s a name you’ve probably never heard of — for now. From the brains of Melanie Bender (whose resume includes executive roles at Rhode, Versed, and Merit) and Joe Cloyes and Greg Gonzalez (founders of Youth To The People) comes Lore. The collection of four hyper-sensorial, unique fragrances ranges from fruity with a hint of smoky mezcal (Disfruta, seen here) to <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovely-a-little-twisted-eau-de-parfum-P517242?skuId=2888469&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p517242:product"">Lovely And A Little Twisted</a>, a milky rose that’s utterly addictive. Best of all: They all clock in at $88 for a full-size bottle — easily half of comparable designer brands — and are fair game during the sale. </p>



<h2 id=""modal2Title""><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/summer-fridays-the-holiday-trio-set-hot-coco-toasted-marshmallow-lbb-mini-jlm-P518536?skuId=2902054&amp;icid2=products%20grid:p518536:product"">Summer Fridays The Holiday Trio Set</a>, $48</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940179.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but the Summer Fridays one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. This cozy set includes two holiday-exclusive flavors (Toasted Marshmallow and Hot Cocoa) alongside a travel-size Jet Lag Mask for skin-quenching hydration.</p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/big-bitty-setting-spray-superstars-P518405"">ONE/SIZE On ‘Til Dawn Mattifying Waterproof Setting Spray Big &amp; Bitty Duo</a>, $36</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940151.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>Patrick Starrr’s ONE/SIZE setting spray is goated for a reason: Nothing works better to lock in makeup all day long with a soft matte finish. This holiday set is only $2 more than the full-size, but includes a mini for those all-important touchups. </p>



<h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/underpainting-face-highlight-contour-palette-P516830"">m.ph Underpainting Face Highlight &amp; Contour Palette</a>, $64</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940170.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>This time last year, celebrity makeup artist Mary Phillips’ brand, m.ph, was still waiting in the wings. This year, however, is a different story. The versatile complexion palette is already a Sephora bestseller, and thanks to a recent restock, you can snag yours at a discount during the sale. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11941082.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>It’s been nearly two years since the action planet <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars has orbited Sagittarius</a>, making this year’s comeback memorable. In the midst of several retrogrades (Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), we can rely on Mars in Sagittarius to serve as the energetic light we need to get us through the muddiness of fall <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">from November</a> 4 to December 15.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, Mars in Sagittarius can get a little messy. The reason is that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is an impulsive sign</a> that is super reactive and doesn’t focus on the consequences of their actions. When the action planet Mars is fired up in Sagittarius, it can create a mountain out of a molehill, as the archer’s energy can push limits and fight to prove a point for the sake of their bravado — even if no one is questioning their abilities and knowledge. We must be careful because we could shoot an arrow from our arsenal without considering where it lands (or others can do this to us). The reckless attitude and behavior can intensify existing matters. </p>



<p>Our weapons of choice will be words. Mars in Sagittarius has a tendency not to think before speaking. The condition is called “putting our foot in our mouths.” As you know, hearing the cold, hard truth can be unpleasant, making shooting from the hip the worst possible way to upset others. Being that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mercury-retrograde-aries-pisces-march-2025-meaning-effects"">Mercury retrograde</a> commences on November 9 and lasts until November 29, we should all take cover from miscommunications and hapless interpretation of sentiments. If we don’t, arguments will intensify since we want to have the last word. PSA: Sometimes we don’t need to send the final zinger to win the battle. There is power and authority in silence when people are popping off. </p>



<p>Debating the past is another core theme of Mars’s current journey in Sagittarius. Our memories are based on our personal feelings, which others might not align with someone else’s — which is okay. We have different experiences as humans and should find a common ground to understand each other. Regardless of how we perceive our past, being around those who nurture our hearts with kindness and aim to understand us is pivotal. So, if anyone begins to gaslight us, we should put them on ice and surround ourselves with loving people. Compassion goes a long way in the next several weeks. </p>



<p>Although the transit of Mars in Sagittarius is a time of action, we may be stuck in the mud. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars’s interaction with the other planets</a> serves up indecision instead of certainty. The harsh aspect Mars makes to Neptune retrograde in Pisces on December 14 will make us unsure about how we want to proceed in relationships, work projects, and the next steps in our lives. The only way to deal with this energy is to be calm and meditate on our plans — even if we have the urge to power through. Stopping to smell the roses offers perspective to assess what is essential and what we desire. Taking the opposite road is the equivalent of trying to make “fetch” happen — the trend from <em>Mean Girls</em> that never caught on.</p>



<p>If we put our darts aside by finding the right ways to express ourselves and proceed with empathy — not just for others, but for ourselves — we can make the best of the situation. In a world full of chaos, we can choose to be good and tender. Perhaps Neptune retrograde will soften up the fierce energy of Mars in Sagittarius — here’s hoping for that! </p>



<h2>Important Dates: </h2>



<p><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars enters Sagittarius, adding boldness and confidence to our aura. <br /><br /><strong>November 4:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius opposes Uranus retrograde in Gemini, bringing breakthroughs to the world and our lives.<br /><br /><strong>November 6:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius sextiles Pluto in Aquarius, intensifying matters due to control issues.<br /><br /><strong>November 12:</strong> Mars and Mercury retrograde in Sagittarius form a conjunction, making us question the direction we are heading in.<br /><br /><strong>November 24:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius squares the Nodes of Destiny, urging us to speak up and take a stand for our beliefs.<br /><br /><strong>December 8:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius creates a fraught aspect with Saturn retrograde in Pisces, pushing us to be pragmatic and realistic.<br /><br /><strong>December 14:</strong> Mars in Sagittarius connects with Neptune retrograde in Pisces, highlighting our uncertainty and confusion. Our vitality and energy will be low, so take it easy.</p>

Fall is finally here, and you know what that means: The holidays are just around the corner.

Case in point: Beauty-stuffed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unique-advent-calendars"">advent calendars</a>.<br /><br />While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. <br /><br />All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to <em>ooh</em> and <em>aah</em> at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11939482.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>November opens with a bang — and a bite. The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">first three days of this month</a> mark the final stretch of Mars in Scorpio, so if you’ve been simmering with ambition, desire, secrets, or strategy… you’re not imagining things. Mars is in its domicile here. It’s potent, precise, and a little bit ruthless. There’s a reason things have felt <em>hot</em> beneath the surface — emotionally, sexually, and globally.  <br /><br />This is a week to notice what you’ve learned during this <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio journey</a> (since early October). Have you confronted your triggers? Decluttered your energy? Spoken your truth in a controlled burn? Or maybe you’ve been holding it all in, trying to perfect your next move… but Mars in Scorpio doesn’t wait forever. The first half of this week is your cosmic green light to finish strong, but be mindful of your intensity. Don’t spiral into obsession, revenge, or paranoia. You’re wiser than that now. </p>



<p>By Tuesday night into Wednesday, Mars says goodbye to Scorpio and enters freedom loving Sagittarius, and suddenly everything feels a little lighter… and a little riskier. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-zodiac-sign-traits-characteristics"">Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter</a>, the planet of expansion, exaggeration, and big-picture dreams. So this Mars in Sag transit (from Nov 4 through late December) gives us energy to believe again. We’re breaking free from emotional stagnancy and burning through limitations. Globally, you’ll see the people speaking out for justice louder than ever, organizing protests, demanding rights, and moving with radical optimism. Individually, it’s time to stretch. Move your body. Hike that mountain. Try that dance class. Say yes to things your cautious self might decline. Just be careful not to say <em>yes</em> to everything, because Mars in Sag is also notorious for burnout. Take big swings… but be sure to rest in between. <br /><br />Then on November 5th, the energy deepens with the Taurus Full Moon. Earth signs take the stage, reminding us to come back to the body, back to the breath, back to the beauty of what’s real. This lunation activates themes around <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">money, security, self-worth, and sensuality</a>. It’s a powerful time to pause and ask yourself: <em>Where am I rushing? Where am I forcing what could simply flow?</em> Taurus teaches us that consistency is magic. That pleasure isn’t earned — it’s our birthright. So yes, you can manifest the bag under this lunation, but don’t forget to enjoy the garden you’ve already built. Put your bare feet in the grass. Make the luxurious meal. Light the candle just because. Taurus wants you to taste life, not just conquer it. </p>



<p>Finally, November 6th brings a double dose of cosmic intensity: Venus enters Scorpio and Uranus retrograde re-enters Taurus. Venus in Scorpio is loyal, laser-focused, and just a <em>little bit</em> obsessed with whatever (or whoever) has its attention. This is not the time for superficial love. We’re craving depth, intimacy, and truth. You’ll feel more sensitive to energy; you’ll pick up on what people <em>don’t</em> say more than what they do. And your own aura? Unmissable. You’re magnetic now. But be careful of testing people or playing mind games. Real ones want honesty, not manipulation. As for Uranus sliding back into Taurus for one final round (until it leaves for good in 2026 — not to return for 80+ years), we’re revisiting the lessons around stability, value, and revolution. What outdated ideas about money, land, pleasure, and the body need to go? What new systems are you ready to build? This is the final stretch — so let’s make it count. <br /><br /><em>Read your horoscopes for your Sun and Rising signs for the most in-depth forecast.</em></p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, Mars, your planetary ruler, is switching signs this week, and you’re gonna feel it like a gust of wind in your sails. On November 4th, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-sagittarius-horoscope-meaning-effects-november-2023"">Mars enters Sagittarius</a>, activating your expansion zone, and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been swimming in the deep, emotional waters of Mars in Scorpio for weeks now, digging through shadows and figuring out who’s really down for you and who just likes your fire. But now it’s like the fire returns to <em>you</em>. Mars in Sag wants you to move — mentally, physically, spiritually. It’s giving “book that trip,” “say the bold thing,” “write the damn pitch,” “go back to school,” “start the documentary,” “text your mentor back.” Your world is ready to grow, but first you’ve gotta believe there’s more than the tiny corner you’ve been stuck in. And if you’ve been shrinking yourself to survive? Not anymore. This is a cosmic jailbreak. Freedom is calling, and it wants you to answer.<br /><br />Then we get hit with that Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th, lighting up your money zone — and it’s not subtle. Something you started building financially (or energetically, self-worth-wise) around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-new-moon-in-taurus-april-2025-meaning-effects"">Taurus New Moon six months ago</a> is coming to a head. Maybe you’re finally seeing the payout from something slow and steady, or maybe you’re realizing where you’ve been undercharging, undervaluing, or underestimating yourself. Either way, this lunation is here to shake you back into confidence — but not without a few questions. Especially because two days later, Uranus retrograde reenters Taurus, like a surprise pop quiz from the Universe: “Have you <em>really</em> changed your money mindset? Or are you still clinging to fear, scarcity, or control?” The bag is trying to get bigger, Aries, but you’ve gotta stop blocking it with old narratives. Let this moon illuminate your next step, and then take it, even if your voice shakes. </p>



<p>And let’s not forget Venus
entering Scorpio on November 6th, because whew, things are getting deep. With
both the Sun and Venus now in your sector of intimacy, power, and merging,
you’re not really in the mood for surface-level anything. You want to feel
held. You want to feel trusted. You want to get to the bottom of it — <em>whatever it is</em>. This could be a magnetic
time for financial partnerships too: loans, collaborations, shared investments,
but make sure it’s a soul yes, not just a shiny one. Emotionally, you might
find yourself craving more than words — you want actions, presence, energy. You
want someone who sees through the mask, even the one you forgot you were
wearing. Let yourself be soft <em>and</em>
smart. Let yourself be all-in — but not at the expense of your boundaries.
You’ve come too far to betray yourself for someone who doesn’t know how to swim
in your depths. </p>

<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this week starts off like the drumroll before the drop… and the Full Moon in your sign on November 5th? That’s your moment, baby. You’re closing a chapter that began around your birthday season, and even if you didn’t know it, you’ve been building toward this culmination for months. Something about your identity — the way you present, the way you carry yourself, the way you take up space — is breaking through to a new level. You’re releasing versions of yourself that felt safer but smaller. And honestly? You’re no longer available for the role of “reliable one who keeps the peace.” You’re the main character. The muse. The mountain. Don’t be surprised if emotions run high around this lunation: you might cry at random commercials, or suddenly want to chop your hair off, or finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025-outfit-inspiration-ideas"">wear the outfit you’ve been saving for “someday.”</a> That someday is now. <br /><br />And just when you think that Full Moon glow is the climax, Uranus retrograde re-enters your sign on November 7th, stirring up the final stretch of your personal revolution. Think back to the shake-ups and glow-ups that started around 2018. Uranus was trying to wake you up from autopilot. Now it’s back for the final rewrites — one last round of “plot twists” that push you closer to the version of you who lives freely, speaks boldly, and doesn’t compromise just to be liked. There might be a reunion or revisit this week, maybe with an old desire, maybe with a person, maybe with a part of you that’s been hiding. Instead of resisting it, ask: What is this moment trying to liberate me from? The future is calling, and it wants <em>you</em>, not your mask. </p>



<p>And then Venus, your planetary ruler, slips into Scorpio on November 6th, straight into your partnership sector, and suddenly, everything feels more intense. You’re magnetizing people like crazy — lovers, collaborators, past situationships you thought were long gone. But this isn’t about nostalgia. Venus in Scorpio is here to show you who’s <em>actually</em> ready to meet you in the depth you crave. Loyalty, sensuality, psychic connection — these are the bare minimum now. If it’s not soul-stirring, why are you entertaining it? This transit might also bring <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/07/202646/money-questions-to-ask-your-romantic-partner"">money talks in relationships</a> or contracts with business partners, and your boundaries will be everything. You’re not here to be agreeable; you’re here to build legacy. Say what you want. Ask for what you need. And let love — the real kind — <em>transform you</em>. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, Mars moves into Sagittarius on November 4th, and suddenly you’re not just craving connection — you’re demanding real partnership. The kind where communication feels electric and aligned, where conversations don’t loop in circles but actually <em>go somewhere</em>. This is happening in your relationship sector, so people might start projecting their stuff onto you, especially since Mars tends to stir tension before it brings clarity. But if you’ve been people-pleasing or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/define-the-relationship-advice"">avoiding the Big Talks</a>, this week might blow that avoidance wide open. You may find yourself blurt-blessing truths in mid-convo like: <em>“Wait…why are we even doing this if we both want different things?”</em> Don’t regret it. You’re setting fires, yes, but they’re the kind that forge something stronger from the ash. Whether in business, love, or friendship, Mars is turning up the heat, and if the flame doesn’t grow <em>with</em> you, you’re allowed to walk away. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5th hits your subconscious sector like a lucid dream you don’t want to forget. This is the realm of endings, solitude, intuition, and rest, so if you’re suddenly feeling emotionally wiped out, it’s not just you being “too sensitive.” It’s your soul saying: <em>Pause. Listen. Heal.</em> This full moon is helping you end an old karmic loop: maybe a self-sabotaging behavior, an internalized fear, or a secret you’ve been carrying for way too long. Add to that Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, and you might be up late at night processing dreams, journal prompts, or uncanny synchronicities. Pay attention to what your body is telling you to… your nervous system has been holding a lot. Give it a release. Baths, naps, nature, prayers, poetry, whatever grounds you, do it. This full moon is a gentle but firm push into surrender. </p>



<p>By November 6th, Venus slips into Scorpio and lights up your daily routine zone with an edge of mystery, sensuality, and craving. You’re feeling more tuned in to your habits: what you consume, who you give your energy to, what you do with your hours. And to keep things real, Gemini: some of it has gotten too scattered. Venus in Scorpio isn’t about adding more to your to-do list, it’s about deepening what’s already working and letting the rest fall away. You might also feel more physically in tune with your body, or more aware of who at work is draining your joy. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/11/10751082/should-you-trust-your-gut-instinct"">Trust your gut</a>. This is an ideal time to bring more pleasure into your healing journey: hot yoga, Pilates, music baths, dance breaks between emails, delicious meals you eat <em>slowly</em>. Life isn’t a checklist. Let it become an offering. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831494.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s power in rest, Cancer, and this week, the stars demand it. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 activates your community and dream-vision sector, revealing which collaborations are truly aligned with your soul’s long-term growth, and which have quietly expired. It may feel like a wave of both grief and gratitude floods in as you realize certain friendships, teams, or goals no longer resonate. Let it. This full moon is a mirror: <em>Here’s what you wanted then. Here’s what you’ve outgrown. Here’s what you’re ready to dream next.</em> If you’ve been shouldering too many people’s hopes and expectations, this week calls you back to your own lane. You’re allowed to not answer every text. You’re allowed to unplug. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Mars shifts into Sagittarius on November 4, supercharging your health and daily rhythm zone with fire and pressure. You might feel the urge to finally <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-morning-rituals"">commit to a routine</a>—or finally <em>ditch</em> one that’s been draining your joy. Be mindful of burnout, especially if you’ve been over-giving. Mars here isn’t subtle; it demands action. It wants you to be more discerning with your time and habits, not more productive for productivity’s sake. Trust your body when it asks for different pacing. Then on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, inviting more sensuality, play, and emotional depth into your creativity and romantic life. Think less “get back on track” and more “build a life where joy is the track.” Start there. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>You’re stepping into the spotlight whether you planned to or not, Leo. The Taurus Full Moon on November 5 lights up your career and public reputation, and the impact is tangible. An opportunity you’ve been quietly nurturing may come to fruition—or a chapter may close to make space for one that’s more aligned with who you <em>really</em> are now. You don’t have to be ready to be seen. You just have to <em>show up</em> honestly. And if you’re not being recognized where you’ve been pouring your energy? Take note. This lunation brings revelations around legacy, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/secret-to-happiness-at-work"">work-life balance</a>, and your capacity to lead in ways that feel <em>true</em>, not just impressive. <br /><br />Then Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4 and Venus enters Scorpio on November 6, shifting your axis of expression. Mars fuels your fifth house of passion and selfexpression, pushing you to say what’s been unsaid: on the page, on stage, in love, or in your journal. The fire returns to your belly. Your inner artist is hungry. Let them feast. But with Venus moving into your emotionally intense fourth house, there’s also a longing to retreat, to nurture your inner child, to reconnect with what truly feels like <em>home</em>. Let both parts of you breathe this week—the one who wants to shine, and the one who wants to curl up in softness. You’re both. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>This week opens with a sacred pause, Virgo: an invitation to step back and look at the bigger picture. The Full Moon in Taurus on November 5 lands in your ninth house of perspective, expansion, and spiritual philosophy, and it’s whispering: <em>What if it’s not about fixing? What if it’s about trusting?</em> You’ve been growing. Quietly, steadily, deeply. This full moon reveals how far you’ve come and encourages you to release the illusion that you have to have it all figured out before you take the leap. Travel, education, or even a shift in worldview could mark this week. Let curiosity lead you more than control. <br /><br />With Mars entering Sagittarius (your home and roots sector) and Venus moving into your communication zone, your inner and outer voices may clash. Mars in Sagittarius could stir conflict on the home front or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/single-solo-travel-romanticise-life"">make you crave more independence</a> and space than usual. That’s not a betrayal of your people — it’s a call to check in on your nervous system and boundaries. Venus in Scorpio, meanwhile, blesses your words with velvet, and you’re more sensual, intuitive, magnetic. Whether you’re writing, speaking, or just thinking, you’re tapping into a deeper truth. You don’t need to scream to be heard. Whisper your magic. It’ll find who it’s meant for. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, it’s time to stretch your wings and remember how much more of the world there is for you to touch. With Mars entering Sagittarius on November 4, you might feel a jolt of energy and inspiration in your communication zone — and honestly, it’s about time. You’ve been thinking deeply, maybe even overthinking, but now the cosmos is asking you to speak, write, teach, and share again. Not from a place of performance, but from presence. Your words carry fire now, Libra. Conversations will have more spark, more conviction, more truth. So whether it’s pitching that idea, reaching out to an old friend, or just hitting publish on a post you’ve been second-guessing, Mars says: just go for it. <br /><br />Then just a day later, the Taurus Full Moon on November 5 illuminates your intimacy and legacy sector. And it’s not just a regular full moon: Uranus retrogrades back into Taurus two days later, intensifying whatever emotional or financial storyline is rising. This could be the time where you finally release an old debt — emotional or literal. A truth about what you truly <em>value</em> in deep partnerships might surface. You may feel this in your body too: your throat chakra buzzing, your sensuality heightened, your nervous system needing grounding. Ride the waves, but let go of control. There’s alchemy happening in your shadows. </p>



<p>And with Venus entering Scorpio on November 6, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2025"">your money sector is now infused with magnetism</a>. But not just the “cash flow” kind — I’m talking about a deeper rerooting in your self-worth. This is a great time to review your budget or raise your rates, yes, but it’s also about asking: am I honoring the <em>value</em> of my energy? Of my presence? Venus in Scorpio doesn’t do surface-level abundance. She wants you to get intimate with your desires and become unapologetic about claiming what’s already yours. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831498.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week Mars, one of your planetary rulers, is leaving your sign after an extended stay that probably felt like a bootcamp for your soul. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/november-monthly-horoscope-2025-meanings-effects"">The first few days of November</a> carry this final blast of Martian energy, and it’s intense. You may feel a pressure to prove yourself, make a move, or demand clarity… but before you do, breathe. Mars in your sector of self has been reminding you what it feels like to move with your own instincts, not based on validation or trends, but based on your gut. And now, as it moves into Sagittarius on the 4th, your energy shifts to money, security, and self-worth. Your identity work isn’t over, but now it’s more about how you fund the life you’re building, how you value your energy and time, and how you build confidence through aligned action. There may be unexpected purchases, business ideas, or moments where you finally charge what you’re worth. Don’t rush the pivot… just notice where the fire’s leading you.<br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th, activating your relationship sector — and it’s <em>major</em>. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/scorpio-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Some Scorpios could be falling in love</a>, signing a marriage license, or realizing they’ve outgrown a connection they once centered their whole world around. </p>



<p>You might go from <em>“I don’t want love”</em> to <em>“I want a home and a legacy with someone”</em> in 24 hours — or vice versa. The moon is revealing what you truly desire in partnership, and what you’ve been pretending not to want. Maybe you’ve been avoiding intimacy when what you crave most is to be held. Or maybe you’ve been <em>centering a fantasy of love</em>, while forgetting your own name in the process. This moon brings truth, clarity, and release. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, that clarity isn’t temporary — it’s evolutionary. Expect twists. Expect breakthroughs. Expect to surprise even yourself. <br /><br />By the time Venus enters your sign on November 6th, you’ll feel a soft but powerful return to self. Mars handed you the blueprint, but Venus wants to show you how to move with grace, magnetism, and self-awareness. This is your glow-up moment. People are watching. You’re becoming more intentional about how you show up in relationships, and how you allow others to show up for you. It’s also a powerful time to attract wealth, romantic attention, and recognition, but only if it aligns with the person you’re becoming, not the one you’ve outgrown. Venus in Scorpio doesn’t play about love, money, or authenticity. This is your cue to romanticize your own life, Scorpio. Not because it’s cute — but because it’s time. </p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sagittarius, this is your cue to stretch, breathe deep, and get ready, because Mars enters your sign on November 4th, and your world is about to speed up. The beginning of the week still carries <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">the remnants of Mars in Scorpio</a>, which for the past several weeks has activated your spirituality and solitude sector, pulling you inward, forcing you to look at the patterns you’ve avoided, and making you rest even when you didn’t want to. If you’ve been feeling lowkey exhausted, maybe even emotionally foggy or withdrawn, don’t trip — that was part of your cosmic reset. But now the heat is back.  <br /><br />As Mars returns to your sign, so does your drive, your confidence, your power to initiate, and your sense of momentum. The fog lifts. You’re inspired again. Just don’t try to do everything all at once, as this transit can make you impulsive, even reckless. Channel the fire into focused movement, especially with your body: hiking, dance classes, morning runs, boxing, swimming — anything that grounds the energy. You’re not supposed to go from zero to a hundred. But you <em>are</em> meant to follow the fire that feels real. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk money, worth, and self-sufficiency, because the Taurus Full Moon on November 5th (followed by Uranus’ retrograde in Taurus on the 7th) is lighting up your sector of routine, work, and wellness, and it’s bringing some truth to the surface. Maybe it’s a project finally wrapping up, a contract closing, a health scare resolving, or a realization that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">your burnout wasn’t just physical</a> — it was emotional. This moon says: what in your everyday life is truly sustainable, and what needs to go? <br /><br />Then, on November 6th, Venus enters Scorpio, diving into your dreams, secrets, and emotional processing zone. It’s like your sensual side turns inward. You might be craving more time alone, not because you’re antisocial, but because you’re finally understanding the beauty of emotional privacy. Old loves may resurface, either literally or energetically. You could find yourself craving intimacy without chaos, longing for depth in your friendships, or even reconnecting with a creative project that once felt too vulnerable to share. Let yourself feel things all the way through. Journal. Make playlists. Cry in the shower. Dream big. This transit is preparing you for the soft launch of a new emotional era — one that doesn’t need to be loud to be real. </p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the week begins with a quiet hum of closure, as Mars finishes its journey through Scorpio, activating your community and collective impact sector one last time. For the past month, you’ve likely been in your boss mode bag, but not in the “climb-the-ladder-alone” kind of way. You’ve been assessing who’s truly in your corner, who aligns with your vision, and where you may have been playing it small just to fit in. Now, as Mars enters Sagittarius on November 4th, you’re entering a more introspective chapter — your healing sector gets lit, and suddenly all the things you’ve been pushing through rise to the surface. Don’t brush it off this time. If you need to rest, rest. If you need to forgive someone (or yourself), do it without making it a whole performance. This is the time to slow your hustle just enough to make sure your soul is still in the driver’s seat. <br /><br />Then comes the Taurus Full Moon on November 5, and baby, this one’s personal. It activates your pleasure, romance, and creativity zone, and it’s bringing up all the feels. For some Capricorns, this could be a literal climax: a passionate fling turning serious, a creative baby being born, or a truth bomb dropping in matters of the heart. For others, it could feel like a deep craving for joy and softness that you haven’t let yourself feel in a while. Let it in. And with Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, don’t be surprised if an old crush, hobby, or dream makes an unexpected reappearance. This energy is like your inner child saying, “Can we please go back to what made us <em>feel</em> alive?” Let yourself feel playful again — not because it’s productive, but because your joy is sacred and revolutionary. </p>



<p>And then we have Venus entering Scorpio on November 6th, which breathes depth and intensity into your friendship and vision sector. This is “ride or die” energy. You might suddenly find yourself drawn to new people who feel like soul family — or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/outgrowing-friendships-as-an-adult"">you may start reevaluating long-time connections</a> that don’t hold the same magic they used to. Creatively, you’re magnetic right now. People are watching you, even if they’re not saying it. Don’t shrink your passion. Venus in Scorpio reminds you that the right people won’t flinch at your intensity; they’ll mirror it back to you with devotion. </p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, the start of the week hits with a potent shift in momentum: Mars wraps up its journey through Scorpio, which has been activating your career and legacy zone for weeks. Whew. You’ve likely been in hyper-focus mode, trying to solidify your path, prove yourself, or restructure what success even means to you. Maybe you were working overtime, maybe you were silently wondering if all your effort is even being seen. (It is, btw.) But here’s the catch: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars in Scorpio can bring out your most obsessive tendencies</a>. If you’ve been pushing yourself past burnout in the name of excellence, pause. That drive isn’t sustainable if it’s rooted in fear.  <br /><br />On November 4, when Mars enters Sagittarius, the tone shifts completely — now it’s all about community, collective dreaming, and your wider network. You’re being invited to remember you don’t have to build the future alone. This transit wants you to connect, collaborate, and maybe even call up those people you keep meaning to reach out to. You’re most powerful when you remember your ideas are meant to inspire a movement, not live in a vacuum. </p>



<p>Then comes the Full Moon in Taurus on November 5, illuminating your home and emotional security sector. This could bring major revelations around where you live, who you live with, or even what “home” means in this current chapter. Some Aquarians might be finalizing a move, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/family-arguments-toxic"">mending family dynamics</a>, or finally releasing emotional weight that’s been stored deep in the body. If you cry this week, let it happen — there’s medicine in those tears. With Uranus retrograde re-entering Taurus two days later, this isn’t just a random full moon: it’s a wake-up call from the Universe about your nervous system and ancestral patterns. Is the version of “security” you’re clinging to actually nourishing you? Or are you due for a whole new blueprint of what rootedness looks like? <br /><br />And then — boom — on November 6, Venus enters Scorpio, joining the Sun and continuing the deep dive into your career and public reputation zone. You’re magnetizing attention like never before, but not because you’re trying to. It’s the depth, the edge, the truth in your voice… people feel it. This is a powerful time for rebranding, launching something bold, or showing up with raw, authentic power in spaces where you previously felt like an outsider. Just don’t fall into the trap of over-curating your image. Trust that being your whole self is what draws the right opportunities in. </p>

<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, the week begins with an emotional sigh of release. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mars-in-scorpio-horoscope-2025-meaning-effects"">Mars is finishing its time in Scorpio</a>, your sector of expansion, spirituality, and long-distance journeys, and baby… what a ride. These past weeks may have felt like an initiation, one that cracked you open and demanded deeper trust in your intuition — not the watered-down, airy kind, but the kind that whispers <em>“go anyway”</em> when logic says don’t. You’ve been traveling (literally or spiritually) and shedding beliefs that no longer align. And now, on November 4, Mars enters Sagittarius and your career zone, shifting the spotlight to how you show up in the world. Expect things to get louder, faster, and more visible. You’re being asked to own your expertise, pitch the dream project, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/online-job-search"">apply for the thing you thought was too big</a>, and step into your power like you didn’t just spend a month doing inner excavation. You did — and it shows. But be mindful of burnout. Mars in Sag can make you think you’re invincible — <em>you’re not</em>. You’re still water, love. Stay hydrated. Stay soft. <br /><br />Then the Full Moon in Taurus arrives on November 5, lighting up your communication and learning zone. Something you’ve been processing mentally may suddenly drop into your body with clarity. A conversation you’ve been avoiding? A message you’ve been waiting to share? This full moon cracks open your throat chakra and dares you to speak from the heart. Words become spells now, so use them wisely. And with Uranus retrograding back into Taurus just two days later, you’re revisiting how you process, think, and even teach. This week rewires your voice and your mind, anchoring your ethereal wisdom into grounded, practical action. </p>



<p>By November 6, when Venus enters Scorpio, the cosmos brings things full circle. You’re being called deeper into your desires for intimacy, depth, and soul-stirring truth — and not just romantically, but spiritually, intellectually, and even professionally. Your magnetism increases tenfold, but so does your craving for meaningful experiences. You’re not here for surface-level vibes anymore. Whether you’re <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/millennial-travel-trends-google-powerpoint-spreadsheets-planning-travel"">planning an international trip</a>, beginning a new study, or finally sharing the sacred work you’ve kept close to your chest, this transit says: go all in. Trust the path even when it’s foggy. Love yourself through the mystery. You are the ocean, Pisces, and the world is ready for your waves. </p>

<h2>White Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>

Best of all, brands have designed just as many options in white gold as they have in the metal’s yellow-gold counterpart, including classic small and large hoops, as well as textured and bubbled designs.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chunky Gold Hoop Earrings</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940587.png?width=960&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=15%3A16"" /></figure>



<p>Thick gold hoops balance boldness with timeless appeal. Some retain a sleek and sculptural feel, while others lean into a chunky and puffy silhouette.

<p>Make a statement with a pair of go-to large gold hoops. How big you go in circumference is up to you, of course. An oversized pair made from a single thin wire is a classic, while others feature sculptural details begging for a double-take. Continuous circles and open-ended backs both bring just the right amount of drama to everything from a black turtleneck to a tailored blazer — and require little other jewelry. </p>

<p>For a good chunk of the late ‘90s and 2000s, it would be rare to see twins Tia and Tamera Mowry without each other. For many Black millennial women like me who grew up with  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/06/157426/sister-sister-reboot-tia-tamara-mowry""><em>Sister, Sister</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/browse/entity-3aa9e7b5-c02e-45db-a8dc-88e9e3a04a11""><em>Twitches</em></a>, Tia and Tamera embodied what we’re talking about when we say “representation matters”: on<em> Sister, Sister</em> they were whole characters who got to be serious or silly, logical or impulsive, boy-crazy or booksmart. And they gave us the freedom to be all of the above too — well, depending on whether you were a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2020/11/10172757/where-to-watch-sister-sister-netflix-canada"">Tia or Tamera</a> (my good grades, shyness, and constant need for parental approval made me a Tia of course). <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">And with </a><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated"">Twitches</a></em> (and <em>Twitches Too</em>), they redefined spooky season. Something that didn’t always <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-ca/2021/10/10731680/growing-up-black-without-halloween"">feel like it was for us</a> was suddenly anchored by a movie starring two Black girls, and 20 years later, it’s still a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows"">Halloween staple. </a></p>



<p>Now, the Tia and Tamera sightings are fewer and farther between. So much so that last year when Tia mentioned on her docuseries <em>Tia Mowry: My Next Act</em> that she wished the two were “still close” the internet was convinced the twins had fallen out. Later, <a href=""https://www.today.com/popculture/tia-tamera-mowry-relationship-now-rcna172091"">Tia Mowry clarified</a> that she and Tamera (now Mowry-Housley after marrying Adam Housley) are better than good and still as close as ever, they just live apart and are busy with their respective professions (both have maintained successful acting careers for the past two decades) and families, naturally. And yet, when the duo reunited recently in <a href=""https://people.com/tia-mowry-tamera-mowry-housley-love-reuniting-focusing-on-what-really-matters-during-holidays-exclusive-11838188"">partnership with HomeGoods</a> for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQR_KO2Aa2I/?hl=en"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, the fact that they were in the same place at the same time prompted social media users to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQap_IKkZJ4/?igsh=N2ZleXBqdmsxc2Y0"">lose their minds</a>. </p>



<p>When Tia and Tamera logged on — together — for our Zoom interview, I wish I could say I kept my chill. I didn’t. The nostalgia was too strong. I reverted right back to the kid who worshiped at the altar of <em>Sister, Sister </em>reruns every day after school and who made her entire identity for multiple Halloweens doing the <em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitches</a></em><a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7159649084423294250?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> chant</a>. Tis the season to relive our obsession with Tia and Tamera so it’s only fitting that the duo are back together for the holidays for <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HomeGoods annual </a><em><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/homegoods-kicks-off-third-annual-deck-the-everything-day-with-early-store-openings-inviting-shoppers-to-shop-early-and-unleash-their-holiday-alter-egos-302597797.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deck the Everything Day</a>, </em>a holiday created for those early decorators who can’t wait to kick off the holiday season<em>. </em>It was surreal to see their distinct personalities on full display as they chatted about their dueling holiday alter egos, whose mac and cheese is better, and which Mowry sibling is hosting Thanksgiving this year. Here, we get into all of the above — plus, Tia and Tamera talk about what <em>Twitches</em> means to them all these years later and what <em>they</em> mean to Black women. </p>



<p><strong>I’m getting emotional just seeing you two together! Everyone is always so happy to see you both in the same place. Do you feel that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia Mowry: </strong>Yesterday, every five minutes we were getting stopped. And the word that everybody was saying was “nostalgia.” They were so happy to see both of us together. They would see [Tamera] and then when they would see me, they were like, “Oh my god! Hey!” They just lit up when they would see both of us. So basically, what you just did was happening all day yesterday. It was very, very sweet.</p>

<p><strong>You mean so much to me! Do you understand how much you mean to millennial women, especially Black women? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you. Yesterday, a girl asked for a photo with us and she said the same thing. So I am honored. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera Mowry-Housley: </strong>We are honored. It’s so sweet. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I think [we do understand] now. I think when we were younger, we never really did — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>That’s interesting. I did in the sense of our natural hair. So many young and up and coming actors now, they would say,<em> thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair. </em>Because, as you know, in the last decade, our natural hair wasn’t always accepted, especially on television and in the workforce. So when they saw us, they’re like,<em> oh my gosh, yes, I can wear my natural hair.</em> It’s beautiful.</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, I think, now, and especially in our late — </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Gosh, don’t say it. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> In our late 40s! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You look good, girl! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Thank you, you too!<em> [laughs]</em> Now, in our <em>late 40s</em>, I’m truly understanding the impact of representation and how important it is to see women that look like you be celebrated, and I feel that it leans into the quote, “if you see it, you be it.” And so I think that’s why I followed [your statement] with, “I am honored,” because it’s not easy. Being in the positions that we are in, it’s a constant battle. It’s a constant fight, just being a woman in general.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>So many young and up and coming actors now, they say,<em> </em>‘thank you so much for representation. You let me know that someone like me can do this, but not only that, someone with my hair.’ </p><cite>tamera mowry-housley on ‘sister, sister’s’ impact</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I can speak for Hallmark. When I started at Hallmark — it’s been about seven years —  I remember not seeing women like me at all on that network, and I got to give it to Michelle Vicary, who is there now, she gave me my chance. She was like, “listen, we want you to tell your stories. I’m going to give you three films to produce.” And I was like, <em>Oh my gosh, the pressure!</em> But also, like Tia was saying, I felt very honored. I did a movie called <em>Girlfriendship</em>, an all-Black woman cast <em>on Hallmark</em> and literally, the producers came back and said, “we’ve had the most Black audience we’ve ever had on Hallmark, thank you.” That felt beautiful and amazing. And I’m happy that I’m still there. I still get to tell all kinds of stories of what Black families look like. We’re biracial, I get to tell those stories. And to be honest, the response as the new person, the trailblazer going in there, telling these stories, it wasn’t always positive. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Yeah, and that’s why I said there’s still a challenge. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>But we’re doing it! </p>



<p><strong>You’re partnering with HomeGoods. Tell me more about that collaboration.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Let me tell you this, one thing about HomeHoods that I love is there’s representation. So when you see the Santas, you see some Black Santas. It’s amazing. You’ll see some Black nutcrackers. When I saw them I was like, <em>let’s go! </em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia always says she loves for people to feel seen, feel heard, and understood. And what’s so cool is that this campaign focuses on the holiday alter ego that comes out</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>And doing the holidays your way! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>There’s so many different styles. There’s so many different styles, so many different HomeGoods holiday carols that you can choose from that you feel like represents your festive alter ego. </p>



<p><strong>What’s the difference between your holiday alter egos? Who’s the early decorator? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>We’re both early decorators! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>For our Thanksgiving dinner that I hosted for our family, it was Christmas. There was Christmas everywhere, but Tia’s more whimsical, winter whimsy. </p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Sparkle, sparkle, baby! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Yes, glam! I am an ever green icon. So the traditional Christmas colors that you think of — red, green, that cozy, warm, traditional woodsy vibe. But what’s cool is I have blue ornaments, I’ll embody the golden glam Holiday Carol alter ego and I’ll add some gold in there. I love interior design, I love decorating, I love hosting. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p><cite>tia mowry on the 20-year anniversary of ‘twitches’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> And hosting on a budget, okay? And that’s what’s so amazing about HomeGoods. I’m telling you, when you look at the prices, you’re like <em>what!? </em>I literally saw a huge Nutcracker. And I love Nutcrackers. We grew up with Nutcrackers. Our mom loves pecans and walnuts, and she would always bring out that Nutcracker. But there was a huge Nutcracker, maybe four, five feet tall, and it was 100 dollars! </p>



<p><strong>We’re talking about holidays so I would love to know your favorite holiday memory together. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Oooh! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>I have a memory, and it was together, I just don’t know if you remember it<em> [laughs]. </em>My memory sometimes is her memory. I’ll say “I remember…” and Tia will be like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“No, that was me!” </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia, do you remember <em>Polar Express,</em> this book, about if you have hope and you believe in magic, you can hear a bell. So we would always read that book to our brother, Tahj, and still to this day, he loves that book. I’ve passed down reading that book to my kids, but there was a moment where I could have sworn we were eight years old and I heard Santa’s footsteps, and I heard the bells. Do you remember that, Tia? </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940561.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> Yes, I do! We really thought it was really Santa because we heard the bells from the reindeer, but it was Dad. We ended up realizing later it was Dad. Our parents did such a great job. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We believed [in Santa] until we were 11 years old. Yeah, we believed for a long time! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera, you said you hosted Thanksgiving. Are you hosting this year? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>No, we oscillate.<strong> </strong>I always host Christmas but on Thanksgiving we oscillate. It was you last year, me the year before that, so now Tahj is hosting this year. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We’re going over to his house and we’re all going to be there. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>We do potluck style with Tahj.</p>



<p><strong>Who brings the mac and cheese?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I do. I can throw down on some mac and cheese. And you know who’s really  good at mac and cheese now?</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>[our other brother] Tavior. [My husband] Adam’s good too!</p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>But girl he can’t touch my mac and cheese, I’m sorry. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know what we should do? We should have the family vote. We need to have a mac and cheese competition between Adam’s, Tavior’s and yours. So you know if you won hands down. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I’ve tasted Adam’s mac and cheese, girl, and it’s fabulous. It’s great too. But he can’t beat my mac and cheese. Sorry<em> [laughs].</em></p>



<p><strong>We know that you’re both moms, and during the holidays you’re hanging out with each other’s families. Who would your kids say is the fun Auntie between the two of you? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> I’m gonna say me. I am so the fun Auntie! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> But what would they say about me? </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I would say that they think that you’re really sweet. And warm and cool. </p>



<p><em>[Editor’s note: Tamera’s phone rings and it’s her husband Adam] </em></p>



<p><strong>Tia:</strong> That’s Adam. Tell him my mac and cheese is better!<em> [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong><strong><em> [on the phone]:</em></strong><strong> </strong>Adam, we’re doing an interview right now. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>Lord have mercy on my soul! My mac and cheese is better than your mac and cheese, Adam! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>What do you say, Adam?</p>



<p><strong><em>[Adam through the phone]</em></strong>: I’m not getting in the middle of this one! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>SMART man! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> I love you, I’ll call you later. <em>[hangs up phone] </em></p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11940564.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=762&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A381"" /></figure>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>So I’m the one that’s like, let’s come over to the house and have sleepovers, and let’s jump in the pool, and let’s go to amusement parks and stuff like that. Not that you’re not, but [Tamera], you’re very warm. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera</strong>: If they want to talk about something, or if they’re having a challenging time and just want to release and chill. We’ll watch movies and just relax.</p>



<p><strong>It’s spooky season so everyone is doing their <em>Twitches</em></strong><strong> re-watch. Did you know when you were doing Twitches that all these years later people would still be so obsessed with it?  Does it still blow your mind? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>It blows my mind that people have tatted themselves with the sun and the moon. I’ve seen tattoos! </p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> They have Halloween parties, like the Halloween parties are themed around <em>Twitches</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>I don’t think a day goes by during the Halloween season when a stranger that we don’t know goes, “Oh my gosh, I love <em>Twitches</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>Tia and I loved <em>Halloweentown. </em>Remember, we were obsessed with <em>Halloweentown, </em>and we had no idea that <em>Twitches</em> was going to become one of those. It is insane. Like, it’s iconic. It’s <em>Sister, Sister </em>and <em>Twitches</em>. That’s what we hear the most. </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>People actually don’t know that we improvised the [“Go Twitches, go Twitches” chant]. I forgot what the director said but he was just saying, like, have fun. I think in the script it just said “Twitches” or “Twin witches” or something like that. And then we were like — </p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>“Go Twitches, go Twitches!” [<em>laughs</em>]</p>



<p><strong>Tamera:</strong> It’s like “go home, Roger!” </p>



<p><strong>That’s our time but I was just going to ask you both to turn to each other and give each other the proverbial flowers that we collectively give to you all the time.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Tia and Tamera (in unison): </strong>Aww! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>We really, really appreciate that. </p>



<p><strong>Tamera: </strong>You know, we should really do that today, give each other [actual] flowers. I’m serious! </p>



<p><strong>Tia: </strong>No, I know. Let’s go get some flowers. </p>
<p><strong>Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9944836/tia-mowry-etsy-collection?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback1"">Tia Mowry&#039;s Etsy Home Line Is Homespun Chic</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/10/10111555/twitches-halloween-movie-underrated?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback2"">This Is The Most Underrated Spooky Season Movie</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-horror-films-movies-shows?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss_linkback3"">Stream These Black Horror Films &amp; TV Shows</a></p>",
