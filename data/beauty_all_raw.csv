<p>Having <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/combination-imbalanced-skincare-routine"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">combination skin</a> is like bringing all your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/one-on-one-friendship-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">different friendship groups</a> together on your birthday — but instead of enjoying yourself on the karaoke machine, you’re making sure they get along. Keeping every personality happy at once is no easy feat, and the same goes for managing two <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-cleansing-routine-skin-type"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">skin types</a>. In my experience, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-moisturizer-for-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">moisturizers for dry skin</a> tend to be unctuously thick, which can trigger breakouts, while those made for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">oily skin</a> are often too light to make a difference. So when I find a product that does it all — quenching dry patches and delivering hydration without a greasy feel — I have to shout about it. Enter: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary’s new Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. </p>



<h2>What is The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p>Don’t be fooled by <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion</a>. At first glance, it looks like one of the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-multi-antioxidant-radiance-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">many serums</a>, and while it boasts a lightweight, milky consistency and comes in a dropper bottle, this product is actually a moisturizer. </p>



<p>The Ordinary drew inspiration <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/belif-korean-skincare-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">from K-beauty</a>, specifically milky skincare textures, when developing this moisturizer, and its star ingredient — rice lipids — also nods to Eastern beauty rituals. You might be familiar with rice water in skincare, but lipids are a little different. NYC-based dermatologist <a href=""https://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/"">Joshua Zeichner, MD</a>, explains, “Rice lipids are natural fats derived from the outer layer of the rice grain known as the bran, and they have emollient benefits.” This, adds Dr. Zeichner, means they “fill in cracks” between cells on the surface of the skin. As a result, Dr. Zeichner explains that rice lipids can soften the outer skin layer, or what is known as the skin barrier.  </p>



<h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, $13</a></h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955647.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>There’s also <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-ectoin-hydro-barrier-serum-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ectoin, a skincare ingredient</a> that’s finally getting its dues in skincare. “Ectoin is a naturally derived compound that helps maintain a healthy skin barrier and protects skin from the environment,” says Dr. Zeichner. He adds that it’s naturally found in bacteria that live in extreme conditions, helping those bacteria to survive. “In skincare, it improves hydration and provides antioxidant benefits to prevent inflammation,” continues Dr. Zeichner. If your skin feels rough, flaky, or tight after cleansing, then ectoin is for you. Even better? It has a soothing effect on inflamed skin, and over time, it can help improve uneven skin texture.  </p>



<p>For the ingredient buffs, hydrating electrolyte molecules and amino acids — the building blocks of skin-strengthening proteins — are also present in this milky moisturizer. These are both present in the skin anyway, but sometimes our reserves run low, resulting in dry skin. But there’s good news: “These ingredients have been replicated and used in skincare products,” says Dr. Zeichner, “and they pull hydration into the skin.” As someone currently using <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength retinol</a> and really feeling the effects of cold weather and central heating, this sounded right up my alley. </p>



<h2>What makes The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion special? </h2>



<p>Lightweight moisturizers can be hit or miss. In fact, my bathroom cabinet is lined with gel-cream products that keep my oily T-zone happy but just don’t cut it on my dry patches, so I slotted this into my routine the day it landed at my door — and I’m so glad I did.  </p>



<p>I started using it after ditching a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">high-strength acid</a> that wrecked my skin barrier, and within just a couple of days, my skin had already recovered. It was less red and angry; the dry skin around my mouth had disappeared, and there was a subtle dewy sheen that meant I didn’t want to wear as much foundation. I ended up dropping my thicker moisturizer and shelving my hydrating serum, too, because this does it all. I even take it up to my eyes and use it as an eye cream — it’s that moisturizing. </p>



<p>Besides the powerhouse ingredients, how the moisturizer is made is pretty special. Without boring you with the science, the formula goes through microfluidization, a high-pressure mixing technique that blends light, water-based ingredients with slightly heavier, oil-based ones. The result? A lightweight, comfortable moisturizer that absorbs quickly but is substantial enough to hydrate even dry skin. </p>



<h2>What to know about The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion </h2>



<p>• Reduces visible skin redness after one use. </p>



<p>• Provides hydration for up to 24 hours and repairs a weakened skin barrier. </p>



<p>• Can be used in the morning and evening and comes in 60ml and 120ml bottles. </p>



<h2>How do you use The Ordinary’s Rice Lipids + Ectoin Microemulsion, and is it worth it? </h2>



<p>My skincare routine is pretty simple. In the morning, I wash my face with a cream cleanser, apply a pipette-full of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheordinary.com%2Fen-us%2Frice-lipids-ectoin-microemulsion-moisturizer-100739.html"">Rice Lipids + Ectoin</a>, then finish with three finger lengths of sunscreen. In the evening, I double cleanse to remove all traces of makeup and sunscreen, apply Rice Lipids + Ectoin, and finish with my retinal serum. I find that, even though this moisturizer is featherlight, it provides a nice cushion for retinoids and helps reduce irritation and flaky patches of skin. </p>



<p>Because it’s such an all-rounder, I’ve happily and easily recommended it to anyone looking for a simple moisturizer that transcends seasons. While it’s working wonders on my skin this winter, it’ll be just as brilliant come spring and summer, thanks to its quenching feel and lack of any slippery residue. Better still, a 60ml bottle is only $13. If you love it as much as me, you grab the 120ml bottle, which is $22.50.  </p>

<p>“Every January, L’Oréal unveils a mascara to rival the previous year’s, and I’m convinced it’s impossible to beat the last one — but I’m always proven wrong. Big Deal is a serious upgrade on the Panorama Mascara, which scooped the top spot in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-beauty-products-2024-innovator-awards"">2024’s Beauty Innovator Awards roundup</a>, and I’ve barely gone a day without it. Most mascaras are too wet on the first swipe, but this one is perfect from the get-go. The springy, conic brush boasts two types of bristles to capture and thicken lashes in one swipe, and you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how easily it slips on. Just like its predecessor, it stays put until you decide to remove it at the end of the day. Smudges? Where?!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“Everything Danessa Myricks makes is pro-level; every makeup artist I know swears by her products for their true innovation and multitasking power.

<p>“My bathroom cabinet is lined with oils promising growth, shine, and 101 other benefits, but this is the one I always come back to — and the only oil I actually finished last year. I run a quarter of a pipette through towel-dried hair before blow-drying, and it leaves my hair shinier, softer, and healthier, without even a hint of heaviness. That’s thanks to glycolic acid, which smooths the hair cuticle to reduce frizz, plus hydrating hyaluronic acid suspended in a nourishing yet lightweight oil base. When I skip it, I really notice the difference. Even better, the subtle rose and sandalwood notes mean it doubles as a hair perfume.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I’ve never met a heat protectant that didn’t make my hair feel greasy and look dull — until this. While it’s deeply conditioning thanks to a blend of plant oils and strand-strengthening proteins, it offers lightweight heat protection up to an impressive 450°F. I use it knowing it shields my hair from my flat iron without ever weighing it down, even if I accidentally apply too much. I recently gave a bottle to my mom, who has very dry, bleached blonde hair and usually relies on Olaplex, and she hasn’t stopped raving about how soft it leaves her hair — and how much easier it is to style. She’s a total convert.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“This no-frills cleanser is the skincare product I bought most in 2025. It feels like a lightweight lotion but transforms on contact with water into a silky milk that dislodges mascara and melts foundation, all without leaving skin feeling stripped or tight. The star ingredient is 5% rice milk, a key component in many dew-giving Korean skincare products, along with hydrating hyaluronic acid and ultra-moisturizing glycerin. It does the job of an expensive cleanser at a fraction of the price, and it’s so quick I no longer dread washing my face at night. That’s no small feat!” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“If you’ve asked me on any given day what lipstick I was wearing last fall, it was almost certainly this one. I usually never wear matte liquid lipsticks, and for a few reasons: Too many of them are uncomfortably dry, go on patchy, or migrate at first bite or sip. I was already a fan of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.violettefr.com%2Fproducts%2Fpetal-bouche-amour-fou%3Fvariant%3D43587553755325"">Violette_FR’s iconic Petal Bouche</a> matte liquid lipstick, but its newer addition, Plume Lip, is even better. It has the most incredible whipped texture that effortlessly glides onto lips, and doesn’t feel like dry cement once it sets. I audibly gasped after I swatched the rosy brown Châtaigne Grillée (aka my new go-to for everyday wear) — <em>that’s </em>how stunning she is IRL. Because I’m in my soft girl era, I’m especially loving Plume Lip’s diffused, blurred finish, which is just so pretty and romantic.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“Another <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lancome-lip-idole-juicytreat-gloss-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">breakout favorite among R29’s beauty editors</a> appeared in the form of Lancôme’s JuicyTreat Lip Oil Gloss, which proved that lightning can indeed strike twice. (This, said by a girl who keeps a Juicy Tubes in every bag.) I’m convinced the magic is in the hydrating, naturally plumping benefits, thanks to the squalane-packed formula. Any gloss can sit atop lips with a shiny finish, but true ‘juiciness’ comes from lips that are soft and nourished, then made even better by gloss.

<p>“I’ve lost count of how many blushes — from pressed powders to creams — landed on my desk in 2025, but this is the only one I used consistently. It’s a chunky product, so you only need a single swipe, and it has a subtle iridescence that makes my skin look alive. When I have to join a last-minute virtual call, it’s the product I reach for to look fresh in seconds. I pop it on my cheeks, lids, and lips, and I’m always impressed by how well it stays put, even though it’s a cream. While it’s packed with moisturizing ingredients, including a handful of oils, it never breaks me out. My favorite shade is Rosy Glow.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I recently donated a foot of my hair, and while I love my new bob, the styling learning curve is real. For days when I don’t feel like using a curling iron to enhance my natural waves, I’ve been using mousse as an easy air-dry hack, and my favorite from recent history is, without a doubt, Crown Affair’s Texturizing Air Dry Mousse. It’s easily the most sophisticated mousse I’ve ever tried, and I’m convinced it’s the closest thing to what clouds must feel like. The weightlessness, airy foam has none of the crunch I knew (and hated) from back in the day, and the soft scent (Crown Affair’s signature blend of bergamot, yuzu, and lemongrass) is clean and refreshing. I finger-comb three or four pumps of the stuff into damp strands and watch as my hair air-dries in soft, tousled waves with just the right amount of bounce.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-builder-gel-manicure-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Builder gel manicures</a> are a salon staple for good reason, and we have Olive &amp; June to thank for bringing the technology in an easy, user-friendly format that you can do right at home. I’m a reformed anxious nail biter with notoriously brittle nails as a result, and Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel has been a game-changer for my natural nail journey. Designed in tandem with the brand’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/olive-june-gel-system-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">existing DIY gel system</a>, Olive &amp; June’s Builder Gel polishes (retailing for $12 each) are thicker in texture than traditional gel polish, creating a strong, supportive barrier to help grow your natural nails. My go-to is <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/products/creme-caramel-builder-gel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crème Caramel</a>, a gorgeous sheer, warm beige, and <a href=""https://oliveandjune.com/collections/gel-builder-polish/products/soft-tint-builder-gel"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Soft Tint</a>, a your-nails-but-better sheer veil with a hint of sparkle.

<p>“Last June, I called this the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/elf-halo-glow-skin-tint-spf-50-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">best skin tint</a> for people with olive skin, and I stand by it — I’ve been using it ever since. I’ve tried multiple high-end skin tints and foundations over the past year, but I always come back to this one. It’s more substantial than other tints I’ve tried, yet the coverage is perfect — not too thick, but pigmented enough to blur dark circles and acne marks. It blends in seconds, leaves my skin looking healthy and radiant, <em>and</em> has mineral protection in the form of SPF 50. A pea-sized amount covers my face and neck, and it lasts well into the evening.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

Cosmetics’ Halo Glow Skin Tint</a> was my go-to for most of last year, besting several formulas (including those double the price) in my extensive collection. Nothing I’ve tried (and I’ve tried what feels like hundreds) compares to its lightweight hydration and sheer veil of coverage. (Added SPF 50 is a welcome bonus, even if it doesn’t replace sunscreen as a separate step — say it with me!) I also want to shoutout the niacinamide and bisabol in the formula, two ingredients that my notoriously breakout-prone skin loves. Anything with ‘glow’ in the name tends not to suit my oily complexion, but Halo Glow actually has a wearable, not greasy, finish that genuinely looks like you don’t have makeup on. Between this and the brand’s beloved <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fpower-grip-primer-pimprod2030073%3Fsku%3D2591795"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Power Grip Primer</a> (another personal go-to of mine), I’m racking up e.l.f. faves like Infinity Stones — and don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“ghd is my go-to hair tool brand any day of the week, especially its Curve wand, which gives me the loose, S-shape bends of my dreams. Now, it’s bigger and better. Enter: the new Chronos Max Curve, a larger-barrel wand designed to make light work of thick, long hair. Waving hair can feel like a chore, but this lets me take bigger sections and finish in half the time. What I love about ghd tools is that they deliver results without frazzling your hair — they’re capped at 365°F — yet my waves still last, and my hair always looks incredibly shiny.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“In Paris last August, this scent seemed to follow me everywhere — from the Louvre to Montmartre — and even back to London. It’s become the ultimate European perfume, with people literally chasing strangers to ask what they’re wearing (<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@sasscarella/video/7549550575688437006"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this TikTok alone has 2.8M views</a>). I had to get my hands on a bottle, and I can confirm it’s incredible. It’s equal parts spicy and floral, thanks to creamy jasmine and clean sandalwood, while the ‘solar’ notes make it warm and comforting, like cozying up in your favorite cashmere sweater.

<p>“Last week, I left the house without this and had to turn back to get it — even though I was already a 20-minute walk away by the time I realized. That’s how I knew it deserved a Beauty Innovator Award. One swipe delivers a sheer wash of color, and while it feels like a lip gloss at first, it dries down to a comfortable, moisturizing balm that leaves my usually parched lips feeling soothed and soft. That’ll be the shea butter and plant oils. I’m convinced the subtle shimmer makes my lips look more plump.

<p>“I’ve really put this hairspray through its paces. The first time I used it was before a 10-hour flight that turned into a 24-hour travel day thanks to delays. Even though I slept in it, my waves didn’t budge an inch — so much so that my travel companions were convinced I’d packed a portable curling iron and redone my hair in the airport bathroom. While it delivers a strong hold, there’s no hint of crispiness. Instead, hair stays glossy, flexible, and completely resistant to humidity.

<p>“I was a big fan of Kosas’ debut mascara, The Big Clean, which packed lash serum-like ingredients in an inky black, volumizing mascara.

The brand’s<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/kosas-soulgazer-mascara-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> Soulgazer Mascara</a> was indeed an improvement in every sense. It retained the serum-grade, conditioning peptides with none of the clumping that some users experienced with The Big Clean.

<p>“Call me biased, as I’m a Brit, but UK skincare brand Medik8 really broke the mold with this moisturizer. It’s packed with all the ingredients skin needs to maintain bounce, radiance, and strength. Think peptides that help preserve the skin’s collagen reserves, keeping it soft and supple; polyglutamic acid, which hydrates far more deeply than hyaluronic acid; and growth factors to further support collagen and elastin, the two key proteins that give skin structure and help prevent fine lines.

<p>“I finished this body wash months ago, and I’m still thinking about it. While its main job is to cleanse, the added ingredients make it feel like a treatment. Glycolic acid (an AHA) gently exfoliates and helps fade the marks left by body breakouts, while salicylic acid (a BHA) prevents clogged pores from forming in the first place. Despite a satisfying lather, it’s deeply moisturizing thanks to shea butter and glycerin — I often skipped body lotion altogether.

<p>“When this launched, it was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">talk of our editor Slack channel</a>. I love Tatcha’s original Dewy Moisturizer, but my skin adores this lightweight version even more — so much so that I’ve gone through two bottles in the past year. That’s saying something considering how many moisturizers I need to try for my job. While it’s thinner than its original counterpart, it still delivers a hydrating punch. And the dew? Unrivaled. My skin feels happier and healthier for using it — fewer breakouts and fine lines, better radiance, and a perfect base for makeup. It isn’t greasy or sticky and feels comfortably moisturizing.” <em>— Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director.</em></p>

<p>“I loved this fragrance so much that I wore it on my wedding day last year. (It is now stored in a cool, dark room so I can treasure it forever.) The crisp mix of citrus, white florals, and musk is undeniably romantic, but not super girly or feminine. At first spritz, the bright bergamot and orange blossom are invigorating and clean, but as the scent dries down, I pick up on the lingering floral notes left behind. (This is also a scent that will stay for hours, from getting-ready to dancing the night away.) As the name suggests, it’s an olfactive interpretation of snowy slopes and the cozy appeal of <em>après-ski </em>— fitting as we said ‘I do’ at our favorite ski mountain.” <em>— Karina Hoshikawa, senior beauty writer.</em></p>

<p>“ICYMI, Shark has been absolutely crushing it in the beauty tool space, and its latest hair innovation is no exception. Meet Shark Glam, which combines the same wet-to-dry technology you loved from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">the FlexFusion</a> with faster dry time, shinier results, and less heat damage than its predecessor.

From shielding skin from dry, cold weather to strengthening the skin barrier, proper hydration and moisture (which are two different things, both important: In layman's terms, hydration is more surface-level, lending an immediate softening, plumping effect to skin, while moisturizing locks in hydration via oils/butters to prevent evaporation.) is an essential step in your routine, and one worth investing in.<br /><br />I personally learned (the hard way, might I add) that neglecting moisturizer is honestly, one of the worst things you can do to your skin. As an acne-prone gal, I spent more years than I'd care to admit robbing my face of hydration in the hopes it would curb my breakouts, when in reality, it only exacerbated them since my sebum production skyrocketed as a result of dehydration.<br /><br />As beauty editors, we test hundreds of moisturizers a year, and as such, know a thing or two about the ones that actually work and the ones worth skipping. Ahead, the 12 best moisturizers for dry skin that really quenched our thirst.<br /><br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

For starters, it’s thick — probably the most dense I’ve tried. But it delivers instant, long-lasting relief for very dry, flaky skin, with results that last for hours. When I use it at night, I wake up to skin that looks and feels brand new. That’s thanks to squalane, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin, alongside skin-smoothing ceramides, hydrating niacinamide and cholesterol — a natural lipid that helps repair and maintain the skin barrier, keeping moisture in and bacteria out. The most interesting thing about this moisturizer, though, is the way it dispenses: it comes out like whipped cream.

First up are ceramides, which act like glue between skin cells, keeping skin soft and healthy rather than rough and flaky. Then there’s shea butter, which dermatologists praise for its deeply moisturizing properties, alongside glycerin. Glycerin is both a humectant  (meaning it draws moisture into the skin) and an emollient, helping to keep that moisture locked in. Even though it’s a souped-up moisturizer, it never breaks me out.

In the summer, I like to keep this in the fridge and use it as a cooling mist when I’m about to step out of the house (make sure you’re wearing water-resistant sunscreen, though). You can also put it in a cooler bag and keep it in your car to spray on your body when you’re overheated.” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/brownskinderm/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Adeline Kikam</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist</em></p>

<p>“For my patients with atopic dermatitis, eczema, and dry skin, I always recommend the Lipikar AP+M Cream.

I have dry skin, so I use this moisturizer on my face and all over my body; it’s great at locking in moisture [thanks to ingredients like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">barrier-strengthening ceramides</a> and shea butter, which soothe and hydrate the skin].” <em>— <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drheathermd"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Heather Woolery-Lloyd</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist </em></p>

<p>“I often recommend this serum to women of color, who are predisposed to hyperpigmentation. It <a href=""https://www.laroche-posay.us/melasyl.html"">features Melasyl</a>, a proprietary ingredient that actively targets discoloration. It’s all about prevention: Melasyl blocks the precursors to melanin, effectively stopping the formation of increased pigment in the skin, so you don’t even get the discoloration. For patients prone to hyperpigmentation when getting a chemical peel or microdermal abrasion, I put them on this serum for two to four weeks prior [as hyperpigmentation can be a <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3560165/"">side effect</a> after the procedure].

<p>“I live in Colorado, and many of my patients struggle with dry skin. They’d moisturize with lotions and tell me that their skin still feels really dry. In a lot of cases, they are actually using the wrong body wash. The easiest thing I’d recommend is switching to this shower oil, since it moisturizes while cleansing the skin. The formula is oil-based, so it gives you that extra moisture boost before you even exit the shower and put on body cream.

<p>Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as <em>the</em> outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and <em>wow</em> factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-faux-fur-coats-jackets"">faux-fur coat</a> or the versatility of a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/womens-fall-jackets"">trench coat</a>, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. <br /><br />This season, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-dresses-for-women"">top winter trends</a> point towards bold plaids (or even more dramatic checks), animal print (yes, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-leopard-print-2"">leopard print</a> is always in fashion), and winter whites (to channel Pantone’s Color of the Year: Cloud Dancer). And for silhouettes, it’s time to pull out your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">scarf jackets</a> from a couple of seasons back (or invest in a new one) and bundle up in funnel-neck designs (that don’t require a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oversized-scarf"">chunky scarf</a>). <br /><br />Whether you’re looking for an elevated coat to wear over <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-wedding-guest-dresses-outfits"">winter wedding guest dresses</a> or a cozy cropped jacket to pair with <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-matching-sweatsuits-womens"">lounge sets</a>, you can brave the cold in style.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Plaid Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952061.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The winter calls for festive plaids, especially on your outerwear. This season, the closet mainstay is refreshed with punchier colors and unexpected silhouettes. Think: vibrant color combos, blazers, and bomber jackets. We’re especially eyeing reversible jacket designs that can transform with different outfits and seasons. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Scarf Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952078.png?width=819&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=819%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>It seems like every It-girl on our feeds and on the streets is wearing a scarf coat. The bundled-up silhouette trended a couple of years back — briefly overtaken by the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cape-coats-jackets-trend"">cape jacket</a> — and is back at the forefront. Wear the scarves loosely hanging down or wrapped snugly around your neck (and be sure to also look out for coats with detachable scarves). </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Winter White Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952100.png?width=1024&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1%3A1"" /></figure>



<p>A winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool, a white coat should be in your closet (or in your shopping cart), especially thanks to Pantone’s Cloud Dancer color and the trending <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hm-perfect-moment-collaboration"">après-ski aesthetic</a>. The best part is that you can go down any route, from sporty <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-puffer-jacket"">puffer jackets</a> and wool cropped coats to faux fur zip-ups and wrap trenches.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Funnel Neck Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952122.png?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Funnel neck coats are one of those <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2025-trends"">runway trends</a> that are <em>actually</em> wearable IRL. The exaggerated high necks aren’t just dramatic, they’re also practical for keeping the wind and snow from ruining your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-makeup-looks"">winter makeup looks</a>. You can find the trendy silhouette across leather jackets, wool dress coats, and even longline vests.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Animal Print Coats</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11952143.png?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure>



<p>Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. And an <em>animal print</em> faux-fur coat is an even more bold and playful option. While you can’t go wrong with classic leopards and cheetahs, more unexpected animal prints — like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-wear-cow-print"">cow</a>, zebra, deer, giraffe, and even snow leopard — are trending. There are also non-furry fabrics that can be worn cross-seasonally.</p>

<p><em>You say you want change?</em> Well, the time has come! <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">Action planet Mars</a> is entering the sign of Aquarius, encouraging us to push back popular notions and lean into our one-of-a-kind perspectives. The opportunity to express ourselves is here. As a result, we’ll be able to direct our attention toward the future and take steps to set the intention that will help us attain our dream. First, we must get out of our comfort zones and take a leap of faith. Every visionary has begun their journey here. Let’s get it started! The path less taken is ready for us to walk down. </p>



<p>It’s been over a year since Mars was in the Air sign of Aquarius. Now that it’s coming back into orbit, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/weekly-horoscopes-january-18-to-24-meaning-effects"">January 23rd to March 2nd</a>, we are reaffirming our commitment to causes and striving to give our best to care for others in our community. Mars in Aquarius isn’t shy about giving us the stamina to assert ourselves. Still, this transit does require a more innovative approach to taking a stance and defining our needs and desires. This often marks a time of uprising and rebellion, when we speak our minds and take a stand to assert our personal beliefs. Note that this can transcend in any form — from something as simple as defying the “norms” of relationships to fashion trends to peer groups. We’re elevating our lives to showcase our unique sentiments, feelings, and talents. </p>



<p>While it is fantastic to captivate an audience and to hold personal power, the caveat is that once we get on our soapboxes, it’ll be hard to listen to different perspectives and not force our ideals onto others. Knowing when to slow down and take a step back can be challenging, but it’s essential. To effect change in the world, we must have an open mind and accept that everyone holds different views — even if we disagree with them. However, having an active discourse and debate is a great way to harness the diverse ways people think. A moderator, or mutual acquaintance, should be present to ensure we do not take the conversation too far — especially on January 19th, when Mars and Pluto form a conjunction in Aquarius (this is an astrological aspect that occurs when two planets come together in the same sign and degree) triangulating circumstances.   </p>



<p>Being a social justice warrior will be at the forefront of our hearts and passions. Still, it’s also vital to examine situations that require assistance on both a smaller scale and a collective level. Focusing on social dynamics, injustices, and local issues in our neighborhoods or cities will be necessary. Try to be more involved in politics, voter registration, or even participate in charitable endeavors. Paying it forward will be rewarding on many levels, particularly when it comes to our aspirations to better the common good — a vibe we will feel during the Snow Full Moon in Leo on February 1st. </p>



<p>When it comes to friendships and relationships, we often find ourselves drawn to those who align with our aspirations. Looking at the people who add fun, excitement, and push us to think outside the box propels us to regenerate our lives and be different. Their presence reassures and inspires us to be our best, most authentic selves. We can live freely and authentically, thanks to Mars in Aquarius. February 27th motivates us to take the leap towards confidence and embracing ourselves, due to Uranus in Taurus squaring off with Mars. We’ll want to make a break into the purest essences that define us. </p>



<p>Mars in Aquarius is going to be a moment in which we strive to be greater. We aren’t going to sit back and let life happen. Be bold and daring! By taking a firm stand, we can do our best to implement transformation and evolution — not only in the world but also in our personal lives. The goal is to improve in any way we can, so what are you waiting for?</p>

<p>If 2025 was the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">year of the bob</a>, then 2026 is the year that the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/01/11843952/pixie-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie cut </a>steals the spotlight back.  </p>



<p>Some might say that last year’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-two-in-one-haircut-trend"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">jaw-grazing cuts</a> were just leading up to this moment—and they’d probably be right. We can’t scroll through Instagram without spotting a meticulously carved <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-haircut-trends-2025"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">pixie crop</a>, whether on a celebrity like <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Teyana Taylor</a> or an influencer like <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@yeslydimate?lang=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yesly Dimate</a>. </p>



<p>There isn’t a pixie cut that <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">David Boardman</a> — a hairstylist located at <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cutlersalon/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cutler Salon</a> in New York — hasn’t mastered, and he has a sense of why it’s making a huge comeback in 2026: “It’s all about individuality and boldness,” Boardman tells R29. “It’s a style that blends softness and ease, allowing you to play with volume and texture.”  </p>



<p>Boardman says that you can “slim” it down for a sleek, tapered look or add fullness for a more dynamic shape. “Ultimately, the pixie cut accentuates your best features and brings out your personality in the most authentic way,” he says.  </p>



<p>Spoiled for choice? We’ve done the hard work for you. Our edit of the best pixie cuts is all the inspiration you need to show your stylist. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DLXiJTPqBMI/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Content creator Sia</a> proves that a pixie cut can be chic with this straight-across style. The chopped-in fringe adds a subtle edge, taking it from bowl-like to modern. To achieve that bitty, separated finish at the front, your stylist will cut vertically into the strands as a final touch. </p>

<p>This cut sits in a cozy space between a pixie and a shag. While it’s shorter at the back and sides, hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DEpyRiHMMZt/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Justė Sidabraitė</a> has left plenty of length on top so the curls can be scrunched and mussed up using a texturizing product for added volume. </p>

<p>The way hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/davidboardman_/?hl=en"">David Boardman</a> has cut this pixie makes the model’s hair look sculpted, almost as if it’s been carved. It’s all in the subtle short layers, the face-framing pieces, and the softer, longer sides. </p>

<p>One thing that comes with the territory of being a beauty director is that friends, family, and colleagues always tap me for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skincare-advice-2026"">skincare advice</a> — over text, email, or even in the office bathroom. Unlike a dermatologist or esthetician, I’m not a qualified expert, though I like to think I’ve got a little knowledge under my belt. But one skin dilemma that’s stumping even me is why everyone thinks their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-inkey-list-advanced-retinal-serum-review"">skin looks so dull</a> right now. </p>



<p>Maybe it’s colder weather, central heating, or a lingering post-holiday skin hangover. Whatever the cause, dullness is a skin concern most of us are dealing with — so I asked a top dermatologist to break down what’s behind it and what actually helps. Without further ado, here’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/citric-acid-skincare-benefits"">how to make dull skin radiant</a> in a few easy steps, many of which you can do with products you likely already have at home. </p>



<h2>What does dull skin look like? </h2>



<p>Dermatologist <a href=""https://drophelia.com/"">Dr. Ophelia Veraitch</a> says that “dull skin” isn’t a medical or dermatologic diagnosis: “It’s a descriptive term used to explain skin that lacks clarity, even tone, and light reflection,” she explains. When the skin’s surface becomes uneven, she adds, it prevents light from reflecting properly, making the complexion appear flat or tired. </p>



<h2>What causes dull skin? </h2>



<p>I hate to break it to you, but there could be a long list of factors behind dull-looking skin. The first — and most obvious — is a buildup of dead skin cells, says Dr. Veraitch. Your skin naturally sheds dead skin cells as newer ones take their place, but some skin types might need a little help clearing them. More on that later.  </p>



<p>Another underlying cause of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skincare-dry-skin-dermatologist-advice"">dull skin is dehydration</a>, says Dr. Veraitch. While drinking water throughout the day supports overall health and skin, topical hydration through lotions and serums is also important for combating dullness. </p>



<p>Environmental stressors are another factor. Pollution particles, Dr. Veraitch explains, can cling to dead skin cells, oil, and sweat, leaving behind an uneven, lackluster surface. </p>



<p>What’s more, skin inflammation — from conditions <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-acne-skincare-advice"">like acne</a>, psoriasis, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sex-trigger-rosacea-flare-up"">or rosacea</a> — as well as hormonal skin changes such as melasma, and a compromised <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-soothing-barrier-support-serum-review"">skin barrier</a> (like dry or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanning-beds-eczema-treatment-dermatologist-advice"">eczema-prone skin</a>) can all contribute to dullness. </p>



<h2>How can you get rid of dull skin and make it brighter? </h2>



<p>Dr. Veraitch suggests it’s important not to self-diagnose: “The most effective way to treat dull skin is to identify and manage any underlying cause,” she says. “This is why I always recommend seeing a dermatologist first — particularly if dullness is driven by inflammation, pigmentation, or a chronic skin condition.”  </p>



<p>Perhaps you only experience occasional breakouts and don’t have a chronic skin condition. If so, Dr. Veraitch says you can simply adjust your at-home skincare routine — and keeping it consistent plays an important role in improving skin brightness. </p>



<h2>What are the best skincare products for dull skin? </h2>



<p>First up: exfoliation — specifically, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">the chemical kind</a>. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are especially effective at lifting dull, dead skin cells and revealing healthy new ones. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">Glycolic acid</a> is arguably the most popular recommendation among skin experts for its ability to brighten the skin, minimize the appearance of hyperpigmentation, and smooth rough texture over time. A leave-on toner or serum applied at night is your best option. </p>



<p>A favorite of mine is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fglycolic-acid-7-exfoliating-brightening-daily-toner-pimprod2007097"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating and Brightening Daily Toner</a>, which contains 7% glycolic acid. After cleansing, I pour a little onto a cotton pad and swipe it over my entire face and neck each evening, then follow with a simple, hydrating moisturizer. </p>



<p>Seven per cent glycolic acid is relatively high, so if you’re new to AHAs, go a little lower. Beauty editors wax lyrical about <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftatcha-the-texture-tonic-P479352%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tatcha The Texture Tonic AHA Liquid Exfoliating Treatment</a> with exfoliating glycolic acid and soothing Japanese mugwort, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fgreen-plum-refreshing-toner-P517632%3FskuId%3D2896272%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap517632%3Aproduct"">Beauty of Joseon Refreshing Toner</a>, with glycolic acid and moisturizing glycerin.  </p>



<p>If your skin is on the sensitive side, consider lactic acid. Its molecules are larger than those in glycolic acid, which means it absorbs into the skin more slowly and gently — making it a better choice for reactive skin types. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fsuper-serum-night-repair-5-in-1-face-serum-pimprod2041036%3Fsku%3D2615447"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olay Super Serum Night Repair 5-in-1 Face Serum</a>, which combines lactic acid with skin-strengthening peptides, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Flactic-acid-10-ha-2-high-strength-exfoliating-serum-uneven-texture-pimprod2007103%3Fsku%3D2551156"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA 2%</a>, which contains 5% lactic acid and hyaluronic acid for added hydration. </p>



<p>Exfoliating acids make skin sensitive to sunlight, so be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-reviews"">high-factor, broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> during the daytime.  </p>



<h2>Is retinol good for dull skin? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinoids like retinol, retinal</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tretinoin-skin-benefits-risks"">prescription-strength tretinoin</a> also help improve skin brightness. If you’re a beginner, the same rules apply: go low and slow. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fstarter-retinol-us-P520372"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Inkey List’s new Starter Retinol Serum</a> or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP427418"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion</a>. Both contain granactive retinoids, which are formulated to release slowly and gently into the skin, helping reduce irritation. </p>



<p>If you’re a pro, Dr. Veraitch recommends her <a href=""https://drophelia.com/products/anti-ageing-night-serum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Night Serum</a> with tretinoin, which increases cell turnover and improves overall skin clarity.  </p>



<p>You can use retinol and exfoliating acids in the same routine, but it pays to be smart. The number one rule? Don’t layer them, which can leave your skin sore, sensitive, and dry. It’s better to use glycolic acid at night after cleansing, then introduce retinol a couple of nights later, always following with moisturizer and applying sunscreen in the morning. </p>



<h2>Are antioxidants good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Once you’ve got your evening skincare figured out, Dr. Veraitch suggests adding one more ingredient to your morning routine: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">an antioxidant</a>. There are plenty to choose from, including <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C,</a> resveratrol, vitamin E, ferulic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunday-riley-b3-nice-niacinamide-serum-review"">and niacinamide</a>. Each works a little differently, but at their core, they all help protect skin from environmental aggressors — like smoke and UV — that can make it appear dull. </p>



<p>Arguably, the most popular antioxidant is vitamin C, which acts like a force field around the skin while brightening in the process. Dr. Veraitch often recommends <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dermstore.com%2Fp%2Fskinceuticals-c-e-ferulic-with-15-l-ascorbic-acid-vitamin-c-serum-30ml%2F11289609%2F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</a> to her patients to protect against oxidative stress and boost radiance. It contains a trifecta of antioxidants: vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid. If you’d prefer to spend less, try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fbright-icon-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-serum-pimprod2052406%3Fsku%3D2640211"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">e.l.f. Bright Icon Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Serum</a>. For even better results, apply your antioxidant serum <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-sunscreen-spf-oily-skin"">before sunscreen</a> to maximize protection against UV rays. </p>



<h2>Which facials are good for dull skin? </h2>



<p>Lastly, if you have a bigger budget, Dr. Veraitch suggests a medical-grade treatment, which she says can significantly accelerate results. She likes to combine the <a href=""https://skinspanewyork.com/products/hydrafacial%C2%AE-platinum"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">HydraFacial Platinum</a> — a non-invasive facial that removes dead skin cells — with extractions. “I follow this with <a href=""https://www.clearandbrilliant.com/"">Clear + Brilliant</a>, a low-energy laser that gently but effectively brightens the skin, refines texture, and evens out skin tone.” Even better, there’s no downtime. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-biting-best-strengthening-products"">Growing out my nails</a> has never been my strong suit. Until recently, I could barely make it a few weeks before breaking one while doing something as untaxing as zipping up my jeans, let alone facing every nail’s nemesis: the ring pull on a can of Coke. </p>



<p>To give them a fighting chance, I’d take skin, hair, and nail supplements like they were going out of fashion, wear gloves while carrying out even the smallest of chores, and refrain from using my nails as tools to open my mail (we all do it). Frustratingly, none of those things worked. What I needed was some expert guidance. </p>



<p>Over the past year, I’ve collected tips and tricks from nail technicians, dermatologists, and even TikTok’s manicure obsessives. But I won’t gatekeep. These are the six simple, and most importantly, affordable pieces of advice I was given for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/japanese-manicure-nails-trend"">longer, stronger nails</a> that actually worked.  </p>



<h2>I chose cuticle oil over nail hardeners</h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.drdanastern.com/"">Dr. Dana Stern</a>, board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2F"">Dr. Dana</a>, says that the cuticle is the nail’s natural protective seal. When it becomes dry and dehydrated, it’s compromised: “When this happens, water and moisture can enter the nail unit,” she says. “This causes all sorts of problems, including redness and swelling,” and eventually, the nail could grow irregularly: “Think white patches, bumps, thickening, and discoloration,” she says. </p>



<p>While most nail technicians will trim or remove dead cuticle skin during a manicure for aesthetic reasons, using cuticle oil still offers multiple benefits for the remaining skin surrounding your nails, as I’ve discovered: “Regular application of cuticle oil helps maintain hydration,” says consultant dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drzainab.dermatology/?hl=en"">Dr. Zainab Laftah</a>. “Hydration benefits both the nail and surrounding skin by reducing brittleness, enhancing nail health, supporting healthy nail growth, and preventing infections,” she adds. </p>



<p>Unlike nail hardeners, which can make nails a little <em>too</em> hard, session manicurist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/amistreets/?hl=en"">Ami Streets</a> says that cuticle oil keeps nails flexible, withstanding everyday wear and tear. “Cuticle oil is the best product for growing nails — and my most recommended item to add to your beauty routine,” she says. </p>



<p>Dr. Dana recommends her <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrdananails.com%2Fproducts%2Fnourishing-cuticle-oil"">Nourishing Cuticle Oil</a>, with jojoba oil and indigo naturalis, a Chinese plant known to repair and strengthen the skin barrier. Complete with a handy roller ball for easy, drip-free application, it’s an oil I can vouch for, having used it down to the very last drop. Another of my favorites is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fvitamin-e-nail-cuticle-oil-xlsImpprod17821169%3Fsku%3D2523202"">Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, with moisturizing vitamin E and a dream team of nourishing plant oils. Streets also loves <a href=""https://amzn.to/42WVpGa"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">L’Occitane Shea Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil</a>, which is twice as moisturizing as the impressive hand cream in the same collection, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicacosmetics.com%2Fproducts%2Fphenomen-oil"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Phenomenoil</a>, another oil we’ve both used up.    </p>



<p>Besides ingredients, exactly how you use your cuticle oil matters, too. Streets says that a single drop on each cuticle is ample — and it’s best applied at night to give the oil time to absorb. Not only does cuticle oil hydrate deeper than hand creams, but Streets and Dr. Dana say that the massaging motion could help stimulate circulation and promote nail growth, too.  </p>





<h2>I switched from traditional gel to builder gel — or BIAB</h2>



<p>Not all gel nail polish is created equal. On my brittle nails, most would chip quickly. I’d then pick off the polish and damage my nails even further. It wasn’t until a fellow beauty journalist recommended <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hard-biab-manicure-strengthen-weak-nails"">Builder in a Bottle</a> — also known as BIAB or builder gel — that my nails grew long and strong. I’m almost a year in, and I haven’t had a single chip or break. They’re growing so quickly that I always ask my nail technician to cut them down. </p>



<p>“Builder in a Bottle is a specific type of gel that lends strength and structure to natural nails,” explains Streets. Thanks to its stronger base, Streets says that it’s a great option for those who want to reinforce their nails while trying to grow them, as they can last up to three weeks. Another great thing about BIAB is that it can be infilled, says Streets. This involves getting the grown-out gap near your cuticles filled in with more gel, rather than having to fully remove the polish each time. “This allows natural nails to maintain growth,” adds Streets, but she recommends a maximum of two to three repeated infills before having a short break to keep your nails healthy and happy.</p>



<p>Thanks to BIAB’s harder, more durable finish, Dr. Dana says that it not only serves as a “protective armor” for nails, but it typically has a forgiving, less damaging removal process by soaking off, so it tends to be more advantageous than other nail enhancements like acrylics. “I’ve seen patients who use BIAB and have very healthy nails in comparison to my patients who wear acrylics and do constant soak-off gels,” she says, adding that BIAB’s durable nature also makes it a good option for nail biters. </p>



<h2>I addressed my vitamin D deficiency</h2>



<p>When a blood test revealed that my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin"">vitamin D</a> levels were low, I began taking a 2000 IU vitamin D supplement daily alongside my trusty omega-3, 6, and 9. While there are multiple health benefits to both, Dr. Laftah points out that they could have additional advantages for nails: “Addressing a vitamin D deficiency can improve nail health as low levels can result in brittle nails,” she tells me. Interestingly, <a href=""https://ijdvl.com/nails-in-nutritional-deficiencies/"">one small study</a> suggests that hapalonychia — a condition that causes nails to become soft and prone to breakage — has been associated with vitamin D deficiency. As for omega-3? “Incorporating omega-3 fatty acids into your diet may also benefit nails by providing essential nutrients that support overall nail strength and integrity,” Dr. Laftah says.</p>



<p>However, Dr. Dana points out that no robust studies prove that vitamins or supplements benefit nail health. But since nails are made of keratin (a type of protein), she suggests that if your diet lacks sufficient protein, it may be worth considering protein supplementation to improve the condition of your nails. Streets also advises incorporating more protein into your diet and drives home the importance of staying hydrated. </p>



<p>Before adding supplements to your routine, consult your doctor to ensure they’re safe and suitable for you.</p>



<h2>I took hand cream very seriously</h2>



<p>Previously, I’d only use lotion when my hands were uncomfortably dry and on the verge of cracking. Over the past few months, though, I’ve <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"">taken moisturizing very seriously</a>, and I’m convinced that keeping my hands adequately hydrated throughout the day has also benefited my nails. </p>



<p>I was right. For clients who want longer, stronger nails, Dr. Laftah recommends moisturizing regularly to maintain hydration. “Using a nourishing and hydrating hand cream can help,” adds Streets. “Not only does it keep skin in a supple and soft condition, but it can also act as a protective barrier against environmental stressors,” — like cold weather. Streets says that dry, cracked skin and cuticles can lead to infection or weak nail growth, so consistent daily use of a moisturizing product is essential. </p>



<p>If you want fast hydration without the sticky feel, I love <a href=""https://amzn.to/4jIh9eJ"">Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Hand Cream</a>. If your hands are especially dry, my all-time favorite hand lotion is <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fca%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fhand-creams-P307907"">L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream</a>. The silky soft feeling sticks around for hours — even post-hand-wash. “On application, make sure you use a massaging motion,” advises Streets. “It can help to boost blood flow to hands and cuticles, which supports new nail growth even further.”</p>



<h2>I started using a glass nail file</h2>



<p>Dr. Dana believes that many nail files, particularly traditional, rough emery boards, can be too abrasive for natural nails, potentially causing “microscopic tears” that lead to splits and breakage. That’s where glass or crystal nail files come in. On days when I gave my nails a break from BIAB, I’d file away rough edges with a glass file, which I’m certain is kinder on nails. </p>



<p>“In contrast [to emery boards], glass creates a perfectly smooth, split-free edge to the nail,” says Dr. Dana, who uses the <a href=""https://amzn.to/3CH5w7g"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Precision Glass File</a>. Likewise, Streets believes that a glass nail file is a worthwhile investment for at-home manicures: “They provide a finer and more controlled filing experience, and the smooth edges help seal the keratin layers at the nail’s edge, preventing splitting, peeling, and snagging that can occur when using a rougher emery board.” What’s more, Streets points out that glass nail files are non-porous and can be washed or sanitized between uses.</p>



<h2>Lastly, I exfoliated my nails</h2>



<p>With its ability to exfoliate the skin, leaving it smoother and brighter, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/the-ordinary-glycolic-acid-scalp-treatment-dandruff"">glycolic acid</a> is a staple in many skincare routines, but it can benefit your natural nails, too. In between BIAB appointments, I’ve often applied a glycolic acid toner to my nails and cuticles using a cotton swab, then followed with a glug of cuticle oil. The result? Fewer flakes and a stronger, smoother canvas for nail polish. If you’d rather not DIY, try the Dr. Dana <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fnail-renewal-system-set-30-value%2F7951571%3Forigin%3Dcategory-personalizedsort%26breadcrumb%3DHome%252FBrands%252FDr.%2520Dana%26color%3D000"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nail Renewal System</a>, a once-weekly, 3-step nail system that boasts glycolic acid, a nail primer, and a hydrating gel-oil to reveal healthy, hydrated, and shiny nails, fast. “It’s perfect for brittle, peeling, weak nails, post-gel damage, or if you simply want a gorgeous, healthy-looking shine without having to go to the salon,” says Dr. Dana. </p>
