<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/02/11960582/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">2026 BAFTAs</a> gave us much to celebrate. Rich, exciting, complex Black filmmaking was given its due, with multiple awards going to Black cinematic artists. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11881716/sinners-movie-ending-explained-wunmi-mosaku-interview"">Blockbuster horror <em>Sinners</em></a>, the British Nigerian coming of age story <a href=""https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/entertainment/my-fathers-shadow-wins-outstanding-debut-at-2026-bafta/2026/""><em>My Father’s Shadow</em>,</a> and British short animation <a href=""https://www.channel4.com/programmes/two-black-boys-in-paradise""><em>Two Black Boys in Paradise</em></a> collectively won an incredible five BAFTAs. <em>Sinners</em> Director <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11884333/sinners-true-story-robert-johnson-ryan-coogler-box-office-success"">Ryan Coogler </a>made history as the <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/ryan-coogler-first-black-person-bafta-original-screenplay-1236666022/"">first Black winner</a> for Original Screenplay. It was also a night that recognized the lived reality of <a href=""https://tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia/"">Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprolalia</a>; the emotional, heartwarming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWqQN3snCU"">film <em>I Swear</em></a> documents the struggles <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n9709g0go"">Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson</a> has with the disability, and other people’s ignorance of it. The film won three BAFTAs including a surprising <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv05r8dgpo"">Best Actor win for lead actor Robert Aramayo</a>.    </p>



<p>Within that celebratory same space, an uncomfortable, unfortunate incident unfolded: one that was difficult for everyone involved, and which has since been stripped of context and complexity by a slew of online commentators who favor uncompromising hot takes over nuance and in doing so, have arguably made a sad situation far worse. </p>



<p>During the live broadcast, an involuntary <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tourettes-bafta-film-awards-bbc-john-davidson-sinners-1236512321/"">vocal tic from Davidson</a> was picked up by microphones while <em>Sinners</em> <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/bafta-awards-2026-tourettes-n-word-outburst"">stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo</a> were on stage presenting an award. The outburst included the offensive racist term the n-word, prompting a response from the <a href=""https://people.com/michael-b-jordan-delroy-lindo-onstage-baftas-racial-slur-tourettes-activist-11911616"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceremony’s host, Alan Cumming</a>, who stated: “If you have seen the film <em>I Swear</em>, you will know that film is about the experience of a person with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a disability, and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you were offended.” Despite being pre-recorded, the moment was broadcast live to millions by the BBC, creating a situation that was distressing for the actors on stage, the audience, and likely Davidson himself, who reportedly later left the ceremony early of his own accord.</p>



<p>It, of course, wasn’t easy to witness two Black people have a racial slur directed at them particularly in such a public manner, and on an evening where their art was being lauded by award ceremonies that historically have underrewarded Black filmmaking. The moment where both Jordan and Lindo register what’s been shouted at them, before almost immediately recomposing themselves and continuing, was a sad and likely familiar scenario to anyone who has ever publicly endured slurs. It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wider context has been largely absent from much of the online commentary, but here’s what we know about the details leading up to the event: BAFTA reportedly made guests aware in advance of Davidson’s experiences of involuntary vocal tics. I don’t agree with the ignorant arguments that have been fired off that dismiss Tourette’s Syndrome, including suggestions that Davidson should have been banned from the ceremony altogether, and that he was an unrepentant racist who must have meant what he said. Even actor <a href=""https://www.aol.com/articles/jamie-foxx-weighs-michael-b-125419991.html"">Jamie Foxx has chimed in</a> unhelpfully saying on instagram “Nah he meant that sh*t”. It’s quite shocking to hear almost medieval arguments that disabled people be locked away from public view in 2026. Such responses disregard the reality that Tourette’s can be profoundly distressing for those who live with it; involving loss of bodily control, deep shame, and a constant fear of public misunderstanding. </p>



<p>But harm was caused. The word at the centre of this incident carries a specific and brutal history of violence, degradation, and dehumanization directed at Black people; a history that continues to shape lived experience today. In a global political moment marked by the resurgence of openly racist rhetoric, policies, and state violence, audiences are likely even more raw and sensitive to its use. That context does not justify the ableist or deeply unempathetic responses directed at John Davidson. But given that Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage representing <em>Sinners</em> — a film that directly grapples with the history and ongoing cycle of racism in the United States — it does help explain the depth of feeling, and why this moment which shouldn’t have been aired landed with such visceral force. Who was protecting Jordan and Lindo in the moment, and the Black audience watching? </p>



<p>Variety reported other incidents of Davidson’s Tourettes throughout the ceremony, including  shouting “shut the f-ck up” at BAFTA chair Sara Putt and saying “f-ck you” as the award for best children’s and family film was being accepted. Based on what we know about the disability, these actions were involuntary and not a malicious act. The attempt to ascribe the incident as a personal, moral failure of Davidson’s is wrong and unhelpful. It’s a horrible irony that an evening where a film like <em>I Swear </em>won so much praise has almost immediately been followed with proof of precisely why the film is so necessary. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The real issue in this story appears to be institutional. The BBC and the BAFTAs made a deliberate editorial decision to air the incident, despite the BAFTAs having been filmed approximately two hours prior to broadcast. This sits uneasily alongside the fact that references to “Free Palestine,” as well as mentions of Congo and Sudan, were trimmed from <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My Father’s Shadow” </a></em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">filmmaker Davies Jr.’s acceptance speech</a>. In response to criticism, a BBC spokesperson stated: “The live event is three hours and it has to be reduced to two hours for its on-air slot. The same happened to other speeches made during the night and all edits were made to ensure the programme was delivered to time. All winners’ speeches will be available to watch via BAFTA’s YouTube channel.”</p>



<p>That explanation raises more questions than it resolves. It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. Given the broadcaster’s clear capacity to edit sensitively and selectively, it is reasonable to ask why this segment was left intact, or why the audio was not muted, particularly when doing so might have mitigated harm for everyone involved. Now, the clip has been shared widely, including the word, causing a firestorm that could have — in part — been avoided. Jordan and Lindo shouldn’t have had to endure that slur being yelled at them, and Davidson shouldn’t have had his disability used against him in such a public manner.  The events that have unfolded suggest the BBC has an institutional bias in terms of what it regards as offensive, which lines up with its <a href=""https://cfmm.org.uk/resource/bbc-on-gaza-israel-one-story-double-standards/"">egregious wider reporting</a> on issues such as the <a href=""https://www.un.org/unispal/document/special-rapporteur-report-gaza-genocide-a-collective-crime-20oct25/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Israeli genocide in Palestine. </a></p>



<p>The BBC issued an apology this morning (ET), hours after the widespread backlash: “We apologise that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.” By the time the apology was issued, the clip had already circulated widely across social media, fuelling outrage, misinformation, and deeply ableist and racist commentary, and leaving Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo, and John Davidson to absorb the public fallout. There has been no public reflection on addressing the editorial judgement and criteria that allowed it to be broadcast in the first place.</p>



<p>These moments reflect some of the most destructive habits of online political culture, that many Black writers and thinkers have often highlighted as unhelpful in the wider scheme of things. People’s very real grievances can easily be projected onto these more tricky hyper-visible pop culture moments, and a desire for outrage and simplistic, absolutist punishment end up taking precedence over a more serious, empathetic conversation that can encompass multiple things at once. This flawed logic often relies on an explicit hierarchy of suffering, where your suffering must take total priority over another’s, but that framework is neither radical or effective. We live in a world that feels like it’s on fire, and racism is now a visceral daily reality in our politics.  Perhaps the powerlessness people feel means these moments unfairly become proxies for broader, deeper rage at an unjust world that no one seems to know how to fix. It’s a sad rinse and repeat cycle that we’re trapped in.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended.</p><cite>‘sinners’ production designer hannah beachler on ‘x’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A number of disabled Black people, including some who have Tourtettes have provided far more caring, nuanced perspectives on the situation. <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5j3eXb/"">@sh4ysgrwm</a> on TikTok pushed back on the idea that tics can be controlled, clarifying that it’s the result of “neurons misfiring…we have got to stop thinking with our feelings and start thinking with logic. It’s ok to be offended, but it’s not ok to be ableist and try to make it seem like those with Tourettes, specifically those with Coprolelia, say their tics on purpose.” Misunderstanding these conditions can have wider and more troubling consequences. When public opinion and policy defaults to individual moral judgement, it is racialized disabled people who are most likely to face even harsher treatment, disbelief, or punishment. Involuntary tics from Black people are even more likely to be perceived as threatening or dangerous; it’s clearly in everyone’s interests to better understand and support people with these disabilities. </p>



<p>The impact of Davidson’s disability was harmful and many Black disability advocades are calling for him to apologize. I am uncomfortable with the idea of Davidson having to apologize for his disability (although he may personally wish to as I assume he probably felt terrible about it) because of the precedent that sets for disabled people. It’s true that we may be giving this white man more grace than a Black disabled person (especially a Black woman) may get in his situation, but I think the apology and changed behavior really needs to come from the institutions themselves.  </p>



<p>“I keep trying to write about what happened at the <a href=""https://variety.com/t/baftas/"">BAFTAs</a>, and I can’t find the words,” BAFTA nominee and <em>Sinners</em> production designer Hannah Beachler, posted on X after the ceremony, <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/global/sinners-hannah-beachler-n-word-slur-baftas-apology-1236670089/"">reported by Variety</a>. “The situation is almost impossible, but it happened 3 times that night, and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.. and a third time at a Black woman,” she wrote. “I understand and deeply know why this is an impossible situation. I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended…but our frequency, our spiritual vibration is tuned to a higher level than what happened.. This did not bounce off of me, but I exist above it. It can’t take away from who I am as an artist.” Delroy Lindo later said at one of the BAFTA after parties that he wished <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/delroy-lindo-bafta-n-word-michael-b-jordan-1236670222/"">“someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards”</a> confirming both BAFTA and the BBC have shown a significant lack of planning, safeguarding and aftercare even after the incident. BAFTA’s lackluster apology during the broadcast sits alongside what appears to be a total lack of accountability for the situation all parties were placed in. </p>



<p>Aside from needing far better media institutions, this episode underlines why art remains indispensable. At its best, it gives us language for experiences we do not have first hand knowledge of, and it asks us to sit with discomfort and contradictions. Many of the best films showcased at the awards resist the urge to collapse human complexity, and the friction that can come with it, into simplistic ideas. A little less time on social media and a bit more time with art might be a good place to start- and it’s clear that the decision-makers at the BAFTAs and BBC need to learn from the very art these institutions are celebrating.   </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960571.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/keren_bartov/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Keren Bartov</a> has magic hands — it’s the only explanation for why I left her treatment room with the glowiest skin of my life. But don’t just take my word for it: she’s the celebrity esthetician behind some of the dewiest skin <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">at the BAFTAs</a> over the weekend, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"">Teyana Taylor,</a> Jessie Buckley, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katehudson/?hl=en"">Kate Hudson</a>. No wonder she’s in such high demand — Bartov’s skincare knowledge is exceptional, and she knows exactly how to make skin look its best under the spotlight.</p>



<p>Bartov is so sought after that she has a four-storey, state-of-the-art facial clinic in London’s Notting Hill. Her clinic might be hi-tech (it promises more beep-boop machines than you could imagine), but Bartov believes it’s how you take care of your skin at home that really matters. </p>



<p>With that in mind, here are all the smart skincare rules I learned from Bartov and her team during a facial treatment.</p>



<h2>Don’t sleep on your cleansing routine</h2>



<p>Cleansing your skin effectively is the best thing you can do for it, according to Bartov. If you’re not lifting away your sunscreen, makeup, and all of the grime you’ve collected throughout the day, any skincare you apply in the evening won’t work to the best of its ability — and that’s a serious waste of both product and money. </p>



<p>Before you do anything, Bartov suggests washing your hands for at least 30 seconds. “Otherwise you’re putting bacteria all over your skin when you want to be washing it off — and that makes no sense at all,” she says. Bartov adds that this step is especially important for those with acne-prone skin, as oil and dirt can easily clog pores.</p>



<p>Simple is best, too. Bartov doesn’t enlist fancy cleansing devices, nor flannels or cloths. Your fingers are the best tools for the job. She recommends double cleansing at the end of the day (washing your face once and following up with a second cleanse, or using micellar water to remove makeup and then doing a proper, water-based cleanse) for at least a minute each time. </p>





<h2>These ingredients are the best for breakouts</h2>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">benefits of exfoliating acids</a> on acne-prone skin (for both preventing breakouts and minimizing the skin staining left behind) are well known, but it’s how you use them that matters. I often have blackheads, whiteheads, and little under-the-skin pimples, so Bartov layered salicylic acid (which exfoliates deep inside the pore to prevent breakouts) and azelaic acid (another exfoliating acid, which reduces redness and minimizes pigmentation over time). </p>



<p>Look for smart products that contain both, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpaula-s-choice-10-azelaic-acid-booster-P469507"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paula’s Choice 10% Azelaic Acid Booster</a>, which can be combined with a simple moisturizer. </p>



<h2>Wait for your skincare to absorb</h2>



<p>Bartovs clinician said that patience is a virtue when layering serums and moisturizers. She suggested waiting at least three minutes between applying each skincare product so as not to disturb it on the skin and to give it time to fully absorb and work its magic. If it means you have to brush your teeth or tinker around the bathroom for a moment, that’s fine. It’s worth it to get the most out of your skincare. And always take any excess product right down to your neck and chest area, which Bartov said is often neglected. </p>



<h2>Try these three ingredients for rejuvenated skin all year round</h2>



<p>“<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinol</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"">peptides</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> are important ingredients for stimulating collagen and elastin, and giving a glow to the skin,” said Bartov, who suggests using a retinol serum in the evening only. </p>



<p>Peptides (essentially skin-repairing proteins) are sneaking into all kinds of skincare products lately, particularly moisturizers, and they are tolerated well across the board. R29 rates <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnaturium-multi-peptide-moisturizer-1-7-oz%2F-%2FA-82247120"">Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer</a>, which hydrates, moisturizes, and protects skin. It also features vitamin C to shield against pollution. </p>



<p>If you’re already using a vitamin C serum that you love, follow it up with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455369"">The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP514671"">Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Gel-Cream Moisturizer,</a> both of which can be used in the morning and the evening. </p>





<p>If you’re using retinol at night, be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum, high-factor sunscreen</a> during the daytime, as retinol can make skin sensitive to sunlight.</p>





<h2>Avoid this one thing if you’re prone to breakouts</h2>



<p>As Bartov mentioned earlier, vitamin C is a brilliant ingredient for protecting skin against pollution and other environmental aggressors, as well as minimizing pigmentation and skin staining. But if you have active breakouts, Bartov suggests avoiding it altogether. L-ascorbic acid is currently a popular form of vitamin C as it’s really potent, but it could irritate in the form of stinging or burning, particularly on open skin. It can be especially irritating at higher concentrations. </p>



<p>While vitamin C is unlikely to make your breakouts worse (or <em>cause</em> them, for that matter), it can make your skin even more sensitive. If you really want to try it, skip the strong stuff and go for something like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">ascorbyl glucoside</a>, which is derived from vitamin C. I love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP442756"">The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%</a>. Make sure it’s oil-free. </p>





<h2>Take sun safety seriously</h2>



<p>Bartov is the first to admit that she enjoys a handful of vices in life and doesn’t believe in cutting out certain foods or drinks. But basking in the sun is a no-go. Not only does it accelerate the aging process, but it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">linked to skin cancer</a>. </p>



<p>“I personally enjoy my life,” said Bartov, “but I use products on my skin which stop these free radicals,” — including UV rays and cigarette smoke if you’re around smokers. Vitamin C is a good shield, and when she’s outside in summer, Bartov <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tinted-moisturizer-sunscreen"">tops up her sunscreen</a> every two hours. If you’re spending time outside in the winter (even just exercising for an hour or heading out on a walk), sunscreen is also a great shout, as UVA rays can penetrate clouds.</p>



<h2>Facial treatments are an investment</h2>



<p>Lastly, home skincare is not to be underestimated. But if you’re experiencing gripes like persistent breakouts or pigmentation, for example, you might like to give a pro treatment a go — budget depending. Bartov specializes in acne, pigmentation, and skin rejuvenation, and while she enlists lasers and lights to enhance the skin, she doesn’t offer injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/masseter-botox-side-effects-jowls"">like Botox</a>. Nor has she had Botox injections herself.</p>



<p>Considering the cost, you’d expect the results of a professional facial to be instant. But I learned that it can take two to three weeks to see the full effects of most treatments. In other words, patience is key. </p>



<p>One thing Bartov would always recommend leaving to the professionals is pore extraction, using either metal tools or your hands. Digging at pimples and blackheads could push bacteria sitting on your skin deep inside pores, potentially making the breakout worse and causing scarring or pigmentation. Bartov suggests layering a spot treatment on top of any breakout (big or small) to bring it down, and letting your face do the rest naturally. Try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Frapid-relief-acne-spot-treatment-P421432%3FskuId%3D1933100%26icid2%3Dproducts%2520grid%3Ap421432%3Aproduct"">Murad Rapid Relief Acne Spot Treatment</a>, which contains spot-busting salicylic acid, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FZitSticka-Patch-Killa-Spot-Clarifying-4pc%2F5604704219"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zitsticka Killa</a> patches, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCeraVe-Salicylic-Acid-Acne-Control-Gel-Treatment-Acne-Treatment-for-Face-1-35-fl-oz%2F440953674%3F"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">CeraVe Blemish Control Gel</a>, with salicylic acid and oil-reducing niacinamide.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959719.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=671&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A671"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes — sorry to say this, but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">the winter blues</a> we’re all feeling aren’t immediately going to get better from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Mercury’s backspin in Pisces</a> on February 26th. Fear not though because the astrological backspin is going to offer us a way to mend ourselves. Slowly but surely, we’ll feel whole with hope. Trust the process, okay? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde perpetuates an optical illusion that makes us think the planet is moving backward away from earth, when in fact it’s just moving more slowly. So, communication and travel halt, causing disruptions in how we interact with others. This astrological phenomenon can also disrupt our plans and well being, as unforeseen events occur and we are sluggish from the cosmic force at play. The unpredictability of Mercury <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-from-the-universe-disappointment-setbacks"">creates heightened anxiety</a> because it makes us feel out of control and unable to accomplish tasks quickly. </p>



<p>If one planet can cause all of that commotion, then why do some people revel in the chaos? Mercury retrograde can offer a unique perspective on matters. Since the planet of information and news is kicking back for a few weeks, we should give our minds a break and chill. Easier said than done, right? Not letting the small stuff bother us and gaining a deeper understanding of situations, now that we can look at them more closely allows us to thrive. We have to be mindful of what energy we allow to permeate our lives. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">Protect your peace</a>. </p>



<p>The first Mercury retrograde of 2026 in the water sign Pisces offers us a chance to reconnect with projects and people we love — even if it’s for a fleeting moment. Venus and Mercury retrograde form a conjunction on February 28th, uniting us with a romantic partner or creative venture from the past. We will be inclined to forgive, but not forget. Old wounds might reopen, so be careful in your interactions to avoid heartache from recurring. Although we are resilient, going against our instincts and believing in others we shouldn’t, can sting, if they prove to be untrustworthy. This is a reminder to keep our guard up and boundaries in place. </p>



<p>The sun and Mercury retrograde connect on March 7th, four days after the total lunar eclipse in Virgo. The “cazimi” aspect, which translates from Latin to English as “in the heart of the sun,” offers clarity and decisiveness amid the ambiguity and chaos. We will find enlightenment and be able to make plans to move forward, so we must use it to our advantage. Even though it may not be the light at the end of the tunnel, we can assess matters with a clear mind and determine how we wish to move forward. Think of “cazimi” as a temporary saving grace. </p>



<p>Another important point of the planetary moonwalk is the affiliation between the North Node of Destiny and Mercury retrograde on March 17th. Pay close attention to the events that transpire on this day, as they’ll prove to be pivotal in the future. Situations are unfolding, urging us to seize the moment. Fate is linking us up with people and possibilities that are helping us evolve and grow. Even if the future doesn’t guarantee the outcome we hoped for, it’ll lead us to another amazing place that fulfills our dreams and aspirations. Say yes with caution, to whatever presents itself on March 7th.</p>



<p>The retrograde wraps up on the first day of spring, giving us a fresh start. As we head onward, it’s vital to reflect and share the lessons learned. </p>

<p>Cosmic beings, you survived the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius Solar Eclipse</a> and the launch of the Year of the Fire Horse, and honestly… that was a lot. This week shifts the pace. We’re now fully <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">in Pisces Season</a>, and the assignment is simple but not easy: slow down. Go with the flow. Rest without guilt. Dream without immediately turning the dream into a five-step action plan. After last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn–Neptune conjunction</a>, many of you are receiving quiet downloads about where your energy actually belongs. Trust what’s coming through, even if it doesn’t look “productive” yet. Sitting with your feelings, journaling, meditating, or simply doing less is also progress. Pisces energy reminds us that clarity grows in still water.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings the first reality check since the eclipse. First quarter moons tend to feel like roadblocks or tension points, moments where you realize that the intention you set now needs adjustment. Because this one is in Gemini, the medicine is flexibility. If something isn’t working, don’t double down out of stubbornness. Ask more questions. Look at the situation from another angle. Have the conversation. Pivot if needed. This is less about pushing harder and more about staying curious enough to find a smarter path forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 26th, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces, and the emotional weather gets… watery. Focus may feel slippery, timelines may blur, and your mind might drift into nostalgia, daydreams, or full cinematic flashbacks from the past. Miscommunications are possible, especially when feelings are implied instead of spoken clearly. But this retrograde has a gift: it’s powerful for emotional closure, forgiveness, creative reflection, and tying up loose ends your intuition already knows about. People from the past may resurface, memories may stir, and old feelings may ask for acknowledgment. Just remember: feel everything, but stay grounded. Not every emotion is a crisis… sometimes it’s just your heart clearing space for what’s next.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, this week feels like the emotional cool down after being spiritually and energetically “on stage” for most of the month. With the Saturn–Neptune conjunction freshly behind you, you may still be processing major identity downloads… who you are now, what you’re ready to commit to, and what version of you is officially retired. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> asks you to move slower than usual, even if your instinct is to charge forward.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental speed bump… a conversation, decision, or piece of information that makes you rethink your next move. Don’t treat this as a setback. Gemini energy is about adjusting your approach, asking questions, and staying flexible rather than forcing clarity too quickly.</p>



<p>The tone turns even more inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces, activating your realm of healing, rest, and spiritual closure. As February wraps up, you may feel more introspective, nostalgic, or emotionally sensitive than usual. Old memories, dreams, or unresolved feelings could surface, not to overwhelm you, but to be released. This is a powerful time to unplug, journal, meditate, and tie up emotional loose ends rather than pushing new plans forward. After a month of intense visibility and transformation, the real alignment now comes from solitude and softness. Think of this as your energetic reset before your season arrives.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward connection, community, and your long-term vision for the future. You may feel more emotionally attuned to your friendships, social circles, or online spaces, noticing who feels aligned with the person you’re becoming and who doesn’t quite match your energy anymore. This is a softer, more heart-centered time for collaboration and dreaming with others.</p>



<p>However, on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your money and self-worth zone, bringing a potential reality check around finances, pricing your value, or how much energy you’re giving compared to what you’re receiving. If a small obstacle shows up, don’t panic. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible, explore options, and adjust your strategy rather than taking it personally.</p>



<p>Things may feel a bit more fluid and unpredictable starting February 26th, when Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces for three weeks. Miscommunications with friends, shifting group dynamics, or social media and tech hiccups are possible. You might even feel the urge to step back from certain platforms or take a break from being constantly available. This retrograde isn’t here to disrupt your peace, it’s here to help you reassess where your energy truly belongs. If plans change or connections feel unclear, resist the urge to control every outcome. Some things are meant to realign on their own. Your job is simply to stay grounded in your values and let the right circles reveal themselves.</p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, the first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> puts your career, reputation, and long-term direction in the spotlight, but in a softer, more reflective way than you might expect. You may feel more emotionally connected to your work, questioning whether your current path actually aligns with your purpose, not just your skills.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in your sign brings a personal checkpoint. This can feel like a moment of pressure, a decision point, or a sudden realization about how you’re showing up professionally and personally. If something feels like a roadblock, don’t rush to push through it. This is Gemini energy at its best when you pause, gather more information, and adjust your approach rather than forcing a single outcome.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces. As February wraps up, you may find yourself rethinking a professional goal, reconsidering a public role, or feeling the need to slow down rather than chase the next opportunity. This isn’t the ideal time to launch brand new pitches, apply impulsively for roles, or make major career commitments unless the process began before the retrograde. Instead, think of this as a strategic review period. You’re refining your trajectory, not falling behind. The more honest you are about what success actually looks like for you now, the clearer your next move will be when Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, as a moon-ruled sign, you’re still feeling the energetic aftershocks of last week’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Aquarius solar eclipse</a> more strongly than most. Eclipses tend to activate your emotional radar, and you may be entering this week feeling heightened, reflective, or aware that something internally has shifted. Now that the cosmic intensity is settling, the first full week of Pisces Season offers a welcome emotional flow. Pisces energy supports your growth, faith, and long-term vision, helping you reconnect with hope after a period of major internal processing.</p>



<p>That sense of forward momentum meets a checkpoint on February 24th, when the First Quarter Moon in Gemini activates your rest, closure, and mental health zone. This can feel like a temporary pause or emotional speed bump, especially if you’ve been pushing yourself to “figure everything out.” You may need more sleep, quiet time, or space away from noise and expectations. Gemini energy here isn’t asking you to solve anything immediately, it’s encouraging you to listen to your inner dialogue and release mental clutter before taking your next step.</p>



<p>The pace shifts further inward on February 26th, when Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your expansion realm for the next three weeks. Plans related to travel, education, publishing, entrepreneurship, or big-picture goals may need to be revisited, delayed, or adjusted. Instead of forcing new launches or committing to major long-term decisions, use this time to refine your vision. You may rediscover an old idea, reconnect with a previous opportunity, or realize your direction needs a slight pivot. This retrograde isn’t blocking your growth, it’s making sure your next leap is aligned with who you’re becoming.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, you’re entering this week still processing the emotional intensity <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">of the recent eclipse</a>, and you may feel more aware than usual of your deeper needs and boundaries. The first full week of Pisces Season activates your intimacy, healing, and shared resources zone, pulling your focus beneath the surface. This energy asks you to slow down and get honest about emotional exchanges, financial entanglements, or situations where you’ve been giving more power away than you realized.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a social checkpoint. A conversation with friends, a group dynamic, or a long-term goal may require adjustment. If plans shift or people show you new sides of themselves, stay flexible. Gemini energy here is about recalibrating your network so it reflects where you’re actually headed.</p>



<p>As February winds down, the tone turns even more reflective. On February 26th, Mercury starts its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. You may need to revisit agreements around money, boundaries, or expectations in close relationships. Old feelings could resurface, or past connections may reappear for closure. This isn’t the time to make major financial commitments or merge resources impulsively. Instead, think of this period as emotional and energetic bookkeeping. The more honest you are now about what you share, what you owe, and what you need, the stronger your foundation will be moving forward.</p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this week is all about relationships, reflections, and recalibrating how you show up with others. The first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> activates your partnership realm, putting the spotlight on one-on-one dynamics in love, business, and close collaborations. You may feel more emotionally attuned to others’ needs, but also more aware of where the balance feels off.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a reality check around your career or public direction. A professional conversation, decision, or expectation could create temporary pressure that spills into your personal life. Gemini energy asks you to stay adaptable and communicate clearly rather than assuming you have to carry everything alone.</p>



<p>Things get more personal on February 26th, when your ruling planet Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Because Mercury governs you, you’ll feel this shift more strongly than most. Miscommunications, mixed signals, or unresolved dynamics with partners may surface, not to create chaos, but to be addressed honestly. This isn’t the best time to rush into new relationship commitments, sign major contracts, or make emotional ultimatums. Instead, think of this as a relationship review period: old conversations may resurface, past partners could reappear, or you may simply see a current dynamic more clearly. The more patient and transparent you are now, the stronger and more balanced your connections will become.</p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831497.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, you may still be feeling the emotional weight of last week’s Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, which activated your partnership realm in a major way. Big realizations about commitment, boundaries, or the reality of certain relationships are still settling in. This week isn’t about making dramatic moves, it’s about integrating what you’ve learned and giving yourself space to process how your relationship patterns are evolving.</p>



<p>The first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">full week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your attention toward your daily life, work rhythms, and overall well-being. This is a softer, more intuitive period for adjusting your schedule so it actually supports your energy. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini may bring a mental or logistical speed bump around travel plans, learning, or a long-term goal. Stay flexible and open to changing your approach rather than pushing for immediate clarity.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury goes retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Expect shifts in your schedule, workplace miscommunications, or a need to revisit health habits and boundaries around how much you’re taking on. This is less about being perfectly productive and more about creating systems that are sustainable. Small adjustments now will make a big difference once Mercury moves forward again.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, after the emotional shakeup of last week’s Aquarius solar eclipse, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of Pisces Season</a> feels like a welcome exhale. That eclipse squared Uranus in your partnership realm, bringing unexpected shifts or truths in relationships that may have felt destabilizing in the moment, but ultimately freeing. Now, Pisces energy helps you soften. This is your zone of romance, creativity, joy, and inner child healing, inviting you to date yourself, say yes to what feels fun again, and allow love to flow both ways. You may notice your mood lifting, your creativity returning, and your desire for play coming back online. Let this be a lighter week… you’ve earned it.</p>



<p>On February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around shared finances, debts, or long-term wealth planning. This could surface as a small speed bump or reality check, but Gemini energy keeps the tone lighter than usual. Instead of spiraling, approach your situation with curiosity and even a little humor. This is a good time to explore multiple income streams or rethink how you’re managing resources, just be mindful not to overcommit or take on more than you can realistically handle.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces on February 26th, also in your romance and creativity zone. Over the next three weeks, nostalgia may hit hard. Old flames, familiar dynamics, or rose-colored memories could resurface, making the past look sweeter than it actually was. Stay grounded. This retrograde is less about rekindling old patterns and more about healing them. Use this time for rest, creative reflection, and reconnecting with the version of you that feels playful, expressive, and emotionally safe.</p>

<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> pulls your focus inward toward home, family, and your emotional foundation. After the intensity and movement of the past few weeks, this energy asks you to slow down and tend to your inner world. You may feel the urge to nest, rest, or spend more time with the people and spaces that make you feel safe. Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a relationship checkpoint. A conversation, decision, or difference in perspective could surface with a partner or close collaborator. Gemini energy here isn’t about conflict, it’s about communication. Stay curious, ask questions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.</p>



<p>As February winds down, Mercury shifts retrograde in Pisces on February 26th for the next three weeks. Plans around living situations, family matters, or domestic routines may shift, or old memories and feelings could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major moves or make permanent decisions about your living environment unless the process began earlier. Instead, use this period to reorganize your space, revisit emotional boundaries, and create a home life that actually supports your energy. Slowing down now will give you the stability you’ll need for the momentum ahead.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward communication, learning, and the conversations shaping your day-to-day life. You may feel more reflective than usual, noticing how your words, thoughts, and mental habits are affecting your energy. This is a softer, more intuitive time for writing, brainstorming, or having heart-centered conversations.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a practical checkpoint around your work routines, responsibilities, or health habits. A small scheduling issue, workload adjustment, or energy dip could surface. Gemini energy asks you to stay flexible and tweak your systems rather than pushing yourself harder.</p>



<p>As February wraps up, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces for the next three weeks. Expect delays, crossed wires, or the need to revisit conversations, paperwork, or short-term plans. This isn’t the best time to rush contracts, announcements, or major decisions unless they’ve been in motion already. Instead, use this period to edit, review, and clarify. Slowing down your pace and double-checking details now will save you time and stress once Mercury moves forward again.</p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831501.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, after such a personal and intense stretch, the first full <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">week of Pisces Season</a> shifts your focus toward grounding and rebuilding your sense of stability. This energy activates your money, self-worth, and values zone, encouraging you to slow down and get clear about what actually feels sustainable. You may find yourself reassessing where your time and energy are going and whether the return feels aligned.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a creative or emotional checkpoint. Something related to dating, a passion project, or how you’re expressing yourself may need a small adjustment. Gemini energy asks you to stay playful and flexible rather than taking the moment too seriously.</p>



<p>As February comes to a close, Mercury begins its retrograde in Pisces in your financial and self-esteem sector for the next three weeks. Payments, budgeting plans, or income conversations may shift or require review. This isn’t the time for major financial risks or impulsive purchases unless they were already planned. Instead, use this period to reassess your spending, renegotiate your value, and reconnect with what actually makes you feel secure. Slow and intentional moves now will help you build a stronger foundation moving forward.</p>



<div id=""pisces""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this first full week <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pisces-season-horoscope-2026-february-meaning-effects"">of your solar return season</a> puts you back at the center of your own story. After the intensity and collective shifts of the past few weeks, the energy now asks you to move at your pace, not the world’s. You may feel more sensitive, intuitive, and aware of what your body and emotions actually need.</p>



<p>Then on February 24th, the First Quarter Moon in Gemini brings a checkpoint around home, family, or your emotional foundation. A conversation, scheduling shift, or small tension in your living environment may require flexibility. Gemini energy here is a reminder to stay adaptable and communicate rather than internalize everything.</p>



<p>Things turn even more introspective on February 26th, when Mercury begins its three-week retrograde in your sign. Since this is happening in your identity and personal expression zone, you may feel more reflective, nostalgic, or uncertain about how you want to show up. Old versions of yourself, past decisions, or unfinished emotional stories could resurface. This isn’t the time to rush major reinventions or make bold personal announcements. Instead, treat this as a personal reset. Journal, rest, revisit your intentions, and let clarity come back to you naturally. The more gentle and honest you are with yourself now, the more aligned your next chapter will feel.</p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton’s</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2025/10/11938298/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Yerin Ha</a> is currently <em>everywhere</em>. While we have been fans of the Korean-Australian actor since <em>Halo</em> and <em>Bad Behaviour</em>, her breakout role in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters"">Bridgerton</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/10/11938163/bridgerton-season-4-details-cast-love-story-characters""> Season 4</a> as Sophie Baek has put her on the map worldwide. As the first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2022/03/10896653/asian-australian-women-online-communities"">East Asian</a> to lead the Regency romance drama, she continues to break boundaries and offer representation for those less seen on screen.</p>



<p>As a rising star, Ha has also been hand-picked by SAG-AFTRA to become the Ambassador for <a href=""https://www.actorawards.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Actor Awards</a>, which will air live on March 2. The star will be sharing behind-the-scenes content and participating in multiple pre-show events.</p>



<p>“Being named The Actor Awards Ambassador is such an honor because this ceremony is about actors celebrating actors,” Ha said. “There is something uniquely powerful about being recognised within your own community. As someone who cares so deeply about the craft and about collaboration, it means so much to represent the next generation of actors and be part of an event that uplifts storytelling.”</p>

<p>Ha follows in the footsteps of previous SAG-AFTRA Ambassadors such as Sofia Carson, Haley Lu Richardson, Antonia Gentry and Alexandra Daddario.</p>



<p>The <em>Bridgerton </em>star was most recently seen at Gold House’s Lunar New Year party, where <a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">she opened up to </a><em><a href=""https://people.com/bridgerton-yerin-ha-says-former-leads-simone-ashley-and-nicola-coughlan-have-been-lovely-and-supportive-exclusive-11681027"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">People</a></em> about East-Asian representation on screen. “It’s been really, really amazing and beautiful. I mean, I’ve been really caught up with the [<em>Bridgerton</em>] press tour, so I don’t think I’ve been too [online], Ha said. “It has been really positive and I just feel so proud that I get to be the face of that and keep advocating for change, and knowing that we deserve these roles and spaces.”</p>



<p><em>Bridgerton</em> Season 4 Part 2 will be released on February 26, and will see Ha’s Sophie (hopefully) win Benedict’s heart and become a true leading lady. In a time where the world can seem overwhelming, it’s lovely to be able to celebrate Ha and her successes.</p>

<p>My feed has been completely taken over by fans lamenting that they haven’t been able to secure <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/05/9781230/hilary-duff-kids-luca-banks-mom-advice-media"">Hilary Duff</a> tickets for <a href=""https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a70327671/how-to-buy-hilary-duff-the-lucky-me-tour-tickets/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Me Tour</a>. From people sliding into the pop star’s DMs to beg her to add more dates, to countless memes and TikToks from those who missed out, it’s clear that <a href=""https://lifestyle.si.com/news/hilary-duff-pens-love-letter-to-fans-following-new-album-release"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hilary Duff fever</a> has landed. During the first Mastercard pre-sale in Australia where I live, there were over 50,000 fans in the queue. Aside from the fact that Duff hasn’t toured here for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/ipod-noughties-tech-nostalgia"">18 years</a>, the demand could tie into this interesting trend of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/gen-z-nostalgia-millennial-experience"">pop culture selling nostalgia</a> — a sure-fire way to tap into already established audiences. </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/28/that-yearning-feeling-why-we-need-nostalgia"">According to psychologists</a>, nostalgia is a powerful tool. It has the ability to increase self-esteem, help people form social bonds, soothe anxiety, boredom and stress, as well as being positive for your mental health. One fan tells me a <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15562273/Hilary-Duff-tour-fans-engaged-las-vegas.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">connection with Hilary Duff</a> transports her back to when times felt safer and easier. “They weren’t lying when they said ‘don’t grow up’. I was really lucky growing up, I had a beautiful childhood, with a big family, everything was simple back then and the world felt beautiful and full of colour,” fan Sakara Bell says. “I’ll never forget the Christmas when I unwrapped her album <em>Most Wanted</em>. I played <em>Beat Of My Heart </em>on repeat for months and never got tired of it.”</p>



<p>Anita Tran, who was lucky enough to purchase tickets, says nostalgia is “powerful” right now. “It transports me back to when my biggest worry was whether I’d make it back home in time to watch my favourite Disney Channel shows. A time where my first crush was <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@refinery29/video/7530306456667622687"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad Michael Murray</a> in <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career"">One Tree Hill</a></em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/01/10259591/one-tree-hill-james-lafferty-now-engaged-career""> </a>or I first understood what love meant watching <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2021/09/10678647/best-2000s-tv-shows-teens"">Dawson’s Creek</a></em>. It’s sweet, it’s innocent, and it’s just safe,” Tran adds. “Hilary is my childhood. <span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">She takes me back to my youth, where a cartoon <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lizzie-mcguire-hair-makeup"">Lizzie McGuire</a> </em>narrated my exact teenage thoughts, and <em>Metamorphosis </em>was the album my besties and I blasted on the way home from school</span>.” Other fans echoed the same sentiment, with one wanting to “heal her inner teen”, and another says Duff “genuinely influenced her personality as a child”. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.</p><cite>Sakara Bell, Hilary Duff Fan</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Duff’s triumphant return to pop music is not only a reclaiming of her story, and finally being able to write the music <em>she always wanted to write</em>, but it ties into a larger theme of how we’re seeing the world. The <a href=""https://dictionary.apa.org/nostalgia"">definition of nostalgia</a> is wanting to return to a time of life where things seemed better than the present, and with the current political climate, consumers are more desperate for nostalgia than ever. With an ongoing <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/palestine-mothers-children-gaza-solidarity"">genocide in Gaza</a>, <a href=""https://psychology.org.au/insights/the-australian-women-dreading-change-in-trump%E2%80%99s-am"">Trump rolling back women’s rights</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/2026/02/11959006/celebrity-political-statements-grammys-super-bowl"">issues of ICE in the USA</a>, it seems almost impossible to go through life without being faced with a new horrific truth. Shared nostalgia gives us an escape, where we can come together and bond as a community. </p>



<p>It’s no surprise that brands have commodified nostalgia. If you were wondering why there have been endless amounts of reboots (did we <em>really</em> need <em>Zoey 102</em>?), and beloved childhood toys like <em>Barbie</em> getting the big-screen treatment, there’s a reason. <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/41/3/713/2907535"">Research shows</a> that nostalgia can “decrease people’s desire for money”. People are more willing to open their wallets and pay more for products. <em><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/4JlqOqhImVEFmH4ue7GbVH"">Culture Club</a> </em>co-host and writer Jasmine Wallis agrees, believing that while she loves nostalgia, a big part of it is capitalism. “Millenials and older Gen Z’s (like Hilary’s fans) are entering adulthood in a really tough economy. So, while having kids and buying a house feels like a huge struggle and sacrifice, attending concerts like Hilary’s can offer a sense of joy for just $200,” Wallis says. “It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.” Duff fan Sakara Bell is aware of this marketing tactic, but it doesn’t turn her off at all. “I don’t really care. As cringy as it is, you only live once, and I’m a big believer in money comes and goes,” Bell says. “Being able to experience something that is your childhood, is everything and more.” </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It takes us back to childhood whilst also offering a reprieve from adulthood. Executives and corporations know this and so are playing into it.</p><cite>Jasmine Wallis, co-host and writer of culture club</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nostalgia isn’t even exclusive to your own childhood, either. <a href=""https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/millennials-lead-american-optimism-for-the-future/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Even Gen Z are tapping into nostalgia</a> for the 1990s, including those who weren’t alive at the time. The pre-digital era is coveted by those who believe we’re spending too long doomscrolling. According to a study in the US, two-thirds of Gen Z adults wished to return to a world before we were all “plugged in”. </p>



<p>Perhaps that’s why Hilary Duff has completely taken over in Australia. It’s about more than just her hits (but she has great bops, to be fair), and more about society and how we yearn for a simpler, kinder time in life. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960290.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say I’ve watched the rise and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-inclusivity-in-fashion-2025"">fall of size inclusion</a> at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/search?q=nyfw"">New York Fashion Week</a>, I really mean it. <br /><br />I was at the runway of <em>the</em> first plus-size designer on the official NYFW calendar (Eden Miller’s Cabiria, showing at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week back in 2013). A year later, I was there when <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/a45139956/plus-size-new-york-fashion-week/"">Chromat opened their SS15 show with plus model Denise Bidot</a> — and I made a very un-fashion-week-like exclamation of excitement when I saw her step onto the runway. I saw Christian Siriano go from a straight size designer to a plus fashion collab with Lane Bryant, to dressing plus celebrities for the red carpet, to becoming one of the designers known for dressing <em>every</em> body once he normalized <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/5-plus-size-models-just-walked-in-christian-sirianos-fashion-show"">including multiple plus models on the runway in 2016</a>.<br /><br />For a glorious while, it felt like progress was inevitable and the number of plus models walking NYFW would just keep going up… and then the pandemic hit. And then <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-positivity-movement-fat-black-women-weight-loss"">the rise of Ozempic</a> for weight loss hit. And suddenly, progress hadn’t just ground to a halt — we were going backwards. <br /><br />As someone who has been <a href=""https://www.elle.com/elleextra/events/a46688773/fashioning-a-more-size-inclusive-nyfw-panel-discussion/"">pushing for size inclusion in fashion</a> for over a decade, it is beyond disheartening to see the tiny bit of hard-fought progress we made being pushed back so rapidly. I’ve loved fashion since I was a little kid (I was the 5 year-old seeking out copies of <em>Vogue</em> and <em>Elle</em> at the local library), and I still get a thrill from covering NYFW even after a decade plus of doing so. But sometimes I look at the CFDA calendar before a season starts and feel my anxiety rising, because I just know there probably will be little to no size diversity to come. <br /><br />That bad-gut feeling was sadly correct this season. The official numbers aren’t in yet, but this might have been one of the least size diverse New York Fashion Weeks in recent history — and that bar is <em>low</em>.<br /><br />Now, some of this season’s dip can be attributed to certain brands sitting the season out. Last season, I saw the bulk of visibly plus size representation at plus-specific shows like<a href=""https://www.reneecafaroatelier.com/""> Renee Cafaro Atelier</a> and plus fashion label <a href=""https://www.eloquii.com/"">Eloquii</a>’s NYFW debut. Size inclusive designers like <a href=""https://rachelantonoff.com/"">Rachel Antonoff</a> and Kimberly Gordon of <a href=""https://selkiecollection.com/"">Selkie</a> can always be counted on for truly diverse runways too, but neither showed this season. <a href=""https://www.alexisbittar.com/"">Alexis Bittar</a> is another designer that I always find casts without discriminating against larger bodies (last season’s pageant-themed presentation was filled with dolls of every size), but this year’s visceral, violent, and excellent vignette just included one model (and one victim), so size diversity wasn’t applicable this time around. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>But all that just highlights the fact that it shouldn’t be on a handful of designers to carry all of the representation at Fashion Week. Because when they change their format or skip a season, the absence is keenly felt. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>These feelings are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">supported by the data</a>: We’ve not yet seen the numbers from this season, but last season the representation was insignificant, with less than 1% plus models on the runway, and 97.1% of models sizes 0-4. Given that the average U.S. size is closer to a 16/18 (and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm"">recent CDC data</a> shows that that size is holding true even after years of aggressive marketing of GLP-1s for weight loss), that is nothing short of abysmal. <br /><br />To be clear, we’ve never approached anything even CLOSE to equitable runway representation (which would mean at least 67% curve models). Indeed, we’ve barely even cracked 5% — and that’s with the most generous calculations. Tokenization, which is not real representation, has often been the norm over the last decade, but there’s nothing like seeing <em>zero</em> curves on the runway to put the absence of even that little bit of size diversity into sharp relief. <br /><br />I wasn’t alone in feeling it, either. Bella Gerard, a fashion editor and author of <a href=""https://bellagerard.substack.com/"">Substack’s B List</a>, also noted the blatant regression: “Above all else, the lack of body diversity on the runway this season just feels so…disappointing,” she noted. “It’s not breaking news that attempts at inclusivity are often performative in the fashion sphere, but this season really proved a ‘one step forward, three steps back’ reality. Not only was there next to no curve representation, but the straight size models looked even thinner than in recent years, calling back to an era of thinspo I thought we’d collectively renounced and evolved past.” </p>

<p>Fortunately, there were some bright points this season too, with top designers whose visions of fashion were not constrained to just one type of girl. On the first day of shows, <a href=""https://collinastrada.com/"">Collina Strada</a> showed a deliciously darkly romantic-yet-eclectic collection, replete with high <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/09/11778397/beetlejuice-beetlejuice-fashion-costumes"">Victorian lace collars</a>, blurred prints, volume play, and body baring dropped-waist silk dresses that looked equally hot on straight and plus size models. Later that evening, <a href=""https://www.jane-wade.com/"">Jane Wade</a>’s show — titled “The Summit” — was an innovative fashion expedition, with conifers on the runway, tents on dresses (and <em>as</em> dresses), and survival-ready fabrications merged with Wade’s signature suiting and elevated officewear. (The story of a corporate woman dreaming of an escape to nature is crucially not one limited by size.)<br /><br />And at New York Men’s Day, <a href=""https://www.a-potts.com/"">A.Potts</a> showed a distinctive style of oversized, genderless clothing on a cast that included both age diversity and an even more underrepresented category: Male plus models. Designer Aaron Potts is no stranger to size diverse casting, either: Prior seasons have included plus models, and I — a size 20 — was actually one of the models for the launch of his new diffusion label Werkshop by A.Potts (which was also featured in his NYMD presentation). <br /><br />I allowed myself a little hope after that good first day, but as the week went on and I saw more shows with <em>zero</em> curve models than not, the lack of size inclusion just felt more and more pronounced. Industry friends who knew I was reporting on size inclusion this season would occasionally text me curve model sightings. “Paloma on the runway at Proenza.” “One curve model at Gabe Gordon.” “I think two? at Eckhaus Latta.” Every message was appreciated, but the underlying implication that we needed to be eagle-eyed to spot even a smidgeon of size inclusion was a downer. <br /><br />Then there were the false positives, driven by the emerging trend of adding mass to thin bodies with clothing. I saw countless peplums, panniers, and padded pieces throughout the week, and as I was desperately searching for a hint of curve and trying to parse a tall size 8 curve model from her size 4 contemporary, I occasionally got excited only to realize that was just a straight size model with fabric curves added on. It felt like I was playing an unwitting (and unwelcome) game of “curve model or just a structured hip?” When there’s so little visual difference between straight and curve models — who do not typically wear <em>actual</em> plus sizes, paradoxically — the facade of inclusion shatters even more.</p>

<p>Shows with organic diversity, like <a href=""https://kimshui.net/"">Kim Shui</a>’s richly textured, color-forward FW26 show, were some of the bright points of the season, but were sadly the exceptions, not the rule. Age diversity did seem to be on the uptick, too — with gorgeous older models in shows including <a href=""https://www.carolinaherrera.com/us/en/"">Carolina Herrera</a>, <a href=""https://diotima.world/"">Diotima</a>, and the relaunch of <a href=""https://dereklam.com/"">Derek Lam</a> with new creative director Robert Rodriguez at the helm.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Yet as I saw runway after runway composed exclusively of the thinnest models, the scattered tips I was getting about curve models on the runway started to feel like rare sightings of an endangered species.</strong> </p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As someone with 25 seasons of NYFW under my belt and who has dedicated my career to the push for more and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wray-closing-plus-size-community-impact"">better for plus size women</a>, I am always wary when there’s a category that seems like the chosen diversity <em>du jour. </em>True representation should be across the board and not a passing trend, with an ongoing emphasis on making sure underrepresented groups can see themselves in fashion. I’ve obviously clocked this, but other fashion industry vets have noted it as well. <br /><br />In <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/fashion/skinny-models-ozempic-glp1.html"">a recent piece for the <em>New York Times</em></a>, top fashion critic Vanessa Friedman noted that the recent shift extends well beyond the catwalk: “The gravitational pull is toward an ever-shrinking human form, especially on the runway,” she wrote. “It’s too bad. Not because skinniness is bad, but because it should not be the only option. People still come in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Seeing the reality of life reflected on the runways, which have become a form of entertainment for everyone, is actually more appealing than seeing life reduced to one size that cannot fit all.<br /><br />Designers who really understand that appeal also know that it’s good for their bottom line. Committing to size inclusivity isn’t just the ethical thing to do — it’s good business sense, too. Take Christian Siriano, who <a href=""https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a21529009/christian-siriano-tripled-his-business-by-adding-plus-sizes/"">extolled the fiscal virtues of size inclusion back in 2018</a>, saying: “Adding plus sizes to my line tripled my business. Why wouldn’t you do that?!” <br /><br />This season, when asked about diversity in casting, he echoed that sentiment, exclaiming that it was “so important!” Last week, the designer punctuated this belief visually by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU659FZiSdq/"">sending the same silhouette down the runway on two different body types</a>. “I love how you can see they look amazing in the same dress, in the same look,” he told me backstage. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960215.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960216.jpg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>When designers approach representation as part of their brand identity, it effortlessly translates to the audience. Both legendary R&amp;B singer Monica and <em>the </em>Whoopi Goldberg independently praised Siriano’s commitment to making fashion for all backstage. “It was absolute elegance, and it was for every size, shape, color and creed, so many different types of women — and men! — in the show,” Monica noted. “Gives you all sorts of inspiration!” Goldberg summed it up even more succinctly: “Christian’s work just always inspires me and makes me so happy, because we can all wear it.”<br /><br />That type of organic inclusion was also evident in <a href=""https://chukscollins.com/"">Chuks Collins</a>’s striking presentation, which ranged from lush topstitched knits to sharp suits to stunning structured ballgowns, all shown on a range of sizes and body types. (Collins was heavily influenced by how scarification, purposeful, ritual, and otherwise, can play into the way we present ourselves to the world.)<br /><br />“I grew up seeing people that look like you, people that look like me,” Collins said. “My mom is not a size 2. My grandmother, who taught me to sew, she’s not a size 10. About 40 to 50% of my clients are plus size people. So I am not going to lie to myself and say ‘oh, my demographic, my ideal demographic is a size 2 to 4.’”<br /><br />For Collins, who started the brand in 2006, building a collection for customers of all sizes is both a labor of love and a practical financial matter — after all, he’s building a label he wants to last. “I have to create clothes that people see themselves in, that they want to wear. With that, I’m becoming a successful business,” he noted. “I also just love dressing people with curves, because that’s what I started doing, that’s how I started my career. So I’m not going to — because of what, industry standards? — I’m not going to include that? And I love women. I love beautiful women with curves. I tell the stories of how I feel, and my work is a representation of myself.” <br /><br />In the end, an outsized portion of the size diversity this season came from emerging designers and those making their CFDA debuts, such as Menyelek Rose of the eponymous label <a href=""https://www.menyelek.online/"">Menyelek</a>. Designer <a href=""https://www.andrewcurwen.com/home"">Andrew Curwen</a>, meanwhile, showed a sexy, directional, and haunting (complimentary!) collection. “Nocturnal Conditions” looked stunning on every figure, and the diverse cast (by F10 Casting agency) felt simultaneously natural and intentional. <br /><br />Camryn Mcclain of <a href=""https://reneenyc.com/"">RENÉE NYC</a> also cited body diversity as integral to her inspiration: “For casting this season, we focused on different characters of everyday people of various shapes and sizes that reflect what I see in the city,” Mcclain said. That thoughtfulness complemented a presentation of some of the most interesting knitwear I’ve seen lately, with bold braiding and fringe details rendered in rich jewel tones and gilded neutrals. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960219.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960220.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>“I want my collection to inspire and be inclusive for everyone,” said <a href=""https://veejayfloresca.com/"">Veejay Floresca</a>, another designer on the CFDA calendar for the first time. “I worked with my team to cast models across sizes, races, ages, and gender identities so that everyone can see themselves in the collection I created. It is so important to me that everyone feels beautiful and can express themselves freely and I hope my collection can bring this to all of my customers.” <br /><br />The casting fully reflected that, with a stunning range of bodies (including <em>Project Runway</em> star plus model Liris Crosse) all looking occasion-ready in sumptuous gowns and suiting. Floresca’s <em>Project Runway</em> mentor Christian Siriano was also in attendance, and it felt both poetic and prophetic that Floresca is also adding to the legacy of embracing true runway diversity. <br /><br />As New York Fashion Week wrapped, social media was only beginning to set itself ablaze with <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6qBxcEmoA/?img_index=1"">reactions to the new Netflix documentary centered on <em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, particularly  the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/harmful-beauty-standards-artificial-intelligence"">impossible beauty standards</a> that persisted then and seem intent on making a vicious comeback today. While reactions to the show — and the harmful standards that were upheld in the era of <em>ANTM — </em>are rightfully horrified, it’s worth looking at the present in the same lens.<br /><br />Fashion is meant to be forward-looking, creative, and progressive, but all too often falls into the “that’s just the way things are” default.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p><strong>Designers letting themselves off the diversity hook now, thinking the current wave of regressive and exclusionary ideals will be an excuse, will inevitably find themselves on the wrong side of history. </strong></p><cite>Sarah Chiwaya</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>For now, the bright spots and the designers that see fashion for all will keep me going. As Curwen said after his show: “Those who are told ‘no’ the most in the industry are the ones we pay the most attention to.” In doing so, Curwen and designers like him set themselves apart from the crowded field of brands all targeting the least populous market (aka straight sizes). Here’s hoping the industry gets on board with this more expansive view of who belongs in fashion, and other designers see the opportunity that true inclusion presents, for both business and the human obligation. </p>

<p>As a fashion writer, dressing up for New York Fashion Week is both exhilarating and daunting to me (especially during the February shows when a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-winter-jackets-for-women"">winter coat</a> can make or break your outfit). Do I opt for an all-black, NY journalist uniform? Do I try to go all out like one of the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-street-style"">Getty-photographed fashion darlings</a>? Or do I dress on-theme for specific shows? Decisions, decisions!<br /><br />At this point, I’ve grown accustomed to the chaos and long days of NYFW, so I like to plan my outfits well ahead of time. When I was planning out this season’s looks for seven straight days, I predominately considered pieces that I’d feel most comfortable in — because when I left my BK home, I certainly wasn’t going back to do a not-so-quick change in the middle of my packed schedule.<br /><br />Leaning on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">Refinery29’s Winter 2026 Lookbook</a> for some outfit inspiration, I decided that — with what I already had in my closet and what brands graciously leant to me for the week — I’d put my own twist on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-fashion-beauty-trends-forecast-2025-2026"">“The Demuralist” look</a> (with hints of The Weather-Maxxer and The Holiday Host aesthetics) for Day 2 of NYFW.<br /><br />In this reimagined Roaring Twenties look: “The all-black uniform gets a festive lift here with sequins and quietly elegant accessories.” While I’m not the most sparkly person, I took bits and pieces from this modern flapper aesthetic and styled a glam look that could take me from day to night, across the city, and confidently into five designers’ runway shows.<br /><br />Ahead, see how I interpreted R29’s stylist-vetted Demuralist trend, the exact pieces I wore (including an <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-fall-winter-2026-trends"">on-trend hat moment</a>), and outfit inspo to get you through the rest of the frigid winter in style. </p>

<p>Some themes of “The Demuralist” include dark palettes, luxe details, and rich textures. “We wanted to lean into this idea of the ‘20s and that being a reference point for celebration,” stylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/christinenicholson__/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christine Nicholson</a> told me behind the scenes of the R29 photoshoot. “We kept the idea of craftsmanship as it relates to things like beading, but made it feel new and fresh.” <br /><br />Taking style cues (but not hard and fast rules) from the lookbook, I opted for my black <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/madewell-alexa-chung-collaboration-2024"">Madewell x Alexa Chung</a> oversized corduroy blazer, rather than a statement dress. I just love the thick fabric and unexpected bright-white buttons. I doubled down on the textures of this look by wearing a white ribbed sweater with fluffy wrist cuffs (that perfectly peeked out from my blazer sleeves) from <a href=""https://www.cupshe.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cupshe</a>. And while the R29 model was styled in funky culottes under her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-dress-trends-2025"">drop-waist dress</a>, I chose my unassumingly stretchy and comfy trousers from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-lululemon-gifts"">Lululemon</a> that I knew would keep my legs warm.<br /><br />With my base layers offering a more masculine silhouette, it then came time to jazz up the look with feminine flapper energy through accessorizing. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959893.jpeg?width=854&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=427%3A512"" /></figure></div>

<p>The Demuralist look consists of long sequined gloves (Note: opera gloves were everywhere during NYFW!), fuzzy Mary Jane heels, and, of course, a spectacular headpiece. And to my delight, I knew just the pieces that would give a similar festive and vintage flair, that felt wearable; not just editorial. <br /><br />I excitedly whipped out the funky magenta fur mittens I had purchased as a tween. (While they at one point revolted me, they’re of course back in style and add a touch of whimsy to every winter outfit.) I also slipped on my burgundy <a href=""https://www.vivaia.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Vivaia</a> knit waterproof boots, which were the perfect touch of color and texture (and sensible for the snowy streets).<br /><br />The cherry on top of this ’20s-esque look came about while rummaging through <a href=""https://tjmaxx.tjx.com/store/index.jsp"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">TJ Maxx</a> (my favorite pastime). I stumbled on a burgundy faux fur trapper-like hat that felt like it was from a past era, and knew I wanted to wear it during NYFW.<br /><br />The final touch (that I picked up just one day before NYFW) was an incredible faux fur scarf-shawl-hybrid from <a href=""https://misscircle.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Circle</a>. It was so luxe and dramatic, and helped me channel some flapper energy. (It also brought me the biggest compliments from industry peers throughout the day!)</p>

<p>While translating a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/winter-2026-fashion-beauty-lookbook"">bold editorial photoshoot fashion look</a> into a wearable IRL look was at first daunting, the final outcome wound up being one of my favorite NYFW outfits to date.<br /><br />Taking notes from the R29 Lookbook helped inspire an outfit I may have never put together otherwise. In the end, my interpretation had me feeling festive, comfortable, confident, and most importantly, like myself. And I can say with confidence that you <em>have </em>to try it for yourself too.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor of ten years, I’ve been a guest at a fair share of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dyson-hairstyling-tools-worth-it-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair tool</a> launch events, from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/shark-flexfusion-styler-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">blow-out brushes</a> that are like having your own personal hairstylist, to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mermade-hair-curling-iron-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">curling irons</a> that use clever mechanisms to draw your hair in and form a perfect tousle. But none have drawn as many collective “Oohs” and “Ahhs” from my editor peers as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s new SilkiPro</a>. </p>



<p>I know what you’re thinking: <em>another hair tool?</em> And you’d have a fair point. In recent years, Shark has unveiled the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-glam-hot-tool-air-styling-drying-system%2FHD6000PKSN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glam AirStyling System</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-glossi-2-in-1-hot-tool-and-air-glosser-juniper%2FHT302TL.html%3Fdwvar_HT302TL_color%3D429195"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glossi Hot Tool</a>, and the <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fbuild-your-own-shark-flexstyle-air-styling-drying-system-stone%2FHD400SN.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">FlexStyle Drying and Styling System</a> (a personal favorite of mine). But the SilkiPro Straight is different. No, really — it straightened my thick, wavy hair in ten minutes flat when it usually takes 30. But more on that later.  </p>



<h2>What is Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkninja.com%2Fshark-silkipro-straight-wet-to-dry-straightener-rapid-blow-dryer-plum-satin%2FHT400PU.html%3Fdwvar_HT400PU_color%3DA875B3"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shark’s SilkiPro</a> is a wet-to-dry straightener and blowdryer in one. Imagine your current flat iron had discreet vents inside that released warm air for a smoother finish with every pass, and you’ve got the idea.  </p>



<p>At the bottom of the tool, there’s a slide-up button that lets you select a mode for wet or damp hair, which emits heated airflow — with the intensity controlled via a separate button. There’s another mode for dry hair, which relies solely on the ceramic straightening plates, without additional airflow. In other words, it combines everything you love about a flat iron — quick, high-shine results — with the benefits of a blowdry brush like less frizz and a smoother finish.  </p>



<p>Perhaps the most brilliant feature is the built-in blowdryer. You can lock the tool closed, and the airflow comes out from the sides, letting you rough-dry your hair before styling. </p>

<h2>What makes Shark’s SilkiPro Straight special? </h2>



<p>At Shark’s launch event, I was lucky enough to see the tool in action on two models — one with very thick, curly hair and another with fine, wavy hair. LA-based hairstylist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jaybirmingham_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jay Birmingham</a> was on hand to demonstrate, and I was mesmerized by how quickly it slid through the first model’s curls, leaving a sleek handful of hair in just a couple of passes.  </p>



<p>According to Birmingham, this is largely thanks to the smart, inconspicuous slots inside the tool, which accommodate combs in three different sizes — all included with the tool. Birmingham explained that if you usually “chase” your straightener with a comb or brush to achieve a smooth, sleek finish, there’s no need anymore — it’s essentially built in. The larger wide-tooth comb is especially brilliant for thick, curly, and coily hair.  </p>



<p>On the model with finer, straighter hair, Birmingham demonstrated how to create flat-iron waves by clamping the straightener on the hair and twisting it downward. When he released, it produced the most effortless tousled look. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between Shark’s SilkiPro Straight and the Dyson AirStrait? </h2>



<p>Now, you’re probably wondering how the SilkiPro compares to Dyson’s AirStrait. While they look similar at first glance, they’re actually quite different. The AirStrait doesn’t have ceramic hot plates, whereas the SilkiPro does. This means you can use it without airflow on dry hair to straighten, create waves, or touch up your style. If you ask me, it’s also lighter and perhaps quieter — and unlike the Dyson, it comes with those aforementioned slide-in combs.  </p>



<p>Dyson’s hallmark is that its tools don’t cause heat damage, so you might assume the ceramic plates on the SilkiPro would fry your hair like a traditional straightener. Fortunately, the SilkiPro has heat sensors that adjust the temperature automatically when it gets too hot, lending silky results without split ends. Of course, repeatedly going over a section or holding the plates down for too long can still cause damage, but because it works so quickly, one or two slow passes is usually enough. (And I always recommend heat protection.) </p>



<p>In terms of results, Dyson’s tool leaves hair looking more naturally straight and swishy, while Shark’s makes mine look sleek and pin-straight. If you have layers, and you like a tool that gives your lengths some movement, the former might be a better option, or one of Shark’s round blowdry brushes.  </p>



<p>At $249.99, it’s not exactly budget-friendly, but it is slightly more affordable than the AirStrait.</p>

<h2>What to know about Shark’s SilkiPro Straight Wet to Dry Straightener + Rapid Blow Dryer </h2>



<p><strong>• </strong>A straightener-meets-blowdryer featuring different levels of airflow and temperature-controlled ceramic plates for straightening, blow-drying, and creating waves. </p>



<p><strong>• </strong>Comes with three slide-in comb attachments: a wide-tooth comb for curly or coily hair, a gentle comb for natural straight styles, and a precision comb for maximum tension. </p>



<p>• Lightweight, quiet, and suitable for all hair types.  </p>



<h2>How do you use Shark’s SilkiPro Straight? </h2>



<p>Although “wet” is in the name, SilkiPro is best used on damp or towel-dried hair. I used the blowdryer function to rough-dry my hair to about 90% dry before switching to the “For WET Hair” setting on medium heat with full airflow. Happily, you can choose both the temperature and airflow level to suit you. </p>



<p>I have one stubborn step-like wave at the back of my head, which hairstylists usually struggle to smooth with a blowdryer and round brush, but this smoothed them out in just two passes. The chunky ceramic plates, combined with the extra airflow, work together to make hair silky, straight, and soft without much effort. </p>



<p>While the tool itself looks quite large, I can confirm that because the ceramic plates extend all the way to the tip, it’s easy to reach the roots and smooth out frizz and flyaways. I managed to straighten all my hair in just 10 minutes, when it usually takes me 30. Some might call it sorcery, but I know Shark has been quietly perfecting this behind the scenes for years. </p>



<p>Beyond the smart plates and directed airflow, the gentle comb attachment helped the tool glide through my knotty hair like a hot knife through butter. I also love that the tool quiets down when you put it down and starts up again when you pick it up, making it less overstimulating. </p>



<p>Will it replace my trusty Shark Glossi? I think so — once I’ve grown my layers out. I prefer a blunt cut with straight hair on me. That said, my friends with curly hair are already eyeing it up, so who knows how long I’ll be able to hold onto it… </p>
