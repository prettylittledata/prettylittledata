<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957041.jpg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m not <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/engagement-marriage-proposal-celebration-anxiety"">engaged</a>. And yet, somehow, I took my boyfriend to what might be our future wedding destination. I had started wedding planning without meaning to.</p>



<p>When the invitation to visit <a href=""https://ranchosantana.com/""><strong>Rancho Santana</strong></a> landed in my inbox, the subject line stopped me in my tracks: <em>Nicaragua</em>. It wasn’t a place I had ever imagined myself visiting let alone falling in love with, but I’m always down for the ride. So I said yes, packed my bags, and invited my boyfriend along to help photograph the trip.</p>



<p>From the moment we landed, the experience felt elevated. A private car service picked us up and drove us two hours through the countryside of Nicaragua, eventually arriving at a secluded paradise I didn’t even know existed. At Rancho Santana, we were greeted with welcome drinks, cool towels, and the kind of hospitality that instantly makes you exhale. The entrance alone felt cinematic: a hacienda-style courtyard opening up to sweeping ocean views. That was my first thought: <em>This place feels heaven-sent.</em></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957061.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>What I didn’t realize and what my boyfriend found out shortly after we arrived was that the rest of our group consisted entirely of wedding planners and wedding photographers. The side-eye was immediate. I promised him it wasn’t a setup, but once you experience Rancho Santana, the confusion makes sense. This is the wedding venue of your dreams. Whether you’re envisioning a beach ceremony, an intimate chapel moment, or vows exchanged at golden hour, the resort offers every version of romance that is thoughtfully designed and effortlessly executed. Our group included some of California’s most talented wedding and event planners, including <a href=""https://www.rheefined.com/"">Jason Rhee</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charleybluebell/?hl=en"">Charley King</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/artandsoulevents/"">Jessica Carrillo</a>, <a href=""https://thomasbuilifestyle.com/"">Thomas Bui,</a> and <a href=""https://nahidglobal.com/services-2/"">Nahid Farhoud</a>, along with photographers <a href=""https://emilywren.com/"">Emily Wren</a> and <a href=""https://clanegessel.com/"">The Clane Gessel Studio</a>. As the only journalist on the trip, I felt incredibly honored to be with such great talent.</p>



<p>And then there was the itinerary… which did <em>not</em> help my case.</p>



<p>Our room had a private terrace (by the way, every room does), mornings started with oceanfront breakfasts while surfers rode the waves below, and evenings were filled with sunset cocktail hours followed by candlelit dinners with gorgeous table decor. Night one felt less like a welcome dinner and more like an engagement dinner, for guests we hadn’t invited.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957080.jpg?width=821&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=821%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>The next day, we toured the full property, and that’s when everything clicked. In addition to resort rooms, Rancho Santana offers over 20 private residences that can accommodate anywhere from six to eighty guests. It’s an ideal option for weddings or milestone celebrations that feel both intimate and expansive. Guests still receive full access to the resort’s amenities, including butler service, three restaurants, a café, a pool bar with cabanas, and a local market.</p>



<p>One night, we attended an all-white themed dinner at one of the restaurants. Between the unreal sunset backdrop and the stunning decor by local designers, you couldn’t convince me it wasn’t a rehearsal dinner. At one point, we were on the dance floor and the entire group cheered us on as the “newlyweds for the night.” I was nervous about how my boyfriend would react,  until I looked over and saw that he was having just as much fun as I was.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957075.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The running joke throughout the trip was that he might as well just marry me right then and there. The planners were ready. The photographers were on site. The venue was flawless. Low-key, I was like, “yesss, let the inspiration marinate!” And while I was joking, I was also quietly taking notes.</p>



<p>Beyond the romance, the resort delivers unforgettable experiences like horseback riding along the beach, bird and monkey nature tours, surf lessons, sandboarding, and a hands-on ceramics class. Each day somehow outdid the last.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957077.jpg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>On our final day, they staged a full wedding — complete with a bride, a chapel ceremony, a saxophone player, cocktail hour, and a reception dinner inside one of the eight-bedroom homes. There was a live band. a private chef, and a level of detail that felt impossible to top.</p>



<p>By the end of the trip, we were both joking (but lowkey serious) about living there someday. I’ve always known I wanted a destination wedding. I just didn’t know where. Without realizing it, I spent five days experiencing exactly what that dream could look like, in a country I had never considered visiting. Nicaragua <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/singapore-vacation-travel-experience-black-woman"">surprised me</a> in the best way. Between the people, the culture, and the undeniable magic of Rancho Santana, I’d recommend it for a wedding, a milestone birthday, or simply a luxurious reset. As for my boyfriend? Let’s just say manifestation is real. Now the only thing left to figure out is how I accidentally plan my way onto a private jet next.</p>

<p>As a beauty editor, it’s my job to test beauty treatments, but there are only a handful that I’m really obsessed with. Sure, there are tons of interesting options out there, like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/led-face-mask-red-light-skin-benefits"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">LED facials</a> and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/skinvive-injectable-moisturizer"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">injectable moisturizer</a>, but few are genuinely innovative and game-changing (in my opinion, the single most overused phrase in the beauty industry).  </p>



<p>Without a doubt, one of those innovations and my can’t-live-without product is builder in a bottle, which you may also know as BIAB nails. I’ll even bet money on you trying it and loving it. Here’s everything you need to know about the new nail treatment sweeping salons everywhere. </p>



<h2>What are BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>BIAB (also known as builder gel) was developed by the brand <a href=""https://thegelbottle.us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Gel Bottle</a>. Creative nail expert and content creator, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/SadieJNails/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sadie Jordan,</a> always uses BIAB on her clients: “It’s a [curable] gel nail enhancement designed to add strength and structure to your natural nails, helping them to grow out without breaking as easily,” says Jordan. She adds that BIAB is more viscous than gel polish. “It allows you to build an apex — the highest part of a nail enhancement, most visible from the side angle — which is what makes your nail more durable.”  </p>



<p>BIAB is layered on top of your natural nail (whatever the length) to lend strength and prevent breakage. BIAB comes in a range of different colors, but the most popular tends to be clear or neutral pink. It can be used as a base coat (with gel polish layered over the top, including nail art) or applied on its own.  </p>

<h2>What are the benefits of BIAB nails?  </h2>



<p>The main benefit of BIAB is the ability to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-long-strong-nails-expert-advice"">grow your natural nails</a> underneath. Even long-term nail-biters, or those whose nails are prone to breakage, tend to have success with growth. What’s more, countless BIAB nail looks can be achieved without glue or plastic tips, says Jordan. This means you can have long-lasting manicures with a similar removal process to regular gel by simply filing away the top layer and soaking off the product with acetone. </p>



<p>Another benefit of BIAB is that it can be used alongside <a href=""https://www.thegelbottle.com/shop/37364-pro-nail-forms.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">nail forms</a> (a paper or foil tip) to repair chipped corners. </p>

<h2>What’s the difference between BIAB nails, traditional gel, Gel-X nails, and acrylics?  </h2>



<p>It can be hard to tell, but there are differences between BIAB, traditional gel, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/apres-gel-x-nail-extensions"">Gel-X</a>, and acrylics. </p>



<p>Gel nail polish was <a href=""https://www.cnd.com/"">developed by CND</a> under the brand name Shellac and is a liquid polish that is cured and hardened under a UV lamp. Curing makes gel polish chip-resistant and gives it a longer wear.  </p>



<p>BIAB is a form of gel polish that has a stronger base — this is why it assists growth. An upside of BIAB is that it can be soaked off just like gel polish. Both gel polish and BIAB give that incredible, long-lasting shine that regular nail polish can’t achieve. </p>



<p>Gel-X is a gel nail extension system developed by Aprés Nails, where full-cover tips are bonded to the natural nail with gel and cured under a UV lamp, then shaped to your preference. BIAB doesn’t require tips. Instead, it’s applied onto the natural nail.  </p>



<p>Acrylics are created using liquid monomer and powder polymer, which should be mixed carefully by your nail tech. Acrylics don’t need curing under a lamp and harden within a few minutes. If you’re someone who loves really long nails, acrylics tend to be a sturdier option. One similarity between BIAB and acrylics is that once the nail starts to grow out, you can get an infill (where product is applied to the nail growth area).  </p>



<p>So what’s the best technique? It all depends on your budget, what your nail tech offers, the outcome and length you’re looking for, as well as your activity level, or how much you use your hands. </p>

<h2>How long do BIAB nails last? </h2>



<p>Luxury nail artist and beauty professional <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/charlotteemilybeauty_/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Emily</a> explains that most of her clients come in every three weeks to maintain their BIAB nails. But she notes that if there’s proper nail prep, a BIAB set can last for much longer. That said, keeping BIAB nails on for longer than four weeks isn’t recommended, as lifting can allow water to get trapped beneath the gel and encourage bacterial growth. After three or four weeks, BIAB nails can either be infilled or soaked off.  </p>



<h2>Is there anyone who shouldn’t have BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>Both Emily and Jordan note that those with extremely damaged nails (for example, very thin, extremely brittle, and lifting away from the nail bed) shouldn’t get BIAB nails. In some cases, those with conditions like psoriasis may also want to avoid BIAB nails. “Applying BIAB directly to a severely damaged nail bed can cause heat spikes — a stinging sensation on the nail bed — and the product should not come into contact with skin,” says Jordan.  </p>



<p>A qualified nail tech will let you know whether you’re a suitable candidate for BIAB and can create a treatment plan that’s best suited to your nails. Happily, Emily said she’s never had to turn anyone away from BIAB nails.  </p>

<h2>Are there any downsides to BIAB nails? </h2>



<p>“BIAB does take a little longer to soak off compared to gel polish,” says Jordan, but as long as the top coat is filed and broken down, this isn’t a major issue. “It can also make your nails grow out very fast,” she adds, “so you may need to have manicures more frequently if you don’t like the look of regrowth.”  </p>



<p>At present, BIAB has no downsides for Emily. “My clients and I are happy with the results, and it has created a low-maintenance manicure which is great for a busy lifestyle,” she says.   </p>

<h2>Where can you get BIAB nails, and how much do BIAB nails cost?  </h2>



<p>Today, BIAB is just as widely available as gel polish — if you’re unsure, simply call your local nail salon and ask specifically for the treatment.  </p>



<p>The cost of nails always depends on where you live, with cities being the most expensive. In New York and LA, for example, a typical price range for basic BIAB is between $40 to $80. </p>

<p>Something’s been amiss when I <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/greasy-oily-hair-after-washing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wash my hair</a>. Instead of the odd few strands escaping — totally normal, by the way — my hands have been filled with near-chunks of hair. It’s a conundrum I can’t crack, because at a glance my hair still looks <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">long and healthy</a>; it just seems that I’m losing more of it. And I’m not the only one. Countless friends have texted me in a panic, convinced their <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/female-pattern-hair-loss-baldness-experience"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">hair is coming out</a> more than usual. Interestingly, TikTok’s hair experts appear to have diagnosed it. Apparently, we’re all experiencing the big <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@abbeyyung/video/7546699386563120414"">winter hair shed</a>. </p>



<p>If I weren’t going through it myself, I’d have assumed winter hair shedding was a myth. I mean, how many more things — besides <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-hand-cream-dry-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dry hands</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">cracked lips</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dull-skin-causes-dermatologist-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">dull skin</a> — can we take? But reaching out to my little black book of experts has proven otherwise. On the plus side, there’s usually nothing to worry about, but here’s everything I’ve learned from the pros about managing it.  </p>



<h2>Firstly, what is hair shedding — and is it normal? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/dermatologist_adel/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Aamna Adel</a>, consultant dermatologist and founder of <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooOoT-AkJdIvdreb1LWiY2WzlEBHvpTercvOTYFAfbdSZM0Rq0Q"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute hair</a>, says that hair shedding is a normal part of the growth cycle: “Each hair on your scalp goes through phases of growth (otherwise known as anagen), transition (catagen), and rest (telogen).” Dr. Adel adds, “At the end of the cycle, the hair sheds to make room for a new one to grow in. So yes, some shedding is completely normal and happens continuously.” </p>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/afopeatoyebi/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</a>, a certified trichologist, cosmetic chemist, and head of product at <a href=""https://rukahair.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ruka Hair</a>, adds that on a healthy scalp, anything between 10 to 15% of total hairs are in the telogen or exogen phase at any given point in time, which means that some hair shedding is natural all year round. “It’s normal to shed between 50 and 100 hairs per day,” says Atoyebi, but she adds that this shouldn’t be confused with hair fall from breakage. “This is where the hair shaft fractures, as opposed to falls, from the root,” she explains. You can usually tell the difference because broken hairs are shorter, while hairs that have been shed naturally tend to have a white bulb at the end. </p>



<p>While some shedding is natural, Atoyebi says how much you lose can be influenced by things like stress, illness, nutritional deficiencies — including low protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D, and B12 — as well as hormonal changes, such as pregnancy or certain forms of hormonal contraception. Dr. Adel says that if your hair is thicker or longer, or if you skip hair washing, shedding might appear more obvious. </p>



<p>Some evidence suggests telogen — the resting phase — varies slightly across ethnicities, says Atoyebi. But there’s no data showing that shedding changes with hair type. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but the increased shedding people might notice could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors like stress and nutritional deficiencies.</p><cite>certified trichologist Afọpẹ́ Atoyebi</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2>Is winter hair shedding real? How can you manage it? </h2>



<p>Dr. Adel notes that many people notice increased shedding in winter, and that there could be a handful of reasons why. First, what she calls seasonal hair cycling: “Some studies suggest more hairs enter the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320509854_Seasonality_of_hair_loss_a_time_series_analysis_of_Google_Trends_data_2004_to_2016"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">shedding phase in autumn</a> and early winter, possibly as a delayed response to summer UV exposure,” says Dr. Adel.  </p>



<p>Second, a dry scalp and hair: “Cold air outside and central heating indoors strip moisture from the scalp, which can disrupt the scalp barrier,” explains Dr. Adel. Last, lifestyle changes: “Reduced sunlight (and therefore vitamin D), higher stress levels, and nutritional changes during winter can all play a role,” says Dr. Adel. She emphasizes that winter shedding is usually temporary, not true hair loss. </p>



<p>Atoyebi says that winter itself does <em>not </em>directly cause hair shedding, but she echoes that the increased shedding lots of people might notice in winter could be down to more exposure to established hair-shedding factors: “Think stress, illness, and hormonal and nutritional imbalances that commonly accompany the season,” says Atoyebi. Depending on where you live, a lack of sunlight might also be a factor. Reduced sunlight can impact your body’s circadian rhythm — basically, your internal body clock. This could then reduce your quality of sleep. “All of which can impair the immune resilience your body needs to ward off and recover from said triggers,” says Atoyebi.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, you can support your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. </p></blockquote></figure>



<h2>How can you prevent winter hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Rather than trying to ‘stop’ hair shedding, Atoyebi suggests supporting your body through the seasonal stressors it tends to encounter in winter. “This includes prioritizing a nutrient-dense diet and correcting common deficiencies associated with hair shedding, particularly iron (ferritin), vitamin D, zinc, B12 or folate, omega-3 fatty acids, and ensuring adequate protein intake,” she says. </p>



<p>While I’m not deficient in iron myself, a blood test showed that I needed to increase my vitamin D and folate intake. I also take omega-3, 6, and 9 daily — and I’m noticing a positive difference in my hair shedding.</p>



<p>Besides addressing deficiencies, Dr. Adel suggests prioritizing scalp care, since a healthy scalp supports better hair growth. She recommends using scalp-focused treatments and conditioners to lock in moisture, while avoiding over-scrubbing or harsh exfoliation. I love the ritual of applying <a href=""https://rhutehair.com/products/serum?srsltid=AfmBOopKhDFqOD3FYXENxfKnMQEtdQkxG2VScpENuPF5ZdcdWbFx-5Om"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">rhute’s Density &amp; Repair Scalp Serum</a>, which moisturizes, exfoliates, and soothes the scalp with panthenol, salicylic acid, and niacinamide. Also try <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.typebea.com%2Fproducts%2Fovernight-boosting-peptide-1%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopbtKLBw_Cnqztua7eIW4TNy2aF4O66SWfl-xcaHqGHwN4WyAbH"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Typebea G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Hair Serum</a>, with baicapil, an ingredient proven to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/grow-out-bob-hair-care-expert-advice"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">strengthen hair follicles</a>. </p>





<p>Dr. Adel continues, “Don’t avoid washing your hair out of fear of shedding, as this can actually make things worse. Instead, use gentle shampoos, focus on the scalp [when washing], and try not to use overly hot water.” Since I’ve started washing my hair more regularly — every two to three days, and focusing more on the scalp than the lengths — I’ve noticed far less hair shedding each time.</p>



<p>Dr. Adel adds that aggressive towel-drying, tight hairstyles, excessive heat styling, and even friction from tight scarves and hats can all encourage breakage, so it’s important to be mindful. I swear by a gentle <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fmicrofiber-hair-towel-P507559"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">microfiber towel.</a></p>





<h2>When should you see a doctor about hair shedding? </h2>



<p>Atoyebi shares a note of encouragement to those experiencing winter shedding: “Although it can be very unsettling, diffuse shedding [where hair sheds evenly across the scalp] does not lead to baldness,” she says. “Provided that the underlying trigger is addressed, this kind of shedding is completely reversible, with regrowth starting as soon as three months after addressing the trigger.” </p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re worried about the rate at which your hair is shedding, Atoyebi recommends seeing your doctor or a certified trichologist for a blood test: “This can help identify emerging deficiencies or hormonal imbalances, allowing for appropriate, clinician-guided supplementation,” she says.  </p>

If you thought for a moment that <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/london-fashion-week-haircut-trends-fall-winter-2025"">London</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-haircut-trends-spring-summer-2026"">Paris</a>, and Milan were the only stylish European cities winning at <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/paris-fashion-week-street-style-spring-summer-2026"">fashion week</a>, let us put <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/copenhagen-fashion-week-spring-summer-2026-trends"">Copenhagen on the map</a>.<br /><br />Denmark’s capital has been quietly vying for the spotlight ever since it dipped its toe into Fashion Week in 2006, and now, almost 20 years later, it’s cemented its place as one of the most fashion-forward of the bunch.<br /> <br />This season, Copenhagen fall/winter 2026 is a masterclass in winter dressing, with faux-fur hats, oversized puffer jackets, and knitted hoods reigning supreme. But it’s the haircut trends catching our attention along the city’s picturesque thoroughfares. <br /><br />From <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/haircut-trends-2026"">full fringes</a> to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bob-haircut-trends-2026"">blunt bobs</a>, here are the standout haircut trends from Copenhagen Fashion Week F/W 26 so far. <figure><img height=""3000"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957025.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=3000&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption>This rounded cut features defined curls blended with softer, airier pieces for added dimension, while the cherry cola color adds warmth and depth. <span class=""copyright"">Photo: Paul Gonzales/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""2999"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11957027.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=2000&amp;height=2999&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2000:2999"" width=""2000"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_aalia/?hl=en"">Aalia’s hair</a> falls just below her collarbone, but when tucked into this knitted hood, it creates the illusion of a bob.

<p>A new year means a new set of trending colors for the style set to swoon over. Last year was all about <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/butter-yellow-runway-trend"">butter yellow</a>; before that, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/barbie-brand-collaborations-2023"">Barbie pink</a> and a highlighter shade of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/charli-xcx-brat-green-color-trend-fashion-history"">Brat green</a> <em>were</em> the moment. But fashion experts predict that something a little less definitive will infiltrate the market in 2026. Enter specific hues and color combinations that are as vibrant as they are complimentary to each other. “Most of us aren’t living in just one mood or style; instead we’re balancing calm with chaos, and seriousness with play,” says Xanthe Wells, VP of Global Creative at <a href=""https://newsroom.pinterest.com/news/from-cool-blue-to-persimmon-meet-the-2026-pinterest-palette/"">Pinterest</a>. The colors of 2026, she adds: “really capture how layered life feels right now.” <br /><br />More than a handful of bright colors have already popped up on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nyfw-spring-summer-2026-soccer-sport-fashion-trend"">runways</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/golden-globe-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">red carpets</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/new-york-fashion-week-spring-summer-2026-street-style"">street-style</a> looks for 2026, proving that the muted neutrals that defined “quiet luxury” are on the decline and something more effervescent is blooming in its place. From traditional primary pigments — red, blue, and yellow — to unexpected pairings like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pantone-color-of-the-year-2025-mocha-mousse"">chocolate brown</a> and frost blue, this more dynamic approach is a great opportunity to let your mood shine. “Color has become a language people use to express who they are and intentionally shape how they want to feel,” Wells says. Not yet convinced? Continue ahead for more about the colors that will reign supreme in 2026 fashion.</p>

<h2>Jade Green</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956899.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the latest collection from designers such as <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-menswear/amiri/slideshow/collection#26"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amiri</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/balmain/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Balmain</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/acne-studios/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Acne Studios</a>, then you know that the color jade is already one of the hues of the season. According to Wells, this shade of green should feel more grounded than the playful mint color that might already be in your closet, allowing it to double as a neutral all year long. <br /><br />“The color blends serenity with sophisticated elegance, yet still makes a statement,” Wells says. Those looking for a bolder take on jade should consider investing in a pair of  <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retro-sneakers-y2k-trend"">sneakers</a> so punchy, they go with nearly anything and everything.</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Primary Palettes</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956902.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Some of the best color combinations are the ones that may seem a little too on the nose. For proof, look to the number of designers who harnessed a primary color palette –– yellow, blue, and red –– in recent collections. At <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/loewe/slideshow/collection#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Loewe</a>, this manifested in tulip-shaped leather jackets and strategically-layered basics, whereas <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/dsquared/slideshow/collection#7"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DSquared2</a> took a more eclectic approach reminiscent of streetwear in the ‘90s. Colorblocked prints and stripes are a great way to embrace the trend, while styling individually-hued pieces together makes a Crayola-level impact.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Dark Plum Noir</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956903.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>A stark contrast to many of the bright, playful colors on trend for 2026, dark plum noir is moody yet striking, making it a great alternative for those who tend to wear all black. Between the rich suede outerwear from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/tom-ford/slideshow/collection?share=app#1"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford</a> and the romantic goth aesthetic of Rabanne’s pleated babydoll dresses, the deep berry hue has the power to work as both a staple and an accent in your wardrobe. Plus, it pairs well with other standout shades of the season, including electric wasabi and soft persimmon (more on that below). <br /><br />“They feel unexpected at first glance, but when you see them together, it just clicks and creates this intriguing balance,” Wells explains. “Plum noir brings this cool, collected depth, while wasabi instantly wakes up a space.”</p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Electric Wasabi</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956901.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>

Though it may seem intimidating for some, the key is to start small. A pair of statement flats can be a great place to start.<br /><br />“You can also layer a colorful piece under a neutral jacket or sweater,” Wells says. “The goal is to sprinkle in color in ways that feel authentic to you.” For a more head-turning look, layer a brightly-colored bra under a sheer top or peeking over a plunging neckline.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Shocking Pink</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956904.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The industry’s penchant for pink is set to continue well into 2026. The bright magenta of shocking pink consistently popped up across the latest runway collections. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/mm6-maison-martin-margiela/slideshow/collection#17"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">MM6 Maison Margiela</a> showcased head-to-toe pink looks, while <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/burberry-prorsum/slideshow/collection#34"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry</a> offered ample style inspo by adding a neon pink scarf to an otherwise muted outfit. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-colored-tights"">Bright tights</a> underneath mini dresses and sheer skirts are another great option if you’re looking to (literally) dip your foot into the trend instead of jumping right in. </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Chocolate Brown &amp; Blue Frost</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956906.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Mint chocolate chip, anyone? Repurpose the icy blue pieces you likely added to your closet in 2025 by pairing them with chocolate brown.

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Juicy Persimmon </h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956905.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>If you’d like to look good enough to eat, try on a few pieces in the rich, reddish shade of orange aptly named persimmon. <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/christopher-john-rogers/slideshow/collection#23"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Christopher John Rogers</a> and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2026-ready-to-wear/no-21/slideshow/collection#4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">No. 21</a> were just a few of the brands who embraced the bright hue during the Spring 2026 collections, with bold separates and monochromatic looks galore. Despite the tropical feel, the shade transitions well into the winter months, too — persimmon-colored cold-weather accessories like a beanie or <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-balaclavas-bonnets-knitted-hooded-scarf"">hooded scarf</a> are bound to make a statement.  </p>





<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Turquoise</h2>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956900.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>Brands all around the world, including <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/shanghai-spring-2026/xu-zhi/slideshow/collection#43"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Xu Zhi</a>, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/patou/slideshow/collection#36"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Patou</a>, and <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2026-ready-to-wear/j-w-anderson/slideshow/collection#31"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">JW Anderson</a> are incorporating turquoise into their collections for fall 2026, making it a must-have shade for the seasons ahead.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11922291.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic beings, February is not playing around. This is an eclipse month, the official start of the Year of the Fire House, and one of those rare chapters where it feels like the universe is flipping multiple switches at once. The month opens with a vibrant Full Moon in Leo on February 1<sup>st</sup>, a heart-forward, spotlight-stealing lunation that kicks off eclipse season. </p>



<p>Since this Full Moon arrives just before a solar eclipse, it acts as a culmination point, illuminating themes that began around the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/new-moon-in-leo-2025-july-horoscope-meaning-effects"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Leo New Moon</a> six months ago. Think creativity, confidence, romance, leadership, and self-expression. Where were you dimming your light last summer, and where are you finally ready to celebrate yourself now? The shadow here is ego or performative confidence, but the medicine is remembering that taking up space does not require apology. </p>



<p>Just two days later, we hit another major milestone as Uranus, the Planet of Surprise, stations direct in Taurus for the final stretch of its transit, something we will not see again in our lifetimes. This is big. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been shaking up our relationship with money, food systems, land, labor, and material security. As it moves forward without another retrograde in this sign, expect acceleration. </p>



<p>Economically and socially, conversations around value, resources, sustainability, and wealth distribution may reach turning points. Politically, this can look like sudden shifts tied to land, currency, or supply chains. On a personal level, it is about finally acting on the changes you’ve been circling for years. Your comfort zone is officially obsolete. </p>



<p>The first half of February carries a distinctly Aquarian flavor. With the sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Pluto all in Aquarius, the collective mood is future-focused, innovative, and a little rebellious. We’re thinking bigger than ourselves, questioning systems, and imagining new ways of living and organizing. Then, starting February 6th, the energy softens as Mercury enters Pisces, followed by Venus entering Pisces on February 10th. This shift brings emotion, intuition, and compassion back into the picture. Logic gives way to feeling and vision meets vulnerability. It’s a reminder that even as we dream up new futures, we still need tenderness, beauty, and emotional honesty to sustain them. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the astrology takes a sharp turn as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, joining Neptune, which recently made the same move. After years of Saturn in Pisces fog, this is a wake-up call. Saturn in Aries is about discipline, courage, and taking responsibility for your desires. No more waiting for permission. No more spiritual bypassing. When Saturn and Neptune conjoin on February 20th, the message is loud and clear: our dreams require structure and inspiration needs action. This is a rare alignment that supports launching creative projects, movements, or personal initiatives that feel both visionary and grounded. The shadow of the conjunction is ego battles or authority figures posturing for dominance, especially on a global scale. The higher path is conscious leadership that builds rather than destroys. </p>



<p>The centerpiece of the month is the New Moon Solar Eclipse in Aquarius at 28 degrees, a potent reset that squares Uranus in Taurus. This is not subtle energy. Expect breakthroughs, plot twists, and moments that force rapid change. Collectively, this can coincide with political shocks, technological shifts, or sudden awakenings that demand adaptability. Personally, you may feel restless, electrified, and oddly optimistic all at once. Life may move faster than planned. The key is practicing flexibility. </p>



<p>Pisces Season begins the very next day on February 18th, reminding us that even during revolution, rest matters. As Mercury retrograde begins on February 26th in Pisces, the month closes with an invitation to slow down, reflect, and release. Forgive where you can. Tie up loose ends, sleep more, create more, and love more. You cannot spell r<strong><em>evol</em></strong>ution without love, and this month reminds us that the most sustainable change always begins in the heart. </p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, February starts with fireworks, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of creativity, faith, freedom, and self-expression, reminding you that you were never meant to play small. This is a feel-good, heart-opening moment where passion projects, romantic sparks, or creative risks reach a turning point. You may feel inspired to put yourself out there, share your work, or follow joy more unapologetically. The shadow, though, is burnout or overconfidence. Leo Full Moons can make everything feel urgent and dramatic, so pace yourself. You do not need to prove your brilliance by exhausting yourself. Let confidence come from authenticity, not pressure. </p>



<p>A few days later, the energy shifts in your favor as Uranus stations direct in Taurus, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for its final stretch. This is a green light moment. Financial progress that felt stalled can suddenly move forward, and new ideas around income, pricing, or independence may land quickly. Because Uranus <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">rules Aquarius season</a>, which dominates most of February in your friendship, technology, and community sector, this is also a powerful time to show up more online, collaborate, or lean into digital platforms. Friendships, group projects, and social media can become surprisingly lucrative or confidence-boosting. Say yes to connections that feel future-focused and mutually supportive, especially if they align with your long-term goals. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight turns fully toward you as Saturn enters your sign on February 13th, beginning a two-year chapter of growth, responsibility, and leadership. This is not light energy, but it is meaningful. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, to commit to who you are becoming, and to step into authority over your life. Some days may feel heavy, like the pressure is on, but here’s the magic: Neptune is also in your sign, adding vision, faith, and imagination. When Saturn and Neptune meet on February 20th, you experience a rare blend of discipline and dreaminess. This is a metamorphosis moment. You’re learning how to build your dreams in real time. The start of the Year of the Fire Horse, paired with the Aquarius solar eclipse in your community sector, reinforces this theme. You’re not just changing yourself, you’re changing how you lead, inspire, and move within the collective. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins on February 18th, shifting your focus inward. After such an activating start to the year, you’re invited to rest, reflect, and reconnect with your spiritual side. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages solitude, forgiveness, and tying up loose emotional ends. This is not a slowdown, it’s sacred preparation. The next four weeks are about integrating everything you’ve learned, releasing old identities, and clearing space for your birthday season and the astrological new year ahead. Trust that stepping back now helps you come back stronger, wiser, and more aligned than ever. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831459.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, February marks a once-in-a-lifetime turning point for you. When Uranus stations direct in your sign early this month, it officially enters the final stretch of a transit you will not experience again in this lifetime. Since 2018, Uranus in Taurus has been reshaping your identity, your body, your confidence, and your relationship to stability. Now, there’s no more backtracking. The final months of this transit, through to April 26th, are about embodiment. This is your moment to fully <em>own </em>the version of yourself that has been quietly emerging. Radical self-acceptance, personal reinvention, and freedom from old labels are not optional anymore… they’re the assignment. The more you resist change, the louder it gets. The more you cooperate, the more empowered you feel. </p>



<p>The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st sets the tone by illuminating your home, family, and emotional foundation sector. You may feel pulled between craving comfort and needing independence. This Full Moon can bring breakthroughs around living situations, family roles, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2022/08/11094940/workplace-boundaries-unhealthy-environment"">or emotional boundaries</a>. The magic here is realizing that you can create safety without staying small. The shadow is stubbornness or emotional defensiveness. Let yourself feel proud of how far you have come, but stay open to growth. Security does not mean stagnation anymore. </p>



<p>Mid-month, things get real as we approach the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which lands in your career and public life sector and squares Uranus now direct in your sign. This is major. Eclipses bring sudden shifts, and this one may force a choice between authenticity and expectation. Career pivots, changes in direction, or moments of visibility may arrive unexpectedly. The tension is real, but it is productive. If something collapses or feels unstable, it is because it cannot come with you into the next chapter. This eclipse asks you to trust the version of yourself that Uranus has been sculpting for years, even if the world has not fully caught up yet. </p>



<p>As February unfolds,<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects""> Aquarius Season keeps</a> your focus on ambition and long-term goals, while Saturn entering Aries on February 13th pushes you to take rest, healing, and mental health seriously. You’re learning that growth requires recovery, not just effort. By the time Pisces Season begins later in the month, the energy softens, encouraging spiritual grounding and community support. Mercury retrograde toward the end of February invites reflection rather than reaction. Taurus, this isn’t a month to rush. It’s a month to <em>claim</em>. You’re stepping into the final chapter of a long reinvention. Make it intentional, make it honest, and make it yours. </p>



<div id=""gemini""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831461.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, February feels like a breath of fresh air and a spark to the mind all at once. The month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, lighting up your communication, ideas, and self-expression sector. This is a moment of clarity around your voice. A conversation, announcement, creative project, or piece of writing may reach a culmination point. You may feel more confident sharing your thoughts or finally being seen for your intelligence and creativity. The shadow is overperforming or feeling like you have to say everything at once. Let your words land with intention. You don’t need to dominate the room to make an impact. </p>



<p>One of the biggest themes for you this month is movement, mentally, socially, and spiritually. With Uranus now direct in Taurus, activating your subconscious, healing, and intuition sector, breakthroughs may come quietly but powerfully. Old fears, limiting beliefs, or mental habits you’ve outgrown are ready to dissolve for good during the final stretch of Uranus in Taurus through April. Pay attention to dreams, sudden insights, or moments of clarity that arrive out of nowhere. As an Air sign, you may be tempted to overthink these shifts, but this transit works best when you trust your inner knowing rather than analyzing it to death. </p>



<p>Mid-month brings a major reset with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, landing in your fellow Air sign and activating your sector of growth, travel, education, and big-picture vision. This eclipse kicks off the Year of the Fire Horse, and for you, it feels like momentum returning after a period of mental fog. Opportunities to expand your world, learn something new, or share your ideas more widely may appear suddenly. The square to Uranus means plans may change quickly, but those changes are purposeful. Stay flexible. This is not about controlling the path, but following the curiosity that pulls you forward. </p>



<p>As the month winds down, the focus shifts to your career and public life as Pisces season begins, followed by Mercury retrograde on February 26th in your professional sector. Because Mercury is your ruling planet, you will feel this deeply. Work plans may slow, feedback may feel confusing, or old goals may need revision. This is not a failure moment, it is a reroute. Instead of spiraling, use this time to reflect on what success actually means to you now. Dream up new possibilities without forcing immediate answers. February is asking you to trust that clarity arrives when you stop rushing it. </p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831462.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Cancer, February hits different for you because you’re ruled by the moon, and this month is basically a lunar rollercoaster in the best and most transformative way. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your money, self-worth, and security sector, bringing big feelings around value, confidence, and what you deserve. This can look like a financial win, a reality check, or a moment where you finally realize you’ve been underestimating yourself. Because eclipse season begins immediately after, emotions may feel heightened, dramatic, or extra revealing. Try not to react impulsively. Lunar energy always passes, but the insights it brings are lasting. If something feels loud, it’s because it needs your attention, not your panic. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the spotlight intensifies with the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse, which activates your intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth sector. For a moon-ruled sign, eclipses can feel like emotional plot twists. You may experience breakthroughs around trust, vulnerability, finances tied to others, or emotional bonds that no longer feel safe or reciprocal. Things may shift quickly, especially as this eclipse squares Uranus, bringing sudden realizations or changes. Breathe through it… What’s being cleared now is making space for deeper, healthier connections. You are not losing control, you’re releasing emotional weight you were never meant to carry alone. </p>



<p>One of the most important long-term themes for you begins this month as Saturn and Neptune both move through Aries, your career and public life sector. Yes, this is very different energy from your natural watery rhythm, but it is also powerful. Aries is a fellow Cardinal sign, which means you’re being asked to lead, initiate, and take yourself seriously in new ways. Saturn may bring pressure, responsibility, or moments of self-doubt around your path, while Neptune adds vision, faith, and creativity. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel a strong pull toward a new purpose or calling. The key is not shrinking in the presence of fire. You don’t need to become someone else to succeed. Lead with emotional intelligence. Your sensitivity is not a weakness here, it is your edge. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces season begins, harmonizing with your Cancer sun and offering emotional relief. After a month of intensity, Pisces Season invites rest, spiritual reflection, creativity, and compassion. Mercury retrograde late in the month encourages you to slow down, revisit old beliefs, and give yourself grace. You’re not behind… you’re integrating. February teaches you that emotional courage is just as powerful as action. When you honor your feelings instead of fighting them, you move forward with far more strength than you realize. </p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831463.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, February opens with <em>your </em>moment in the spotlight, literally. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lands in your identity, confidence, and self-expression sector, officially kicking oﬀ eclipse season and reminding everyone who the main character is. This is a powerful culmination point tied to intentions you set<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/leo-season-2025-horoscope-july-meaning-effects""> around Leo Season</a> last summer. You may feel seen, celebrated, or finally ready to own a version of yourself you’ve been growing into quietly. Creativity, romance, leadership, and self-belief are amplified. The shadow is overdoing it, overpromising, or feeling crushed if the applause doesn’t come fast enough. Let this Full Moon be about authentic confidence, not performance. You don’t need to prove anything… your presence already speaks. </p>



<p>For most of the month, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season puts your relationships</a> front and center, and things get real fast. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse later in the month activates your partnership sector and squares Uranus in Taurus, which has been shaking up your home, family, and emotional foundation for years. Translation: relationship dynamics may force conversations you’ve been avoiding. A partnership could change form, deepen, or end so that something more honest can take its place. Living situations, family roles, or emotional attachments may suddenly feel incompatible with who you’re becoming. This eclipse isn’t the most comfortable, but it is necessary. Breakthroughs arrive when you stop trying to control the narrative and allow the truth to surface, even if it disrupts the status quo. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Saturn and Neptune in Aries begin reshaping your beliefs, worldview, and sense of purpose. You’re being asked to commit to a bigger vision for your life, not just chase validation. Around their conjunction on February 20th, you may feel called to step into a leadership role, spiritual path, or long-term goal that requires courage and consistency. The challenge is impatience. Fire wants everything now, but this chapter rewards faith paired with discipline. Trust that clarity builds through action, not just confidence. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy deepens as Pisces Season activates your intimacy, shared resources, and healing sector. After a very visible, relationally charged start to the month, you’re invited inward. Emotional honesty, vulnerability, and energetic cleanup become priorities. Mercury retrograde late in February encourages reflection around trust, finances tied to others, and emotional boundaries. This is not a step back, it’s integration. February teaches you that true main-character energy isn’t about being adored, it’s about being aligned. When you honor that, everything else follows. </p>



<div id=""virgo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831464.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Virgo, February is not just another month for you. It’s a preview episode. The eclipse storyline unfolding now is actively leading toward the total lunar eclipse in your sign on 3/3/2026, and what you feel, notice, or question around mid-February is part of a much bigger arc. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your rest, healing, and subconscious sector, stirring emotions, memories, and realizations that may not fully make sense yet. That’s okay. This is your cue to slow down and listen. The work right now isn’t fixing or optimizing. It’s observing patterns, especially around burnout, self-criticism, or where you’ve been carrying more than your share. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius Season and</a> the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activate your work, wellness, and daily routines sector. This is major for you. Eclipses here can bring sudden shifts in schedule, job dynamics, health habits, or how you structure your days. Something may stop working the way it used to, and that’s intentional. This eclipse is asking you to redesign your life in a way that supports your energy, not just your productivity. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes may feel abrupt or inconvenient, but they’re opening the door to a more sustainable rhythm. Think of this as the first draft. The full revelation comes in March. </p>



<p>Relationships also play a central role this month as Pisces season begins on February 18th, activating your partnership sector. Emotional sensitivity increases, and you may feel more aware of imbalances, unspoken expectations, or where you’ve been over-functioning in connection. Mercury retrograde later in the month encourages reflection rather than confrontation. This is not about making final decisions yet. It’s about noticing how your body responds to certain people and commitments. Your nervous system is giving you data. Trust it. </p>



<p>The most important preparation you can do now is rest, honesty, and gentle recalibration. February is helping you shed layers before the 3/3 Virgo eclipse asks you to step into a new version of yourself. You don’t need to rush clarity. You need to protect your energy, simplify where possible, and stay curious about what’s ending naturally. This is not a breakdown… it’s a sacred edit. And you are right on time. </p>



<div id=""libra""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831465.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Libra, February opens with a clarifying moment as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your friendship, community, and long-term goals sector. This lunation asks you to look closely at who you’re building with and where you truly belong. You may feel proud of a collective achievement, step into a more visible role within a group, or realize that certain social dynamics no longer fit the future you’re envisioning. The shadow here is staying connected out of obligation or fear of rocking the boat. Let this Full Moon remind you that alignment matters more than approval. </p>



<p>As the month moves forward, the tone deepens significantly. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your partnership and marriage sector for the next several years. This is a major chapter opener. Saturn brings reality checks, boundaries, and long-term commitments, while Neptune dissolves illusions and asks for soul-level honesty. Together, they begin reshaping how you approach relationships of all kinds. Some connections may feel heavier, more serious, or more demanding, while others reveal whether they can actually go the distance. The most important shift, though, starts internally. Your relationship with yourself is being redefined, and from that place, your standards naturally rise. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your creativity, romance, and self-expression sector, adding unpredictability to the mix. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, sparks can fly unexpectedly. A creative breakthrough, romantic turning point, or sudden realization about what truly brings you joy may arrive quickly. While this energy can feel destabilizing, it’s also liberating. It challenges you to choose pleasure, authenticity, and passion without apologizing or over-explaining. If something cracks open now, it’s because it was limiting your ability to feel alive. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward work, wellness, and daily balance, encouraging you to slow down and integrate everything you’ve learned. Mercury retrograde later in February asks you to revisit habits, commitments, and routines that affect your energy. Libra, February is not about rushing relationship decisions. It’s about clarity, honesty, and laying a foundation that can actually support love, partnership, and self-respect over time. The choices you make now echo far beyond this month, so trust the pacing. </p>



<div id=""scorpio""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831467.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, February opens with a moment that puts you <em>on the map</em>, whether you asked for it or not. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your career, reputation, and legacy sector, bringing a culmination or revelation around your professional life. This could look like recognition, a new role, a public win, or the realization that the version of success you’ve been chasing no longer fits. And yes, both can be true at the same time. The shadow of this Full Moon is over-identifying with achievement or feeling pressure to perform. The lesson is visibility without self-betrayal. Let yourself be seen, but not at the cost of your well-being. </p>



<p>Around this same time, Uranus stations direct in Taurus, bringing a noticeable shift in your partnership and relationship sector. After years of unpredictability, surprises, and emotional curveballs in one-on-one dynamics, things begin to stabilize in a new way. Not “back to normal,” but clearer. You may feel more grounded in what you want from relationships, less reactive to sudden changes, and more confident advocating for space, honesty, or freedom. This direct motion helps rebalance your relational life, especially after a long period of adapting to the unexpected. The lesson now is integration. You don’t have to abandon intimacy to protect your independence. </p>



<p>As the month unfolds, a deeper shift begins as Neptune and Saturn move through Aries, your work, routines, and energy-management sector. Neptune is already here, heightening your sensitivity to environments, tasks, and expectations that drain you. You’re no longer willing to tolerate work that feels misaligned, performative, or soul-sucking. Saturn’s entry on February 13th, followed by their conjunction on February 20th, asks you to restructure how you work, not just what you work toward. Boundaries become non-negotiable. You may need to be a little more “selfish” with your energy, and that’s not a flaw, it’s wisdom. This is the beginning of a longer chapter where sustainable success matters more than grinding for approval. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse activates your home and emotional foundations sector, creating tension between public life and private needs. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, changes around living situations, family dynamics, or emotional security may arrive suddenly. You may realize that certain professional goals require a different kind of support system, or that your current setup is no longer compatible with the life you’re building. The Leo–Aquarius polarity running through this month makes one thing clear: you can’t keep sacrificing your inner world for external validation. </p>



<p>By the end of February, the energy softens beautifully as Pisces Season begins, harmonizing with your Scorpio nature. This brings more creativity, romance, play, and emotional release. You’re reminded that joy is not a reward for productivity, it’s a necessity. Mercury retrograde later in the month invites reflection rather than action, helping you integrate everything you’ve learned. Scorpio, this eclipse season isn’t just about career breakthroughs, it’s about finally letting the world see the full range of what you oﬀer. You have talents, gifts, and ideas that deserve daylight. Stop hiding them. The right people are ready to receive what you’ve been holding back. </p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831468.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, February opens with a spark that reignites your sense of purpose and possibility. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your sector of travel, education, belief systems, and long-term vision, bringing clarity or culmination around a dream you’ve been nurturing since last summer. You may feel ready to take a leap, say yes to an opportunity, or finally trust a path that once felt uncertain. This Full Moon is about faith, but the shadow is overconfidence or assuming everything will work out without eﬀort. Let inspiration lead you forward, but back it up with follow-through. </p>



<p>The month continues with a strong Aquarian influence as <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">Aquarius season activates</a> your communication, learning, and local community sector. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse mid-month brings sudden shifts in how you share ideas, connect, or move through your daily environment. Conversations, contracts, or plans may change quickly, but these shifts are meant to open new doors. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, flexibility is essential. The more open you are to rerouting, the easier this transition becomes. Think curiosity over control. </p>



<p>A major long-term shift arrives as Saturn enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th, activating your sector of creativity, joy, romance, and self-expression. This marks the beginning of a more serious relationship with your passions. You’re being asked to commit to what lights you up, not just chase excitement. Neptune brings imagination and inspiration, while Saturn asks for structure and discipline. Together, they help you turn play into purpose. The challenge is impatience. Creative growth takes time, even when the vision feels urgent. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, the energy softens as Pisces Season begins, drawing your focus toward home, emotional grounding, and rest. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than action, especially around family matters or personal decisions. This is a moment to slow down, integrate the lessons of an intense month, and reconnect with what feels emotionally supportive. Sagittarius, February reminds you that expansion doesn’t always mean movement. Sometimes growth happens when you let yourself land.</p>

<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, February opens with a moment that asks you to slow down and feel before you act. The Full Moon in Leo on February 1st activates your sector of intimacy, shared resources, and emotional depth, bringing a culmination around trust, vulnerability, or financial entanglements. This can look like an important conversation, a realization about power dynamics, or a moment where you see clearly what feels reciprocal and what doesn’t. The shadow here is control or emotional withdrawal. The medicine is honesty. Let yourself be real about what you need instead of managing everything from behind the scenes. </p>



<p>The bigger shift arrives mid-month, and for you, it’s <em>major</em>. On February 13th, Saturn enters Aries, ending its two-and-a-half-year journey through Pisces. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’ve felt Saturn in Pisces deeply, often as emotional fatigue, blurred boundaries, or the pressure to hold space for others without clear structure. Saturn moving into Aries is a sharp pivot. This is fire, not water. Action, not ambiguity. But here’s the tension: Aries squares Capricorn. Over the next two years, you may feel challenged to act faster than you’re comfortable with, to initiate before everything feels perfectly planned. Frustration can arise if you cling too tightly to control. The growth edge is learning when to lead boldly instead of cautiously. You don’t lose authority by adapting, you expand it. </p>



<p>That lesson intensifies as Saturn conjoins Neptune on February 20th, activating your home, family, and emotional foundations sector. This is about restructuring your inner world, not just your external goals. You may feel called to redefine what stability actually means, where you live, who you build with, or how you emotionally ground yourself. Neptune adds sensitivity and imagination, while Saturn demands realism. Together, they ask you to build a life that supports your nervous system, not just your resume. This is not about abandoning ambition, it’s about rooting it somewhere sustainable. </p>



<p>By the end of the month, Pisces Season shifts your focus toward communication, mindset, and emotional processing. Mercury retrograde later in February encourages reflection rather than decisive action. Old conversations may resurface. Plans may need revising. Take that as a gift, not a setback. Capricorn, February is a turning point. You’re learning how to lead without carrying everything alone, how to adapt without losing yourself, and how to build a future that feels as solid internally as it looks externally. </p>



<div id=""aquarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831471.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, February opens with your relationships front and center as the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st lights up your partnership sector. This is a culmination point around love, commitment, collaboration, or even long-standing dynamics that have needed clarity for a while. You may feel seen by someone in a new way or finally realize where a relationship has been more about performance than presence. The shadow here is ego clashes or projecting instead of listening. The growth is learning that real connection does not threaten your independence, it strengthens it. </p>



<p>Then, everything pivots toward <em>you</em>. The first three weeks of February are dominated <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/aquarius-season-horoscope-january-2026-meaning-effects"">by Aquarius Season</a>, and this year, it’s not subtle. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse in your sign is a major identity reset, one that you will continue to feel echoes of for the next two years. Eclipses in your sign are not casual… they’re chapter-defining. This one asks you to shed an old version of yourself, whether that’s a role, label, or way of moving through the world that no longer fits. Because this eclipse squares Uranus, your modern ruler, changes may feel sudden or destabilizing at first. Plans can shift quickly. Your sense of direction may evolve overnight. Trust that whatever is cracking open now is making room for a more authentic version of you to emerge. </p>



<p>Adding to the intensity, Uranus stations direct in Taurus early in the month, ending its final retrograde in a sign it will not revisit in your lifetime. As a Uranus-ruled sign, you feel this shift deeply. This direct motion brings momentum to changes around home, family, emotional security, and where you put down roots. Uranus’ shift direct reminds you that growth requires movement, even when it disrupts comfort. This isn’t about chaos for chaos’ sake. It’s about liberation. This February, the universe is nudging you to choose evolution over familiarity. </p>



<p>Mid-month, the plot thickens as Saturn, your traditional ruler, enters Aries on February 13th, followed by its conjunction with Neptune on February 20th. Saturn moving into Aries activates your communication, mindset, and learning sector, asking you to take your ideas seriously and follow through on them. This is about disciplined thinking, intentional speech, and committing to a vision rather than floating between possibilities. With Neptune involved, dreams feel vivid, but Saturn insists on structure. The tension you may feel is between wanting freedom and needing responsibility. The breakthrough comes when you realize you can have both. Aquarius, February is a spotlight moment. You’re being reshaped in real time. Let the world see you as you are becoming, not as you used to be. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831472.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, of all the signs, you <em>made it</em>. February marks the end of one of the most intense chapters of your life as Saturn finally leaves your sign, closing a cycle that began back in 2023. This transit has tested your boundaries, maturity, resilience, and sense of self in ways that few people around you could fully see. You were asked to grow up, and show up, even when you were tired, unsure, or grieving old versions of yourself. The weight begins to lift this month, and while you’re not magically “done” with the lessons, you’re done carrying them alone. Take a moment to honor yourself. Seriously. </p>



<p>Before Saturn fully changes the game, the month opens with the Full Moon in Leo on February 1st, activating your work, health, and daily routines sector. This can bring clarity around habits, jobs, or responsibilities that have been draining you. You may realize how much you’ve been doing on empty, or finally see which systems no longer support your energy. The shadow is pushing through exhaustion just to prove you can. You don’t need to prove anything anymore. This Full Moon asks you to choose sustainability over self-sacrifice. </p>



<p>The real plot twist arrives mid-month when Saturn enters Aries, activating your money, values, and self-worth sector for the next two years. At first glance, this could sound intense, Saturn is still Saturn, after all. But here’s the magic: Neptune is already in Aries too. This means that for the first time in years, discipline and dreaming are working <em>together </em>for you, especially around finances. Instead of feeling restricted, you’re learning how to build something real from your imagination. Around the Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, you may have a breakthrough around income, pricing your work, or realizing that you’re allowed to be both spiritual and supported. You’re not here to struggle forever. That chapter is closing. </p>



<p>As the month continues, Pisces Season begins, returning the spotlight to you and reminding you who you are beneath the pressure. The Aquarius New Moon Solar Eclipse earlier in the month may have stirred subconscious fears or old patterns, but by the end of February, clarity replaces confusion. Mercury retrograde invites reflection, forgiveness, and gentle release rather than big pushes. Pisces, February isn’t about rushing forward. It’s about exhaling. You’ve done the hard part. Now you get to build a life that actually feels like yours, with faith, structure, and self-worth finally aligned. </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956574.png?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>While Oregon became a state in 1859, Latines have been part of the region for more than 150 years. Arriving mostly from Mexico within decades of statehood and, in some cases, before it, they often came as laborers, working railroads, agriculture, mining, and ranching. And today, the more than 70,000 Latines who call Portland home carry that legacy forward, contributing not only to the city’s economy but to its cultural fabric, politics, and future.</p>



<p>These days, much of the community — still overwhelmingly Mexican, but also shaped by migrants from across Central America, South America, and the Caribbean — are behind the city’s community pillars. During a recent trip to Portland, sponsored by <a href=""https://www.travelportland.com/"">Travel Portland</a>, I experienced these bustling Latine-owned businesses firsthand. </p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956576.jpeg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p>I spent the initial hours of my first night at <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a wellness space and shop selling plant-based beauty and wellness products hand-mixed by owner and curanderista Yvonne Pérez Emerson. Drawing from her Indigenous Mexican and Scottish lineage, she also offers healing services including limpias, rebozo rituals, drum cleansing, and hapé ceremonies. After first holding me in a plática — a heart-to-heart conversation meant to better understand my emotional and spiritual state — I laid down on a bodywork table as she utilized prayer, sacred plants, cleansing smoke, breath, rhythm, and, at times, an egg to clear dense, stagnant energies and attachments throughout my body. The limpia, deeply emotional and beautifully insightful, eased the weight I had been carrying in my mind, body, and spirit, leaving me calm, open, and ready for the weekend ahead. </p>



<p>An adorably walkable city where history and progressive fight live on every corner, some mornings I walked past walls shouting reminders like “the border crossed us” — a popular Mexican saying that speaks to how the U.S. invaded Mexico and claimed its land, turning Mexican residents into so-called immigrants overnight — before grabbing a veggie burrito at Mexican-owned <a href=""https://losburrossupremos.com/"">Los Burros Supremos</a>. During the day, I hiked Forest Park, the largest urban park in the country, with <a href=""https://aroundportlandtours.com/"">Around Portland Tours</a>, learning both about how locals are protecting native flora and fauna as well as the mystical, age-old tales of women who fled and avenged the violence of men, their secrets and mysteries still held safe under the shadowy canopy of the Douglas firs. At night, I made my way to <a href=""https://milagro.org/"">Teatro Milagro</a>, a Latine arts and culture center that’s been serving the community since 1985, to catch <em>Autoretrato de Fridita,</em> a table-top puppetry show telling the story of a young Frida Kahlo and how she used her imagination and a box of paints to help her overcome challenges and create her own world amid the Mexican Revolution.</p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956580.jpeg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure></div>



<p>Other days, I was immersed in the city’s often-overlooked history. At the <a href=""https://www.ohs.org/"">Oregon Historical Society</a>, I learned about the nearly 15,000 Mexican men who came to Oregon during World War II through the Bracero Program, helping sustain the state’s farming and timber industries while U.S. men were deployed, and often experiencing wage theft, dangerous conditions, and segregation in return. At the <a href=""https://www.portlandmuseum.org/"">Portland Museum of Art</a>, I marveled at abstract works by Afro-Puerto Rican artist Iván Carmona Rosario that took inspiration from the mountains of a Caribbean land we both call home. And at <a href=""https://letshopscotch.com/locations/portland"">Hopscotch</a>, an immersive art experience, I wept in the Secret Garden, a room by artists Paloma Cortez and Pamela Rachel, where participants safely and anonymously share their deepest secrets, trusting strangers to listen and hold them beneath the shelter of artistic tree and bush forms. Finally, I ended the night, and my trip, at <a href=""https://www.barpalomar.com/"">Palomar</a>, a tropical, dimly-lit Cuban restaurant-bar, savoring a deeply satisfying jackfruit ropa vieja tostada.</p>



<p>When I boarded my flight back home to Orlando, I was deeply proud of the Latines who, for generations, have carved out home in this Northwest city, and eager to uplift their stories, spaces, and brands.</p>



<h2><strong>Orox’s Leather Goods</strong></h2>



<p>The people have spoken, and they have named <a href=""https://www.oroxleather.com/"">Orox</a> the best-smelling shop in Portland. The scent of warm leather may initially draw passersby into the store and workshop in the city’s Old Town district, but it’s the quality of the handbags, aprons, and jackets — and the multi-generational story behind each piece – that keeps them coming back. </p>



<p>The story of Orox — a play on Oregon and Oaxaca, the Mexican city where its origins begin — dates back to 1933, when Don Felipe Martínez Audelo began crafting custom leather baseball gear and belts for his own team, Los Audelos. His grandson, José, would later hone the family trade in Japan, where he spent years developing and manufacturing his own leather designs. When José eventually returned to Oaxaca, he believed he would leave the craft behind. Instead, his son, Martín, moved to Portland, studied business, and reignited the family legacy.</p>





<p>Today, Orox is a family-owned and -run business, grounded in the belief that family is formed not only through blood but also through chosen bonds. From the aprons worn by restaurant chefs, to the purses slung over women’s shoulders, to the journals university students fill with notes, each piece proudly carries the Orox name.</p>



<p>And the leather goods, designed by José in Oaxaca and handcrafted and assembled in the Portland shop, are made to last lifetimes. “We aim to create high-quality, durable goods that, while stylish, don’t go in and out of style,” the website notes of its items. “We hope that our products will be used and loved for years, and eventually passed on to the next generation.”</p>



<h2><strong>Make &amp; Mary’s Wellness Essentials</strong></h2>





<p>Drawing inspiration from her ancestral lineage — Mexican and Scottish — herbalist and curandera Yvonne Pérez Emerson uses earth-based wisdom to grow, blend, and bottle botanical offerings through her brand <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/"">Make &amp; Mary</a>. Since 2016, the brand has crafted and refined wellness and beauty creations that are natural, cruelty-free, vegan, and thoughtfully low-waste. The brand carries <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/face-body-serum"">face serums</a> formulated with rosehip seed, wild carrot seed, and rose geranium; bath essentials like <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/ritual-bath-essentials/products/forest-bathing-body-polish"">Forest Bathing Body Polish</a>, made of mango, shea, lime, vetiver, and clary sage; nourishing <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/armonia-cacao-hemp-tea"">Armonía Cacao Hemp teas</a>; and home goods, like the delicious <a href=""https://makeandmary.com/collections/frontpage/products/soulshine-ritual-essential-oil-candle"">Soulshine Ritual Essential Oil Candle</a>, with notes of palo santo, holy basil, and ylang-ylang. The brick-and-mortar shop in Portland’s Alberta Arts District, where Pérez Emerson produces her entire line, also houses <a href=""https://www.casaderitual.com/"">Casa de Ritual</a>, a space for deeply spiritual and transformative self-care rituals and events.</p>



<h2><strong>Arium’s Houseplants </strong></h2>





<p>With the belief that “there is a plant out there for everyone,” Tylor Rogers and Alba Sanchez founded <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com"">Arium</a>, Latin for “a space or vessel that contains something,” in 2017. The queer-, Latine-, and vegan-owned houseplant shop is a safe space where all, regardless of gender, immigration status, or religion, are welcome — and where no question about plants is silly or illegitimate. It’s a space for learning about and taking home unusual plants. It nurses smaller <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/agraecum-leonis"">Agraecum leonis</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/ceropegia-ampliata"">Ceropegia ampliatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/in-stock/products/dracaena-masoniana"">Dracaena masonianas</a> as well as larger <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/monstera-deliciosa-xl"">Monstera deliciosas</a>, <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/dracaena-marginata-xl-1"">Dracaena marginatas</a>, and <a href=""https://ariumbotanicals.com/collections/trees-pickup-or-local-delivery/products/ficus-elastica-burgundy"">Ficus elasticas</a>. Even more, they work with small businesses and makers for its stunning selection of handmade planters and ceramics.</p>



<h2><strong>Nossa Familia Coffee</strong></h2>





<p><br /><a href=""https://www.nossacoffee.com"">Nossa Familia Coffee</a> was founded in Portland in 2004, but owner Augusto Carneiro comes from a lineage of coffee growers in the highlands of his homeland, Brazil, that dates back to the 1890s. After a career in mechanical engineering left him unfulfilled, he found his thoughts drifting back to his childhood and the time he spent working on his family’s coffee farms in Brazil. Nossa Familia, Portuguese for “our family,” ultimately brought those reveries, and ancestral traditions, into his new life in the Northwest. But his business, which now comprises a Portland-based roastery and two zero-waste cafés, is still deeply rooted in home, working with coffee-growers in Brazil as well as in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia, and more. </p>



<h2><strong>La Familia Cider </strong></h2>



<p>As a first-generation Mexican immigrant family, the Gonzalezes wanted to create something that was at once Oregonian and Mexican. When wife and mother Shani tasted locally-made cider, she had the idea of combining Oregon’s new craft cider movement with Mexico’s passion for fresh-fruit drinks. After convincing her husband and children, <a href=""https://lafamiliacider.com/"">La Familia Cider</a>, founded in 2017, was born. </p>





<p>Every cider is crafted with 100% Northwest apple juice, using mainstay flavors like manzana, tamarindo, and hibiscus (or the seasonal guayaba flavor) to offer distinctive hard ciders inspired by Mexico’s aguas frescas. Named “Best Taproom of Salem, Oregon,” La Familia operates out of Salem and Portland, and can be found in more than 500 local shops around Oregon and Washington. Helping the cider taste even sweeter: a percentage of La Familia Cider’s profits are donated to organizations supporting immigrants’ rights.<br /></p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There wasn’t really an expectation from my parents, but it was understood that that would be my path from an early age. I graduated valedictorian in high school and took my studies very seriously. I did go to a private liberal arts college in Utah, where I got a lot of scholarships. For my first three years, I had to take out federal AND private loans for what scholarships did not cover. For the last year, scholarships covered mostly all my costs, and I paid out of savings for the small remainder of what was left. I supported myself financially throughout college, and I am responsible for paying my student loan debt off by myself, and I had known this was going to be the case my whole life.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I don’t recall hearing or having many financial conversations when I was really young. When I was about 10, my dad tried to teach me about money through people like Tony Robbins, but I HATED when he made me listen to him or read books on money (why was I being forced to read <em>The Richest Man in Babylon</em> this young? And I DID do it because I am nothing if not persistent). My parents split up when I was in middle school, and that was when I became very aware of money. My mom didn’t have a job because my dad wanted to “take care of the family,” so she had to work minimum-wage jobs to care for us up until the past few years. My dad didn’t make a lot of money at this time (he is an entrepreneurial doctor), so he wasn’t providing much more than the bare minimum. My four siblings and I had homes, beds to sleep in, and food to eat, thanks to governmental assistance, but weren’t given money for new clothes or spending money — and we’d sometimes struggle with heating our house in the winter. I am <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eldest-daughter-syndrome-oldest-sibling-family-responsibilities"">the eldest daughter</a>, so I was brought into a lot of these conversations and was made very aware of our financial situation as a teenager.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />When I was 12, I started babysitting. I babysat the same family for five summers throughout middle school and high school. I got it to pay for my own clothes, fun experiences, and gas. I also tutored when I was in high school. I had short stints at Pizza Hut and a local chain restaurant (I hate the food and restaurant industry). My first “real” job that I kept for a long time was at a local pharmacy as a delivery driver.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />When I was very young, no. I had a very comfortable childhood — we went on family vacations, I went on multiple shopping sprees a year, and I engaged in many extra-curricular activities. After my parents’ divorce, yes! I stopped myself from doing extracurricular activities because I didn’t want to ask my parents for money and I worked a lot as a teenager. I wanted to have fun money to go out with my best friends, and I saved up a lot of money to move out for college. I think all my parents provided for that was the cost of my first plane ticket to Utah.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes and no. I definitely am aware of lifestyle creep, but I’ve been quietly letting myself indulge in the luxury of making more money than I ever have before. I am smart and cognizant of how I spend my money. If something comes up, I usually have the money to cover it. I know I will not be able to afford to buy a house, or retire young, or even comfortably have children on the salary I have now in Chicago, but I have high hopes for myself and I know I will only grow in my career. Also, I sometimes do have the Gen Z view of having no hope for the future of our economy… I barely even expect to be able to ever buy a house or retire. I used to have a lot of money anxiety, and I’m honestly proud of where I’m at now — even if it’s sort of fatalistic. I try not to think too much about the future while also saving what I can. I’m working hard, and I’m going to enjoy my life now! Sorry if this is problematic!<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />Even though I pay for mostly everything by myself, my mom covers streaming services and still pays for my phone bill and iCloud storage. When I visit home, my mom, dad, or grandma pretty much cover anything I need when I’m with them. If I’m alone, I pay. If I’m with my younger sisters, I often cover their expenses, as well. I know if I were to need it, I could always move back home and in with my mom, dad, or grandma. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />When I graduated high school, I got a lot of money from extended family and friends (I’m not sure how much), and $1,000 from my grandfather when I graduated college that I used to buy my car in Utah (which I have since sold, and lost money on by the way… I’m still angry about that). Other than those monetary gifts, no. <br /></p>



<h3>Day One: Thursday</h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — I finally wake up after snoozing my alarm a few times (I’ve gotten into a bad habit of this; I haven’t been sleeping well recently) and drag myself out of bed. My day always starts in the bathroom brushing my teeth and doing my skincare (CosRX snail mucin, Vanicream moisturizer, and Innisfree sunscreen). </p>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I make my morning coffee (iced hazelnut oatmilk lattes every morning using my Gemini Express), feed my cat, R., roll out my yoga mat for a 10 minute morning flow, and then get ready for the day. </p>



<p>7:15 a.m. — Breakfast time. This morning, I’m having egg whites and spinach, chicken sausage, and a piece of buttered toast. I have some version of this pretty much every morning. </p>



<p>7:40 a.m. — I head out the door after saying bye to R. I take the bus to work this morning. It’s free every time I tap into public transit because I pay for the unlimited monthly CTA pass (included in expenses above).</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — Once I arrive at work, I put my lunch in the fridge and set myself up for the day. In the morning, I spend some time planning my day, responding to emails, and getting organized. This morning I’m drinking a blood orange kombucha I brought from home.</p>



<p>10:40 a.m. — I spend the morning working on content planning and creation. I wear a lot of different hats in my full-time position, so I’m always doing something different. I also take a break to eat the ripest, most delicious farmers’ market peach.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Lunch break. I eat what I brought from home (it’s a beef bowl lol) and then go on my lunchtime walk. I spend some of it researching a potential therapist. I haven’t been in a few years, and feel like I really need to be back in therapy. My anxiety has gotten, and is getting, exponentially worse as I get older. I don’t want to pay for it at all, though, which is why I’ve been putting off finding a new one. I try calling the office of a therapist that looks somewhat promising, but they don’t answer. I leave a voicemail.</p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — My afternoon consists of more caption writing and creative ideation. I break to chat with a colleague about how her daughter’s college move-in day went. I love talking to my colleagues, which doesn’t happen that often. I’m almost always one of a few people in-office. I eat two chocolate caramels, then start to wrap up the workday.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I leave work and walk home. I either like to walk to or from work. I prefer walking home FROM work, and now that it’s not as hot outside, I can finally do that. I call my mom on the walk home after I try the therapist’s office once again (they don’t answer).</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — Home! I do my dishes from this morning, scoop litter, and get dressed. My best friend, M., and I have plans tonight that we’ve been wanting to do since last summer and I’m very excited! Before she gets to my house, I spend some time doing some of my freelance tasks. Today, I am doing community management and posting on socials. </p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — M. comes over and we start our trek to the restaurant. It takes a long time because we are using public transportation and it’s quite far north. We just chat the whole way about life updates. On our walk to the restaurant, we get stuck behind a HUGE group of people wearing all white. They end up situating themselves in the grass across from the restaurant, and the rest of our night is spent trying to figure out what is going on. We discover that it’s some sort of all white “dinner party” that you have to pay $100 to go to even though you have to bring your own chairs, table, food, cups, etc. Weird?!</p>



<p>7:00 p.m. — M. and I eat our food, listen to the live band that’s playing, talk some more, and watch the sunset over the lake. It’s a beautiful night, and quite chilly. I’m excited for fall because fall in Chicago rules. We split cheese curds, and I get the blackened shrimp tacos. <strong>$36.78</strong></p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — We finally catch the bus home and laugh the whole way. It was a silly night for some reason. I arrive home to my boyfriend, N., putting our new dining table and chairs together. We just moved in together last month, so we’re still getting settled and buying new furniture. Previously (and in my last Money Diary) I lived with my best friend M. All three of us moved to Chicago together — we are besties!</p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — I shower, do my skincare (double cleanse with Dr. Hauschka soothing cleansing milk and Drunk Elephant jelly cleanser, Vanicream moisturizer, Cetaphil eye cream), and fall asleep watching <em>The White Lotus</em> on my phone.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $36.78</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Two: Friday</h3>



<p>6:20 a.m. — I wake up after snoozing my alarms multiple times (again). R. is very obsessed with me this morning and follows me around, watching everything I do. He has a bowl of food, so he just wants my attention. I make sure to give him some! He’s the cutest. </p>



<p>7:40 a.m. — After my morning routine, I take the bus to work. I arrive at work about 10 minutes later — this was one of my smoothest commutes in a while! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I was not very hungry this morning and I only had a small bowl of chia seed pudding, so I get hungry around this time. I eat the Mid-Day Square I brought from home to hopefully hold me over until lunch.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I spend my morning doing administrative tasks and grant searching. I get hungry and take my break for lunch. I eat (the same lunch as yesterday), go outside, and read a little bit of my current book (I am re-reading <em>Normal People</em> by Sally Rooney). I also book a massage for next week because M. (bff) got me a gift card for my birthday that I still haven’t used.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — The afternoon DRAGS ON, but it’s finally time to go. We had summer Fridays, and this was the first Friday back to normal hours. Rough. I am a firm believer that it should be company policy everywhere that work should end early on Fridays. I eat a peach at some point and I call my sister, A., on the walk home. She’s a freshman in college, and just moved in yesterday.</p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — After doing some chores, putting a load of laundry in, and eating a snack (almonds, cheese, cranberries), I go on a walk. It ends up being a lot longer than expected because I call my grandma and we talk about her life in her 20s. It was a very sweet conversation. I end up at Trader Joe’s and buy myself pork dumplings, ravioli, a Chomps stick, bacon and egg gummies, and white cheddar popcorn. I talk to my mom and sister on the walk home. <strong>$13.70</strong></p>



<p>8:00 p.m. — I spend my evening eating the pork dumplings and watching <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em>. N. wants to watch <em>The White Lotus</em> with me but I end up falling asleep at 9:30. I feel like something is wrong with me because I can’t stay awake past 10 p.m. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13.70</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Three: Saturday</h3>



<p>7:45 a.m. — I wake up before my alarm and lay in bed for a while. I try not to do this, but I am SO TIRED. I feel delusional getting up and doing my morning routine.</p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I realize what time it is and start quickly getting ready. I eat some chia seed pudding, drink a coffee, get dressed, and pack my bag. I head to the bus stop around 9:15. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Time for concrete beach mat pilates! I signed up for the class and paid the $5 ticket fee a few weeks ago. It’s a fun class and it’s hotter outside than I was expecting. The instructor partnered with a chiropractic place that was giving complimentary massages after the workout. I get a quick five-minute massage and a voucher to come in for a free session, so I schedule that for Tuesday. I make a mental note to move the one I booked yesterday to a later date. </p>



<p>11:00 a.m. — I get off my bus stop and walk to the farmers’ market. I grab a breakfast sandwich because I am craving one so bad… I can’t help it. <strong>$18.54</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready for my afternoon plans. Before we leave, I lounge around, reading (<em>Ducks, Newburyport</em> by Lucy Ellmann is my current at-home read), scrolling on my phone, drinking another latte, moving my massage appointment, and facetiming A. I also buy some new sheets for the fall/winter. I decide on a red and cream striped duvet cover, brown sheets, and brown pillow cases. I hope they’re comfy — I rarely ever treat myself to a purchase like this. <strong>$127.37</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — N. and I head out for the afternoon. Our friend P. is having her birthday party, frat boy themed. I am wearing N.’s Dolphins jersey for the occasion. We uber there because we are already running late. <strong>$5.00</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I spend the afternoon hanging out with my friends, laughing, and having a good time. We don’t leave P.’s house.</p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — At around this time, everyone starts to leave the party. N. and I head home on the bus. Once we get home, he makes me ravioli and I fall asleep around 11:30. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $150.91</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Four: Sunday</h3>



<p>10:00 a.m. — I wake up to my alarm going off. I knew I was going to sleep in because I’ve been so tired recently, but I still wanted to wake up relatively early because I don’t like to waste my weekends sleeping. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I pretty much throw myself up out of bed, get dressed in sweats, and start cleaning the house. I clean the kitchen, floors, and even get out my window squeegee to clean the windows from the outside. It feels great to have a clean house. I eat breakfast at some point in this time frame (egg whites, spinach, toast, and chicken sausage). </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — Once I finish cleaning, N. and I head out for a lunch date. We take the train to a pizza spot where we get the monthly special pizza (ricotta, pickled red onions, chorizo verde, jalapeno, and potatoes). It was so good! <strong>$23.35</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — When we get home, we lounge around, half-napping with R. on the bed. I watch a little bit of YouTube vlogs. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get up, put on shoes, and head out on a walk. I walk to a nearby park and spend about an hour reading and finishing <em>Normal People</em>. I listen to music while I read, and it’s a wonderful time. The weather is absolutely perfect today. I stop at Target on the way home and get some kombucha and an Olipop. <strong>$14.37</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — Once I get home, I set up the house for the evening. I light a candle, do some dishes, and pack my bag for work tomorrow. N. went out to get us groceries for Sunday night dinner. <strong>$30.66</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After I take a shower, I sit on the couch and watch <em>The White Lotus</em> while N. makes us dinner. We’ve been watching it for a few weeks and want to finish it tonight. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Late dinner because N. had to keep taking breaks to do his Fantasy Football draft (lol). We eat and then finish the show. Both of our reactions were “… that’s it?” I brush my teeth and fall asleep around 11:30. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $68.38</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Five: Monday</h3>



<p>6:15 a.m. — I wake up and let myself scroll for a few minutes. I do my morning routine, and I’m out the door at 7:40 this morning. I take the bus to work.</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — Once at work, I take a few minutes to settle in and then immediately start helping a colleague set up for a session that is going on today in her Center. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — I spend my morning doing admin work, planning for the week, scheduling posts on socials, and attending a meeting. I eat a donut that someone brought in for our office intern’s first day of classes (jelly-filled, of course). </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Lunch time! Today is the first day of classes at our university and, to celebrate, we are having a faculty and staff lunch. Today’s menu is Greek food: chicken gyros, potatoes, salad, and baklava. </p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — I’ve been trying to import data into a new software we are using and the system is giving me SUCH a hard time. I get myself Dunkin’ as a treat. They have a new cereal milk latte that I try despite knowing it’s going to give me a stomachache. It tastes like dessert. I save the other half for tomorrow morning (this might be gross, but I’m not known for listening to food/drink rules). <strong>$6.68</strong></p>



<p>4:15 p.m. — Home from work. I have a 4:45 pm biweekly Monday meeting that I just like to be home for. </p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — My meeting ends and I heat up leftovers to eat for dinner (meatloaf and potatoes). N. has a virtual appointment so I leave to give him some privacy. I facetime A. while sitting in the park. Her first day of classes is tomorrow so we just chat about how she’s feeling. I love my sisters!</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — I read my book for a little bit while N. finishes building the dining room chairs, but then he asks for my help. We try to build this one chair for two HOURS and we can’t get it! We give up and vow to work on it later. </p>



<p>11:30 p.m. — I’m in bed after my shower and skincare. I fall asleep watching YouTube. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $6.68</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Six: Tuesday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I am UP!!! I am still so tired… I can’t seem to wake up on time (I try to wake up at 5:45). Morning routine, breakfast, feed R., out the door. I walk to work this morning because I feel like I need some time to myself. </p>



<p>8:15 a.m. — I arrive at work. This morning, I do admin work, edit some email copy, and work on the data import I was working on yesterday. I also take a minute to pay my student loans (included in monthly expenses). </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — I take my lunch break. I eat leftover pizza from Sunday and go to my favorite spot outside to read my book for a bit. It’s right by a fountain and lots of older people are always here as well — reading, meeting up with their friends, or just enjoying their time. They make me happy to be around.</p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — This afternoon, I process an invoice and spend the rest of my time working on more projects related to the new software implementation. By new, I mean it’s a few months old and this transition is taking much longer than anticipated. That’s okay, though — I sometimes enjoy tedious work. I leave work and take the bus to the place I’m getting my massage today.</p>



<p>5:45 p.m. — After a long bus ride and a FAKE massage appointment, I wait for the bus home. I’m mad they told me I get a free massage today — they just took X-rays of me. I should’ve known it was too good to be true… I reschedule my original massage AGAIN while waiting for the bus home.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I spend alllll night doing freelance work while lying in bed with R. For dinner, I eat leftover meatloaf with some rice and sweet potatoes. I also drink the Olipop I bought on Sunday. </p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — After I shower and get ready for bed, I watch <em>Boogie Nights</em> on my laptop. It’s such a fun movie and VERY entertaining. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $0.00</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3>Day Seven: Wednesday</h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — I wake up later without stressing because Wednesday is my WFH day. I get up, do my morning routine, read in bed, make coffee, and journal. </p>



<p>7:30 a.m. — When N. leaves for work, I walk outside with him and head to the farmers’ market in my neighborhood. There, I buy apricots (I like to get fruit at the farmers’ market to snack on), tomatoes (because they are so perfect right now), a raspberry rose croissant (looked too good to pass up), and a loaf of sourdough. I eat half of my croissant on a park bench, letting the sun shine in my face, and then head back home. <strong>$26.75</strong></p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — After a few hours of work, I take a break to order two books I want to read soon. I’m really good about not buying new books until I read all of my current ones. I am trying to start a personal library, which is basically just a fun way to say I collect books. I do read all of them, though! <strong>$24.89</strong></p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — I take another little break to make lunch. I eat slices of the loaf I bought this morning with cottage cheese and sliced tomatoes on top. Sooooo good! I eat while I work. Today I’m working on planning a social media promotional campaign for an event, doing grant research, and problem-solving with a vendor. </p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — Now I take my “lunch break.” When I WFH, I like my lunch break to be some sort of movement. Today, I follow a pilates video on YouTube. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — Once I finish my work for the day, I head out for a walk and to read in the park (my favorite activity, if you can’t tell). I stay for about an hour.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After eating dinner (ravioli and chicken sausage), I take a quick nap with R. curled up next to me. I wake up abruptly 20 minutes later and quickly get ready to go to a nearby bar for a <em>The Summer I Turned Pretty</em> watch party with my friends. I stop at Walgreens on the way to buy a bag of chips (for me) and peach rings (for my friend). <strong>$6.95</strong></p>



<p>7:15 p.m. — I grab a table at the bar and wait for my friends to arrive. The episode starts at 7:30 and we have a blast. Normally, this is not the type of media I enjoy consuming, but I’m addicted to this show. We snack on the free popcorn the bar has and eat snacks we brought (the bar doesn’t serve food). I don’t get anything because I don’t really drink, and I do feel bad about it. I like to give my money to local places if I’m going to them.</p>



<p>8:45 p.m. — I bus back home with my friend. Once I get home, I take a quick shower and pretty much go right to bed. I want to be well-rested for the rest of my week.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $58.59</strong></p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>



<p>This week was pretty normal for me to be honest. I spend most of my money on food and drink — both groceries and going out to eat. I already track my spending and I’m very aware of it, but it’s always fun to do it journal-entry style! I COULD spend less money going out to eat… but will I? Maybe in the winter when it’s too cold in Chicago to leave my house…</p>

<p>Mere minutes into <em><a href=""https://www.theringer.com/2026/01/26/marvel/what-you-need-to-know-before-watching-wonder-man-mcu"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a>,</em> I had to take a break from the series. Not because it wasn’t good — it’s <em>great</em> — but because I saw so much of myself in <a href=""https://www.disneyplus.com/explore/articles/marvels-wonder-man"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Simon Williams</a> and his relentless anxiety, it was, well, making me anxious. Lately, it feels like conversations surrounding representation and have been flattened, and we decide if a piece of art is good only if we can see ourselves in it. I don’t think that’s true. And I think <em><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/arts/television/wonder-man.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a> </em>is a brilliant show, whether you’re a self-flagulating overthinker like Simon and me or not, but when I was watching it, I was struck by how real he felt, and how rarely we get to see anxious Black characters, especially Black men, onscreen. </p>



<p>All eight episodes of <em><a href=""https://decider.com/2026/01/27/what-time-does-wonder-man-premiere-on-disney/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Man</a></em><a href=""https://decider.com/2026/01/27/what-time-does-wonder-man-premiere-on-disney/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> drop on Disney+ today</a> and in the Marvel series, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/06/10541868/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-rom-com-movies"">Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</a> stars as Simon, a struggling actor who just wants to be seen for his craft, not the anger-induced superpowers he’s desperately trying to hide and has no idea what to do with. You may think you’re getting an origin story for one of Marvel’s most underrated superheroes, but as its eight episodes unfold, <em>Wonder Man</em> quietly transforms into one of the most honest portrayals of anxiety I’ve seen in a superhero show, maybe in <em>any</em> show. Simon’s overthinking, his paralysis in the face of opportunity, his fear that one misstep will cost him everything hit so close to home. Created by Destin Daniel Cretton (<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-09-02/shang-chi-simu-liu-marvel-asian-hero"">“Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”</a>) and Andrew Guest (who has written for “Community” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), <em>Wonder Man</em> is a slow burn meditation on Hollywood, ambition, and who gets to be a hero. And after all these years of oversaturation accusations and critiques that superhero projects have nothing more to offer, this is the MCU at its best and most original.  </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11956454.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=429&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A429"" /><figcaption>Simon Williams/Wonder Man (Yahya Adbul-Mateen II) in Marvel Television’s WONDER MAN, exclusively on Disney+.

<p>There’s this scene early in the series where Simon shows up to set for a small role on <em>American Horror Story</em>. He’s done his research, prepared a whole backstory, and workshopped different line deliveries. He’s in his head. When he starts suggesting tweaks to the scene, the director humors him at first, then grows frustrated, and finally, he gets fired on the spot. Watching Simon’s face collapse as he realizes he’s sabotaged himself yet again — that he tried so hard to be excellent that he forgot to just <em>be</em> — is what made me pause the episode. I had to sit with it for a minute because I’ve been that person, the one so terrified of mediocrity that I self sabotage, the one who shows up with five times the preparation and still feels like an imposter. But Simon isn’t shy or lacking confidence necessarily, he’s anxious because he wants to be the best. He’s anxious because he feels like he knows the character better than anyone, even the director. It’s bravado and fear warring with and wrapped up in each other, and it’s a dangerous combination. </p>



<p>“Anxiety is kind of new to me too. I understand what it’s like,” Abdul Mateen II says, sitting across from me during the film’s junket in Los Angeles. “As an actor, a part of our job is to be able to identify the anxieties and to be able to use our tools to decrease it and then to work through it, to ‘tolerate our discomfort.’” </p>



<p>And it is uncomfortable at times to watch Simon war with his own mind, struggling through who he knows he can be and who he is. Abdul-Mateen II brings so much depth and sensitivity to Simon’s anxiety. This isn’t the one-note brooding, mysterious kind of troubled hero we’re used to seeing. Simon’s anxiety is mundane, messy, and for Abdul-Mateen II, it was personal. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It was really gratifying, and sometimes scary at the same time, to show that vulnerability, to show that anxiety, to show what it looks like to just not be sure of myself at all but still have to proceed.</p><cite>Yahya Abdul-Mateen II </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“It was really gratifying, and sometimes scary at the same time, to show that vulnerability, to show that anxiety, to show what it looks like to just not be sure of myself at all but still have to proceed, and to have the camera be <em>right here</em> while I’m doing that,” He says, gesturing with his hand close to his face. “To be feeling something before a scene and to realize,<em> ‘Oh, yeah that’s right, this is what Simon is feeling’.</em> Oh, OK so I’m right at home so just share it. I’m just there to share it.”</p>



<p>What Abdul-Mateen II shares is revelatory. It’s one of the strongest performances the MCU has ever seen. And at times when the script doesn’t give us much about Simon’s interior, Abdul-Mateen II fills in the rest of the story with his face. Simon’s anxiety shows up in him standing outside an audition rehearsing the same line forty-seven different ways, or calling his ex-girlfriend to apologize for apologizing too much, or him lying awake at 3 a.m. mentally cataloging every interaction he had that day, searching for where he went wrong. There’s a scene where Simon practices his audition in front of a bathroom mirror, and you can see him cycling through emotions — confidence, doubt, overcompensation, resignation — in the span of thirty seconds. It’s exhausting and exhilarating to watch Abdul-Mateen II work. It’s also deeply, painfully relatable. </p>



<p><em>Wonder Man</em> connects Simon’s anxiety to his Blackness without making it the sole defining factor. Simon doesn’t just want to be a good actor; he wants to prove he belongs in spaces that weren’t built for him. There’s this unspoken weight he carries, this understanding that his margin for error is razor-thin. One mistake and he’s not just Simon Williams who messed up; he’s a confirmation of every stereotype and every lowered expectation. It’s the burden of representation that so many Black creatives carry, the exhausting math of needing to be twice as excellent to be considered half as good. It’s such a prevailing understanding, it’s become a cliché. And so the show doesn’t need to spell this out in obvious dialogue, which I appreciate. Instead, it lives in Abdul-Mateen’s performance, the way Simon’s shoulders tense when he walks into a dinner full of white executives (save for his agent Janelle, played pitch perfectly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkum08eYhC8"">by X Mayo</a>) trying to push him to capitalize on his <em>Wonder Man</em> casting, the way he code-switches without even realizing he’s doing it, the way he shrinks around his overachieving brother and how the legacy of his late father is simmering beneath every decision Simon makes. </p>

<p>The genius of the series is pairing Simon with Sir Ben Kingsley’s Trevor Slattery, a washed-up actor (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxl6UhHaYic"">also known as The Mandarin,</a> making his fourth MCU appearance) who’s decided that “good enough” is, in fact, good enough. Trevor is delightfully shameless in his mediocrity. He shows up to auditions unprepared and somehow charms his way through. He forgets his lines and improvises. He lives in the moment because he’s already survived the worst his career can throw at him. He’s also acting as a double agent, spying on Simon for the government’s Department of Damage Control. Agent Cleary (<em>Succession’s </em>Arian Moayed) is his point person at the bureau tasked with bringing in “enhanced” individuals. This part of the script is its weakest, because it’s never really clear why Simon is a target when he’s hiding his powers and can barely control them, but the beauty of <em>Wonder Man</em> is that it doesn’t care much about the MCU politics of it all. This is a small story an unlikely friendship forged between two actors who approach life differently – one living like he’s got nothing to lose (Trevor) and the other carefully clinging to things he doesn’t have yet. </p>



<p>Their dynamic is hilarious. Simon’s anxious perfectionism is constantly butting up against Trevor’s chaotic “we’ll figure it out” energy and it’s also the emotional heart of the show. Trevor becomes the person who gives Simon permission to be imperfect, to make mistakes, to take up space without apology. Their friendship is a quiet rebellion. And when you juxtapose the purity of Simon and Trevor’s bond with what goes on between Byron Bowers’ DeMarr “Doorman” Davis and Josh Gad (playing the asshole version of himself) in Episode 4 (a truly revolutionary, gorgeous, gutting episode), it’s even more evident how special their friendship is. </p>



<p>My favorite scene of the series comes when Simon and Trevor are at the house of the famed eccentric director or <em>Wonder Man </em>(the movie within the show) participating in a day-long audition. When put on the spot to improvise a monologue, Simon cracks and resorts to reciting a scene from <em>Pretty Woman</em>. Yes, that <em>Pretty Woman</em>. Abdul Mateen II says he had fun channeling his inner Julia Roberts, but aside from the comedy of that scene, it’s more proof of Simon’s debilitating anxiety. </p>



<p>“That just shows how much of a wreck Simon is. Simon is a control freak. He has a photographic memory so he remembers every line from every movie he’s ever seen. He has it in his head. That was a lot of fun. He’s trying his best,” Abdul Mateen II says with a laugh. </p>



<p>I keep thinking about what Abdul-Mateen said in a <a href=""https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a70063756/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-man-on-fire-wonder-man-interview/"">recent interview with Esquire</a>, how Simon “lives his life always trying to avoid the next worst thing” and that “it’s paralyzing.” That line stayed with me because it perfectly describes what so many of us are navigating, this constant vigilance, this bracing for impact, this belief that if we just work hard enough, prepare thoroughly enough, excel sufficiently enough, we can somehow protect ourselves from the unfairness we know is coming. But Simon’s journey in <em>Wonder Man </em>is learning that excellence isn’t armor. Sometimes it’s the opposite. Sometimes our desperate need to be exceptional keeps us from actually living, from taking risks, from being human. The show doesn’t offer easy answers (spoiler: Simon doesn’t suddenly stop being anxious by the finale) but it does give him permission to be a work in progress. To be, dare I say it, mediocre sometimes. And that feels radical.</p>

<p><em>Wonder Man </em>is technically a superhero show, but it’s really about what happens when you realize that the superpowers you’ve been hiding might be less scary than the ordinary vulnerabilities you refuse to show. The Marvel series is a surprisingly tender meditation on perfectionism, performance, and the paralyzing fear of not being enough. It’s about the courage it takes to just show up as yourself — flawed, uncertain, still figuring it out — in a world that demands perfection from people who look like you. Abdul-Mateen’s performance is quietly devastating in its specificity, and the series as a whole is a love letter to everyone who’s ever felt like they’re one mistake away from losing everything. It’s a reminder that sometimes the most revolutionary thing we can do is give ourselves permission to just be fine, not exceptional, not extraordinary, just <em>fine</em>. And, honestly, that might be the superpower we need most.</p>
