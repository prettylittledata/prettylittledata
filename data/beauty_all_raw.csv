<p><em>This week: a marketing manager on $167,000 and who spends some of her money on some knitting yarn.</em></p>



<p><em>This Money Diary was written in the summer of 2025.</em> <em>This is a follow-up diary. You can read the original diary </em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary""><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>



<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Marketing manager<br /><strong>Industry:</strong> Life sciences<br /><strong>Age:</strong> 31<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Chicago, IL<br /><strong>Salary:</strong> $167,295 ($143,295 base + $24,000 bonus)<br /><strong>Joint Income/Financial Setup:</strong> Our joint income is around ~$240,000 (+/- $10k). My husband, F., is a freelance director of photography and has recently gone back to school to facilitate a career change to healthcare.  Shortly after my first <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/marketing-manager-chicago-salary-money-diary"">Money Diary</a> we made the decision to combine our finances. It was a little challenging at first, but at the end of the day, we are a team, and we make financial decisions together. Combining finances has given us a clear picture of where we stand as a family and has allowed us to meet big financial goals like completely paying off our student loans last year. The way we manage our finances is that we plan our monthly budget off of my net income, and all money F. brings in goes into our liquid savings account. At the end of every month, we review our spending and sort everything into a spreadsheet with categories to track our spending habits and make sure we’re staying on top of our financial goals.<br /><strong>Assets</strong> <br /><strong>Home value:</strong> $275,000 <br /><strong>Car value:</strong> $20,000<br /><strong>Combined retirement accounts &amp; investments:</strong> $250,848.52<br /><strong>Checking account:</strong> $1,785<br /><strong>Savings account:</strong> $66,612.60<br /><strong>Debt:</strong> $172,600 (home loan)<br /><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x/month):</strong> $3,252 (my husband’s varies)<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong> She/her<br /><br /><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong><br /><strong>Housing Costs:</strong> $1,742.64 ($1,368 mortgage + $374 HOA). <br /><strong>Loan Payments:</strong> $0 (we paid off student loans last year)</p>



<p><strong>All Other Monthly Expenses</strong><br />Paycheck deductions (per paycheck):<br /><strong>Health/Life Insurance:</strong> $273<br /><strong>Investments:</strong> $1460<br /><br /><strong>Recurring expenses</strong> <br /><strong>Utilities:</strong> $100<br /><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> $70<br /><strong>Gym membership for two:</strong> $154<br /><strong>Car insurance:</strong> $111<br /><strong>Mint mobile (2x lines):</strong> $53<br /><strong>Dog medication:</strong> $55<br /><br /><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />There was an expectation to attend college and get my bachelor’s degree. However, I strayed away from getting a degree in anything that would require higher education because I was afraid of having to take on additional debt. I paid for undergrad with a combination of student loans, settlement money from a childhood injury, and some support from my parents. My husband F. is currently pursuing a career change with plans to go to med school. Seeing him in school definitely has me toying with going back and getting an MBA. My company has tuition reimbursement programs I’m looking into.<br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />I did not receive a lot of education around money growing up. My parents made a handful of bad financial decisions and got into a lot of business debt owning their own small business. Tax-advantage accounts and employer 401(k)s were totally foreign to me when I first started working, but I think we’ve done a good job building an investment portfolio given our financial backgrounds. My husband and I have done a lot to improve our financial literacy as adults and discuss our finances often.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />My first job out of college was working as a marketing coordinator at a PR agency. I got the job because I studied communications during college and snagged a paid internship between my junior and senior years. I worked as an intern until I graduated and was offered a full-time position. I was incredibly grateful to have a job lined up on day one of post-grad. My starting salary was $38k, which is wild to think about now! At the time, I was extremely careful with how I spent my money and even managed to save some on this salary.<br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />Yes — looking back it is very clear to me that my parents were striving for a life that their careers could not afford. I grew up with a lot of insecurity around money, and feared that my peers would find out about my parents’ financial struggles and think less of me. Growing up this way definitely pushed me to strive for financial security and success as an adult.<br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />No — I am very aware that we live a life that exceeded either of our expectations and feel confident in our current financial position and trajectory. Additionally, combining our accounts pushed me to take my emotions out of finances. I also know that I’m incredibly privileged to be able to think of money as a tool that allows us to live a comfortable life.<br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />I became financially responsible for myself the day I graduated college. My husband and I have built a financial safety net for ourselves through paying off loans, liquid savings, purchasing property, and investing in retirement accounts. We’ve been able to do all of this by living within our means through our 20s, and by prioritizing spending on long-term investments. <br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />Yes. This past year we received a $10k gift from my grandfather. His health has declined and he is living with my parents, and sold all of his properties. The grandchildren all received a financial gift from the property sales. </p>



<h3>Day One: Monday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — The temps have dropped so we are finally sleeping with the windows open but it means we had a noisier-than-usual night and didn’t get great sleep. My husband, F., makes coffee while I browse white-noise machines. I notice that they are HSA/FSA eligible so make a note to come back for my purchase. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I boot up my computer for the week and check in with co-workers before I get ready to take the dog, P., around the block. I listen to my audiobook, <em>Darling Girls</em>, while I walk P. around the block. I love listening to audiobooks and love that you get 10 hours of listening included in your monthly Spotify Premium subscription! </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I join my weekly round robin all-hands call as F. heads out for a job. My co-worker has the updates for my team this week so I just listen in while all teams give their updates and priorities for the week. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Next meeting of the morning! I hop on a call with all the product marketers on my team and we discuss what we’re working on this week. For me, it’s a few housekeeping tasks and a little bit of planning for future projects. I just wrapped up managing a big project and my manager is on paternity leave for the next two weeks, so it’ll probably be a pretty slow week for me work-wise. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — It’s time for breakfast! I take a break and listen to my audio book while I make myself eggs, toast, and a fruit bowl.</p>



<p>10:15 a.m. — My co-worker calls me asking for help with something. We also catch up and chat about what’s been going on in our lives since we last connected, and I eat my breakfast. </p>



<p>10:30 a.m. — I spend the rest of the morning working on the task my co-worker and I chatted about. </p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I break for lunch and whip up a quick bowl of tuna salad. While I’m on my lunch break I scroll through Ravelry looking for a pattern to use up some extra yarn I have from a baby sweater project. A year ago, I really got into knitting and haven’t stopped since I picked up knitting needles for the first time. I purchase a small neck scarf pattern called the <a href=""https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-jose-scarf"">My Jose Scarf</a>. I cast on the project and knit a few stitches before logging back in for work. <strong>$8.20</strong></p>



<p>3:00 p.m — Work is slowing down for the day so I decide to get a head start on dinner. F. and I have evening commitments so I’m hoping this will get dinner on the table faster. Dinner tonight is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020419-pasta-alla-norma-sorta"">Pasta Alla Norma Sorta</a> from NYT Cooking. F. comes home from his job and we catch up for a few minutes in the kitchen.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — I check my emails and Teams messages before riding my bike to group tennis lessons from 5-6 (I prepaid for the session a few weeks ago but it’s typically $259 for 8x 60-minute lessons). I started taking tennis lessons last March and have fallen completely in love with the sport! I’m still very much a beginner tennis player, but I’ve signed up for my first ladies’ tennis league this fall. Expectations of winning are low, but I’m still planning on having fun!</p>



<p>6:15 p.m. — Back from tennis and F. is already settled into his online chemistry class. I check emails and Teams once more before logging off for the day and taking a shower. I’m grateful my past self did all the dinner prep. All that’s left to do is heat and assemble. I finish listening to my audiobook while I get dinner together. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — F. has a break from his online class so we eat dinner together for a few minutes. F. recently decided on a career change and is finishing up some pre-reqs on online community college. The plan is to take the MCAT after this and then apply for med school (big life change)! After dinner, I clean up the kitchen, and walk P. once more before relaxing with my knitting project and watching reality TV for the rest of the evening. </p>



<p>10:00 p.m. — We get ready for bed and read for a little while before falling asleep. F. is reading his chemistry textbook and I’m reading<em> Fates and Furies</em> by Lauren Groff.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $8.20</strong></p>



<h3>Day Two: Tuesday </h3>



<p>6:30 a.m. — We wake up early today since F. has a job, so he needs to head out the door early this morning. F. makes coffee as I work through the NYT Games for the day. The Wordle really stumps me!</p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I check in on my emails and check off a task for the day. F. heads out the door and I follow behind with P. I call my mom and catch up while I walk the dog. My mom lets me know that they are coming up to Chicago for Thanksgiving and this puts me in a good mood. Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love to host!</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I’m back online for work for the rest of the morning. I get a CC alert that $20 has been reloaded on the city street parking account. F. must have arrived at his job (this is a work expense and we will get reimbursed from the client). I take a quick break to make breakfast and eat in front of my computer while responding to emails.</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — During my lunch break I go to the public tennis courts near our condo and practice my serve for a while. As a beginner tennis player, serves are 100% the hardest skill to learn!</p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — On the way home from the courts I stop at my neighborhood market and grab a bell pepper, turkey, iceberg lettuce, olives, mozzarella, and black olives to make a chopped salad for lunch. <strong>$22.05</strong></p>



<p>1:15 p.m. — When I get home I throw together my lunch salad and settle in for work for the rest of the afternoon. F. gets home from his job around 3 p.m. and makes salad with the ingredients I bought. </p>



<p>4:00 p.m. — I get an email that my tennis league didn’t have enough people sign up for the bracket and is being cancelled and refunded. I end up signing up for Gladiator Tennis, which I’ve heard of players using for league play. After my serve practice, I’m feeling hopeful I won’t totally embarrass myself and sign up for the beginner/intermediate league. <strong>$35</strong></p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — The rest of the afternoon was spent working from the couch. I got my period and was majorly knocked down by cramps and PMS. F is already in class so I peel myself off the couch to walk P. around the block. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Dinner is leftovers from yesterday. F. eats while he’s in online class and I eat while watching TV. I feel a little guilty about being so lazy this evening while F. is being productive in school. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — F. wraps up class early so we walk P. around the neighborhood one more time, and then come home and wind down watching PBS before getting ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $57.05</strong></p>



<h3>Day Three: Wednesday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — We wake up and F. makes coffee while I play the NYT Games for the day and work on a few rows of knitting. F. talks about going to the gym this morning and I tell him I might come, too.</p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I log onto my computer to get started on work for the day. The last week of August is usually my slowest week of the year, so there isn’t a whole lot I need to be doing for the rest of the week. As a “high earner” with a WFH job, I feel a lot of guilt/shame around slow periods. November through July is generally very busy and then it slows down for a few months. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We take P. around the block and then head to the gym. I put on a spooky podcast when I get to the gym and do a leg workout. </p>



<p>11:15 a.m. — F. makes eggs, toast, and fruit for us for breakfast when we get home and I do a little bit of work on my laptop. </p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — I hop on a call to discuss landing pages that are being built for an upcoming campaign I’m managing. I often work with and project manage the digital and content teams and feel grateful that they’re a nice bunch of people to work with. We all give feedback and talk through some options for the Q4 campaign I’m leading.</p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — After my meeting, I take a quick little snack break and have some honey roasted almonds and remind myself to drink a glass of water. F. sees I’m up from my desk and also takes a study/snack break. We talk about going to Key West for his spring break in March. We’ve never been to Key West and we’ve never taken a spring break before. I send F. a few links to the Key West Historic Inns once I’m back at my desk.</p>



<p>3:15 p.m. — Work is wrapping for the day and I get a jump start on dinner since F. and I will be out for the evening. Tonight’s dinner is <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025436-one-pot-chicken-and-rice-with-caramelized-lemon"">chicken and rice from NYTimes Cooking</a>. </p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — While the chicken and rice is in the oven, I take P. out for a walk and clean up the kitchen a bit. F. and I sit down for an early dinner before getting ready to head out. After dinner, F. drops me off at tennis on his way to night class. One night a week he’s in person for a lab.</p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — After tennis, my friend and I grab a drink at a wine bar in our neighborhood and cheers to playing well during class! <strong>$28.25</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I enjoy a nice late summer walk home through the neighborhood. August is the sweetest month of all and I always feel such a warm, fuzzy feeling walking around this time of year. I’m sure the wine was helping perpetuate this feeling!</p>



<p>8:15 p.m. — Home from tennis and I take an ‘everything shower’ before making a yogurt bowl and chilling with my knitting project while watching <em>Southern Charm</em>. I was turned on to <em>Southern Charm</em> after watching the latest season of <em>The White Lotus</em>. F. gets home around 9:30 p.m. and he fills me in on his first day of in-person class, and we hang out for a bit before getting ready for bed.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $28.25</strong></p>



<h3>Day Four: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:30 a.m. — I wake up and get ready quickly for my first meeting of the day. </p>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I meet with a colleague in Europe and we discuss projects we’re collaborating on. F. makes coffee in the kitchen and we drink our coffee together after I wrap up my meeting. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — F. asks if I ordered the sound machine yet (I haven’t). We decide on an old school fan-based sound machine. I get started on a little bit of work and message with one of my coworkers about a final report for a project we’re wrapping up. <strong>$60.63</strong></p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. gets ready for the gym and I get ready to take the dog on a walk. I walk F. to the gym and then stop at a local cafe for a breakfast sandwich before heading home and getting back to work. <strong>$14.79</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — F. has been working on his chemistry homework all morning. Weirdly, the chem textbook does not come with an answer guide to check your work, so he purchases a used solutions manual to help him with studying. <strong>$27.44</strong></p>



<p>1:00 p.m. — I have my weekly check-ins with two of my co-workers. We all agree it’s been such a slow week but also nice to come up for air after our busy season this summer. </p>



<p>3:00 p.m. — I have a psychiatrist appointment to check in on the anxiety medication I’m taking. I had a really scary panic attack where I ended up in the emergency room earlier this year so I have 100% been prioritizing my mental health. Anxiety is something I’ve struggled with since I was a kid and this year I feel like I’m finally taking the steps for treatment. Because I’ve hit my out of pocket max for the year, my co-pay is $0. </p>



<p>3:45 p.m. — I stop for gas and at Whole Foods on my way home to pick up magnesium glycate (recommended by my psych for sleep) and a very balanced snack of cheese balls and a protein drink. I also grab some sugar that’ll I need for the baking project I’m working on this weekend. <strong>$73.25</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I wrap up work for the week and throw together a quick dinner of rice leftovers, broccoli, and shrimp from the freezer for F. and I to have before he has class, and I head out for my evening activity. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — Every Thursday, my local knitting shop has a ‘knit circle’. This is the shop where I learned to knit a year ago and I really enjoy the community space they’ve built. I haven’t been to knit night all summer so I make sure to bring a few of my finished objects to share. Vibes are great and I promise to myself I’ll be back again next week. </p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Home and snacking on the rest of the cheese balls while I watch TV and knit and F. finishes with his online class. Once he’s done, we catch up and get ready for bed. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $176.11</strong></p>



<h3>Day Five: Friday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — I have the day off so F. and I wake up a little later. I don’t know if it’s a placebo, but I did sleep a lot better last night after taking the magnesium! F. and I have sex before getting out of bed and making coffee. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — F. and I meet up with one of my friends to play some two-on-one. We play for about an hour and a half and it’s so much fun. I love the endorphins I get from playing tennis. </p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — Home from tennis and we have some breakfast. After knit night, I’m feeling inspired to order the boucle yarn I need to start a pattern I bought months ago. I also buy an extra skein of yarn for the scarf project I’m working on since it looks like I’m going to lose a game of yarn chicken. <strong>$165.15</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — I shower and get ready to go to therapy. I go every other week, and to be honest, I find talk therapy a little bit tedious and exhausting but I go on the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have to take the train because F. is about to head out of town for the weekend for a film festival. F. will be staying at his parents’ place and any expenses incurred, i.e. meals, etc., this weekend are business write-offs. </p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — Once I get to the office I realize I messed up the dates and I actually don’t have therapy until next week — whoops! Instead of therapy, I take a long walk through the neighborhood and stop at a few shops. I pick up three birthday cards and a baby card at Hazel — they have the best selection of cards. <strong>$25.91</strong></p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — I make a few more shopping stops on my way home. Next stop is a local apothecary to pick up Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara. I also stop at the running store to pick up energy snacks for some of the tennis meetups and matches I have. Last stop is the grocery store to pick up a few ingredients for lunch, and baking ingredients to do a practice run of my friend’s wedding cake I’m making in September. <strong>$77.62</strong></p>



<p>5:00 p.m. — After the impromptu shopping afternoon, I come home and made a Costco frozen pizza. While the oven pre-heats and the pizza cooks I eat the broccoli leftovers from last night. I relax on the couch for a while before taking P. on a long walk. F. ended up taking the toll roads to Michigan since the holiday weekend traffic was looking bad. <strong>$17.10</strong> <strong>(tolls). </strong></p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I spend a majority of the evening working on a practice cake for my friend’s wedding next month. The recipe I’m using is Claire Saffitz’s confetti cake — it’s such a good recipe and is my go-to for the foster care birthday cakes I make volunteering. </p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Cake baking goes well but at this point I’ve made two failed attempts at marshmallow buttercream. I clean up the kitchen and decide that frosting the cake is a tomorrow task. I relax and watch TV while knitting the rest of the evening. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $285.78</strong></p>



<h3>Day Six: Saturday </h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up with a wet nose in the face and we snuggle in bed while I do the NYTimes Games. After this I get up and make a latte —still using the Breville Espresso Maker! While I drink my coffee, I crack open the holy grail cake cookbook, <em>The Cake Bible</em> by Rose Levy Beranbaum and scour the buttercream recipes until I find one that sounds like it will go well with the confetti cake. </p>



<p>9:00 a.m. — I have a 10 a.m. tennis meet-up so I take P. around the block and make a quick breaky of scrambled eggs and fruit. Then I get ready and put a backpack together with my racket, waterbottle, knitting, and a book. I’m not going to go home right away after tennis. </p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — I hop on my bike and arrive a few minutes early, hoping to snag a court, which I do! My tennis partner and I warm up and play a set. I lose 2-6, but still have fun and felt good about my serves. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — First stop of the day after tennis is Loba. I get a housemade melon soda and a strawberry sourdough muffin. I settle in at a table to work on my knitting and start listening to a new audiobook, <em>Don’t Let Him In</em>. Coincidentally, the two gals next to me were also knitting and we share a moment talking about what we’re working on. The knitting community is alive and well in Chicago! <strong>$14.15</strong></p>



<p>12:30 p.m. — Next stop is Paulina Meat Market to grab an Italian sub. I’m back on my bike headed towards the lake to enjoy my sandwich, and a little more knitting while I listen to the audiobook. <strong>$13.78</strong></p>



<p>2:00 p.m. — I don’t have enough butter in the fridge to do the meringue buttercream recipe so I stop at the local market on the way home and buy more butter. It kills me to buy butter at this price so I make a mental note to stock up at Costco next time. <strong>$6.64</strong></p>



<p>2:15 p.m. — P. greets me at the door and I get straight to work prepping all the ingredients for the butter cream. All goes well with the new buttercream recipe and I finish up with the cake project for the weekend. </p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I take P. for a long walk to the river before the sun goes down. When I get home, I take a shower, clean up the kitchen and make tacos for dinner. </p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — I try a slice of the cake I made and it’s heavenly — can’t wait to bring some to my friend tomorrow morning! The rest of the night is spent working on my knitting project and watching <em>Southern Charm</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $34.57</strong></p>



<h3>Day Seven: Sunday</h3>



<p>8:00 a.m. — P. wakes me up again and we snuggle in bed while I play the daily NYTimes Games. </p>



<p>8:30 a.m. — I make a latte and watch <em>Sunday Morning</em> while working on some knitting. After this, I walk P., have some breakfast, and get ready to meet up with a friend for tennis. </p>



<p>10:00 a.m. — We don’t have to wait long for an open court, thankfully! My friend and I have a nice long warm-up and then play a match. I get my a** handed to me and lose 6-0, 6-0. I still have fun and score a few points and remind myself the only way to get better is to keep playing!</p>



<p>12:00 p.m. — After tennis, I go home, take a shower, and get the laundry for the week started. Our condo building doesn’t have in-unit hook-ups, so we’re still using coin-operated in the basement. It’s not glamorous but it gets the job done. <strong>$4.50</strong></p>



<p>1:30 p.m. — F. is home from his weekend away and I’m starving for lunch! We go on a long walk through the neighborhood and get sandwiches and Diet Cokes at L&amp;M, which we eat in the park and catch each other up on our weekends. <strong>$37.42</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — When we get home from lunch we have some of the cake I made yesterday. F. gives his best Paul Hollywood critique. The rest of the afternoon is spent working on knitting projects and watching TV. I’m pretty tired from the two hours of tennis. F. takes a nap and works on his chemistry homework for a bit. </p>



<p>6:00 p.m. — F. and I walk P. around the block. When we get home we open a bottle of wine and have the tacos from yesterday for dinner. We chat for a bit before F. resumes his chem homework and I get back to knitting. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $41.92</strong></p>

For virtually all of my teen years, I blasted my face with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide — anything that claimed to target acne, I slathered with reckless abandon. It wasn't until my 20s that I finally put down the harsh products and picked up gentler ones that targeted breakouts without the slash-and-burn-farming approach — this is how I discovered <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/niacinamide-for-skin"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">niacinamide</a>. <br /> <br />If you ask me, niacinamide (a form of vitamin B3) is well-deserving of its hype, and it’s not unusual to see it laced into not only skincare products, by makeup primers, skin tints, and foundations nowadays. The ingredient is often name-checked by dermatologists for its multifaceted benefits: curbing excess oil, minimizing the appearance of large pores and fine lines, and soothing flare-ups due to inflammation or acne.  <br /> <br />“Niacinamide works by modulating inflammation and supporting the skin barrier, which is especially important for acne-prone and reactive skin,” explains dermatologist Jenna Queller, MD. She adds, “It also helps regulate sebum production [natural oils produced by the skin], reduce the transfer of pigment within the skin, and improve skin elasticity, contributing to brighter, more even-toned skin over time.” In other words, it's an all-in-one skincare ingredient with near-universal appeal. <br /> <br />Ahead, I've rounded up some of my favorite products that include the star ingredient — from niacinamide cleansers to serums to moisturizers. <br /> <br /><em>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.

/>I've been using this stuff on repeat for a few reasons. For starters, the price is right, and for an acne cleanser, it's not over-stripping, thanks to CeraVe’s signature ceramide complex and hyaluronic acid. Plus, it works wonders to ward off new breakouts, thanks to antibacterial salicylic acid, which also exfoliates deeply but gently, preventing clogged pores, not to mention niacinamide to mop up oil and boost the skin barrier.  <br /><br /><strong>CeraVe</strong> Renewing SA Cleanser, $, available at <a

Essence<br /></h2><br />Then I Met You (founded by Charlotte Cho, the brains behind K-beauty retailer Soko Glam) has been something of a best-kept secret — until now. This hydrating, brightening essence contains yeast-derived galactomyces ferment filtrate and saccharomyces ferment filtrate to reduce the appearance of large pores and curb sebum. (TL;DR fermented skin care ingredients tend to be more effective and are easily absorbed by the skin thanks to the molecules being much smaller.) Besides these smart ingredients, it contains a 5% concentration of niacinamide to brighten and soothe skin. <br /><br /><strong>Then I Met You</strong> The Giving Essence, $, available at <a

<p>I started <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/summer-fridays-flushed-lip-stain-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">wearing makeup</a> at 13, but I can count on one hand the lipsticks I’ve used all the way to the last swipe. Over the years, very few have ever given me exactly what I want — and I don’t think I’m asking for much. I want my lipstick to feel moisturizing on my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">chronically dry lips</a>, stay where I put it without ending up on my teeth, lend a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/blur-makeup-trend-products"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">soft, blurred, diffused effect</a>, and not break the bank entirely. That’s exactly why I’ve fallen head over heels for <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a>. </p>



<h2>What is Merit’s Signature Lip Blush and what are the benefits? </h2>



<p><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is the latest addition to Merit’s growing lip lineup. You might know — and love — its <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lipstick,</a> which occupies a cozy space between matte and glossy, giving lips a subtle satin-like glint. Or perhaps the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/merit-beauty-products-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Shade Slick lip oil</a> is a staple in your handbag. <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a>, however, dials the shine all the way back. </p>



<p>Merit describes <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> as a “sheer matte lightweight, buildable formula with a comfortable, balm-like feel”. To me, it’s a soft matte lipstick that’s not too dissimilar from a lip stain — packed with pigment — or a lip pencil, which you can diffuse with your fingers or a brush.  </p>



<p>If you’re just as obsessed as I am with celebrity makeup artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ninapark/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nina Park</a>, specifically the way she makes her clients’ lips appear contoured, plump, and diffused, then I have a feeling you’re going to love this lipstick. On application, it’s sheer and light enough to blend outward, but unlike others with a similar texture, once it dries down a little, it clings to lips for a good four hours without disappearing into nothingness. </p>



<p>That’s all down to what Merit calls gel-wrapped pigments — essentially molecules of color encapsulated in a gel-like texture that makes swiping and blending easy. Speaking of color, there are eight shades in total, spanning Andie (a delicate petal pink) to Gamay (a deep red wine). Here, I’m wearing September, a muted terracotta, paired with Merit’s <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-liner%3F_pos%3D1%26_psq%3DSignature%2BLip%2BLiner%26_ss%3De%26_v%3D1.0"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Liner in Mayfair,</a> a peachy mauve. I will say the lipstick bullet appears a little darker than it does on the lips.</p>

<h2>What makes Merit’s Signature Lip Blush Special? </h2>



<p>What sets <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Merit’s Signature Lip Blush</a> apart from other soft matte lipsticks is how it feels on. Most matte products dry out my parched lips even further, settling into — and accentuating — lines and creases. This one feels so comforting, it’s like wearing a lip balm — all without any stickiness. You can thank sesame seed extract, nourishing olive oil, and plant-based waxes for that. </p>



<p>I judge makeup first and foremost on how it makes me feel, but when others notice, it’s affirming. Since giving <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"">Signature Lip Blush</a> a trial run these past few weeks, I’ve had countless compliments on my lipstick, with beauty editor peers repeatedly asking what I’m wearing — we’re convinced it makes my lips appear bigger. </p>



<h2>What to know about Merit’s Signature Lip Blush:</h2>



<p>• Sheer, matte lipstick with a moisturizing balm-like feel. </p>



<p>• Available in eight shades from rose brown through to bordeaux.  </p>



<p>•  Lends a diffused, blurred finish to lips and stays put for hours. </p>



<h2>How do you use Merit’s Signature Lip Blush? </h2>



<p>Because <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.meritbeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fsignature-lip-blush"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Signature Lip Blush</a> is so balm-like, I don’t have to be precise when I apply it. Usually, I line my lips and even use a lip brush before any lipstick, but with this, I can swipe it on haphazardly — without a mirror — and still end up with perfect, pillowy lips. Maybe that’s the blurred-lip trend talking, but the texture makes it so easy. </p>



<p>If you’re applying it a little more thoughtfully, it looks even better paired with a darker lip pencil and blurred ever so slightly over the lines, again lending that Nina Park effect. I love that the lipstick bullet boasts a squoval shape, which makes light work of tracing your lip line if you don’t have a lip pencil to hand. </p>



<p>Ultimately, this is the perfect lipstick for lipstick skeptics and obsessives alike — low-maintenance, wearable, and hard to mess up. I currently have three in my handbag.</p>

<p>Rejoice! As we enter Pisces season, we’re also getting closer to spring. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">From February 18th to March 20th</a>, the sun will be splashing around in the enigmatic water sign of Pisces, heightening our intuition, and creativity. This year, Pisces season brings wisdom, reflection, and a lot of wildness in between. Things are going to get messy, so prepare for the drama-of-it-all. Before we get sea sick from the rapid changes, it’s important to learn how to flow with ease through the turbulent waters ahead. Luckily, the stars and planets will <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">help us predict the journey</a>.</p>



<p>In previous years, Saturn and Neptune have added restriction and paranoia to the mix when the sun was in Pisces. Now, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/saturn-in-aries-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">Saturn and Neptune are in Aries</a>, still stirring up problems, but not making us insecure and unsure about the road ahead. February 20th brings the conjunction of the two, urging us to pursue our dreams at any cost — even if it means hurting others in the process. We aren’t going to stand idly by and watch situations unfold; we’re going to take an active approach to drive change. We are more confident, aggressive, tenacious, and tougher than before.</p>



<p>For the first part of the solar return, there will be a stellium in mystical Pisces (the sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars). We’ll be stubborn in our delusions, only accepting our reality as the correct one, which is problematic. As a result, arguments can ensue, especially if we do not back down. Finding the middle ground is useful; however, it’ll be difficult to understand others when we put our desires first and throw logic out the window. Taking a beat to center our energy requires patience and consideration — sentiments we may be lacking in the heat of the moment. </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde in Pisces begins on February 26th and lasts until March 20th, when the sun ingresses into Aries, and the spring equinox melts the ice away. The Mercurial moonwalk is going to raise our anxieties from the immense miscommunications and frenetic vibes. The universe wants us to go inwards, allowing us to focus on internal healing. Former partners will resurface, promising the world, when they have no intention of staying. Things are feeling intangible, and the wishy-washiness makes us lose our way. Choosing compassion connects us to people and gives us the strength to rise above the tides.</p>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">total lunar eclipse in Virgo</a> on March 3rd keeps our head above water by offering a chance to have a pragmatic approach to resolving matters. The blood moon is letting us see through the darkness, like a lighthouse illuminates the ocean, keeping us afloat. The caveat is that lunar eclipses are fast and furious, so the information being brought to our attention might shake us up, forcing us to make decisions. The retrograde pauses us from being direct or able to cut off the negativity, leaving us riddled with confusion, disillusionment, and frustration. I told you it was going to be chaotic! </p>

<h3>Key Astrological Dates For Pisces Season: </h3>



<p><strong>February 18th:</strong> The sun enters Pisces, making us tender, imaginative, romantic, and sentimental. Our hearts and emotions guide the way forward.</p>



<p><strong>February 20th:</strong> Saturn conjuncts Neptune in Aries, allowing this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon to bring evolution and a metamorphosis on a global level. Outdated systems fall and new ones emerge.</p>



<p><strong>February 26th:</strong> Mercury Retrograde in Pisces commences, bringing travel issues, missed texts or emails, and the revival of old foes or exes for another hurrah (if we let them). </p>



<p><strong>March 2nd:</strong> Mars enters Pisces, pushing us to rebel and assert our views — although, we’ll have a few doubts about what we want to fight for or pursue.</p>



<p><strong>March 3rd:</strong> The lunar eclipse in Virgo is a moment of clarity and truth. How we react and deal with the energy will augment and shift our lives. </p>



<p><strong>March 6th: </strong>Venus enters Aries, motivating us to take the lead in relationships and to pursue our dreams.</p>



<p><strong>March 10th:</strong> Jupiter in Cancer ends the retrograde cycle that began on November 11th, 2025. Abundance and luck are coming!</p>



<p><strong>March 18th:</strong> The New Moon in Pisces is an opportunity to manifest our hopes and goals for the new season that comes two days later.</p>

<p>Black hair has a way of carrying everything. Memory. Care. Pressure. Pride. Each ritual rooted in purpose. On this episode of <em>Go Off, Sis</em>, the conversation feels less like an interview and more like a collective exhale, as the hosts dig into the rituals, rules, and quiet truths that shape Black women’s hair journeys.</p>



<p>The episode is presented in partnership with <strong><a href=""https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/https://www.target.com/c/celebrate-black-history-month/-/N-bw2fbN-bw2fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Target</a></strong> and their Black History Month Collection, which highlights the power, purpose, and intention behind Black founders and the communities that inspire them. The connection is clear in this conversation, which highlights women whose careers are rooted in care, access, and showing up for Black communities in tangible ways.</p>



<p>Beauty founder <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/darealbbjudy/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jesseca Dupart</a></strong> brings the perspective of someone who understands hair as both personal and collective. Her approach to building has always extended beyond products. It is about creating tools that help Black women feel confident, supported, and seen, especially in spaces where their needs have historically been overlooked. Her work and products show community impact matters just as much as innovation.</p>



<p>That sense of care and purpose becomes deeply tangible with celebrity hairstylist<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> </a><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lacyredway/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lacy Redway</a></strong>, whose stories blur the line between ritual and profession. Growing up Jamaican, she remembers sitting between her sister’s legs every Sunday as her hair was washed, twisted, and prepped for the week. When the hosts chime in with memories of familiar wash-day routines, the moment feels instantly shared, grounding the conversation in experiences many Black women recognize.</p>



<p>As an adult working across red carpets, magazine covers, and film sets, Redway says that intimacy never disappears. “We’re not just doing hair. We’re creating safety,” she explains, describing the trust required when working with clients in industries where Black hair is still misunderstood or minimized. From editorial shoots to major premieres, she continues to push back against narrow ideas of what is considered professional or feminine, reminding us that textured hair does not need to be tamed to be worthy.</p>



<p>Throughout the episode, the conversation returns to a simple truth. Choice matters. Whether worn natural, braided, relaxed, covered, or completely undone, Black women deserve the freedom to decide how they show up without explanation.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955795.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes, this week begins in the dark of the moon, and we can all feel it. In the days leading up to the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, emotions run high beneath the surface, even as many people pretend they’re unfazed. This is a charged combination. The Dark Moon is always a liminal space, a threshold where fears, insecurities, and unspoken truths rise up, both personally and collectively. You may notice avoidance, dissociation, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/therapy-healing-relationship-family-friends-impact"">or emotional numbness</a> as coping mechanisms. The invitation here is honesty, at least with yourself. What are you afraid of losing? Where have you been trying to stay neutral when neutrality no longer feels possible? This is not the week to bypass discomfort. It’s the week to witness it.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse strikes and the Year of the Fire Horse officially begins. This eclipse is electric, disruptive, and unapologetically revolutionary, especially because it squares Uranus, one of Aquarius’ ruling forces. On a collective level, this is volatile energy. Expect an uptick in unrest, protests, system shocks, and visible attempts by entrenched power structures to hold on tighter as their foundations crack. Aquarius eclipses do not negotiate with empires. They expose them. This square makes it clear that staying on the sidelines is no longer an option. Over the next six months, people will be forced to choose where they stand. Comfort, compliance, and silence become increasingly uncomfortable positions to maintain.</p>



<p>And yet, just as the revolution peaks, the cosmos reminds us to keep our hearts open. On February 18th, Pisces Season begins, and the sky fills with a powerful Pisces stellium. The sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node all gather in Pisces, creating a countercurrent of compassion, empathy, and spiritual remembrance. This is not weakness. This is medicine. While Aquarius agitates and Aries ignites, Pisces insists that healing, love, and imagination remain central. This stellium asks us to believe in the best-case scenario even when the world feels like it’s cracking. It urges us to grieve what’s ending, tend to collective trauma, and remember that liberation without heart becomes hollow.</p>



<p>The week culminates on February 20th with a rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries, a once-in-a-generation alignment that fuses vision with responsibility. On a personal level, this can feel like a calling, a moment where dreams stop being abstract and demand action. Many people will feel compelled to step into leadership, creativity, or courage in new ways. Collectively, this alignment can catalyze the birth of movements, bold initiatives, and new identities rooted in purpose. The shadow is ego inflation, savior complexes, or mistaking impulse for destiny. The higher path is conscious courage: act from integrity, not adrenaline. This week reminds us that revolution isn’t just about tearing down what no longer works. It’s about building what comes next, with intention, imagination, and care.</p>

<h2><strong>Aries Sun &amp; Rising:</strong> </h2>



<p>Aries, the week opens in the dark of the moon, and for you, this stirs the part of life tied to friendships, communities, and social dynamics. If the vibes have felt oﬀ lately, trust that you’re not imagining it. With Saturn and Neptune now in your sign, you’re more visible than usual, and visibility attracts everything… admiration, curiosity, and yes, sometimes jealousy. As we move through the final days of the Year of the Snake, this is a powerful time to release old alliances, unspoken tensions, or the need to prove yourself within certain circles. You don’t need to confront everything. Quietly choosing distance is just as effective.</p>



<p>Everything resets on February 17th, when the Aquarius Solar Eclipse <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/making-friends-connections-adulthood"">activates your friendship</a> and community realm. This is a fresh start. Over the next six months, you’ll either deepen bonds with true ride-or-dies or meet people who align with the version of you that’s emerging now. This eclipse can also accelerate your digital visibility. You may feel called to join a new collective, show up more online, or even create your own community or platform. If your circle feels small right now, don’t panic. This eclipse is planting seeds. Trust that the right people will find you as you step forward more authentically.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, inviting you inward for reflection, spiritual integration, and rest. This gentler tone pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in your sign on February 20th, a once-in-a-generation moment of identity transformation. Saturn asks you to take yourself seriously, while Neptune reminds you to stay connected to hope, imagination, and faith. Together, they mark the beginning of a long chapter where your dreams are no longer abstract. They’re asking to be lived. This week is not about having all the answers. It’s about trusting who you’re becoming and allowing your identity to evolve with intention, courage, and compassion.</p>



<div id=""taurus""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831491.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Taurus Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Taurus, this is the kind of week you end up writing a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/01/11636388/daily-journaling-mental-health-benefits"">fifteen-page journal entry</a> about and still feel like you’ve only scratched the surface. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns inward toward your career, reputation, and long-term direction. You may find yourself spiraling a bit, questioning whether the path you’re on is still worth the energy it demands. With the final days of the Year of the Snake wrapping up, this is a release moment. Titles, expectations, or goals that once felt motivating may suddenly feel heavy or outdated. Letting go now isn’t failure, it’s discernment.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which brings an undeniable aha moment around your public life and sense of purpose. This eclipse pushes you toward innovation and authenticity. You may feel inspired to pivot professionally, redefine success, or take a bold step that aligns more closely with your values. Over the next six months, this eclipse can radically change how you show up in the world, especially if you’ve been playing it safe to maintain stability. Growth now requires courage, not comfort.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy softens and shifts toward friendships, networks, and shared visions for the future. You may feel drawn to people who feel emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, or creatively inspiring. This gentler tone pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating a more introspective zone of solitude, healing, and spiritual depth. This is about learning to trust your inner world rather than fear it. Your intuition is strengthening, not to overwhelm you, but to guide you. The more you honor quiet reflection this week, the clearer your next direction becomes.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831493.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Gemini Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Gemini, this is one of those weeks where your <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-get-a-good-sleep-reclaiming-rest"">brain is doing backflips</a> at 2 a.m. and suddenly everything feels <em>philosophical</em>. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, the spotlight turns to your beliefs, future plans, and the big “where am I actually going?” questions. You may feel restless, disillusioned, or torn between multiple paths. That’s not a sign you’re lost — it’s a sign something old is ready to go. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, release outdated narratives about who you’re supposed to be or what success is supposed to look like. You don’t need all the answers yet, just honesty with yourself.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which hits this same realm of growth, travel, education, and long-term vision. This is a genuine reset. Over the next six months, you may say yes to a new direction, commit to learning something transformative, relocate, publish, teach, or radically change your worldview. The square to Uranus means the pivot may come suddenly or feel slightly chaotic at first, but it’s freeing. This eclipse doesn’t want you stuck in analysis paralysis. It wants movement, even if the map isn’t fully drawn yet.</p>



<p>The energy softens on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward career, visibility, and your public voice. Your intuition starts guiding professional decisions more than logic alone. This blends powerfully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your community, networks, and long-term goals. You’re learning which dreams are worth committing to and which circles actually support your growth. Spiritually and socially, this is a maturation moment. You’re not here to float between possibilities forever. You’re here to choose a direction that feels meaningful and build toward it with intention.</p>



<div id=""cancer""></div>



<h2><strong>Cancer Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11955474.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Cancer, this is one of those weeks where <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/women-intuition-gut-instinct-personal-safety"">your intuition is louder</a> than everyone else’s opinions combined, even if you’re trying to ignore it. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, deep emotional material rises around trust, intimacy, and shared resources. You may feel more sensitive than usual, or suddenly aware of where you’ve been over-giving, over-functioning, or holding emotional weight that isn’t yours to carry. With the Year of the Snake coming to a close, this is a powerful release window. Let go of attachments that drain you, even if part of you feels guilty doing so. Emotional boundaries are the medicine right now.</p>



<p>The breakthrough comes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates a major reset around healing, vulnerability, and energetic exchange. Over the next six months, you may redefine how you share space, money, emotions, or power with others. This eclipse can bring sudden clarity around debts, dependencies, or emotional entanglements that need to be transformed. It’s uncomfortable at first, but ultimately liberating. You’re learning that closeness doesn’t have to mean self-sacrifice, and independence doesn’t have to mean isolation.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the energy shifts in your favor, opening a gentler chapter focused on faith, learning, travel, and spiritual expansion. This flows beautifully with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which activates your career and life-direction realm. You’re being asked to blend intuition with responsibility and dream with structure. Leadership may feel intimidating, but it’s calling you anyway. This week helps you trust that you can step into visibility without losing your emotional integrity. You’re not meant to hide right now. You’re meant to lead with care.</p>



<div id=""leo""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831495.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Leo Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Leo, this week feels like the plot twist you didn’t ask for but secretly needed. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your relationships take center stage and not in a casual way. You may feel tension, distance, or emotional uncertainty around partners, close friends, or collaborators. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed relationship dynamics that drain your vitality or keep you performing instead of being real. If something feels off, trust that instinct. You’re not meant to carry connections that dim your light anymore.</p>



<p>The reset arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, landing directly in your relationship realm. This is a big one. Over the next six months, your approach to partnership will radically evolve. New people may enter your life suddenly, or existing relationships may need to renegotiate terms around freedom, equality, and authenticity. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, expect surprises. Not all of them are comfortable, but they are necessary. This eclipse asks you to stop clinging to what looks good on paper and start choosing what actually supports your growth.</p>



<p>The tone shifts on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, pulling your focus toward healing, intimacy, and emotional honesty. This pairs powerfully with the rare Saturn– Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your beliefs, values, and long-term vision. You’re learning to balance hope with discernment and passion with wisdom. This week reminds you that true confidence doesn’t come from controlling outcomes. It comes from trusting yourself enough to adapt, grow, and let relationships evolve alongside you.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831496.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2>Virgo Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Virgo, this is one of those weeks where your nervous system knows what your mind is still trying to rationalize. As the week opens in the dark of the moon, your focus turns to routines, health, work dynamics, and the way you spend your energy day to day. You may notice fatigue, irritation, or a strong urge to clean up systems that feel inefficient or draining. This is the final stretch of the Year of the Snake, and it’s asking you to shed habits that keep you busy but not fulfilled. You don’t need to fix everything at once. You just need to be honest about what’s no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets your relationship with work, wellness, and service. Over the next six months, you may change jobs, shift schedules, adopt new health practices, or redefine what productivity actually means for you. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, the changes may feel sudden or disruptive at first, but they’re designed to free you from rigid expectations. This eclipse reminds you that efficiency without alignment <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/burnout-at-work-recovery-tips"">leads to burnout</a>. You’re allowed to design a life that works for your body and your spirit.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention shifts to your relationships and one-on-one connections. This softer energy blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating deep themes around trust, vulnerability, and shared commitments. You’re learning how to balance discernment with openness. This week encourages you to let others meet you halfway rather than carrying everything yourself. You don’t have to be the strong one all the time. Growth now comes from collaboration, not perfection.</p>

<h2>Libra Sun &amp; Rising:</h2>



<p>Libra, this week opens with a subtle but emotionally charged dark of the moon, stirring your creative life, romantic longings, and desire for joy. You may feel strangely restless, uninspired, or unsure about where your passion has gone. That’s not a block, it’s a clearing. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release old narratives around love, attention, and validation. If something no longer feels fun, playful, or heart-expanding, it’s okay to admit that. This is a moment to let go of performative pleasure and reconnect with what genuinely lights you up.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which resets this same realm of romance, creativity, and self-expression. Over the next six months, you’re entering a new chapter around how you love, create, and take up space. This eclipse can spark a sudden romantic development, creative breakthrough, or renewed relationship with your inner child. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, expect surprises. You may feel pushed to take risks emotionally or creatively, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. The lesson here is freedom. You’re learning that joy doesn’t need permission.</p>



<p>The tone changes on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, redirecting attention toward your daily rhythms, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/salary-story-illness-work-life-balance"">work-life balance</a>, and emotional well-being. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating long-term shifts in your partnership and commitment zone. Big relationship themes are unfolding, starting with how you show up for yourself. This week reminds you that sustainable love and creativity come from alignment, not overcompromise. Let pleasure be honest. Let love be real.</p>

<h2><strong>Scorpio Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Scorpio, this week begins with a quiet confrontation between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming. As we move through the dark of the moon, old insecurities tied to home, family, and your emotional roots may resurface. You might notice familiar patterns trying to replay themselves, especially in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This isn’t a setback — it’s a moment of recognition. You’re being shown what no longer deserves repetition. The work here is awareness, not self-judgment. You can’t break a cycle you refuse to name.</p>



<p>The turning point arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, which activates deep shifts around home, belonging, and emotional safety, while squaring Uranus in your partnership zone. This is liberating energy, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Over the next six months, you may break free from relationship dynamics that mirror old wounds or finally speak truths you’ve been holding back. Some connections will strengthen because of honesty, while others may fall away because they can’t evolve with you. Either outcome is aligned. This eclipse asks you to choose emotional freedom over familiarity.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward love, creativity, pleasure, and self-expression. This is a welcome shift after the intensity of the eclipse. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your daily life, work habits, and long-term sustainability. You’re gaining momentum, but the lesson now is pacing. You don’t need to prove anything by overextending yourself. Structure and inspiration can coexist without burnout. This week teaches you that transformation is most powerful when it’s steady, intentional, and kind to your nervous system.</p>



<div id=""sagittarius""></div>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831499.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Sagittarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Sag, this week feels like a mental and emotional reset that you didn’t know you needed until it arrived. As we move through the dark of the moon, your attention turns to communication, thought patterns, and the stories you tell yourself about where you’re headed. Old narratives, especially ones rooted in fear, comparison, or self-doubt, may resurface in these final days of the Year of the Snake. This is your cue to release them. You’re outgrowing a version of yourself that needed constant reassurance. Trust that clarity will follow honesty.</p>



<p>The breakthrough arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your realm of learning, writing, speaking, and daily exchanges. Over the next six months, your voice evolves. You may launch a project, commit to sharing your ideas more publicly, or shift the way you communicate in close relationships. The square to Uranus brings sudden insights and unexpected conversations that push you out of your comfort zone. Say the thing. Ask the question. This eclipse reminds you that growth happens when curiosity outweighs fear.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, attention turns inward toward home, emotional safety, and the spaces that ground you. This softer energy pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating creativity, romance, and passion projects. You’re learning how to bring structure to joy and commitment to what you love. Just be mindful not to overdo it… inspiration doesn’t require exhaustion. This week teaches you that sustainable happiness comes from choosing depth over excess and meaning over momentum.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831500.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Capricorn Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Capricorn, this week begins with a reckoning around worth, security, and what you’re truly building toward. As we move through the dark of the moon, financial concerns, self-esteem patterns, or lingering fears around stability may rise to the surface. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re being asked to release scarcity thinking and outdated definitions of success. If something has required too much effort for too little return, this is your signal. Letting go now creates space for a more aligned foundation to form.</p>



<p>The shift arrives on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your money and values realm. Over the next six months, you may experience a reset around income, priorities, or how you measure your own worth. With Uranus squaring this eclipse, changes may come unexpectedly. A new opportunity, a sudden expense, or a wake-up call around what truly matters could alter your path. This eclipse pushes you to innovate rather than cling to what’s familiar. Security now comes from adaptability, not control.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, your focus softens toward communication, learning, and emotional expression. This pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction on February 20th, activating deep shifts around home, family, and inner emotional structures. As a Saturn-ruled sign, you’re especially sensitive to this moment. You’re learning to build strength without rigidity and responsibility without emotional shutdown. This week reminds you that true resilience comes from honoring both your ambition and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/02/11275205/how-to-sleep-when-stressed-tips"">your need for rest</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Aquarius Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Aquarius, this week is personal in a way you can’t intellectualize your way out of. As the week opens in the dark of the moon in your sign, and the emotional focus lands directly on you… your identity, your body, your sense of self. You may feel unusually sensitive, exposed, or unsure of how you’re being perceived. That’s because something fundamental is shedding. In these final days of the Year of the Snake, you’re releasing an old version of yourself that learned how to survive, not necessarily how to thrive. Let the discomfort speak. It’s showing you where growth is overdue.</p>



<p>Everything changes on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse in your sign, a major reset that will echo for the next six months. This eclipse marks a turning point in how you show up in the world. With the eclipse squaring Uranus, one of your ruling planets, expect disruption, breakthroughs, and moments that force honesty. You may feel pulled between who you’ve been and who you’re becoming, especially in relation to home, family, or emotional security. This is not a quiet evolution. It’s visible. You can’t go back to playing small or staying neutral. The world is responding to the version of you that’s ready to lead differently.</p>



<p>As Pisces Season begins on February 18th, the focus shifts toward self-worth, money, and values, grounding the intensity of the eclipse into practical reality. This blends with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, activating your communication and mindset. You’re being asked to take your ideas seriously while still honoring imagination and intuition. The lesson this week is integration. You don’t have to choose between logic and vision. When you trust both, you become a powerful architect of the future you’re here to build.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11831502.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Pisces Sun &amp; Rising:</strong></h2>



<p>Pisces, this week feels like the deep exhale before a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">brand-new chapter begins</a>. As the week opens with the dark of the moon, you may feel more introspective than usual, pulled toward solitude, memory, and emotional processing. Old fears, habits, or subconscious patterns may surface in these final days of the Year of the Snake, asking for closure. This isn’t about fixing yourself. It’s about forgiveness… of others, of circumstances, and of past versions of you who did the best they could with what they knew.</p>



<p>Everything shifts on February 17th with the Aquarius Solar Eclipse, activating your spiritual, subconscious, and healing realm. This is a powerful internal reset that will unfold quietly but profoundly over the next six months. You may feel called to rest more, create in private, or release attachments that no longer align with your emotional truth. With Uranus squaring the eclipse, sudden realizations or intuitive downloads can arrive unexpectedly. Trust what your inner voice reveals, even if it doesn’t make sense yet.</p>



<p>The tone softens and expands on February 18th as Pisces Season begins, placing the spotlight back on you and your personal journey. This is your time to emerge gently, not rush. It pairs with the rare Saturn–Neptune conjunction in Aries on February 20th, which marks a once-in-a-generation moment of integrating dreams with responsibility. You’re learning that spirituality and structure don’t cancel each other out. They strengthen each other. This week reminds you that your sensitivity is not a liability. It’s the compass guiding you into the next era of your life.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/february-monthly-horoscope-2026-meanings-effects"">Eclipse season is here!</a> The onset of the annual solar and total lunar eclipse is bringing a fateful chance for us to transform. We are shifting our ideas and purpose to find our place in the world. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/yearly-horoscope-2026"">Eclipses help to show us</a> what we need to augment to live a fulfilling existence, and these are no different. The caveat is that we are expected to move forward gracefully, which is hard for anyone, especially since the energy packs a powerful punch that shakes things up unpredictably. Comprehending that some people’s situations and experiences must be shelved or that they must begin a new phase is easier said than done. Compassion for ourselves and others can help us. The only way out is through! See you on the other side!</p>

<h4><strong>The Annular Solar Eclipse In Aquarius</strong></h4>



<p>Take note: February 17th is set to be a momentous day. According to lunar astrology, not only does it usher in the Year of the Fire Horse, but the solar eclipse in Aquarius also occurs at 7:01 a.m. EST. This is the first eclipse that falls on the Aquarius and Leo lunar axis, which makes its formal move into these signs on July 26th. The eclipse activates the coming North Node of Destiny in Aquarius, urging us to usher in <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/money-financial-horoscope-2026-meaning-effects"">a new mindset</a>, and for us all to work cohesively to make global advances. We are a powerful force of nature when we come together.</p>



<p>A “ring of fire” annual solar eclipse is a rare lunar phenomenon that is the result of the moon moving between the sun and earth, while being far from the earth, making the moon look smaller than the sun. The result of the eclipse leaves a fiery look to the circular edges of the moon (in this particular case, the moon will appear that way for two minutes and 20 seconds at the peak of the eclipse). The eclipse is primarily visible from Antarctica. Other regions, such as South America, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean, will have partial views.</p>



<p>The solar eclipse in Aquarius aspects a sensitive point of the sign, known as an anaretic degree (the 29th degree). The urgency to grow and evolve is immediate. It is giving us a chance to embrace our unique sentiments and let them be known. The collective is changing, and we are evolving our minds with it. Because the planet Uranus, which is in Taurus, is active in the eclipse, it’s fair to say that this is the time of revolution. We are going to stand up for what we believe in and won’t back down. The results may be unpredictable at the moment, but the battle is worth fighting for. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h4>The Total Lunar Eclipse In Virgo</h4>



<p>On March 3rd at 6:38 a.m. EST, the total lunar eclipse in Virgo intensifies the sky, giving stargazers and astrology lovers an amazing sight to see and capture. The lunar eclipse is a time of release, since it connects to the South Node of Destiny in Virgo (on the current Pisces and Virgo lunar axis). We are departing from old views and emotions, making space for us to explore different philosophies. This is a moment of transcendence and reflection, so take a look back at what recently happened that is sparking a reaction that pushes us to run away from it. </p>



<p>During a total lunar eclipse, the moon appears to take on a reddish hue as it passes over the earth’s shadow. Known as the “Blood Moon,” total lunar eclipses are a moment of illumination and revelation. The lunar eclipse will be visible in the Western Americas, Australia, East Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, lasting around 59 minutes at its totality.</p>



<p>The lunar eclipse in Virgo receives a gentle push from Jupiter retrograde in Cancer, making a difference. Jupiter is known to be the planet of luck, but it can also expand matters that are in a delicate position in either good or bad ways. Problems can become bigger; however, Jupiter always ensures that the results are fortunate. The sting may feel intense at the moment, especially since Mercury retrograde in Pisces is causing ambiguity and confusion. Looking back on the eclipse, we’ll realize that letting go of the past was necessary. The moon in Virgo is a creature of comfort, which is why relinquishing control and healing will be challenging. In the end, it’ll be worth the sacrifice and ride.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959267.jpeg?width=756&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=189%3A256"" /></figure></div>



<p>So, I’m <strong><em>that</em></strong> friend. The one <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bucket-list-hotels-r29-editor-picks"">booking her hotel</a> on the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/12/11949132/christmas-travel-where-to-stay-hotel-new-york-city"">flight to the destination.</a> The one who buys her <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/capsule-wardrobe-guide-tips"">full wardrobe</a> after getting there. The one with a non-existent itinerary and a deeply held belief that, “If we just walk outside, something will appear.” Some may call it impulsive, but I like to call it spontaneity with a little bit of chaos. </p>



<p>I’ll admit it, I’m a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/life-coach-lessons-type-a-personality"">Type A person’s</a> worst nightmare… and I had every intention of staying that way. That is, until Hilton invited me on a press trip with a handful of seasoned travel reporters, people who don’t just travel, but optimize it. Over dinner, two of them walked me through how they use points to unlock upgrades, experiences, and thousands of dollars in savings I didn’t even realize I was leaving behind.</p>



<p>And for my fellow Type B travelers who’ve been raw-dogging their way through travel, here’s how one Hilton-hosted weekend in West LA reformed me<strong>,</strong> without stripping away my go-with-the-flow energy. </p>



<p>I had just moved from New York to Los Angeles when Hilton reached out to host my <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/grammy-awards-red-carpet-fashion-2026"">Grammy Awards</a> weekend experience.I jumped at the opportunity to attend music’s biggest night and enjoy a little staycation. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959258.jpg?width=784&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=49%3A64"" /></figure>



<p>What I didn’t expect was horseback riding in Malibu, multi-course dinners on property, and a suite bigger than my NYC <em>and</em> LA apartments combined, all tied to <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hilton-honors/"">Hilton Honors,</a> the brand’s loyalty program that gives members access to curated Grammys weekend packages, upgrades, and experiences I genuinely did not know you could redeem with Points.</p>



<p>And before you roll your eyes at the word “points,” I see you. Because if you’re anything like me, “points” sounds like something that requires 47 international flights and a corporate job with unlimited PTO. I am here to tell you: it’s not as unattainable as it sounds. Let’s break it down. </p>



<p>When you book direct or stay at Hilton properties, you earn points you can actually use, either toward free nights or by combining them with cash. You don’t need some impossible balance, you just use what you have.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959270.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>But what surprised me most is that it’s not just about rooms. Through <a href=""https://experiences.hiltonhonors.com/"">Hilton Honors Experiences</a>, Points can unlock actual moments, concert access, VIP sporting events, spa treatments, even Grammy weekend stays at <a href=""https://www.guestreservations.com/waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/booking?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=969500850&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=969500850&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADiMQMYLTTERfRqL_lLG1CPWgLJh2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PqKbdLKIq-SYBhQbXWPtEgKHvICNxJYZYDbYnfDvDQqr7PLjdqchMBoCXKAQAvD_BwE"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills.</a></p>



<p>And then there are the small things that quietly upgrade your life: skipping the front desk with a digital key, choosing your room in advance, late checkout when you need it. And truuuust me, a girl like me will <em>always</em> need a late checkout. </p>



<p>But what if you’re not headed to the Grammys? What if you just want a moment away from the noise?</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959261.png?width=760&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=95%3A128"" /></figure>



<p>That’s exactly how I ended up on the back of a horse overlooking the Malibu coastline. Hilton partnered with a local outfitter and handled the logistics, transportation, timing, the whole setup, so all I had to do was show up. It’s an experience I would never, ever plan for myself, but it pulled me completely out of my comfort zone in the best way.</p>



<p>We split our stay between <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/smoolol-oceana-santa-monica/?WT.mc_id=zLADA0AA1OL2PSH3GGL4AMPHTBRD_Oct5GNPLTPMWBRNLAB6SMOOLOL7EN8i142435__z22150182377z__&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaign%7D&amp;utm_adgroup=%7Badgroup%7D&amp;utm_keyword=oceana%20santa%20monica&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22150182377&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-Q0XEachnVMaiJRrASK4anHY1hat&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtLvMBhB_EiwA1u6_PsQYcgtXE2HDbyA6H3kXeVE9CLM74zjCDXK21WfEO_2Os5I2H-vsfxoCnpoQAvD_BwE"">Oceana Santa Monica</a> and <a href=""https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/laxwawa-waldorf-astoria-beverly-hills/"">Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills</a>, and they could not have felt more different. The Oceana was rooted in serenity and calm, the type of energy Santa Monica is known for. And if you stay there, head downstairs to the La Monique and grab the Escargot Poppers with garlic herb crème fraîche. Yes, they’re fried snails. And yes, they kind of remind me of mozzarella sticks. Soooo good. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959273.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=683&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A683"" /></figure>



<p>On the day of the Grammys, we stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills. It felt like a slightly elevated experience and definitely had me feeling like a superstar for the day. The bathroom overlooked the city, the suite was polished and luxurious, and everything about it felt Grammys-coded. When my mom came to visit, we definitely had a pinch me moment. We’re just two girls from the deep-south after all! </p>



<p>All of this to say: points are  for everyone — including you, Type B traveler who still loves chaos but doesn’t mind leveling up. We can still, stubbornly, embrace the chaos while making our money stretch. </p>
