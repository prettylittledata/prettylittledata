<p><em>This Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Medik8 is offering </em><strong><em>30% off sitewide</em></strong><em> from </em><strong><em>November 20 through December 2</em></strong><em>.</em> </p>



<p>As a beauty and shopping writer, I’ve spent countless hours interviewing dermatologists and estheticians, picking their brains for <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dermatologist-skin-care-advice"">skincare advice</a> and the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/skincare-beauty-products-stop-using-summer"">beauty products</a> they’d happily spend their hard-earned money on. Whenever I ask for recommendations on how to build an effective, no-nonsense routine, one brand comes up time and again: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a good reason why this <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">British skincare brand</a> has captured the attention of so many in-the-know experts. The brand is most beloved for its <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Retinal range</a>, which offers retinal (a vitamin A derivative targeting uneven skin texture and pigmentation) at various concentrations. This tailored approach allows you to find the retinoid strength that works best for your skin without irritation. Other <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 products</a>, such as the <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra-advanced"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">vitamin C serums</a> and <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/advanced-night-ceramide"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceramide moisturizers</a>, are also highly rated for their efficacy.</p>



<p>Since <strong>Medik8 is currently offering <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">30% off sitewide</a> until December 2</strong>, we couldn’t help but share the bestselling products we’ll be carting up during this major <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-deals"">Black Friday beauty sale</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who has sensitive skin, a product that doesn’t cause an instant uncomfortable reaction is a keeper for Susan Devaney, Refinery29’s lifestyle director. Enter: <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/crystal-retinal?variant=36716424560791"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3</a>. “I use it twice a week at night, and I honestly notice my skin feeling softer and brighter when I wake the following day,” she says. Devaney adds, “I’m aware <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">that retinal</a> [a form of vitamin A that’s more gentle but faster-acting than retinol] helps to keep skin in better shape by targeting hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone. I’m in my 30s, so this feels like a good investment to make for my future self. I apply SPF to my skin daily, too, which is a must when using any retinal product.” </p>

<p>Refinery29’s beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita used <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/total-moisture-daily-facial-cream"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">this moisturizer</a> down to the very last drop, and while this might not seem like an impressive feat, for a beauty editor whose job it is to try everything all at once, it says something about how excellent it is. “I love the cushiony texture that sits somewhere between a gel and a cream; it quenches my parched patches in seconds, all without leaving behind a greasy or tacky residue,” says Kilikita. The star ingredients are peptides (essentially skin-strengthening proteins), hydrating hyaluronic acid, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ceramides-skincare-eczema-dermatitis"">and ceramides</a>, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep them healthy and happy. “For me, ceramides are a must when I choose a moisturizer, especially in the winter when my skin becomes sensitive to cold weather and central heating,” adds Kilikita. Even better? It doesn’t break her out like other face creams. She’s already on her third tub. </p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C serums</a> leave skin feeling itchy and red, but <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/c-tetra"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Medik8’s C-Tetra</a> is built differently. It contains 7% tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, a stabilized form of vitamin C that doesn’t irritate, and is enriched with nourishing jojoba oil. Reviewers praise this serum for making a difference to their skin’s overall radiance and improving dark spots. The texture is akin to a dry facial oil and feels a lot more moisturizing than most serums. </p>

<p><a href=""https://go.linkby.com/YNQTKZRJ/products/surface-radiance-cleanse?variant=37945194479802"">This gel cleanser</a> was recommended to Refinery29’s beauty director by a dermatologist when she was going through a period of hormonal acne, and she is convinced it helped to clear up her skin. The reason it’s so great for spots is that it boasts exfoliating alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like lactic acid and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid. The former chips away at dead skin cells and minimizes the appearance of hyperpigmentation, while the latter goes a little deeper, breaking up the mixture of dead cells, oil, and dirt that clogs pores. While it sounds powerful, it’s actually very gentle and never dries out the skin thanks to a heavy helping of moisturizing glycerin. </p>

<p>Celebrity dermatologist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/drewomaukeleghe/?hl=en"">Dr. Ewoma Ukeleghe</a> once described <a href=""https://go.linkby.com/JIARTCNS/products/liquid-peptides"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Peptides</a> as ‘Botox in a bottle,’ and we couldn’t agree with her more. The star ingredient is a hefty 30% concentration of 10 peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with peptides, they’re essentially proteins that boost collagen and elastin — the two things responsible for keeping skin supple. Despite these powerhouse ingredients, it’s surprisingly lightweight and absorbs quickly. Apply it in the evening and wake up to bouncy skin.</p>

<p>This oil cleanser emulsifies on contact with water, turning into a silky milk that dissolves everything from multiple coats of mascara to heavy foundation and sunscreen — all without drying out your skin. That’s thanks to the mega mix of omega-6, vitamin E, and plant extracts that nourish the delicate skin barrier rather than strip it. There’s a reason beauty editors always fall back on it.</p>

It uses multi-weight hyaluronic acid, which penetrates at different levels to ensure every layer of your skin is properly hydrated. Beyond HA, it features a solid dose of vitamin B5 (also known as panthenol) — an ingredient dermatologists praise for helping lock moisture in. Dry, dehydrated skin? Don’t know her. Better still, it never leaves skin feeling greasy or sticky.</p>

It’s meant to be a ritual. It contains a trifecta of moisturizing ingredients: humectants, which draw moisture into the skin; occlusives, which keep it there; and emollients, which soothe and soften dry, flaky skin. Even after one use of layering the two, you’ll notice that your skin looks fresher and noticeably less parched.</p>

<h2>Soapy Oud</h2>



<p>There’s no mistaking the scent of oud — a dark, resinous wood. Equal parts sweet, earthy, and rich, it dominates any perfume it’s in, making it an acquired taste. Perfume expert Aamna Lone, aka <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/perfumeconnoisseurz/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">@perfumeconnoisseurz on Instagram</a>, predicts a new type of oud will reign supreme — and it’s easier to wear. “There has been a rise in soapy, sterile ouds that are softer but still allow the same projection,” she says. Think oud blended with clean-laundry notes like musk, heliotrope, and jasmine. She highlights <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmizensirparfums.com%2Fproducts%2Fperfect-oud%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOor9AQrJPJMckF7nxC4tEEjVkgpI3t8MCwunQtiPgFhRkSpJZfdR"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mizensir’s Perfect Oud Eau de Parfum</a>, which features a “metallic, crisp texture.” Then there’s the more affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Romancea-Woman-Parfum-Ard-Zaafaran/dp/B07QY42V1H"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oud Romancea</a>, which, to Lone, smells like literal soap and oud. </p>

<h2>Dark Fruits</h2>



<p>Lee Howes, <a href=""https://www.lush.com/us/en_us"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lush’s fragrance category lead</a>, says we usually associate fruity scents with summer, but this winter it’s time for darker, richer, berry-like fragrances, inspired by the winter harvest, to take the spotlight. “Cherry will stay popular, though in a cozier form,” says Howes. “This season, we have our <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fcherryish-body-spray%3FqueryId%3Db1255e9fb5d1463e8c5a9f7b571da05b"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cherryish Body Spray,</a> which keeps the freshness of cherry but warms it up with notes of chocolate marzipan — it’s a really festive scent.”</p>

<h2>Edible Nostalgia</h2>



<p>Gourmand fragrances — perfumes with sweet, birthday cake-like notes — aren’t going anywhere, but they’re getting more complex, says <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/barbstegemann/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barb Stegemann</a>, founder and president of <a href=""https://the7virtues.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqi7ycJdxA7P5-RVi6XV6otELvTHJ93U6Eh0jmSlG_4VhEFG6Fb"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues</a>. “The future is all about creating a layer-cake effect, stacking notes of vanilla, caramel, fruit, buttercream, and berries so you smell like no one else in the room,” she says. Gourmand scents can sometimes feel a little saccharine and juvenile, but they also evoke nostalgia, Stegemann notes. To make them more glamorous, she says we’ll pair these sweet notes with deeper ones for contrast. “Think santal wood, tonka bean, and musks,” she explains, calling this the next evolution of personalization. “You’re literally baking your own scent — a fragrance that feels custom, modern, delicious, and uniquely yours.”</p>

<h2>Perfume Priming</h2>



<p>Lone highlights a burgeoning trend among the internet’s perfume enthusiasts: layering fragrances with traditional balms. “This could be Tiger Balm, Aboniki [a Nigerian muscle relief balm made from menthol and eucalyptus oil], or even Vicks VapoRub,” says Lone — yes, really.</p>



<p>“The <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@a.dose.of.e/photo/7561922146411236630"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aboniki layering combination</a> was popularized by certified fragrance specialist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a.dose.of.e/"">Eudora Nwasike</a>, and it has gone viral ever since,” she adds. The main advantage of layering perfume over a balm like this is that it serves multiple purposes. “You can decongest stuffy noses, help ailing joints, and smell good for longer because it creates a new fragrance profile,” says Lone. Even better? “The balm helps ‘trap’ the fragrance odorants in its emollient base, so the scent bubble sticks around for longer.”</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Seasonal Gourmands</h2>



<p>Howes makes another case for gourmand scents but says they’ll be getting a seasonal makeover this winter. “Vanilla and tonka notes have dominated fragrance for months, but now, expect to see them blended with deeper, more nuanced materials,” says Howes. He suggests watching for ginger, black pepper, and cardamom for what he calls spicier takes on the typical sweet scents. “Also, try more grounding and comforting notes of sandalwood and coffee,” recommends Howes. “From Lush, our big winter scents tend to be the deep coziness of <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flord-of-misrule-perfume"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lord of Misrule Perfume</a> and our soft, powdery gourmand, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fturmeric-latte-perfume%3FqueryId%3D0f15fb59b12d096e60db0e759aee4b5c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Turmeric Latte Perfume</a>,” he adds. “Both do a brilliant job of wrapping you up in beautiful fragrance as the weather takes a chillier turn.”</p>

So crave-worthy, Stegemann says this “foodie fragrance” sold out in 48 hours in more than 60 Sephora stores and immediately became the number two fragrance on <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fbrand%2F7-virtues"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sephora.com</a>. </p>

<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2>Strawberry Chypre</h2>



<p>Lone pinpoints “strawberry chypre” as the next big thing in fragrance. For the uninitiated, chypre is a fragrance family that blends bright citrus notes with earthier tones like wood and spices. The addition of strawberry adds a sweet touch, making it more wearable for everyday. “This has sprung forward thanks to <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP517175"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miu Miu Miutine</a> (strawberry, bourbon vanilla, moss, and amber), and it mirrors iconic past favorites such as <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP12495"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum</a> and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP474316"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miss Dior Cherie Eau de Parfum</a>,” says Lone. </p>



<p>You might also like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ulta.com%2Fp%2Fher-elixir-de-parfum-pimprod2034780%3Fsku%3D2599353"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Burberry Her Elixir de Parfum</a>, which features strawberry, warm amber, and earthy sandalwood. Lone predicts that this perfect pairing will continue trending well into next year.</p>

<h2>Scented Skin Layering</h2>



<p>“In many (decidedly warmer) parts of the world, it’s popular to wear scent in the form of a body powder to keep skin feeling fresher for longer — all while smelling great,” says Howes, adding that it’s a smart way to create a “scented base layer.” Think of it as the fragrance equivalent of a clean cotton T-shirt. </p>



<p>Dusting powders are a new Lush innovation, and they’re about to be huge. “These soften and scent your skin, blending beautifully with whatever fragrance you decide to spray on top,” says Howes. Happily, some of the brand’s most popular fragrances are now available in powder form: <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsticky-dates-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Dc3fc6cfd1d1903f50a8a0d7c1ea6c806"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sticky Dates</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Flet-the-good-times-roll-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3Da8b035ed56610abfa60655706286e71c"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Let The Good Times Roll</a>, and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lush.com%2Fus%2Fen_us%2Fp%2Fsuper-milk-dusting-powder%3FqueryId%3D3c8842b45d0044e97ea24073690bbb7d"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Milk</a>. “You can even layer these with your favorite body spray,” recommends Howes.</p>

<p>The holiday season is upon us, and with that, the arrival of the biggest shopping day of the year: <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-friday"">Black Friday</a>. While we may hotly debate when it’s acceptable to blast “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” there’s one early arrival we can all agree on: the best Black Friday deals.</p>



<p>All of your favorite retailers have rolled out all their Black Friday deals, making now the time to score top-rated products you’ve been eyeing (or planning to <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/holiday-gift-guides"">gift someone special</a>) for a fraction of the price. We’ve rounded up all the must-know sales for a successful — and wallet-friendly — Black Friday 2025. Read on below for our guide to the smartest savings — from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-clothing-deals"">highly-coveted fashion markdowns </a>to steep cuts on <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-black-friday-mattress-deals"">mattresses and bedding</a> — happening now.</p>



<h2>What is Black Friday?</h2>



<p>Black Friday lands the day after Thanksgiving (this year, it’s November 28). But it’s far from a single-day event. It’s now a mega-shopping marathon kicking off as early as October and continuing through early December, along with its sister sale, Cyber Monday. </p>



<h2>When do Black Friday deals start?</h2>



<p>Early Black Friday sales are already underway and will continue to ramp up throughout the month. (Remember, it’s a marathon, not a sprint!)</p>

<p>The rivalry between Puerto Ricans and Dominicans goes back decades. The neighboring islands, and their diasporas in the United States, compete over just about everything. The question of who’s better at baseball is settled nearly every year with a new headline matchup. <a href=""https://www.mlb.com/news/dominican-republic-beats-puerto-rico-at-citi-field-in-exhibition-game"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">DR won an exhibition game</a> in New York on November 15, but <a href=""https://www.espn.com/world-baseball-classic/game/_/gameId/401500669/puerto-rico-dominican-republic"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Puerto Rico defeated them in the 2023</a> World Baseball Classic. In the kitchen, the feud is between Puerto Rico’s mofongo and the Dominican Republic’s mangú, two garlicky plantain staples. And in music, there’s the debates about who has more rhythm on the dancefloor and who makes more hits. An outsider might see these hilarious, albeit pointed, jabs thrown at each other on the Internet and think the two are really enemies, but Bad Bunny’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-no-me-quiero-ir-de-aqui-residency-outfits"">DeBí TiRAR MáS FOToS World Tour</a> opening in Santo Domingo displayed what we have always known: It’s all playful love entre familia.</p>



<p>On November 21, the Puerto Rican three-time Grammy winner, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, kicked off his anticipated stadium world tour with two sold-out shows in the Dominican Republic’s capital. On night one, Bad Bunny, who Billboard named the <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/lists/bad-bunny-number-1-top-latin-artists-21st-century-chart/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">top Latin artist of the 21st century</a>, greeted the crowd of about 50,000 people at Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez, saying, “I’ve really enjoyed being a tourist here, though I don’t know if ‘tourist’ is the right word, because when I’m here, I feel at home.” And everything about the show celebrated the shared heritage and close relationship the two islands have built together.</p>



<p>In the audience, Dominican women completed their concert outfits with Puerto Rican pava hats — or, as shouting street vendors throughout la Zona Colonial have renamed them, “el sombrero de Bad Bunny.” Meanwhile, Puerto Rican fans who missed <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bad-bunny-residency-puerto-rico-what-to-do"">Bad Bunny’s historic 31-show residency</a> at San Juan’s El Choli made the short trip west to Santo Domingo, snapping photos in front of wall-length Dominican flags. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944803.jpeg?width=682&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=341%3A512"" /></figure>



<p><a href=""https://www.hennessy.com/en-int/stories/hennessy-joins-forces-global-phenomenon-bad-bunny-his-debi-tirar-mas-fotos-world-tour"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hennessy</a>, the global presenting sponsor of the tour, created experiences that blended both cultures seamlessly right outside of the stadium and in Downtown Santo Domingo. In a <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DRX4E1okTpK/?hl=en&amp;img_index=4"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hennessy-branded casita</a> by the show, Boris like model Joan Smalls y Domis like actress Dascha Polanco sat down to play dominoes, the two flags in the home, while Alex Sensation spun ’70s salsa and merengue típico. Fans refreshed from the Caribbean humidity with Hennessy De Coco, a spin on Pitorro de Coco that blends coconut, tropical fruits, and Hennessy, and Hennessy Pasión, a mix of passionfruit, lemonade, and Hennessy — two cocktails that will be available throughout the tour. At the activations, there was also a piragua stand serving cognac-infused versions of the shaved ice treat popular on Viejo San Juan’s cobblestone streets and classic Dominican chimis. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11944800.jpeg?width=683&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=683%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>The blend made sense because most of us, those with roots in Borikén or Kiskeya, have known it our entire lives.</p>



<p>While our shared history can be traced back to the Taínos, the Indigenous people who once inhabited the islands of the Greater Antilles, and the Spanish conquest that brought violent genocide and African enslavement, less discussed is the solidarity that emerged from this joint struggle. For generations, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans have stood together, lending support and fighting alongside each other in anti-colonial and social justice movements. </p>



<p>To start, the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10334054/dominican-republic-independence-day-history-haiti"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Dominican Republic’s fight for sovereignty</a>, first in 1821 and then in 1844, served as a symbolic and inspirational model for Puerto Rican nationalists. During their bids for independence in the nineteenth century, Puerto Rican revolutionaries often took refuge in Santo Domingo, where they could safely organize, network with nationalists across the Caribbean, and publish anti-colonial materials. In 1868, when Puerto Ricans first revolted against Spanish rule during <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/collections/puerto-rico-books-and-pamphlets/articles-and-essays/nineteenth-century-puerto-rico/rebellion-of-1868/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">el Grito de Lares</a>, they stitched a revolutionary flag featuring a white cross that divided the flag into four rectangles, a tribute to the Dominican flag and to the trans-Caribbean revolutionary network.</p>



<p>Decades later, now as a U.S. colony, the people of Puerto Rico are using the political power they do have to push back against the federal government’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/puerto-rico-ice-raids-protests"">anti-immigrant policies in Puerto Rico</a>, which have predominantly targeted Dominican migrants. Boricuas regularly take to the streets to protest raids, deportations, and anti-immigrant legislation; organize food, clothing, and medical brigades to help Dominican families affected economically by the immigration crackdowns; and even shelter Dominican migrants in churches and community halls that have become safe havens.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Everything about the show celebrated the shared heritage and close relationship the two islands have built together.”</p><cite>raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A similar solidarity exists within the diaspora. In New York, where the playful rivalry between Puerto Ricans and Dominicans began in the 1970s — when Dominicans moved in large numbers to historically Boricua neighborhoods like the South Bronx, Washington Heights, and the Lower East Side — new forms of alliances emerged. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ice-targeting-latine-activists"">The Young Lords</a>, a Puerto Rican revolutionary group born out of Chicago that later expanded to New York, included many Dominican women and men who, together, fought for housing rights, education access, and community health programs that impacted both communities. At the same time, El Museo del Barrio in East Harlem served as one of a few hubs where Puerto Rican and Dominican youth collaborated on arts, education, and cultural projects.</p>



<p>Living side by side in housing projects throughout the city, both groups did what they, arguably, do better than anyone else: crack jokes. As my Puerto Rican dad who grew up in New York in the ‘70s tells me, no one was safe and everything was ripe for teasing: accents, who had slicker game with girls, and who had better rum. Over the years, those neighborhood quips carried on, with Puerto Rican men now laughing at how tight their Dominican friends wear their pants and Dominicans teasing their Puerto Rican brothers for dressing like they are in an early-2000s Peedi Crakk music video. </p>



<p>A comedic skit called <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV0zpqnnGD4"">“Puerto Ricans vs. Dominicans,”</a> published by Flama in 2015, captures the playful beef perfectly. In the five-minute clip, two men go back and forth, hilariously debating which culture has better style, music, and food, only to have a mom in rolos intervene, revealing that the two are actually brothers, each both Puerto Rican and Dominican.</p>







<p>And that’s the other reality: In the diaspora, Puerto Rican and Dominican communities often intermingle, forming families that bond us even closer. Are you even Puerto Rican if you don’t have a Dominican tío? Are you even Dominican if you don’t have a prima who’s half-Bori and a few other distant relatives who have lived in Puerto Rico for decades? We are, quite literally, family. During Bad Bunny’s second show in Santo Domingo this weekend, he brought out <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/romeo-santos-bad-bunny-bokete-bachata-performance-dr-1236120631/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Romeo Santos</a>, who is of both Dominican and Puerto Rican descent, to perform a bachata version of “BOKeTE.” And so many of our favorite stars in music, film, TV, and social media share the same mix, too. Our identities are braided together like the knotted fibers of Taíno baskets, a shared ancestral practice I only just learned about during my recent visit to <a href=""https://casadelcordon.com/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Centro Cultural Taíno Casa del Cordón</a> in Santo Domingo.</p>



<p>A guy I used to date, who just so happens to be Dominican, used to always tell me, “Where there is a Puerto Rican, there is a Dominican nearby.” And he wasn’t wrong. From New York and New Jersey down through Worcester, Allentown, and Orlando, there are entirely blended neighborhoods. We coalesce because we know that, despite all the jokes and competition, we see and understand each other. Our food and music are seasoned with the same stuff. Our accents and slang may be different, but we understand each other’s dialects more easily than anyone else’s. We feel safe together. We feel at home. And like siblings who play-fight but will throw hands at anyone who really comes for their family, we tease each other relentlessly, and hilariously, con amor y respeto.   </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“We are two cultures, two nations, and two islands that have fought conquest, injustice, and generations of marginalization in the Caribbean and in the States — y todavía estamos aquí, juntos, teasing each other, y bien cabrón.”</p><cite>Raquel reichard</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that’s why, when I threw my hands in the air and bounced euphorically at Bad Bunny’s show in DR this weekend, screaming, “Puerto Rico,” mi tierrita, “está bien cabrón,” there were tens of thousands of Dominicans around me leaping and yelling it, too — and meaning it. </p>



<p>It’s also why I teared up when Benito ended that performance declaring, “la República Dominicana está cabrón también.” Because we are two cultures, two nations, and two islands that have fought conquest, injustice, and generations of marginalization in the Caribbean and in the States — y todavía estamos aquí, juntos, teasing each other, y bien cabrón.<br /></p>

<p>For most of us, winter is when <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sagittarius-season-2025-horoscope-meaning-effects"">creativity stalls</a>. Shorter days, darker nights, and sub-zero temperatures don’t exactly fuel the imagination.

<p>This month alone, we’ve spotted cranberry chrome — both block color <em>and</em> <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/deep-french-tips-nails-manicure-trend"">French tips</a> — plus nails drenched in so much glitter they resemble the inside of a snowglobe. </p>

<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DOj62CbDHoi/?hl=en"">nail artist Grethel</a>, traditional tortoiseshell nails have had an upgrade just in time for the holidays.

<p>These split ombré nails are like an optical illusion, evoking the shadowy winter moon. We especially love the gradient, which seamlessly blends midnight and baby blue. Nail artist <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ4h7-_j_5m/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1"">Brittney Ellen</a> explains that the ombré is flipped on the French tip to trick the eye.</p>

Warrant’s “Cherry Pie”, The Runaways’ “Cherry Bomb”, Hozier’s “Cherry Wine”... There’s a reason why so many artists — spanning decades and genres — are inspired by one commonplace fruit. On the one hand, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tiktok-cherry-cola-lips-trend-hack"">cherries</a> represent the simple sweetness of youth and capture the heady nostalgia of long summer days (life is but a bowl of cherries, after all). On the other hand, they’re shorthand for sex, seduction, and a loss of innocence (think the sultry lyrics of Lana Del Rey or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUtDwWp17tM""><em>Twin Peaks’ </em>Audrey Horne</a> tying a cherry stem with her tongue). <br /><br />In the art world, cherries are symbolic of wealth and decadence. The <a href=""https://arthive.com/publications/316~Life_is_just_a_bowl_of_cherries_Top_10_paintings_rendering_cherries#google_vignette"">Dutch Old Masters</a> couldn’t get enough of them in their elaborate still lifes, spilling out of ornate silver dishes with bouquets. The same can be said for cherry fragrances. A cherry note is never just one thing — it can be sweet and succulent, bright and tart, or deep and indulgent. Whatever it’s mixed with can also completely change the game, whether that’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/oakcha-perfume-dupes-review"">rich ouds, boozes and spices</a>, earthy leather and wood notes, florals, or other fruits. <br /><br />Thanks to this versatility and complexity, cherry fragrances have long been topping ‘viral fragrance’ lists (<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/trending-perfume-fragrance-2024"">especially our own</a>). In fact, you’d be hard-pressed not to find <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lost-cherry-P436489?skuId=2369213"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford’s Lost Cherry</a> and <a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/lovefest-eau-de-parfum-intense-P501018"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Kayali’s Lovefest Burning Cherry</a> in the bathroom cabinets of the coolest people you know.

The bright sweetness of cherry is beautifully balanced with warm, sensual notes of vanilla, cashmere wood, and musk. It feels elevated and sexy — a perfect date night perfume. I wore it to a fancy dinner date with my fiancé and felt so confident and beautiful all night. (The right perfume can totally transform your mood and energy.) As it dried down, the warm, sweet amber-y notes lingered. I also love the burgundy chocolate bar-inspired bottle, which stands out in my perfume wardrobe and has a satisfying magnetic closure. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sabrina-carpenter-hair-eras-tour-perfume"">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, the sound of the summer <em>and</em> budding fragrance mogul?

This smells like the last heady days of summer: heatwaves, eating fresh cherries on the lawn, woodsmoke in the air from distant barbecues, and listening to Lana Del Rey on repeat. Lovefest Burning Cherry is heady and sweet without being cloying or sickly thanks to the spicy, warm, woody base of palo santo, patchouli, and guaiac wood, and fresh, fruity top notes of cherry and raspberry. It’s definitely the sexiest fragrance in my arsenal and my go-to when I want to boost my confidence. A date once described me as smelling like a fancy cherry liqueur and whisky cocktail, served in an expensive glass tumbler at an oak-panelled bar, so I’ll take that as a good sign that it’s doing its job!” <em>— Esther Newman</em><br /><br /><strong>Kayali</strong> LOVEFEST Burning Cherry | 48 Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Flovefest-eau-de-parfum-intense-P501018"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1536"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776599.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1536&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=2:3"" width=""1024"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zara.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcherry-bomb-edp-90-ml--3-04-fl--oz--p20120653.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zara Cherry Bomb</a>, $22.90</h2></strong><br /><br /><strong>“</strong>If I could exist solely on a diet of <a href=""https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/opies-cocktail-cherries/550502-77815-77816"">Opies cherries</a> — the kind that mixologists always stir into an Old Fashioned — I would. Sadly, this is neither nutritious nor cost-effective, so failing that, I want to smell like them. This fragrance hits the nail on the head at first spritz. Like those luminous red cherries, it’s zingy, sweet, and moreish, and smells exactly like a maraschino-steeped cocktail. The issue with most cherry perfumes, though, is that the zinginess doesn’t last too long. However, that’s not entirely a bad thing. This dries down to something sweet and delicate — like hints of cherry with subtle florals. The staying power is impressive for a high-street perfume at this price; I could still smell it on my wrists hours later but it lasts much longer on clothes. Thanks to its lightness I think this would make for a better spring scent. I want something deeper and more brooding for fall and winter. But that’s where Creed’s Carmina and Kayali’s Lovefest Burning Cherry come in…” — <em>Jacqueline Kilikita</em><br /><br /><strong>Zara</strong> Cherry Bomb 90 ML, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zara.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcherry-bomb-90-ml-p20120653.html"">Zara</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1500"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776608.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=1500&amp;height=1500&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1500"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Flost-cherry-P436489%3FskuId%3D2369213"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Ford Lost Cherry Eau de Parfum</a>, $255</h2></strong><br /><br />“This is perhaps the most iconic cherry perfume out of the bunch. Since its 2018 release, it kickstarted a craze for not-so-simple, not-so-saccharine-sweet cherry scents, and rather grown-up, elegant, and complex fragrances. To me, this is a delectable cherry cocktail in perfume form. Up top, you have the first sip of black cherry and cherry liqueur, which makes way for the rich and intoxicating mix of bitter almond, warm vanilla, roasted tonka bean, and cinnamon. As such, it’s less of a straight cherry perfume compared to some others on this list, and perhaps not the one for you if you want that long-lasting cherry scent following you all day. Still, it has a real irresistible draw — an almost edible richness that has you wanting more and more (again, just like a great cocktail).” <em>— Esther Newman</em><br /><br /><strong>Tom Ford</strong> Lost Cherry Eau de Parfum 30ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP436489"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1500"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776614.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=1500&amp;height=1500&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1500"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://www.sephora.com/product/yves-saint-laurent-black-opium-eau-de-parfum-over-red-P509702"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Over Red Eau de Parfum</a>, $130</h2></strong><br /><br />“As someone who doesn’t even like eating cherries, I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this cherry-heavy perfume. You can immediately catch the juicy cherry upon the first spray, but it quickly transforms from a fruity gourmand to a sensual floral, thanks to notes of jasmine and orange blossoms. It then develops into something muskier after drying down, with the base notes of vanilla and patchouli warming up my skin. This is also when the sweet whiffs of coffee beans emerge. It smells nothing like the medicinal cherry flavoring you get in your cough syrup as a child, but rather, a bold gourmand fragrance that has several interesting identities. I can’t help but smell my wrists whenever I have it on.” <em>— Venus Wong, Senior Writer</em><br /><br /><strong>Yves Saint Laurent</strong> Black Opium Over Red Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fyves-saint-laurent-black-opium-eau-de-parfum-over-red-P509702"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1600"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776629.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1600&amp;height=1600&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1600"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fcherry-ambition-eau-de-parfum-P508411"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The 7 Virtues Cherry Ambition Eau de Parfum</a>, $94</h2></strong><br /><strong>“</strong>This is a sexy and sophisticated cherry scent. Alongside the cherry, there are sweet florals, vanilla, then amber and woodsy notes for balance. I adore a fragrance that balances femininity with earthy grit — to me, that is what makes it sexy and sophisticated. The catch? Usually, these kinds of scents wear full-bodied on me, so I was expecting this to come with a powerful throw based on first impressions. Cherry Ambition, however, turns to a gentler, near-skin scent after a couple of hours of wear. I don’t mind that, though; it makes it appropriate for everyday settings, like an office, rather than being a fragrance I’d save purely for the nighttime. Another thing to note is how stunning the packaging is. I love how on the back of the bottle you get a recommendation as to what the fragrance is best for: “Feeling brave, igniting ambition, making a statement”. I might not manage to feel these things every day, but a few sprays of this on my neck and wrists bring me a step closer.” <em>— Tanyel Mustafa</em><br /><br /><strong>The 7 Virtues</strong> Cherry Ambition Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP508411"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""1970"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776635.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1970&amp;height=1970&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""1970"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcreed-carmina-eau-de-parfum%2F7561368"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Creed Carmina Eau de Parfum</a>, $310</h2></strong><br /><br />“Forget everything you think you know about cherry perfumes. This wonderfully complex scent from The House of Creed is so much more than that. Yes, you can catch a whiff of dark cherries in the opening note, but overall, it reminds me more of an expensive, artfully put-together bouquet. The breaths of rose de mai, violet, and peonies are so vivid that this might not be your kind of scent if you’re not into florals. I happen to absolutely love how this intensely feminine scent fills the room. It makes me feel so sultry and grown up, like I’m wandering around in a slinky velvet gown. As with all Creed perfumes, the price is steep, but the gorgeous bottles are a work of art — and just two spritzes on each wrist are enough for the scent to linger on your skin all day.” <em>— Venus Wong</em><br /><br /><strong>Carmina</strong> Carmina Eau de Parfum 30ml, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2Fcarmina-eau-de-parfum%2F7561368"">Nordstom</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img height=""582"" src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11776644.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;width=582&amp;height=582&amp;quality=85&amp;crop=1:1"" width=""582"" /><figcaption><strong><h2><a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fjuliette-has-a-gun-juliette-eau-de-parfum-P510656%3FskuId%3D2741023"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Juliette Has A Gun Juliette Eau de Parfum</a>, $115</h2></strong><h2><br /></h2><br />“This is unlike any other cherry perfume I’ve tried, and that’s probably because I can’t really smell any cherry. Supposedly, the cherry note is up top, but it's dominated by pink peppercorn, opening sharp and zingy. Dare I say it, it almost smells medicinal at first, but this quickly dries down to a light, soapy musk (thanks to the mix of jasmine and cashmere). Just like your skin fresh out of the shower, this is definitely one of those ‘your skin but better scents’. Personally, it’s not for me, and I would probably advise steering clear if you’re after a true juicy-sweet cherry perfume, but for anyone who likes fresh, clean, musky fragrances, you’re in the right place.” <em>— Esther Newman</em><br /><br /><strong>Juliette Has A Gun</strong> Juliette Eau de Parfum, $, available at <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com/?id=30283X879131&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fjuliette-has-a-gun-juliette-eau-de-parfum-P510656"">Sephora</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Like what you see?
