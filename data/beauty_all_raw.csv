<p><strong><em>Spoilers ahead</em></strong>: There’s a moment in <em>56 Days</em> when the show’s central con is revealed: Ciara (Dove Cameron) didn’t meet Oliver (Avan Jogia) by chance at the supermarket. She planned it. She’d been watching him, taking <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/bring-back-physical-photo-albums"">photos</a>, keeping notes. She orchestrated the entire encounter to get close to a man she had reason to hate. By any definition, this is manipulation. This is the setup for a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/what-is-love-bombing"">love bombing</a> scenario, or worse. And yet, by the end of the show, we’re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together. To build a life and to have their happy ending.</p>



<p>Dove Cameron is aware of this contradiction. When asked directly if audiences will excuse the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/green-flags-not-red-flags-dating-relationships"">red flags</a> both characters exhibit, she doesn’t hesitate: “I don’t think they’ll excuse any of it. They shouldn’t.” But then she pauses, because she knows what actually happens.</p>



<h3>The attractiveness loophole</h3>



<p>There’s this recurring theme in <em>56 Days</em>: one where Oliver does something genuinely alarming, or Ciara reveals another layer of her deception, and the camera lingers on their faces. Both of them are beautiful, the tension is unbearable, and somewhere in that moment, the audience’s moral objections start to soften.</p>



<p>“I don’t think the audience will completely brush it off,” Cameron says when asked about whether attractiveness gives characters a pass. She’s repeating herself because she knows it’s not true. Or rather, she knows the nuance: audiences <em>shouldn’t</em> excuse it, but they will. “But I do think they’ll start to excuse it more and more as it is clear that they’re both exhibiting red flags,” she continues. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I think when the playing field gets more levelled, it’ll be like, oh, so these two are just fucked up. They’re perfect for each other.</p><cite>DOVE CAMERON</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This is the moment the show wins; the psychological shift happens for the audience when both people are compromised equally. When neither one is the victim, and neither one is the villain, audiences stop trying to pick a side. And in that refusal to judge, they actually end up rooting for the <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/dating-trends-tinder-2026"">relationship</a>, not despite the red flags, but because of them.</p>



<h3>The con works because we want it to</h3>



<p>Ciara’s plan to get revenge on Oliver, the man she believes destroyed her family, doesn’t survive first contact with reality. She falls for him, or she decides to love him anyway. The show intentionally leaves this deliberately ambiguous. But what’s not ambiguous is what happens next: she kills his abusive therapist to protect him and then she chooses him and they run. Oliver, meanwhile, carries his own devastating secret: he killed someone in high school and let his best friend take the fall. Oliver’s been living a lie his entire life, with his abusive therapist weaponising that secret to control him.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961024.png?width=1024&amp;height=538&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A269"" /></figure>



<p>Neither of them is redeemable in any conventional sense; both have done deeply unforgivable things. And yet the show ends with them together, with a child, living in hiding. Not because they’ve been punished or because they’ve atoned, but because they’ve chosen each other.</p>



<p>That confusion in that inability to pin down who’s hurting whom, who’s the predator and who’s the prey, is precisely where the audience’s judgment collapses. We’re not meant to figure it out; we’re meant to accept the ambiguity, and we do. Because they’re beautiful and they’re damaged in interesting ways, where we as the audience almost want to save them. But to be blunt, that’s because they’re hot and the chemistry between them is undeniable.</p>



<h3>The moral we’re actually learning</h3>



<p>The uncomfortable truth <em>56 Days</em> presents is this: we say we want to identify red flags and that we want to protect ourselves from manipulation. But when presented with two attractive, deeply flawed people who are essentially destroying each other and everyone around them, we don’t actually want to look away, and we don’t necessarily want them to be held accountable.</p>



<p>Cameron’s honesty about this is refreshing. She doesn’t pretend the show is teaching us something virtuous. She doesn’t argue that we <em>should</em> root for these characters. She just acknowledges what’s actually happening: “I think that’s when we’ll get into a zone of more, like, I have no idea who’s got the upper hand here.” Jogia agrees and goes further. “You can have all the red flags in the world, but sometimes it doesn’t matter who they are,” he says. “In some cases, they usually go hand in hand with a real connection.”</p>



<p>Jogia points out that he’s not saying to ignore the flags, he’s highlighting that the presence of red flags doesn’t automatically disqualify a relationship from being real. That genuine feeling can coexist with genuine danger, and that when both people are compromised, when both are beautiful and broken in the same ways, the red flags become almost irrelevant to whether we believe in the connection. We reach a point where the question of who’s manipulating whom stops mattering. And at that point of moral surrender, the show achieves something genuinely dark: it makes us complicit in the fiction that love, real, genuine love, can exist in a space of pure mutual corruption.</p>



<p>Maybe it can. Maybe that’s even true in real life, sometimes. But <em>56 Days</em> doesn’t let us off easy by pretending it’s beautiful. It just shows us that we’ll accept it anyway. As long as everyone involved is attractive enough.</p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961059.jpg?width=853&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=853%3A1024"" /></figure></div>



<p>Hearing about your friends’ <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/relationships"">dating lives</a> can be juicy and exciting, whether you’re a teenager in your first blush of romance or a grown woman reminding your group chat about what they deserve. It can also be heartbreaking, discouraging — and particularly if you’re a Latina who lives at several intersections of identity — terrifying. </p>



<p>That’s how I felt in 2002, when at the age of 16, I had just learned about the brutal murder of a 17-year-old <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/06/11434832/transgender-latina-beauty-pageant-contestants"">trans Latina</a> named <a href=""https://abc7news.com/post/who-is-gwen-araujo-timeline-documentary-transgender-murder/12451079/"">Gwen Araujo</a>. Reading the gruesome details of how young cis men with whom she’d been sexually active with killed her because she was trans shook me to my core forever. I often imagined her fate would inevitably be my future — that not only being a Boricua, not only being a woman, but also being a trans woman would prove itself to be perilous as I navigated the still-new-to-me world of dating and the cisgender men who populate it. </p>



<p>Why would I put myself out there when the stakes are so high? But then again, wouldn’t you do the same in the effort to find the love you’ve always felt you deserved?</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Multiple studies have found that <a href=""https://illumin.usc.edu/swipe-by-color-the-pitfalls-of-online-dating-for-women-of-color/"">online dating is statistically worse for women of color</a>. And dating while trans and Latina comes with unique and often systemically violent challenges. The stereotypes abound: that we’re all sex workers; that we’re little more than a fetish for closeted, cisgender men; that we’re not seeking love or partnership, or, just as hurtful, that we’re not worth it. I’ve downloaded <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/latine-dating-apps-successful-stories-couples"">dating apps</a> with a full heart and hope that I could find love in a truly hopeless place, but cisgender men have taken it upon themselves to degrade and demoralize me at every turn. Rather than offering me a simple, “Hello, how are you?” I’m often met with, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CCHHNEgn791/?img_index=1"">“How much?”</a></p>



<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961089.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=628&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=256%3A157"" /></figure></div>



<p>When putting myself out there in the dating pool, I run the constant risk of exposing myself to prejudice (such as being labeled the “spicy” Latina), misogyny, and transmisia that runs rampant on dating apps. I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure. It’s daunting and exhaustive, to put it mildly, and I’m sure you understand why I delete the apps as quickly as I download them.</p>



<p>Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person, just as all Latinas do. And it begins with our communities dismantling the assumptions it makes and perpetuates about me and my sisters — and with holding Latino men to a higher standard, one that holds them accountable to the harm they cause and the inner work they need to do.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’m also put in direct contact with cis men who have historically voted my rights away, strip me of my bodily autonomy, and align themselves with hateful ideologies while simultaneously seeking to take advantage of my body for their pleasure.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>To be clear, I recognize that cis women have it bad on dating apps, too. Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent. Our hair, our bodies, and our skin tones are sacred, representative of the diversity of our Latinidad, and should be treated as such. Yet there’s an added layer of exploitation that trans women are forced to endure — and it’s utterly violating.</p>



<p>I’ve sifted through hundreds of messages from complete strangers who feel comfortable enough expressing that they’d like to “try me for their ‘first time,’” as if I’m a chemistry set to be experimented with rather than the human being that I am. Forget “Hi, how are you?” or “What are you up to?” as predictable, if boring, openers. I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires. The number of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DIQUENauYxl/?img_index=7"">unsolicited nudes</a> I’ve received truly cannot be counted, despite clear warnings in my bio and in messages to not send such photos. </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961090.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=978&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=512%3A489"" /></figure>



<p>It’s a problem the apps are aware of: A new law in the U.K. mandates that <a href=""https://www.the-independent.com/bulletin/news/cyberflashing-law-dating-apps-social-media-b2896534.html"">dating apps have to block these photos</a> and Bumble <a href=""https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/bumble-unsolicited-lewd-nude-images-virginia-texas"">has published advocacy work </a>about such sexual harassment, but am I hopeful that things will change? Not particularly. The LGBTQ-focused dating app Grindr also <a href=""https://help.grindr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008783953-Consent?_gl=1*guunkc*_ga*MTMwMTY0MDkxOS4xNzcwNTM0MTc1*_ga_3ZJKH4GWHP*czE3NzA1MzQxNzQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzA1MzQzMTYkajU0JGwwJGgw"">boasts about the importance of consent</a> and highlights the predatory nature of <a href=""https://www.grindr.com/blog/unsolicited-dick-pic"">unsolicited nudes</a>, yet <a href=""https://www.attitude.co.uk/uncategorised/grindr-must-to-do-more-to-crack-down-on-illegal-unsolicited-nudes-404274/"">the app is still rife</a> with cis men preying upon users seeking deeper connections than just the physical. I’m often left feeling as though there are no safe spaces for me to seek out a monogamous relationship without the risk of being sexually harassed, which can feel extraordinarily lonely.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Latinas, like all other women, deserve the truest forms of love, compassion, safety, and care from our partners. Our heritage is not a crux, nor a deterrent, nor a fetish inviting men to sexualize our bodies without our consent.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that’s only the latest layer of anti-transness I’ve been subjected to throughout my life, particularly given that I grew up as a hyper-feminine child with a penchant for Disney princess films and pop divas like my idol, Christina Aguilera. Both my Puerto Rican household and the broader neighborhood I grew up in — a low-income, primarily Black and brown corner of East Harlem in New York City — prioritized <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2023/08/11487974/hulu-film-miguel-wants-to-fight-challenges-machismo"">machismo</a> over all else. I never felt the safety or permission to embrace my most authentic self, not in my neighborhood, neither in school, and certainly not in my own home. I cried, prayed, begged, and pleaded for acceptance, but, instead, I was met with denial and physical abuse.</p>



<p>It’s the sort of machismo that has historically shamed young Latine men and boys when they express human emotions. The kind that pressures Black and brown boys to be hyper-masculine, hardened, and brimming with toxicity while demanding that women and girls  “know their place.” The kind that expects women to prioritize having children and cooking for the man of the house above all else, fully ignoring the reality that some cisgender <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/16/josh-hawley-senate-hearing-abortion-pills-men-pregnant/88198354007/"">women aren’t able to have children</a>, and some simply don’t want to. </p>



<p>It’s a stereotype that is as damaging to men as it is to women. Men and boys of color are never given permission to cry, to be soft, to embrace the divine feminine. It’s the sort of harm that informs and impacts the way cis men treat women. It’s the kind of violence that is deadly to both trans and cis women.</p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“I’ve received messages about lurid fantasies without my consent, and have been repeatedly dehumanized and denied intimacy, and told that my life does not matter if not for what my body can do to satisfy cis men’s desires.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It’s also, hopefully, on the way out: A survey published by the Pew Research Center in 2024<a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/12/17/what-u-s-latinos-say-about-machismo/""> found</a> that 73% of respondents don’t like machismo. They overwhelmingly said that the concept is a bad thing. The intersection of machismo and anti-trans sentiment is less studied, but the overwhelming emphasis that machismo is related to masculinity and gender-based roles is plenty damning. That only one in five people who are aware of machismo and admit to operating among those guidelines is all the proof you need that this isn’t a trait to uphold or celebrate.</p>



<p>Still, it’s a factor that likely contributed to some of the worst encounters of my life — of the man who asked me out when I was 17, only to sexually assault me several times. Of the messages I received on early online dating sites like TSDating and Craigslist’s romance section, where my inboxes were inundated with propositions for sex, unsolicited nude photos, and graphic details of what these men wanted to subject to me. Of the dates gone sour, like the man who later admitted to fetishizing my transness and the complete prince who was scared of what other people thought.</p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11961091.jpg?width=769&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=769%3A1024"" /></figure>



<p>No doubt some of these men are emboldened by the current political climate and U.S. President Donald Trump, a <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/anniversary-hush-money-conviction-trump-continues-fight-criminal/story?id=122325361"">convicted felon</a> who was also found <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">liable of sexual abuse</a>. No doubt the current administration’s single-minded efforts to <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-transgender-laws-asylum-persecution-canada-b2832107.html"">demonize and</a> <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/trump-admin-fbi-trans-nihilistic-violent-extremists-terrorist"">criminalize</a> trans, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, two-spirit, and other queer human beings only furthers a catastrophe of blatant hatred and violence toward us. (Trump’s re-election campaign spent <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5188573/transgender-gender-affirming-care-trump-abortion-hyde-amendment?utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawPt8_BleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFYZ2lmS1pOM1Q4R0lBN0lDc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHu3jGKzjebu4QuanTFV1ik114RUc3G0N_v96b4xZy7mFt968nLIvnZUz3SQI_aem_7dHoE05RaW_kuMDBc0Pxwg"">$222 million on anti-trans ads</a> during the 2024 election cycle, which sadly resonated with Americans on all sides.) And no doubt the constant efforts to smear us as “groomers,” or as the cause of societal moral unraveling is meaningfully and irreparably violent. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse.”</p><cite>ANGELICA CHRISTINA</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Add all of this to the fact that, statistically, <a href=""https://chprc.org/publications/fatal-violence-against-black-transgender-women-in-the-united-states/"">Black trans women</a> and other trans women of color are impacted by violence and murder at staggering rates. We’re brutally targeted on a daily basis by the same cis men and women who oversexualize us, as proven by Pornhub’s 2025 Year in Review: Trans porn was rated <a href=""https://www.pornhub.com/insights/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1_pornhub-insights-2025-year-in-review-most-viewed-categories-worldwide.png"">the second-most viewed category</a> on their website.</p>



<p>For most of my life, I’ve longed for connection, intimacy, romance, and kindness from potential partners. Far too often, I’ve watched longingly as my friends and chosen family have found love in the most unlikely places, only to feel left behind myself. I’ve dreamed of finding my príncipe azul, my ride-or-die guy, my person. I’ve fantasized about what a dream date would look like — a lovely candlelight dinner paired with a glass of wine and effortless conversation  — and about traveling to far-off destinations. I’d love nothing more than to have a partner that buys me flowers just because it’s Sunday, and a relationship built on trust and intimacy. I long to be courted, romanced, and perhaps even married someday.</p>



<p>What I don’t want is a man to instantly degrade me when learning that I’m trans — an identity that I’m proud of, but one that isn’t an invitation for harassment or abuse. I deserve someone who sees me for more than the oversexualized stigmas and preconceived notions that follow trans women, Latinas, and those of us who live at the intersection like a plague. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>“Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person.

<p>As an activist and advocate with a platform, my life’s work is rooted in fighting for trans rights. We’re human beings deserving of love, care, and compassion. That extends beyond politics, to community care and romantic relationships. Trans Latinas deserve better in dating, both online and in person. My sisters and I deserve safety and trust. We deserve the kind of love that lasts a lifetime. And it begins with our communities dismantling the false assumptions it makes and perpetuates about us. It requires holding the older generations to account when they make an offhand remark, and challenging the men in our lives when they say bigoted things. We are not anyone’s teachers, therapists, or sex workers. The deeper, inner work of healing and being better men is yours to address and yours alone. We should demand more action from the dating apps, and we need to hold politicians to account for the hate they perpetuate.</p>



<p>Even in my darkest moments, I always come back to the belief that someday, I will find my person. That I will find the kind of love that heals generational wounds, the kind where machismo cannot bloom.<br /></p>

<p><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cara-delevingne"">Cara Delevingne</a> just told me I have “fantastic brows,” and I’m not okay. Well, that’s not entirely true: I’m genuinely overwhelmed with joy at the compliment, and not only because Cara Delevingne is <em>my </em>brow icon — <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eyebrows"">brows</a> are her ultimate beauty signature. (In my mind, this is akin to if Michaelangelo complimented me at a Paint &amp; Sip.)  </p>



<p>The L’Oréal ambassador and multi-hyphenate has had a packed schedule as of late, including attending the recent <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wuthering-heights-margot-robbie-alison-oliver-interview""><em>Wuthering Heights</em></a> premiere to support her friend Margot Robbie. “I’ve seen it twice,” she gushes, adding that while she doesn’t typically love period films, the beauty moments were nothing short of mesmerizing. “Margot’s skin and freckles are so gorgeous, and that dewy kind of half-sweat, half-fog from the moors kind of thing, was just so incredible.” (No disagreement there.)  </p>



<p>Ahead, Refinery29 chats with Delevingne about her current makeup and skincare must-haves, beauty philosophy, and why sisterhood is more important than ever. </p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h2><strong>Her back-to-basics skincare routine </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne has been a runway mainstay since the 2010s, and has been public about her own skin journey, ranging from <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/cara-delevingne-psoriasis-met-gala"">psoriasis flareups</a> to adult acne. These days, she says, less is much more — a sort of pendulum effect of years of a “really intense way of doing things,” earlier in her career, as she puts it, with elaborate, multi-step skincare routines: “Now, I just wash my face and use the <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/revitalift-15-pure-hyaluronic-acid-serum-pimprod2001763?sku=2534685"">[L’Oréal] Revitalift serum</a>, give myself a little lymphatic massage, and drain all that nonsense out my face.” Cut to us both on Zoom, demonstrating our favorite techniques; I’m partial to using my fingertips to glide from between the brows down to the cheekbones, and sweeping along jawline to relieve tension and temporarily depuff. </p>



<h2><strong>Her ultimate brow styling hack </strong></h2>



<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve been genuinely floored by a beauty hack, but Delevingne’s takes the cake, IMO. “For a long time — way before I even worked with L’Oréal — I would always use <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/elnett-extra-strong-unscented-hairspray-xlsImpprod4180679?sku=2241495"">Elnett</a> [hairspray] on my brows because it reminded me of my granny,” she tells me. “I’d just get a little mascara wand and put it on [the bristles].” (Editor’s note: I can confirm this indeed, works like a charm.) However, if you prefer to stick to <em>actual </em>gels Delevingne and I both swear by <a href=""https://www.ulta.com/p/infallible-up-24h-brow-lamination-pimprod2045478?sku=2625593"">L’Oréal’s Infallible Brow Lamination gel</a>. It’s especially great for naturally thick brows since it delivers all-day hold but doesn’t feel crunchy, nor does it leave visible, dandruff-like residue that shows up in darker brows like mine. And it seems Delevingne agrees: “I think if I laminated my brows, they would look crazy since I already trim them a lot, but I love the lamination gel.” </p>



<h2><strong>What “I’m Worth It” means to her </strong></h2>



<p>Delevingne is refreshingly candid about discussing her career, but absolutely lights up when speaking about the philanthropic work she gets to witness as part of <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/women-of-worth"">L’Oréal’s Women of Worth</a> — a mission-driven initiative inspired by the brand’s iconic tagline. “I think especially right now when gender equality and women’s rights are being taken away and stripped back so much, [it’s inspiring] to be able to bring something that isn’t fear and bad news,” she says of the program, which awards ten monetary grants of $25,000 to non-profits grounded in female empowerment. “I remember going to my first [Women of Worth] event back in 2024, and I can’t tell you how inspired and blown away I was by all of them,” she says. “And [when] people asked me, ‘Which one touched you the most?<em>”</em><em>’</em> I was like, ‘Which one didn’t?’” (Facts!) </p>



<h2><strong>Discovering beauty on her own terms </strong></h2>



<p>In typical Delevingne fashion, the model is having more fun than ever when it comes to beauty — and making it her own. “Growing up as a girl that didn’t love very feminine things like clothes and makeup, I didn’t have an appreciation for it when I was modeling in the same way that I do now,” she says. “When I had space to explore and figure out my own style, my own way of doing makeup, it’s like I’ve experienced what most girls go through as a teenager in my 20s and 30s — it’s that second coming of being a woman.” </p>



<h2><strong>Her role as a L’Oréal ambassador </strong></h2>



<p>Having walked countless runways around the world, Delevingne is right at home at a fashion show — but nothing compared to the experience of being in <a href=""https://www.lorealparisusa.com/loreal-paris-x-paris-fashion-week"">L’Oréal’s Le Défile</a>, which has taken place at Paris Fashion Week for two years in a row. “When I was doing fashion shows, I definitely felt nervous and alone, but in that lineup, you have other people lift you up and do the same for others,” she says. “I’m in the lineup next to Jane Fonda talking about the things that scare us most, about lessons that we’ve learned and how important female friendship is.” </p>



<h2><strong>How beauty plays a role when acting (and her love of liquid liner) </strong></h2>



<p>From <em>Paper Towns</em> to <em><a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/09/10649938/only-murders-in-the-building-cast-cameos"">Only Murders In The Building</a></em> (in addition to several other projects currently in the works), Delevingne has been busy honing her craft as an actor and utilizing beauty in her process. “When you’re playing a character, I try to think of what scent that person would wear or what little makeup thing that they are really tied to,” she says. “For me as a person, I love doing a cat eye with liquid eyeliner, because I’m good at drawing. So being able to think about that for a character is always so fun, and I think it’s such a good tool to get into that [mindset].” </p>

<p><strong>Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?</strong><br />Yes — both my mom and dad have degrees. I remember my dad studying for his bachelor’s degree when I was a kid, so he could make more money for our family. They always told us we needed to go to college and would help as much as they could. I loved science in school, so after graduating high school, I enrolled in engineering. Everyone always gave me advice to make “practical choices”, so I chose the school that gave me the most scholarships even though it wasn’t exciting. It worked out because COVID happened half way through my college experience, so going to an expensive out-of-state school would have felt like a waste. My parents helped me by sending me money when I needed it, but I took on the bulk of the expenses. I also received some Pell grants after my dad passed away during my junior year of college. <br /><br /><strong>Growing up, what kind of conversations did you have about money? Did your parent(s) educate you about finances?</strong><br />They always stressed the importance of saving money and the difference between wants and needs. There was definitely some fighting behind closed doors and stressors, but they never let it affect my brother and me too much. I didn’t really learn anything about retirement savings or investing until I graduated college, which was a mix of teaching myself and advice from my mom. My mom was an educator at a private elementary school so she was criminally underpaid. My dad was the primary breadwinner for our family and would get stressed by finances, so my mom handled them.<br /><br /><strong>What was your first job and why did you get it?</strong><br />I did some babysitting/dog sitting from age 13. But my first “on the books” job was when I was 16, working for minimum wage at the mall. It was mainly for buying myself “trendy clothes”, to do things with friends and gas money. <br /><br /><strong>Did you worry about money growing up?</strong><br />No, if they did, they hid it from us. There was one time my dad got laid off but it didn’t last long because they hired him back two weeks later. We were comfortably middle class and my brother and I never went without our needs being met. We didn’t get most of our wants unless it was Christmas or our birthday. We could afford luxuries like family vacations but they were always on the frugal side, like camping and road trips. <br /><br /><strong>Do you worry about money now?</strong><br />Yes and no. Yes, as in I used to be a lot more disciplined in savings/investing, but after I went through a messy breakup with a long-term boyfriend I have entered my chaotic spending era. I have been more conscious about my spending lately and have been ramping it down. No, as in I know I am very lucky to have a decently paying tech job in this job market, and I have a lot of time in the future to save and invest. These days, I’m trying to balance my ‘fun spending’ with saving for the future. They’ve had a lot of layoffs at my company but my position is pretty secure as my work is a high priority — but you never know what can happen. <br /><br /><strong>At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?</strong><br />At 24, when I got my first ‘big girl job’ and moved out of my mom’s house. I have my emergency fund that I contribute to every month that I would use if I lost my job. I know I could always move back in with my mom if necessary but I’d never ask her for money. In unfortunate events, she received a large sum of money when my dad passed from his life insurance policy. I’m so grateful she has that to rely on for retirement even though we would all rather have my dad here.<br /><br /><strong>Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income? If yes, please explain.</strong><br />When I was 18, my parents gave me the used car my dad drove. When I got in an accident I used the insurance payout for a downpayment on my new car. My mom has told me she has $10k saved for me that she would give me to help pay for a wedding or buy a house, but I have done neither of those things yet.</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day One</strong>: Monday</h3>



<p>9:00 a.m. — My alarm goes off. I had a busy weekend so I’m very drained. I scroll in bed until 9:25 when I go to log in for my iteration planning meeting, and run a comb through my hair so I don’t look like a mess on camera.</p>



<p>9:50 a.m. — Meeting done. Go make my bed/start some laundry and let the cats out on their catio. I eat my cookie dough overnight oats that I prepped the night before and make some black vanilla tea.  </p>



<p>12 p.m. — My friends are texting me about the <em>Love Island Reunion</em> watch parties tonight. I send them some places that look good and we agree on one. I go wash my face/brush my teeth (I have gotten in the horrible habit of doing this at noon — don’t judge). The cats get their lunch of wet food and I put some bacon in the oven for sandwiches. The catio gets closed for the day because it is too hot to have it open past noon during the Texas summer. </p>



<p>1:05 p.m. — I make a turkey club sandwich and eat while continuing to work. I see a mandatory meeting at 10 p.m. that pops up and I audibly sigh. I never have meetings this late, but we are pushing something to prod that I have been assisting on that is not part of my usual work. Luckily, the place we decided on for the watch party is 10 minutes from me.</p>



<p>2:45 p.m. — I get a text from my mom about the total from a lamp making workshop we did this past weekend. I send her my half. <strong>$140</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I finish up my work for the day and the preparations for the prod deployment tonight. I go to my apartment gym for a quick leg day.</p>



<p>5 p.m. — Done with the gym. Once home I make a protein smoothie and shower. I do my makeup and blow-dry my hair. Trying to fit with the <em>Love Island</em> theme, I wear a tropical print skirt and a tube top with my Doc Marten sandals. </p>



<p>6:30 p.m. — I get to the place with my friend S. We meet our other friend M. there. We order Happy Hour drinks and $7 quesadillas. I feel bad for the bartender because he’s the only one working and seems very unprepared to serve the hoards of women coming in. I leave a $5 tip. $<strong>19.04</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m. — Unfortunately, the reunion is two hours long so I have to dip out early. S. says she will get a ride from M. I feel kinda meh about the whole reunion and am burnt out of <em>Love Island</em> news. I will definitely still be tuning into some social media discourse later, though. </p>



<p>10 p.m. — I get on my work call, which goes very smoothly. It ends in 20 minutes, which I’m happy about. I get comfy on my couch and finish the last 30 minutes of the reunion and then scroll X/Reddit for too long to read discourse. </p>



<p>11:30 p.m. — I get up to go shower (I can not get into bed without showering right before) and do my nighttime routine. I read my book, <em>The Writing Retreat</em> by Julia Bartz. I just started and I’m getting very invested in it. I try to go to bed at midnight but my messed-up sleep schedule doesn’t let me fall asleep until 1:30 p.m.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $159.04</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Two</strong>: Tuesday </h3>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I feel pretty well rested, despite the late bedtime. I log in to work and answer some emails. After my daily team standup, I go make some scrambled eggs and a yogurt bowl with raspberries and chocolate chips. I try a new brand of chocolate chips from Aldi and I’m not a fan. I guess it’s back to the seven dollar bags of Ghirardelli chips. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — My cats are staring at me like they are being starved, so take a break to feed them. I fold my clean clothes from yesterday and get my life in order.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — After being trapped in a Teams exchange for too long, I go make a turkey club. It’s not brutally hot, so the cats are happily snoozing in their catio. I envy them.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — I go to my apartment’s coworking area because I need a change of scenery. It’s pretty empty and quiet, so I hunker down to do some testing.</p>



<p>4:30 p.m. — I finish up and decide to call it a day. I go to the mall near me to hunt for a new swimsuit. I have been wearing the same two I already have, so I want something new for a few pool-related events I’m attending. I end up in Dillard’s and find several good options that are 65% off. I finally decide on a green floral print one and two tops from the clearance rack. $<strong>69.17</strong></p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — After walking around the mall, I end up back in Dillard’s shoe section. I find a super cute pair of chunky black fisherman sandals for $<strong>56.84</strong> in the clearance section. My emo heart can’t resist, so I get them.</p>



<p>6:10 p.m — Once home I eat some leftover baked black bean tacos with avocado and sour cream on the side. I do the brain-rotting combo of scrolling TikTok with the TV playing YouTube videos in the background. I do this until I have to leave for my pole classes. </p>



<p>8 p.m. — Arrive at the pole studio and greet a few friends. I’m doing a flexibility class and then a Russian exotic class. The studio I go to is a bit of a drive, so I justify it by doing back-to-back classes. </p>



<p>10:15 p.m. — Finish up the second class and have a convo with a friend about our relationship/life woes. I also find our Russian exotic teacher is probably going to move next year and am very sad. At least we get one more year!</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Home. I make a protein smoothie and some popcorn and watch an episode of <em>Dandandan</em> while snacking. I shower and do my night routine. I continue reading my book until I fall asleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $126.01</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Three: Wednesday</strong></h3>



<p>9 a.m — My alarm goes off and I log into my workspace. I join our quarterly connections meeting with the whole department. I let it play in the background while I make some scrambled eggs and frozen waffles. I also make a green tea. </p>



<p>11:20 a.m. — I order a 48-pack of wet food off Chewy for my older cat. Unfortunately, she is bougie and only eats one specific type, unlike my younger cat, who will eat anything. They both get half wet food and half dry food from their automatic feeder. $<strong>68.17</strong></p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — We have a vendor meeting about one of our applications we manage. The meeting goes well, but we have an end-of-month deadline for this, which seems like it will be easy to finish by. </p>



<p>11:50 a.m. — My younger cat catches a cicada and brings it inside to try to eat. I rescue it from her and throw it back outside where it lives to see another day. She seems very disappointed that she didn’t get to enjoy her disgusting snack.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I eat the last of my black bean tacos and have a Waterloo Cherry Limeade, too. I put on <em>Vanderpump Rules</em> for background noise while I eat/work. My friend shared her Peacock account with me on the condition that I watch <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>.</p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — Log off for the day. Get changed for my pole class and leave.</p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">7 p.m. — I’m done with the first class, which was a cardio dance class. I always feel a little cringe during this class but it is fun. I have an hour and a half to kill before my second class, so I head over to my mom’s house — she lives five minutes away.</p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — Eat dinner with my mom and her boyfriend. He made a delicious Mediterranean salmon with a strawberry salad and it feels nice to have someone make me a meal. My mom and I take her dog on a walk.</p>



<p>8:30 p.m. — Back to the studio for my second class. On the way back, I stop to fill up my car. Everyone says not to pole after eating but I’m the opposite; I can’t pole on an empty stomach. <strong>$36.27</strong></p>



<p>10:30 p.m. — Get home and I’m super beat. I shower and make some herbal tea plus a Greek yogurt dessert bowl. I play on my Nintendo Switch for a bit before switching to my book. I get a little too invested and read for too long. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $104.44</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Four</strong>: Thursday</h3>



<p>7:05 a.m. — I wake up to my younger cat having a huge fit. She beefs with any cat she sees outside and doesn’t understand they can’t get to her. I let her out of my bedroom and try to go back to sleep. </p>



<p>9 a.m. — My alarm goes off and I can’t tell if I actually fell asleep again or not. My shoulders feel like they’ve been hit by a bus; today is definitely a rest day. I get up and log on. I take some Advil along with my morning supplements. </p>



<p>9:30 a.m. — Join my daily team standup and send out a few Teams messages. We have to meet with the vendor again for an issue and luckily they responded with a meeting time for today. After the meeting, I grab my double chocolate overnight oats I prepped and add raspberries. </p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Join the vendor call and they don’t know what to do either. Great lol. I jinxed myself saying this would be easy to finish.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — Eat a turkey club and get ready to leave for my doctor’s appointment.</p>



<p>2 p.m. — On the way to my doctor’s appointment, I need a pick-me-up, so I get a half-and-half tea with peach from Sonic.<strong> $3</strong></p>



<p>3:30 p.m. — Done with my doctor’s appointment and I have a small balancer leftover from last time. I pay it with my HSA card. $<strong>17.06</strong></p>



<p>4 p.m. — I get home and hop back online. Answer a few missed messages and leave comments on all my stories on the agility board. We switched to a weekly sprints template a month ago and I really like it, my work gets done faster and more efficiently. </p>



<p>5:30 p.m. — I’m feeling beat from the doctor/flu shot I got. I lay down and take a nap.</p>



<p>6:20 p.m. — It starts storming and I get texts from my friends that the floating sound bath at our apartment pool is cancelled. I am lowkey happy as I want to veg out tonight. I get a refund of $19.32 for my ticket. </p>



<p>7:40 p.m. — I heat up some pre-made chicken tikka masala for dinner and eat it with rice. I have a self-care/craft night complete with dying my roots (I refuse to pay $200 plus at the salon for hair dye), and grouting the lamp I made over the weekend. I also play on my Nintendo Switch a bit.</p>



<p>11 p.m. — Stretch and read my book. I pop a melatonin for some undisturbed sleep. I am asleep in 30 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $20.06</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Five: Friday</strong></h3>



<p>8 a.m. — I wake up early for a vendor meeting just to see it got moved to 9 a.m. I go back to bed and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>9 a.m. — Log in for the meeting. Nothing gets resolved and it turns out to be a waste of an hour. </p>



<p>10:20 a.m. — Make some scrambled eggs and two frozen waffles. I also have a kiwi and make a strawberry matcha.</p>



<p>10:40 a.m. — I’m pretty much done with my work this sprint, so I do some chores around the apartment and vacuum. </p>



<p>12 p.m. — I respond back and forth with the engineer I have been collaborating with. I try not to be annoyed as I put in a work order for this assignment a month ago, and he has waited for the last possible second to fulfill it. Typical. </p>



<p>1:25 p.m. — Eat a turkey club. Take two Advil as I have a waxing appointment in 30 minutes.</p>



<p>2:20 p.m. — Get a wax. This is my first time seeing my waxing lady at her private studio versus at the big box chain I met her at. She gives me a discount for being a loyal customer but I tip 20%. </p>



<p>2:30 p.m. — On the way home I return something to Ulta Beauty and Amazon. I get back $57.54 from my returns, which basically means my wax was free. </p>



<p>2:50 p.m — I stop by CVS for a new claw clip because I stepped on my old one and broke it. I have eight dollars in extra bucks, plus a $10 off $25 coupon, so I get a lipstick, lipliner, and claw clip all for $8.61. Thanks, TikTok couponing. </p>



<p>4 p.m. — I take a long walk.</p>



<p>6 p.m. — My friend with benefits, K., comes over. He found out a month into us seeing each other that he has to move back to his home country in a year’s time. We get along really well, so we just keep seeing each other and it doesn’t hurt that the sex is good. I refuse to call it a situationship because I hate that term lol. We go get Pho and he pays.</p>



<p>8 p.m. — On the way back from Pho, we stop at a grocery store because I want a sweet treat. One of his friends calls him and invites him out with his friend group and we decide to join. I get some ice cream, turkey bacon, and a kombucha. <strong>$15.20</strong></p>



<p>9:30 p.m — After fooling around, I change into something better and do some quick makeup. We head to his place because he’s also dressed very casually and wants to change. </p>



<p>11 p.m. — We get to the place. It’s kinda dead so we hop to another place that’s more lively, but we have to wait in line for a bit. Once we get inside K. buys our drinks. </p>



<p>1:30 a.m — We decide to leave and I’m very tipsy but K. is sober and drives me home. We fool around again. I air-fry some Korean corndogs for a post-drinking snack.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — He leaves, which is perfect. I hate sleeping next to a man and would rather have my bed to myself. I shower quickly and promptly pass out. </p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: </strong>$77.81</p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Six: Saturday</strong></h3>



<p>10:30 a.m. — Wake up. I want to go back to sleep but my brain won’t let me. Both cats are cuddling with me, so I enjoy the cuddles and scroll on my phone.</p>



<p>11:30 a.m. — Get up and make some banana pancakes and turkey bacon. A few friends and I were going to my apartment’s Labor Day pool party but it’s raining. So we decide we’ll go on Monday instead since we have the day off. </p>



<p>3 p.m. — After being lazy/playing video games for a while, I get ready to meet some other friends C. and F. at a board game store. I lowkey want to stay home but know if I lay around all day I will feel depressed. They are going to be playing their own games, but I have some life admin stuff I want to do, so I tag along. On the way there, I stop at the grocery store and get a snack box and an onigiri for lunch. <strong>$13.51</strong></p>



<p>4:45 p.m. — The tiredness finally hits me. I head home to chill.</p>



<p>7 p.m. — I eat my leftover chicken tikka masala and commence my rotting session.</p>



<p>9 p.m. — K. comes over again and we go see <em>Caught Stealing</em>. I get my ticket free with my AMC A-List subscription. K. buys us popcorn. I enjoy the movie a lot — I would recommend! </p>



<p>12 p.m. — Get home from the movie and say our goodbyes. I shower and go to sleep.</p>



<p><strong>Daily Total: $13.51</strong></p>



<div>DashDividers_1_500x100</div>



<h3><strong>Day Seven</strong>: Sunday</h3>



<p>10 a.m. — Wake up and scroll in bed. The cats cuddle with me for a bit.</p>



<p>11 a.m. — Heat up some frozen Kimbap. I also make a yogurt bowl with kiwi and honey. It’s still raining so I enjoy the chill morning.</p>



<p>1 p.m. — I go to Aldi. I get hash brown patties, sparkling water, various fruits, a cucumber, peeled garlic, cherry tomatoes, white cheddar, salami, hummus, Greek yogurt, eggs, English muffins, granola, rice, pasta, olives, and chickpeas. <strong>$52.68</strong></p>



<p>2 p.m. — I head out for the pole studio and drink my kombucha on the way. </p>



<p>5 p.m. — I finish up with both of my classes. The first one was another cardio dancing class, and second was level three pole. I eat a protein bar in between classes. The tricks we were learning were very shoulder heavy, so I already foresee the pain I will be in the next day. </p>



<p>6 p.m. — On the way home, I stop by Raising Cane’s. What’s the point of working out if you can’t indulge in some guilty pleasures? I get a three-finger combo with a Diet Coke. <strong>$10.38</strong></p>



<p>7:30 p.m. — After showering and doing some very dark makeup, I uber to a friend’s house to chill before going out to the alternative/goth club. <strong>$12.89</strong></p>



<p>9:15 p.m. — After hanging out for a bit, we head out. </p>



<p>1 a.m — I head out early because I’m tired of socializing and dancing. I ended up not buying any drinks. I get a ride home with a sober friend. Once home, I heat up some frozen pizza. I start feeling sad and call my ex (we are on speaking terms). We talk about life and I cry some.</p>



<p>3 a.m. — I pass out and look forward to sleeping in for the holiday. <br /><br /><strong>Daily Total: $75.95</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>“I need to fix my sleep schedule LOL. And stop being sad about my ex. Other than that, I don’t think I did too badly this week. The shopping I did is very out of the ordinary for me — I usually don’t impulse buy clothes.”</p>

<p>There are some brands that, whenever they launch a new moisturizer, immediately have my attention. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"">Tatcha is absolutely one of them</a> — mostly because it doesn’t happen all that often. In other words, when Tatcha does drop something new, it feels like a Big Deal. </p>



<p>I’ve long admired many of the brand’s cult-favorite formulas — <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fwater-cream%2FCA05310T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Water Cream</a>, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Fdewy-skin-cream-replenishing-and-plumping-moisturizer%2FCA06310T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dewy Skin Cream</a> (along with the lighter <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-dewy-milk-moisturizer-review"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dewy Skin Moisturizer</a> that dropped last year), and <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Findigo-overnight-repair-serum%2FCA08210T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS%26cgid%3Dmoisturizers"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Indigo Overnight Cream.</a> All four seem to permanently live on bestseller lists, and for good reason. So when I heard about the latest launch, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Flongevity-cream%2FCA11010T.html%3Fcountry%3DUS"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Longevity Memory Cream</a>, I was intrigued. Firstly, by its unique texture.

<h2>What is Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream and what are the benefits?</h2>



<p>As the name suggests, <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tatcha.com%2Fproduct%2Flongevity-cream%2FCA11010T.html"">The Longevity Memory Cream</a> is rooted in improving elasticity and resilience; think skin barrier support (keeping moisture in and bacteria firmly out), and long-lasting, comforting hydration. The hero ingredient is the Okinawa cellescence complex, a trifecta of Okinawan botanicals including noni juice (an antioxidant-rich, fermented superfood native to Southeast Asia), shell ginger, and Shikuwasa lime — all three of which are also found in <a href=""https://www.tatcha.com/product/the-longevity-serum/CF12010T.html?country=US"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tatcha’s Longevity Serum</a>.  </p>



<p style=""text-align: left;"">Longevity is somewhat of a new beauty buzzword these days, and you wouldn’t necessarily be wrong to think of it as a rebranding of “anti-aging.” However, I believe that the term “longevity” is more about maintaining healthy skin habits than turning back the clock; IMO, as someone who’s worked over a decade in beauty, I’d like to reframe it as a focus on hydrated, brighter skin rather than waging war on wrinkles. They’re totally normal — and inevitable — after all. </p>



<p>Next, there’s hyaluronic acid: We all know about this hydrating powerhouse, and how it draws moisture into the skin, increasing hydration levels. But this cream features <em>bio-fermented</em> hyaluronic acid. The fermentation process helps supercharge the ingredient so that it sinks into the skin faster and better than other forms of hyaluronic acid we know and love. </p>



<p>Lastly, there’s nonapeptide-1. Peptides are the building blocks for proteins, which give skin its supple look and feel. These work alongside the rest of the ingredients to smooth skin texture. </p>



<h2>What makes Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream special?  </h2>



<p>Unlike most Tatcha moisturizers I’ve tried, The Longevity Memory Cream has a unique, jelly-like texture that reminds me of pudding; perfectly set in its shape but with a soft, gel-like feel that breaks apart as you scoop it out of the jar. This may be a projection, but the bouncy texture of the cream itself is what my skin feels like after applying it. </p>



<p>At first, this was something I actually didn’t love; it left a tacky residue that I feared would sit atop my skin, rather than absorb fully. However, once I take a heaping spoonful and warm it up a bit in my hands, it sinks into my skin beautifully, leaving behind a radiant glow. (Because of its semi-solid texture, this is a rare instance that I actually use the tiny spoon that fancy face creams like this tend to come with.) </p>



<p>I’m not the only one obsessed with the sensory experience of The Longevity Memory Cream. “This is the memory foam of moisturizers,” Refinery29 beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita adds. “Truly — if I press my finger into it, it leaves an imprint. It eventually settles back into place, but the texture is unlike anything I’ve tried before.” </p>



<p>Besides this, the ingredient nonapeptide-1 caught her attention, mainly because it supports the skin’s natural ceramides. “Without taking you back to biology class, ceramides act like glue between skin cells, keeping everything soft and intact rather than dry and flaky,” says Kilikita. “I always look for them in a moisturizer, so I love that this formula helps encourage them.” </p>



<h2>What to know about Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream</h2>



<p>• Has a unique, gel-cream texture, like memory foam. <br />• Contains bio-fermented hyaluronic acid and nonapeptide-1 for bouncy hydration and a supported skin barrier. <br />• Suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin. </p>



<h2>How do you use Tatcha’s Longevity Memory Cream and is it worth it?    </h2>



<p>The Longevity Memory Cream is suitable for morning and<span style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;""> </span>nighttime use, which I’m here for since space on my bathroom counter is rare to come by. I especially love it for daytime as a makeup base, since it instantly plumps my skin and eradicates dry, textured patches on my forehead, creating a smooth base for foundation and concealer. Overnight, I apply a little extra, like a face mask, and wake up with soft, supple skin. </p>



<p>Kilikita says it’s one of the best moisturizers she’s used in a long time: “My skin is reactive and prone to redness — especially after cleansing — and I love how cooling this feels on contact.” She adds, “Unlike many lotions in my collection, it sinks in quickly. One spatula-full is enough for my entire face and neck.” </p>



<figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960721.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=4%3A3"" /></figure>



<p>As for the long term benefits of “youthful” skin, time will only tell. I’m lucky that at 32, I don’t have fine lines and wrinkles to speak of, but I love how this fits into my routine and addresses my primary skin goals of increasing hydration, brightening, and minimizing texture. But how <em>does </em>it fare on fine lines? “At 33, I’m starting to notice some under my eyes and around my mouth, and I can happily report this softens their appearance thanks to how hydrating it is,” says Kilikita. “I notice it most when I’m wearing makeup; it doesn’t settle into creases in the same way.” </p>



<p>“All in all,” she adds, “this is my new favorite moisturizer, and I’ll be using it down to the last drop — or blob.” </p>



<p>I couldn’t agree more, and have gleaming, hydrated skin as the ultimate testimonial.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2026/02/11960582/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">2026 BAFTAs</a> gave us much to celebrate. Rich, exciting, complex Black filmmaking was given its due, with multiple awards going to Black cinematic artists. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11881716/sinners-movie-ending-explained-wunmi-mosaku-interview"">Blockbuster horror <em>Sinners</em></a>, the British Nigerian coming of age story <a href=""https://www.gbcghanaonline.com/entertainment/my-fathers-shadow-wins-outstanding-debut-at-2026-bafta/2026/""><em>My Father’s Shadow</em>,</a> and British short animation <a href=""https://www.channel4.com/programmes/two-black-boys-in-paradise""><em>Two Black Boys in Paradise</em></a> collectively won an incredible five BAFTAs. <em>Sinners</em> Director <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2025/04/11884333/sinners-true-story-robert-johnson-ryan-coogler-box-office-success"">Ryan Coogler </a>made history as the <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/ryan-coogler-first-black-person-bafta-original-screenplay-1236666022/"">first Black winner</a> for Original Screenplay. It was also a night that recognized the lived reality of <a href=""https://tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia/"">Tourette’s Syndrome and Coprolalia</a>; the emotional, heartwarming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeWqQN3snCU"">film <em>I Swear</em></a> documents the struggles <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n9709g0go"">Tourette’s campaigner John Davidson</a> has with the disability, and other people’s ignorance of it. The film won three BAFTAs including a surprising <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv05r8dgpo"">Best Actor win for lead actor Robert Aramayo</a>.    </p>



<p>Within that celebratory same space, an uncomfortable, unfortunate incident unfolded: one that was difficult for everyone involved, and which has since been stripped of context and complexity by a slew of online commentators who favor uncompromising hot takes over nuance and in doing so, have arguably made a sad situation far worse. </p>



<p>During the live broadcast, an involuntary <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tourettes-bafta-film-awards-bbc-john-davidson-sinners-1236512321/"">vocal tic from Davidson</a> was picked up by microphones while <em>Sinners</em> <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/bafta-awards-2026-tourettes-n-word-outburst"">stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo</a> were on stage presenting an award. The outburst included the offensive racist term the n-word, prompting a response from the <a href=""https://people.com/michael-b-jordan-delroy-lindo-onstage-baftas-racial-slur-tourettes-activist-11911616"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">ceremony’s host, Alan Cumming</a>, who stated: “If you have seen the film <em>I Swear</em>, you will know that film is about the experience of a person with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a disability, and the tics you’ve heard tonight are involuntary, which means the person who has Tourette syndrome has no control over their language. We apologize if you were offended.” Despite being pre-recorded, the moment was broadcast live to millions by the BBC, creating a situation that was distressing for the actors on stage, the audience, and likely Davidson himself, who reportedly later left the ceremony early of his own accord.</p>



<p>It, of course, wasn’t easy to witness two Black people have a racial slur directed at them particularly in such a public manner, and on an evening where their art was being lauded by award ceremonies that historically have underrewarded Black filmmaking. The moment where both Jordan and Lindo register what’s been shouted at them, before almost immediately recomposing themselves and continuing, was a sad and likely familiar scenario to anyone who has ever publicly endured slurs. It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It was distressing to watch and both the presenters and viewers are entitled to their discomfort and sadness in response to an extremely difficult situation. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wider context has been largely absent from much of the online commentary, but here’s what we know about the details leading up to the event: BAFTA reportedly made guests aware in advance of Davidson’s experiences of involuntary vocal tics. I don’t agree with the ignorant arguments that have been fired off that dismiss Tourette’s Syndrome, including suggestions that Davidson should have been banned from the ceremony altogether, and that he was an unrepentant racist who must have meant what he said. Even actor <a href=""https://www.aol.com/articles/jamie-foxx-weighs-michael-b-125419991.html"">Jamie Foxx has chimed in</a> unhelpfully saying on instagram “Nah he meant that sh*t”. It’s quite shocking to hear almost medieval arguments that disabled people be locked away from public view in 2026. Such responses disregard the reality that Tourette’s can be profoundly distressing for those who live with it; involving loss of bodily control, deep shame, and a constant fear of public misunderstanding. </p>



<p>But harm was caused. The word at the centre of this incident carries a specific and brutal history of violence, degradation, and dehumanization directed at Black people; a history that continues to shape lived experience today. In a global political moment marked by the resurgence of openly racist rhetoric, policies, and state violence, audiences are likely even more raw and sensitive to its use. That context does not justify the ableist or deeply unempathetic responses directed at John Davidson. But given that Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage representing <em>Sinners</em> — a film that directly grapples with the history and ongoing cycle of racism in the United States — it does help explain the depth of feeling, and why this moment which shouldn’t have been aired landed with such visceral force. Who was protecting Jordan and Lindo in the moment, and the Black audience watching? </p>



<p>Variety reported other incidents of Davidson’s Tourettes throughout the ceremony, including  shouting “shut the f-ck up” at BAFTA chair Sara Putt and saying “f-ck you” as the award for best children’s and family film was being accepted. Based on what we know about the disability, these actions were involuntary and not a malicious act. The attempt to ascribe the incident as a personal, moral failure of Davidson’s is wrong and unhelpful. It’s a horrible irony that an evening where a film like <em>I Swear </em>won so much praise has almost immediately been followed with proof of precisely why the film is so necessary. </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. </p><cite>banseka kayembe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The real issue in this story appears to be institutional. The BBC and the BAFTAs made a deliberate editorial decision to air the incident, despite the BAFTAs having been filmed approximately two hours prior to broadcast. This sits uneasily alongside the fact that references to “Free Palestine,” as well as mentions of Congo and Sudan, were trimmed from <em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">My Father’s Shadow” </a></em><a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/bbc-cuts-free-palestine-akinola-davies-jr-baftas-speech-1236670099/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">filmmaker Davies Jr.’s acceptance speech</a>. In response to criticism, a BBC spokesperson stated: “The live event is three hours and it has to be reduced to two hours for its on-air slot. The same happened to other speeches made during the night and all edits were made to ensure the programme was delivered to time. All winners’ speeches will be available to watch via BAFTA’s YouTube channel.”</p>



<p>That explanation raises more questions than it resolves. It is difficult not to see this as a significant dereliction of duty: a choice that allowed public discomfort, humiliation, and misplaced blame to fall on Jordan, Lindo, and Davidson. Given the broadcaster’s clear capacity to edit sensitively and selectively, it is reasonable to ask why this segment was left intact, or why the audio was not muted, particularly when doing so might have mitigated harm for everyone involved. Now, the clip has been shared widely, including the word, causing a firestorm that could have — in part — been avoided. Jordan and Lindo shouldn’t have had to endure that slur being yelled at them, and Davidson shouldn’t have had his disability used against him in such a public manner.  The events that have unfolded suggest the BBC has an institutional bias in terms of what it regards as offensive, which lines up with its <a href=""https://cfmm.org.uk/resource/bbc-on-gaza-israel-one-story-double-standards/"">egregious wider reporting</a> on issues such as the <a href=""https://www.un.org/unispal/document/special-rapporteur-report-gaza-genocide-a-collective-crime-20oct25/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Israeli genocide in Palestine. </a></p>



<p>The BBC issued an apology this morning (ET), hours after the widespread backlash: “We apologise that this was not edited out prior to broadcast and it will now be removed from the version on BBC iPlayer.” By the time the apology was issued, the clip had already circulated widely across social media, fuelling outrage, misinformation, and deeply ableist and racist commentary, and leaving Michael B. Jordan, Delroy Lindo, and John Davidson to absorb the public fallout. There has been no public reflection on addressing the editorial judgement and criteria that allowed it to be broadcast in the first place.</p>



<p>These moments reflect some of the most destructive habits of online political culture, that many Black writers and thinkers have often highlighted as unhelpful in the wider scheme of things. People’s very real grievances can easily be projected onto these more tricky hyper-visible pop culture moments, and a desire for outrage and simplistic, absolutist punishment end up taking precedence over a more serious, empathetic conversation that can encompass multiple things at once. This flawed logic often relies on an explicit hierarchy of suffering, where your suffering must take total priority over another’s, but that framework is neither radical or effective. We live in a world that feels like it’s on fire, and racism is now a visceral daily reality in our politics.  Perhaps the powerlessness people feel means these moments unfairly become proxies for broader, deeper rage at an unjust world that no one seems to know how to fix. It’s a sad rinse and repeat cycle that we’re trapped in.  </p>



<figure><blockquote class=""has-text-color has-black-color""><p>I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended.</p><cite>‘sinners’ production designer hannah beachler on ‘x’</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>A number of disabled Black people, including some who have Tourtettes have provided far more caring, nuanced perspectives on the situation. <a href=""https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNR5j3eXb/"">@sh4ysgrwm</a> on TikTok pushed back on the idea that tics can be controlled, clarifying that it’s the result of “neurons misfiring…we have got to stop thinking with our feelings and start thinking with logic. It’s ok to be offended, but it’s not ok to be ableist and try to make it seem like those with Tourettes, specifically those with Coprolelia, say their tics on purpose.” Misunderstanding these conditions can have wider and more troubling consequences. When public opinion and policy defaults to individual moral judgement, it is racialized disabled people who are most likely to face even harsher treatment, disbelief, or punishment. Involuntary tics from Black people are even more likely to be perceived as threatening or dangerous; it’s clearly in everyone’s interests to better understand and support people with these disabilities. </p>



<p>The impact of Davidson’s disability was harmful and many Black disability advocades are calling for him to apologize. I am uncomfortable with the idea of Davidson having to apologize for his disability (although he may personally wish to as I assume he probably felt terrible about it) because of the precedent that sets for disabled people. It’s true that we may be giving this white man more grace than a Black disabled person (especially a Black woman) may get in his situation, but I think the apology and changed behavior really needs to come from the institutions themselves.  </p>



<p>“I keep trying to write about what happened at the <a href=""https://variety.com/t/baftas/"">BAFTAs</a>, and I can’t find the words,” BAFTA nominee and <em>Sinners</em> production designer Hannah Beachler, posted on X after the ceremony, <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/global/sinners-hannah-beachler-n-word-slur-baftas-apology-1236670089/"">reported by Variety</a>. “The situation is almost impossible, but it happened 3 times that night, and one of the three times was directed at myself on the way to dinner after the show.. and a third time at a Black woman,” she wrote. “I understand and deeply know why this is an impossible situation. I know we must handle this with grace and continue to push through. But what made the situation worse was the throw away apology of ‘if you were offended’ at the end of the show. Of course we were offended…but our frequency, our spiritual vibration is tuned to a higher level than what happened.. This did not bounce off of me, but I exist above it. It can’t take away from who I am as an artist.” Delroy Lindo later said at one of the BAFTA after parties that he wished <a href=""https://variety.com/2026/film/awards/delroy-lindo-bafta-n-word-michael-b-jordan-1236670222/"">“someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards”</a> confirming both BAFTA and the BBC have shown a significant lack of planning, safeguarding and aftercare even after the incident. BAFTA’s lackluster apology during the broadcast sits alongside what appears to be a total lack of accountability for the situation all parties were placed in. </p>



<p>Aside from needing far better media institutions, this episode underlines why art remains indispensable. At its best, it gives us language for experiences we do not have first hand knowledge of, and it asks us to sit with discomfort and contradictions. Many of the best films showcased at the awards resist the urge to collapse human complexity, and the friction that can come with it, into simplistic ideas. A little less time on social media and a bit more time with art might be a good place to start- and it’s clear that the decision-makers at the BAFTAs and BBC need to learn from the very art these institutions are celebrating.   </p>

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11960571.jpg?width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=3%3A4"" /></figure></div>



<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/keren_bartov/?hl=en"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Keren Bartov</a> has magic hands — it’s the only explanation for why I left her treatment room with the glowiest skin of my life. But don’t just take my word for it: she’s the celebrity esthetician behind some of the dewiest skin <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-au/baftas-2026-red-carpet-looks"">at the BAFTAs</a> over the weekend, including <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/teyanataylor/?hl=en"">Teyana Taylor,</a> Jessie Buckley, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/katehudson/?hl=en"">Kate Hudson</a>. No wonder she’s in such high demand — Bartov’s skincare knowledge is exceptional, and she knows exactly how to make skin look its best under the spotlight.</p>



<p>Bartov is so sought after that she has a four-storey, state-of-the-art facial clinic in London’s Notting Hill. Her clinic might be hi-tech (it promises more beep-boop machines than you could imagine), but Bartov believes it’s how you take care of your skin at home that really matters. </p>



<p>With that in mind, here are all the smart skincare rules I learned from Bartov and her team during a facial treatment.</p>



<h2>Don’t sleep on your cleansing routine</h2>



<p>Cleansing your skin effectively is the best thing you can do for it, according to Bartov. If you’re not lifting away your sunscreen, makeup, and all of the grime you’ve collected throughout the day, any skincare you apply in the evening won’t work to the best of its ability — and that’s a serious waste of both product and money. </p>



<p>Before you do anything, Bartov suggests washing your hands for at least 30 seconds. “Otherwise you’re putting bacteria all over your skin when you want to be washing it off — and that makes no sense at all,” she says. Bartov adds that this step is especially important for those with acne-prone skin, as oil and dirt can easily clog pores.</p>



<p>Simple is best, too. Bartov doesn’t enlist fancy cleansing devices, nor flannels or cloths. Your fingers are the best tools for the job. She recommends double cleansing at the end of the day (washing your face once and following up with a second cleanse, or using micellar water to remove makeup and then doing a proper, water-based cleanse) for at least a minute each time. </p>





<h2>These ingredients are the best for breakouts</h2>



<p>The <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/01/10846449/exfoliating-acids-skin-benefits-risks"">benefits of exfoliating acids</a> on acne-prone skin (for both preventing breakouts and minimizing the skin staining left behind) are well known, but it’s how you use them that matters. I often have blackheads, whiteheads, and little under-the-skin pimples, so Bartov layered salicylic acid (which exfoliates deep inside the pore to prevent breakouts) and azelaic acid (another exfoliating acid, which reduces redness and minimizes pigmentation over time). </p>



<p>Look for smart products that contain both, like <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpaula-s-choice-10-azelaic-acid-booster-P469507"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paula’s Choice 10% Azelaic Acid Booster</a>, which can be combined with a simple moisturizer. </p>



<h2>Wait for your skincare to absorb</h2>



<p>Bartovs clinician said that patience is a virtue when layering serums and moisturizers. She suggested waiting at least three minutes between applying each skincare product so as not to disturb it on the skin and to give it time to fully absorb and work its magic. If it means you have to brush your teeth or tinker around the bathroom for a moment, that’s fine. It’s worth it to get the most out of your skincare. And always take any excess product right down to your neck and chest area, which Bartov said is often neglected. </p>



<h2>Try these three ingredients for rejuvenated skin all year round</h2>



<p>“<a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/retinal-skincare-benefits"">Retinol</a>, <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-peptide-lip-treatment-balm"">peptides</a>, and <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-vitamin-c-serum"">vitamin C</a> are important ingredients for stimulating collagen and elastin, and giving a glow to the skin,” said Bartov, who suggests using a retinol serum in the evening only. </p>



<p>Peptides (essentially skin-repairing proteins) are sneaking into all kinds of skincare products lately, particularly moisturizers, and they are tolerated well across the board. R29 rates <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnaturium-multi-peptide-moisturizer-1-7-oz%2F-%2FA-82247120"">Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer</a>, which hydrates, moisturizes, and protects skin. It also features vitamin C to shield against pollution. </p>



<p>If you’re already using a vitamin C serum that you love, follow it up with <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP455369"">The Inkey List Peptide Moisturizer</a>, or <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP514671"">Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Gel-Cream Moisturizer,</a> both of which can be used in the morning and the evening. </p>





<p>If you’re using retinol at night, be sure to wear a <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/wearing-sunscreen-spf-daily-affordable"">broad-spectrum, high-factor sunscreen</a> during the daytime, as retinol can make skin sensitive to sunlight.</p>





<h2>Avoid this one thing if you’re prone to breakouts</h2>



<p>As Bartov mentioned earlier, vitamin C is a brilliant ingredient for protecting skin against pollution and other environmental aggressors, as well as minimizing pigmentation and skin staining. But if you have active breakouts, Bartov suggests avoiding it altogether. L-ascorbic acid is currently a popular form of vitamin C as it’s really potent, but it could irritate in the form of stinging or burning, particularly on open skin. It can be especially irritating at higher concentrations. </p>



<p>While vitamin C is unlikely to make your breakouts worse (or <em>cause</em> them, for that matter), it can make your skin even more sensitive. If you really want to try it, skip the strong stuff and go for something like <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-c-alternatives-sensitive-skin"">ascorbyl glucoside</a>, which is derived from vitamin C. I love <a href=""https://go.skimresources.com?id=30283X879131&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2FP442756"">The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%</a>. Make sure it’s oil-free. </p>





<h2>Take sun safety seriously</h2>



<p>Bartov is the first to admit that she enjoys a handful of vices in life and doesn’t believe in cutting out certain foods or drinks. But basking in the sun is a no-go. Not only does it accelerate the aging process, but it’s <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/mole-mapping-experience-melanoma"">linked to skin cancer</a>. </p>



<p>“I personally enjoy my life,” said Bartov, “but I use products on my skin which stop these free radicals,” — including UV rays and cigarette smoke if you’re around smokers. Vitamin C is a good shield, and when she’s outside in summer, Bartov <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-tinted-moisturizer-sunscreen"">tops up her sunscreen</a> every two hours. If you’re spending time outside in the winter (even just exercising for an hour or heading out on a walk), sunscreen is also a great shout, as UVA rays can penetrate clouds.</p>



<h2>Facial treatments are an investment</h2>



<p>Lastly, home skincare is not to be underestimated. But if you’re experiencing gripes like persistent breakouts or pigmentation, for example, you might like to give a pro treatment a go — budget depending. Bartov specializes in acne, pigmentation, and skin rejuvenation, and while she enlists lasers and lights to enhance the skin, she doesn’t offer injectables <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/masseter-botox-side-effects-jowls"">like Botox</a>. Nor has she had Botox injections herself.</p>



<p>Considering the cost, you’d expect the results of a professional facial to be instant. But I learned that it can take two to three weeks to see the full effects of most treatments. In other words, patience is key. </p>



<p>One thing Bartov would always recommend leaving to the professionals is pore extraction, using either metal tools or your hands. Digging at pimples and blackheads could push bacteria sitting on your skin deep inside pores, potentially making the breakout worse and causing scarring or pigmentation.

<div><figure><img src=""https://www.refinery29.com/images/11959719.jpg?width=1024&amp;height=671&amp;fit=bounds&amp;crop=1024%3A671"" /></figure></div>



<p>R29 babes — sorry to say this, but <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-enjoy-winter-ideas"">the winter blues</a> we’re all feeling aren’t immediately going to get better from <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/eclipse-season-guide-february-2026-march-meaning-effects-horoscope"">Mercury’s backspin in Pisces</a> on February 26th. Fear not though because the astrological backspin is going to offer us a way to mend ourselves. Slowly but surely, we’ll feel whole with hope. Trust the process, okay? </p>



<p>Mercury retrograde perpetuates an optical illusion that makes us think the planet is moving backward away from earth, when in fact it’s just moving more slowly. So, communication and travel halt, causing disruptions in how we interact with others. This astrological phenomenon can also disrupt our plans and well being, as unforeseen events occur and we are sluggish from the cosmic force at play. The unpredictability of Mercury <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/signs-from-the-universe-disappointment-setbacks"">creates heightened anxiety</a> because it makes us feel out of control and unable to accomplish tasks quickly. </p>



<p>If one planet can cause all of that commotion, then why do some people revel in the chaos? Mercury retrograde can offer a unique perspective on matters. Since the planet of information and news is kicking back for a few weeks, we should give our minds a break and chill. Easier said than done, right? Not letting the small stuff bother us and gaining a deeper understanding of situations, now that we can look at them more closely allows us to thrive. We have to be mindful of what energy we allow to permeate our lives. <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-protect-your-peace"">Protect your peace</a>. </p>



<p>The first Mercury retrograde of 2026 in the water sign Pisces offers us a chance to reconnect with projects and people we love — even if it’s for a fleeting moment. Venus and Mercury retrograde form a conjunction on February 28th, uniting us with a romantic partner or creative venture from the past. We will be inclined to forgive, but not forget. Old wounds might reopen, so be careful in your interactions to avoid heartache from recurring. Although we are resilient, going against our instincts and believing in others we shouldn’t, can sting, if they prove to be untrustworthy. This is a reminder to keep our guard up and boundaries in place. </p>



<p>The sun and Mercury retrograde connect on March 7th, four days after the total lunar eclipse in Virgo. The “cazimi” aspect, which translates from Latin to English as “in the heart of the sun,” offers clarity and decisiveness amid the ambiguity and chaos. We will find enlightenment and be able to make plans to move forward, so we must use it to our advantage. Even though it may not be the light at the end of the tunnel, we can assess matters with a clear mind and determine how we wish to move forward. Think of “cazimi” as a temporary saving grace. </p>



<p>Another important point of the planetary moonwalk is the affiliation between the North Node of Destiny and Mercury retrograde on March 17th. Pay close attention to the events that transpire on this day, as they’ll prove to be pivotal in the future. Situations are unfolding, urging us to seize the moment. Fate is linking us up with people and possibilities that are helping us evolve and grow. Even if the future doesn’t guarantee the outcome we hoped for, it’ll lead us to another amazing place that fulfills our dreams and aspirations. Say yes with caution, to whatever presents itself on March 7th.</p>



<p>The retrograde wraps up on the first day of spring, giving us a fresh start. As we head onward, it’s vital to reflect and share the lessons learned. </p>
