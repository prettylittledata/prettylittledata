Our phones track how much we use them, present this data as evidence of failure, and then leave us alone with our guilt never really addressing why we reached for them in the first place or offering constructive suggestions for improvement.</p><h4>A brief history of digital wellness tools</h4><p>Digital wellness tools <a href=""https://www.apple.com/gr/newsroom/2018/06/ios-12-introduces-new-features-to-reduce-interruptions-and-manage-screen-time/"">emerged around 2018</a> in response to concerns about device addiction. With Apple’s Screen Time and Google’s Digital Wellbeing, suddenly our phones came equipped with features to monitor and limit their own use through dashboards and constraints.</p><p>The digital wellness market is now worth <a href=""https://www.rootsanalysis.com/digital-detox-apps-market"">almost $1 billion</a> — which is not an insignificant number for an industry built on helping us use our phones less yet entirely dependent on our phones to exist.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ubI30RiPmFwEHcZK1Mr6Zg.png"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Screen Time app (collage by author, image <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphbfa595995/ios#:~:text=View%20your%20Screen%20Time%20summary%20*%20Go,see%20a%20summary%20of%20your%20daily%20use"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>These products’ framing deliberately takes from self-care vocabulary (using words like “wellbeing” and “focus”, some apps “diagnose” your focus levels) positioning themselves as caring for our health. But under the surface, these tools share a common mechanism: they make us feel guilty about our behaviour instead of questioning the patterns that influence it.</p><p>There are many digital wellness apps out there, and most follow similar patterns. A couple of the most popular ones are Forest and Opal.</p><p><strong>Forest</strong> is a focused-timer app that uses simple gamification: you set a timed session (like a Pomodoro timer) and a virtual tree begins to grow. If you leave the app to check notifications or else, the tree dies. Completing sessions adds trees to your collection, and you can aim to gradually build a virtual forest.</p><p>Instead of growing a tree, <strong>Opal</strong> works by blocking selected apps and notifications for a set period of time, creating intentional friction between you and your distractions. When a session is active, attempting to open a blocked app triggers a screen reminding you of your focus goal, making the act of “breaking” your session a more conscious decision. Completing sessions adds gems to your collection and ranks you on a leaderboard.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JTHn9mP3e68Kj5XWp_pb5g.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of how guilt is used by Forest app to nudge users (image by author)</figcaption></figure><h4>Guilt as the special sauce</h4><p>These are great examples of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/behavioral-design"">behavioural design</a> at work, and even better examples of how digital wellness tools have convinced us that excessive phone use is a personal failure requiring personal intervention.</p><p>The problem is that this leads to a lot of self-guilt that doesn’t just come up naturally from our phone habits, but it’s also baked into these tools.<strong><em> </em></strong>From a psychological perspective, guilt emerges when we believe we’ve violated a personal standard. Digital wellness features tap into this directly: they highlight “failures” (ie. your tree died because you made a phone call) amplify them with comparisons (ie. your friend is in the top 1% on the focus leaderboard and you are not) and present usage as deviations from a norm.</p><p>Every dead tree or broken streak are feedback mechanisms the apps use to prove their worth, but they’re also guilt triggers aimed directly at users.</p><h4>Why data alone is not enough</h4><p>I don’t think we should have to pay our way out of the attention economy so as an iPhone user, I rely on <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iphbfa595995/ios#:~:text=View%20your%20Screen%20Time%20summary%20*%20Go,see%20a%20summary%20of%20your%20daily%20use."">Screen Time</a> to monitor my habits. It’s free, built in and, at least at surface level, useful. In my opinion, however, it has one major flaw: it tries to teach users how to build better habits while making no changes whatsoever to the core product mechanics. In other words, it’s a diagnostic tool and, as such, its benefits are limited to making the user aware of a problem but not necessarily helping find a solution to it.</p><p>This is a common problem among digital wellness tools and it’s become one of the most widely accepted examples of how technology frames our behaviour as a personal problem to fix, and therefore a source of guilt.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HnkzGI5-6YuzSdTzPw-Cnw.png"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Screen Time is a great example of a data-rich but insight-poor tool. It shows you the numbers but doesn’t help you interpret or act on them. In UX terms, it lacks actionable insights. Data without support often turns into guilt, not change (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, the metrics presented aren’t even that accurate. Screen Time can’t distinguish between types of use, and it doesn’t let you exclude certain apps from the totals. So users are confronted with numbers that tell them almost nothing useful about their <em>actual</em> behaviour.</p><p>I will use my own data as an example. Screen Time told me last Monday I’d spent 5 hours on my phone. If that were 5 hours of scrolling TikTok, fair enough — that could be concerning. But when I dug into the breakdown, I found an hour of Google Maps because I was driving and another 30 minutes of YouTube because my son wanted a dance party after school and we had music playing in the background.</p><p>So my “real” screen time was closer to 3.5 hours. Still a lot probably, but notably less alarming than the initial number. The app had done its job by presenting decontextualised numbers and letting my brain fill in the narrative of personal failure, so before I even looked into what it meant, I felt that pang of shame.</p><p>There is a clear discrepancy between the intended use and purpose of this app versus what it’s able to deliver to users, which is an incomplete experience that doesn’t provide guidance or suggestions on how to take more control over our time.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vapF-8p1mKFJA5FA3zQK3w.png"" /><figcaption>Quick exploration of what it could look like if Screen Time leveraged data to prompt users to take action by providing guidance through insights (image by author)</figcaption></figure><h4>What guilt-free design could look like</h4><p>Screen Time presents usage as a static result rather than a dynamic behaviour, showing numbers but offering no interpretation.</p><p>An alternative to guilt-based design wouldn’t be to remove all this feedback but rather empower users to make change by contextualising the information and offering proactive suggestions.</p><p>My phone knows I’m at work — I have Work Focus on — so why can’t it contextualise my usage? Why not tell me I spent 30 minutes on Instagram during work hours specifically, letting me take accountability where it matters? Or if my Saturday usage suddenly spikes compared to my usual pattern, why not nudge me with a reflection point by letting me know that this is unusual for me at the weekend?</p><p>All these small interventions could help us <em>understand </em>our behaviour instead of just measuring it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9vKYK8rz3cUxSbTiou1wEg.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of how Slack proactively reduces noise and distraction by decluttering the interface. It doesn’t inform the user about the number of inactive or muted channels, but rather offers proactive suggestions on what to do with them, guiding users to a solution (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Digital wellness, to truly live up to its name, should feel more like an environment that supports the user, rather than just a dashboard that informs.</p><p>That could mean more supportive defaults, interfaces and prompts that are able to adapt to context, so instead of leaving users alone with the numbers, design can create conditions where healthy behaviour can develop more naturally.</p><p>I saw a comment on a LinkedIn post about the launch of yet another digital wellness app that I wish I had screenshotted, but it was along the lines of <em>“I don’t need another app to manage how I use my phone. If I want to stay away from it, the best way to do it is simply to leave it another room”.</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pSkJgGkUtrx-lJo0_l9MwA.png"" /><figcaption>Apps like Opal still rely on frequent motivational notifications to encourage “healthy” phone habits, but this means users have to pick up their phone in order to be reminded to put it down. These interruptions however generate additional screen interactions that end up plugging users right back in (image by author)</figcaption></figure><p>Using our phones to manage our phone usage will always have its obvious limitations. Digital wellness apps are still apps — they need our attention to teach us about attention and require engagement to promote disengagement, and it feels like a lot of the current solutions are just slapping a timer on a problem that’s way more complex.</p><p>They can track, nudge, or create a bit of friction, but they can’t fundamentally change the habits or patterns that the system itself creates. However, acknowledging those limits makes the whole experience less about judgment and more about awareness.</p><p>As users, what we <em>can</em> do with that awareness is to make small, realistic adjustments, and as designers what we can do in turn, is to build interfaces that make those adjustments feel a little easier instead of adding more cognitive load, working towards making the relationship between us and our devices feel a bit more intentional.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=f4d4dfaca1e8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ux-behind-screen-time-guilt-f4d4dfaca1e8"">The UX behind screen time guilt</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>People want the human internet back.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""AI Robot getting stuck in a Pinterest filter"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MxLTX1U9YxMB69jKuvMU1w.png"" /><figcaption>AI Robot getting stuck in a Pinterest filter</figcaption></figure><p>Pinterest’s new AI filter could be the next step in the evolution of the internet. It’s the first major platform to actually adjust to what a lot of people have been feeling. Our feeds across a broad spectrum of apps are being flooded with low-quality AI slop. The effect is a degradation of trust and an increasing desire to have more control over what we actually see. Pinterest’s move is the first real signal that platforms are recognizing there’s a growing problem instead of pretending that AI generated content and design is the future.</p><p>While I’m not proud to say it, I do occasionally scroll TikTok to kill a few brain cells and a few minutes in my day. My partner also sends me TikToks which she says is her love language, which I in turn use to justify the habit. But these days I’m seeing a trend, there is a <em>stark</em> increase in comments trying to figure out whether a video is AI. We’re literally becoming reality police in the comments of these feeds. Sometimes it’s obvious, there’s that monotoned, programmatically friendly voice playing over a grainy, intentionally retro aesthetic designed to hide AI distortions. But even when it isn’t obvious, people are suspicious. There’s a growing paranoia around what to believe and not believe when scrolling through your feeds on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and more.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDf5qkCZYMA69Z6rOqjFAg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshots of threads about whether or not a video is AI</figcaption></figure><p>It’s a painfully predictable side effect of releasing an unregulated video-generation tool that tries its hardest to pass for reality. There are many tools racing towards that meaningless end but the most notable example is <a href=""https://sora.chatgpt.com/"">Sora</a>. There’s the famous <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O-8kAnBL2s"">bouncing bunnies video</a> or the progressive pastor video, that went mainstream and gave Sora some early hype. But to me it seems like the hype has evaporated. I don’t know a single person who actually uses Sora.<strong> </strong>Not one. I barely know anyone who even downloaded it! And the people who did opened it once, generated something vaguely cursed, laughed nervously, and then abandoned it.</p><figure><img alt=""Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*sCSb6GAwY_UMxcBA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.digit.in/news/apps/openais-sora-app-is-already-flooded-with-disturbing-sam-altman-deepfakes.html"">Images of videos of Sam Altman doing bizarre things generated by Sora</a></figcaption></figure><p>To me it’s unsurprising, as it seemed like the main use case for downloading the app was making creepy videos of <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-openai-sora-app-ai-videos-2025-10"">Sam Altman being mocked</a> in increasingly bizarre and slightly more humiliating situations. Along with a string of racially insensitive videos of MLK making fake speeches, which were eventually disallowed after the very busy ethicist of open <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0g79xevxo"">AI Olivia Gambelin told the BBC OpenAI that limiting further use of Dr King’s image was “a good step forward”</a>. Not only were there weird historical recontextualized videos but also blatant copyright infringements of famous characters. Which we all know is a favourite of OpenAI. Videos on Sora are considered a “success” when they reach escape velocity and seep into mainstream content, which is a strange metric for anything, let alone for a CEO who keeps insisting this tech is “inevitable.”</p><p>But all of this “inevitability” talk from AI tech CEOs is starting to wear thin. Sure, we exist within certain systems. Yes, capital moves the way capital moves. But companies only have power because users hand it to them. When people walk away and engagement drops the inevitability story starts to look flimsy.</p><p>It’s been a awhile now since the first big wave of AI models started generating shockingly polished visuals. And I’ll be honest: sometimes the results are impressive! But my standards for AI are different from my standards for humans. There is still a huge amount of rich, deeply human art being made every day as well as a huge historical trove to dig through that is fundamentally more interesting because it comes from people with taste and lived experience.</p><p>Also the hard truth for AI generated content is that the people who can make beautiful things already are the ones best positioned to make beautiful AI-assisted things. And what are their incentives? Across the board creatives are getting fired because of the threat of AI replacement, why would they be the first to hop onboard to support a tool that’s literally trying to take their jobs. Right now it seems like lot of AI content online comes from people with no creative background dumping average outputs into the feed. People are trying their hand at it, making something new from nothing, and while I admire the spirit in that the harsh truth is it adds almost nothing.</p><p>It turns out making something good that people care about is extremely hard. And making something great is harder still. Great work in my view is inherently collaborative, political, relational. It requires conflict, iteration, and concession. You can’t flatten all of that into a prompt without losing what makes it resonate. Most recently <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">OpenAI announced that they would be making an AI first movie called Critterz for under 30 million</a> as an attempt to try and show the power of AI in film/animation production. But it does beg the question, why is it that OpenAI has to front the cash here? Maybe it’s because independent filmmakers aren’t interested in leveraging this tool? If it was truly a great tool for filmmakers, we would already be hearing about the new voices breaking through the cultural marketplace signalling the importance of this new medium. It ain’t happening!</p><figure><img alt=""Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JauRQvulDh1F49f4x_DiFQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/openai-is-getting-into-the-movie-business-with-critterz/"">Image of AI generated characters from upcoming OpenAI film Critterz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Oftentimes when I tell this to AI boosters there’s this pushback that it’s only getting better and better, and while yes the fidelity and realism is increasing, I have yet to feel the rumblings of a creative AI revolution. I firmly believe you cannot collapse a lifetime of discipline and taste into a few paragraphs of prompting. You can’t try and remove collaboration and expect a better product. Yes, I’ve seen beautiful AI imagery, but they are the exceptions, not the rule. And more importantly: no one is asking for more of it, in fact they’re asking <strong>for less</strong>.</p><p>When people identify a video as AI, it’s usually to warn others not to trust it. That alone tells you what demand actually looks like. Most social platforms exist on human-generated content and I think the flood of AI slop is not likely to increase engagement. We all buy into this story that AI will optimize for our attention, stimulating the exact parts of our brain to create dopamine zombies and while I don’t deny that’s certainly possible, I do think that it’s actually quite unlikely. There is still no comparison between human content and AI content from a quality perspective.</p><p>Pinterest’s new filter lets users reduce or outright hide AI-generated content. TikTok is now testing a similar feature. And I know I’ll be turning it on the second it becomes available. No one begged for this influx of AI content. It doesn’t solve a problem that actually existed or if it does, I certainly can’t put a finger on it. It’s a novel toy that has overwhelmed entire corners of the internet, suffocating feeds and making us all paranoid and platforms are finally starting to admit it. While they’ll never say “our feeds were drowning in AI nonsense and users hated it.” features speak louder than words. When Pinterest gives you the option to filter out AI, and <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tiktok-now-lets-you-choose-how-much-ai-generated-content-you-want-to-see/"">TikTok rushes to pilot something similar</a>, the message is clear: <strong>people want the human internet back.</strong></p><p>I have hope that creativity online won’t be defined by who has the most generative models pumping out piles of content. The novelty of AI is already wearing off and the fatigue is very very real. If platforms want engagement, if they want trust or if they want actual culture to keep happening on their watch, they’re going to have to give us control over our feeds, including the ability to filter out, reduce, or completely remove AI-generated content.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3e832e8ad0d0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-internet-needs-an-ai-off-switch-3e832e8ad0d0"">The internet needs an AI off switch</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

She grew up surrounded by tutors, books and expectations that her intellect would remain a private accomplishment. When she took to history, philosophy and mathematics with a seriousness that made her parents uneasy, well, that wasn’t the goal they were going for. Knowledge, in their view, was for refinement (or so they’d hoped).</p><p>By her late teens, she had begun pushing against the edges of what society considered acceptable for someone of her background. Nursing, at the time, was not an esteemed profession. It was closer to domestic labor, associated with poverty, poor training and conditions that respectable families wanted nothing to do with. The thought of Florence entering that world was, to her parents, pretty unthinkable.</p><p>Beyond her house, Europe was shifting.</p><p>The British Army was expanding its presence abroad. Hospitals weren’t prepared for the scale or severity of the injuries they received. Medical infrastructure was inconsistent, oversight was minimal, and record-keeping existed but didn’t translate into updated policy or changes in care.</p><figure><img alt=""A detailed nineteenth-century illustration of the Battle of Balaklava showing chaotic close-quarters fighting between cavalry and artillery units.

They weren’t. Reports of catastrophic conditions reached London. Overcrowded wards, contaminated water, shortages of supplies, and mortality rates that dwarfed expectations. Public pressure mounted, and the government needed a response that looked decisive.</p><p>Nightingale was asked to lead a team of nurses to the military hospital in Scutari.</p><p>She accepted, arriving to find a system overwhelmed not only by the war, but by a number of hard to overcome assumptions.</p><p>This is where most accounts of Florence Nightingale begin to lean on the familiar imagery. The lamp, the night rounds, the comforting presence in a place defined by suffering.</p><p>While that version is true enough to persist, it leaves out the part that gives her work its lasting impression, and why it’s the subject of this week’s unquoted.</p><p>The moment she stepped into Scutari, she realized the crisis was much more than medical.</p><p>She had entered an information crisis.</p><p>The hospital produced records, but the records concealed more than they revealed. Deaths were counted, but not categorized. Conditions were noted, but not analyzed. The data existed, but it carried no structure that could lead anyone toward responsibility.</p><p>And this is where the story takes a turn.</p><p><strong>The Florence Nightingale we’re here for is the woman who recognized that the health of an institution depends on the clarity of the information that shapes its decisions.</strong></p><h3>No decision strategy = hope</h3><p>When Nightingale began working through records at Scutari, her goal was to understand how a hospital this large could operate with so many people and have so little sense of direction. Ledgers were full (supplies, patient counts, daily notes) but nothing in them hinted at anything actionable. The information described activities being completed, but not anything about that activity’s implication.</p><p>Over time, this problem persisted. Reports were produced because that was the routine. No one had agreed on what those reports were meant to surface, which scenarios mattered, which changes signaled risk, or which patterns required action. Without that understanding, documentation became a ritual — evidence that work had occurred, not evidence that anything had been understood.</p><p>This pushed Nightingale to stop reading the reports as documentation and start reading them as evidence of how little the institution understood itself. The hospital was active… busy, even… but that activity had no correlation.</p><p>Here’s what’s interesting. Decisions weren’t necessarily being avoided. People in power didn’t know what decisions they’d make if the right information presented itself. Their entire operation was basing itself on activity, optimism and ‘God’s will’ (which is a form of fate that requires no responsibility because it assumes none is possible).</p><p>Nightingale knew the only way forward was to be clear about the goal and then to look for the signals that would tell her whether that goal was getting closer or slipping further away. If the aim was fewer deaths, then she needed to understand what conditions made death more likely, and which of those conditions could be influenced by decisions inside the hospital. That meant defining the kind of evidence that would force a change in course, and then arranging the information so those inflection points (signals) could be seen.</p><p>She worked through the records with that question in mind. Not “what happened?” but “what would have made us act sooner?” Once she separated preventable deaths from battle wounds, organized the accounts in intervals that revealed trends, and drew distinctions that had never been documented with any seriousness, the crisis took on a shape the institution couldn’t look past. The patterns had been buried under routine, but they were unmistakable.</p><figure><img alt=""A polar-area chart showing monthly mortality in the British Army from April 1854 to March 1855. Each wedge represents a month, with green areas indicating deaths from nonbattle causes and orange areas showing deaths from battle. The green segments dominate most months, especially in winter, illustrating that disease and poor conditions caused far more deaths than combat. The chart is based on Florence Nightingale’s 1858 statistical work."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XJpZCcrZmsuWeJnVEiAEYA.png"" /><figcaption>Coxcomb Chart: The English nurse Florence Nightingale was an innovator in displaying statistical data through graphs. In 1858 she devised the type depicted here, which she named Coxcomb. Like pie charts, the Coxcomb indicates frequency by relative area, but it differs in its use of fixed angles and variable radii.</figcaption></figure><p>Her work made the responsibility clear. She identified the decisions that mattered and then arranged the information around those decisions so the institution could no longer look away from its own role in the outcomes. Once the data showed the hospital was contributing to the deaths, the excuses fell apart. Their work had to change.</p><h3>Where organizations lose the plot</h3><p>The pattern Nightingale uncovered isn’t confined to a nineteenth-century hospital. We produce so much information, yet struggle with the same absence of direction. Metrics pile up. Dashboards expand. Data becomes a security blanket for activity. Ask a team what decisions any one of their numbers is meant to influence, and the answer may disappoint you. But hey, the dashboard looks compelling, right?</p><p>The problem starts early. Most organizations begin with the data they have, or the data they want, and work backward into meaning. Nightingale did the opposite. She started with the decision. She asked what needed to be understood, what changes mattered, and what signals would make a different course unavoidable.</p><p>There’s a simple discipline in that sequence.</p><p><strong>Start with decisions</strong><br />Instead of asking what additional data might be useful, ask which decisions need to be made more quickly, more confidently or with greater precision. A metric only matters if it changes a decision.</p><p><strong>Translate decisions into signals</strong><br />Once decisions are clear, the next step is to name the behaviors or conditions that would trigger movement. These signals tie to action, connecting behavior to strategy.</p><p><strong>Then map signals to the data</strong><br />Only after the signals are understood does the question of data come into play. Which information reflects those signals? Which is reliable? Which is unnecessary? This prevents teams from collecting numbers for their own sake and turns data into something closer to what Nightingale built (which was a structure that makes responsibility visible).</p><figure><img alt=""A historic photograph of Florence Nightingale standing in a dark dress with lace details, wearing a white bonnet.

There’s a gap between what’s happening and what’s being said. The choice is to either declare the situation unfair and leave the responsibility where you found it… or you can step closer, notice what isn’t being noticed, and take on the work the institution isn’t prepared to do.</p><p>When Nightingale chose the second path and saw that conditions at Scutari were overwhelming, every excuse was available to her… war, fate, limited resources, the failures of others. Instead of accepting them, she studied what didn’t add up, verifying what the reports wouldn’t show. None of it was convenient. None of it was glamorous, and nearly all of it was thankless.</p><p>But as with every unquoted, that’s the work the greats take on.</p><p>Nightingale was trying to see the situation clearly enough that responsibility had somewhere to ‘land’. Her nighttime rounds weren’t mythology or symbolism. This was the work of a woman who understood that improvement begins where convenience ends.</p><p>It takes someone great to take on that kind of work.<br />She did, and it was about a lot more than a lamp.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3705e128c123"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/florence-nightingale-on-vanity-metrics-3705e128c123"">Florence Nightingale on vanity metrics</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
