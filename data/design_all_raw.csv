His head is tilted slightly forward, and the background is plain and light, keeping the focus on his face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jIlOmpINB0KlHodPMK5CZg.png"" /><figcaption>James Baldwin</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What’s the balance between protection and control?</strong></p><p>Early on, the difference is hard to see. A rule tightens, choices narrow, and it still feels like someone watching out for us. But the moment we’re told which questions are acceptable, the story stops being something we believe and becomes something we’re permitted to follow.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is </em><strong><em>unquoted, installment 14</em></strong><em>. This week, we’re looking at</em><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Baldwin""><em> James Baldwin</em></a><em> and the dynamics of controlling systems.</em></p><h3>Baldwin before Baldwin</h3><p>James Baldwin grew up in Harlem in the 1930s, in a neighborhood where the church was often the only institution offering structure, identity and a sense of direction. His stepfather was a preacher… strict, volatile, convinced the world was dangerous and that discipline was the only defense against it. Baldwin was taught early that love and fear could sound the same from the pulpit, and that protection could arrive in a tone that felt indistinguishable from control.</p><p>By adolescence, he was already <a href=""https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/james-baldwin"">writing</a>, already watching, already noticing how authority behaves when it’s anxious. He saw how parents and pastors tightened their grip (not because they were strong, but) when they were afraid… afraid of the world outside, afraid of losing their children to it, afraid of questions that didn’t have answers prescriptively laid out.</p><p>The punchline is that Baldwin left the church, but he never stopped studying its logic: the way belief gets inherited, the way fear gets institutionalized (let that sink in), and the way people learn to live inside systems that claim to protect them while shaping them into something… relatively insignificant.</p><p>What made Baldwin, <a href=""https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/james-baldwins-reckless-idea?srsltid=AfmBOoq3aGh7HlIOybdMwX47r4Ou62HOfMIWk2vdBNKZ2AiU4RtFowoI"">Baldwin wasn’t doctrine or theory. </a>Instead, it was his ability to see how systems (families, churches, nations, etc.) reveal their deepest insecurities in how they try to keep people “safe”. And how, in doing so, they confuse protection with control until the two become nearly indistinguishable.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo of James Baldwin standing in a dim room with one hand on his hip. He faces the camera directly, framed by a cluttered mantel on the left and a stacked bookshelf on the right. Drawings, books, and papers fill the space around him, giving the room a lived-in, intellectual feel. The light casts his shadow across the wall behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nSgJEuyNPhgi6gSGa3mJAg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>James Baldwin in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979. Photo: Pierre Boulat/Cosmos</figcaption></figure><h3>What Baldwin saw</h3><p>What Baldwin carried out of that childhood was clarity about how authority behaves when it feels uneasy. He noticed that the strictest rules often appeared when the people enforcing them felt threatened. When grips tightened, it wasn’t because the world required it; it was because the adults in charge didn’t know what to do with their own uncertainty.</p><p>He grew up watching beliefs passed down without examination, repeated out of habit, fear, or duty. Questioning them didn’t feel dangerous because of the ideas themselves, it felt dangerous because of what those questions exposed: How fragile the underlying certainty really was.</p><p><a href=""https://theconstitutionalist.org/2021/08/19/learning-to-love-like-james-baldwin/"">Baldwin learned that control often exposes the very vulnerability it intends to hide.</a></p><p>This became the thread running through his work. Whether he was writing about families, churches, or nations, he kept returning to the same observation: Systems that depend on obedience are rarely confident in their foundations. They appeal to safety, stability, or virtue, but what they are really protecting is the comfort of not having to reconsider themselves.</p><p>Baldwin didn’t need to catalogue every rule or doctrine. It was sufficient enough studying what people do when they’re afraid to face their own reflection.</p><h3>When fear becomes policy</h3><p>The dynamics Baldwin observed in the church weren’t confined to pulpits or families. You can see the same architecture anywhere a system confuses order with virtue and obedience with stability. Some cultures call it tradition, others morality, and some simply call it policy. But the structure is identical: fear becomes the rationale, and protection becomes the excuse.</p><p>You see it in countries where dissent is treated as contamination. The state offers “safety” in exchange for silence, promising harmony while making independent thought feel hazardous. Citizens learn to measure their words before they measure their ideas. Over time, people don’t become loyal; they become cautious. And while caution is easy to manage, history has shown this isn’t a foundation for stability.</p><p>You see it in religious movements convinced the world is deteriorating and that only strictness can save the next generation. Rules multiply. Curiosity becomes a liability. Children are raised not to understand their beliefs, but to repeat them as if conviction can survive without the capacity to question. It looks devout from the outside, but inside, it’s a culture afraid of the very people it claims to shepherd — held together by the oldest tool available: shame.</p><p>And you see it in political strategies designed to produce dependency. Systems remove options not because citizens can’t handle them, but because the system can’t. Policies become tight, resources shrink and the message becomes unmistakable: trust us, not yourself. The promise sounds like protection or worse: Equality. The effect feels more like containment, and the longer someone stays inside it, the harder it becomes to imagine leaving.</p><p>Across these contexts, fear has the opposite intended effect. It organizes around compliance rather than unity.</p><p>And compliance, once internalized, becomes something far more difficult to undo than force: <strong>it becomes normal.</strong></p><h3>Why control feels necessary</h3><p>Controlling systems (and people buying into it) rarely see themselves as controlling. They see themselves as managing risk. Uncertainty becomes the problem to solve, and predictability becomes the measure of whether the solution is working. Once that logic takes hold, the system begins to interpret any deviation (any question, new idea, independent choice, etc.) as evidence that the threat hasn’t been contained.</p><p>This is how control becomes rationalized.<br />Not moral, not ideological… <em>rational</em>.<br /> <br />A system anxious about its own stability starts treating unpredictability as danger, even when nothing dangerous is happening. Order becomes a proxy for safety. Obedience becomes a proxy for belonging, and the more fragile the system feels internally, the more rigid its rules become externally.</p><ul><li>In families, this shows up as an insistence that “good choices” are the ones that avoid discomfort.</li><li>In organizations, it shows up as leaders mistaking silence for alignment.</li><li>In societies, it shows up as policies built to prevent change rather than manage it.</li></ul><p>The irony is always the same: The tighter a system tries to hold things together, the more it reveals how afraid it is of letting people grow.</p><p>Control is a thing because a system doubts it can survive… not because a system is strong.</p><p><strong>In the end, control survives not on strength, but on the fear of what might happen without it.</strong></p><h3>The stories avoidance hands down</h3><p>Oddly enough, avoidance isn’t neglect. Avoidance is the explanation of which questions are allowed and which ones should never be asked. Every controlling system depends on stories that make it feel responsible. These are stories inherited so early and repeated so often that questioning them starts to feel like a breach. To Baldwin, these weren’t ideas or lessons. These were boundaries.</p><p>You can probably see where this is going.</p><p>The first layer is <strong>tradition</strong>. It hands us practices and expectations framed as stability. But tradition often survives because it saves people from having to examine what might change if they let themselves reconsider… well… tradition. Avoidance hides neatly inside continuity.</p><p><strong>History</strong> is next. Not as a record, but as a curated reassurance. A society (in power) decides which parts of its past are useful, and arranges them <strong>(or deletes them, as you might notice)</strong> accordingly. Once that arrangement feels authoritative, uncertainty becomes harder to entertain. Questioning the narrative reads as destabilizing, even when the narrative was assembled to prevent destabilization in the first place (if you can believe it).</p><p>Then <strong>morality</strong> steps in to seal the deal. Guidance becomes doctrine, doctrine becomes obligation, and obligation becomes a performance of virtue that relies on predictability rather than understanding. Baldwin saw how easily morality can be drafted into the service of avoidance. <strong>What I mean here, is how often systems reward people not for being thoughtful, but for being steady and compliant.</strong></p><p>And now we have a pattern. Avoidance becomes normal. The stories people inherit teach them to not ask questions. They close the space in which doubt can occur, and treat uncertainty as a sign of <strong>personal failure</strong>. The more these habits embed, the less the system needs to enforce anything. People maintain the limits themselves.</p><p>Baldwin’s clarity cuts cleanly here: O<strong>bedient systems train people to fear questions until avoiding them starts to feel like character.</strong></p><p><strong>If this feels like the moment everything clicks… good. We’re not done.</strong></p><h3>What control really creates</h3><p>Once avoidance becomes the operating logic of a system, something predictable happens to the people inside it: They stop developing the instincts they would need to live without the system’s protection. For Baldwin, this was the tragedy of control. It doesn’t just limit what people can do. It limits what they believe themselves capable of understanding.</p><p>When questions are treated as disruptions, people learn to ignore the parts of their lives that don’t fit the approved story.</p><p>People stop examining their assumptions. They stop trusting their own judgment and stop exploring ideas that might complicate the version of themselves the system prefers.</p><p>You know the consequences better than me. People grow uncomfortable with uncertainty. They choose predictability. They confuse obedience with maturity because obedience is the only behavior the system ever rewarded. And when faced with something that requires imagination, or skepticism, or self-direction, they hesitate…</p><p>I don’t think they hesitate because they lack intelligence. I think they hesitate because of a horrible failure that has taken a really long time to take effect.</p><p>Baldwin’s warning was never about the severity of limits. It was about their effect. <strong>Control produces people who expect someone else to name boundaries for them. </strong>Once that expectation settles in, the system doesn’t need to impose its authority. It simply waits for people to stay inside the lines on their own.</p><h3>The cost of making obedience a virtue</h3><p>The longer a system depends on avoidance, the harder it becomes to see the trade-off being made. Over time, people forget that their certainties were handed to them. They begin to speak as though they reached those conclusions on their own. That’s how avoidance starts looking like conviction.</p><p>This is where I think the damage shows up. Systems built on obedience don’t need to enforce much. People begin to manage themselves long after the original authority fades off. They sidestep questions that would be unsettling to the story they inherited. They’re able to seek out and maintain a stability they never chose and participate in their own containment because the alternative (actual examination) feels disloyal to the world that taught them not to question.</p><p>Baldwin leaves us with a hard truth:<br /><strong>Control doesn’t secure a system; It reduces the scale of the people inside it.</strong></p><p>Once that reduction feels normal, the system has very little to maintain. Avoidance passes from one generation to the next, each one repeating the scripts that make obedience sound eerily similar to maturity.</p><p>We tell ourselves we’re protecting what matters.</p><p>But protection without examination is something else entirely. It’s the refusal to imagine what someone might become if they were trusted with their own questions.</p><p><em>Unquoted is a series about the people and their ideas we can’t afford to forget.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b1eac97329cd"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-stories-that-keep-us-obedient-b1eac97329cd"">The stories that keep us obedient</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>The 19 critical decision moments where human judgment determines whether teams build the right things.</h4><figure><img alt=""Split illustration: left side shows teal circuit board patterns with data icons representing AI automation; right side shows coral-colored hands reaching toward a decision tree, representing human collaboration and judgment. The image visualizes how AI pattern-based reasoning and human meaning-based judgment work together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Pyk6n9NXC25HwSt2nWjYJg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>I watched a talented software team present three major features they’d shipped on time, hitting all velocity metrics. When I asked, “What problem do these features solve?” silence followed. They could describe what they’d built and how they'd built it. But they couldn’t articulate why any of it mattered to customers.</p><p>It wasn’t incompetence, but rather a loss of clarity in the rush to deliver — a failure of judgment, not execution. I’ve been in that room before — on the other side. I’ve watched teams I led ship features that solved problems no one had previously identified. The hard lesson: executing speed without clear judgment gets you to failure faster. Of course, timely execution remains vital, but discovery judgment has become the actual constraint.</p><p>Teams emphasize that judgment can’t be automated. Yet, AI clearly performs tasks that resemble judgment, such as identifying patterns, flagging contradictions, and synthesizing insights across dozens of interviews. So what’s the distinction that matters?</p><p>AI excels at <strong>pattern-based reasoning</strong>: recognizing correlations in data, clustering similar themes, and optimizing within defined parameters. Humans provide <strong>meaning-based judgment</strong>: interpreting what patterns signify about real needs, deciding which correlations reveal causation, and determining what’s worth pursuing given purpose and values.</p><p>The Discovery Judgment Framework helps teams systematically develop this capability. This article focuses on the framework’s first component: the 19 judgment points where meaning-based judgment — not just pattern recognition — determines whether teams build the right things.</p><h3>The Discovery Judgment Framework</h3><p>If you’re skeptical about “yet another framework,” that skepticism is earned. You’ve probably worked with Lean, Agile, Design Thinking, Jobs-to-Be-Done, OKRs, and dozens of others. Each contributes value — improving alignment, efficiency, and collaboration. But even the best frameworks cannot substitute for the quality of judgment applied within them. Framework fatigue typically occurs when teams adopt them without developing the judgment to use them effectively.</p><p>The <strong>Discovery Judgment Framework</strong> is different. It makes invisible judgment visible and systematically developable through four integrated components:</p><ol><li><strong>Judgment Points (Diagnostic)</strong>: Where judgment matters across the discovery-delivery-learning cycle.</li><li><strong>Quality Dimensions (Measurement)</strong>: How to assess judgment quality.</li><li><strong>Core Practices (Development)</strong>: How to strengthen judgment systematically.</li><li><strong>Maturity Model (Progression)</strong>: How judgment capability evolves.</li></ol><p>This doesn’t replace your existing discovery frameworks; it makes them more effective by revealing the quality of judgment they apply.</p><h3>Why These Judgment Points Matter Now</h3><p>As AI makes execution radically faster and cheaper, teams can now build the wrong things at unprecedented speed. What once took six months of misguided effort now takes six weeks, or with AI, six days.</p><p>As Teixeira and Braga (2025) warn in UX Collective’s State of UX in 2025 report, we’re witnessing “a fundamental shift in responsibilities and a transfer of design control from designers to a complex network of algorithms, automated tools, and business stakeholders.” The troubling trend? Teams are “slowly swapping user research for automated A/B tests, and gradually letting the data make decisions on our behalf.” This abdication of human judgment is precisely the problem.</p><p>Judgment density increases as AI accelerates delivery — the number of consequential decisions teams face per week skyrockets. Improving judgment quality isn’t optional; it’s the only scalable control mechanism for preventing algorithms from deciding what to build.</p><p>Teams committed to better discovery still struggle with a fundamental question: Where exactly do you apply judgment? Which decisions actually determine success or failure?</p><p>AI can now synthesize interviews in minutes, but only humans provide the judgment to interpret what patterns signify and decide what’s worth pursuing. Each judgment point is a moment where AI can either accelerate good judgment or amplify bad judgment. When humans interpret AI-generated insights, bias creeps in — we tend to confirm what we already believe and selectively interpret patterns.</p><p>Consider a typical moment where AI accelerates pattern recognition — but judgment still decides what matters.</p><p>A team building project management software conducts eighteen customer interviews. AI analysis flags that thirteen participants mentioned “estimates are always wrong.”</p><p>The team noticed what AI couldn’t: nine engineering managers were frustrated that their teams underestimated technical complexity, while four product managers were frustrated that stakeholders underestimated scope. Same symptom, opposing causes — one group needs better bottom-up estimation tools, the other needs better top-down scope definition.</p><p>Their decision: Interview three people from each group separately to understand the distinct jobs before proposing any solution.</p><p>AI accelerated pattern recognition from days to minutes. Only humans can judge that identical complaints mask fundamentally different problems that require separate discovery paths. As Gecis (2021) emphasizes in the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework, understanding the underlying “job” customers are trying to accomplish — not just surface-level feature requests — is essential for meaningful product decisions.</p><h3>The 19 Critical Judgment Points</h3><p>I’ve mapped the moments where discovery judgment determines outcomes. These judgment points will continue to evolve as practice deepens. Understanding them gives teams a way to see their reasoning, not just results. Discovery isn’t one decision — it’s a cascade of 19 interconnected judgment calls organized into four domains:</p><p><strong>Framing Judgment</strong>: defining the right problems to solve. Focuses on <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>: identifying customers, uncovering unmet needs, clarifying desired outcomes, mapping assumptions, and aligning on the opportunity worth pursuing.</p><p><strong>Solution Judgment</strong>: exploring and choosing how to solve them. Centers on <em>how</em> to generate and evaluate alternative approaches, balancing feasibility and value, sequencing risks, and deciding what to test first.</p><p><strong>Validation Judgment</strong>: interpreting evidence and learning from experiments. Addresses <em>what’s true</em>: setting confidence thresholds, interpreting results objectively, and deciding when to pivot, persist, or stop.</p><p><strong>Post-Delivery Judgment</strong>: learning from what happens after launch. Closes the loop: selecting which signals to track, recognizing emerging patterns, interpreting success or failure, and feeding insights back into discovery cycles.</p><figure><img alt=""A visual diagram showing 19 critical judgment points organized into four domains: Framing Judgment (purple), Solution Judgment (blue), Validation Judgment (green), and Post-Delivery Judgment (orange). Arrows show how judgment cycles continuously from discovery through delivery and back through post-delivery learning. Each domain contains 4–5 specific judgment points where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*QXnk5BOUTqwAxF49Yowvjw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>This diagnostic map illustrates where human reasoning has the most significant influence on product outcomes across four domains: Framing, Solution, Validation, and Post-Delivery. The arrows illustrate how judgment cycles: decisions feed forward through discovery and delivery, and loop back through post-delivery learning.</p><p>Teams don’t always apply all 19 judgment points in practice, but being aware of each one is essential — what’s unseen can’t be improved.</p><p>Here’s how this plays out in real product work.</p><h3>Two Example Judgment Points in Action</h3><p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A cross-functional product team is developing a Team Handoff Tracker — a tool designed to mitigate the chaos that occurs when work “falls between teams.” They’ve heard complaints about tasks “disappearing into a black hole” and assume the main problem is a lack of visibility across departments.</p><h4>1. Assumption Identification &amp; Risk Assessment</h4><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What assumptions are you making, and which are riskiest?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Treat “visibility” as an obvious need. Jump to dashboards and progress indicators without testing whether users actually value visibility.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: List assumptions explicitly: “Users lack visibility into task ownership,” “A dashboard will solve that,” “Teams will update it regularly.” Test the riskiest first. Result: Users don’t want more visibility — they want more transparent accountability.</p><p>As Krawczyk (2022) notes in his article on identifying product assumptions, teams are susceptible to confirmation bias (the longer it takes to test an assumption, the more we want it to be true) and commitment bias (the more effort we invest, the harder it is to pivot). Making assumptions explicit and testing the riskiest ones first protects against these biases.</p><h4>2. Evidence Interpretation</h4><p><strong>The scenario continues</strong>: Three months later, early pilot feedback appears promising. Users rate the tool “very helpful” and mention “clarity.”</p><p><strong>The judgment</strong>: What does this feedback actually mean?</p><p><strong>Poor approach</strong>: Interpret positive feedback as validation of the visibility hypothesis. Plan feature expansions. Miss that “clarity” meant something different — users valued knowing who to contact, not seeing every task’s status.</p><p><strong>Strong approach</strong>: Review qualitative comments line by line. Ask: “When you say ‘clarity,’ what kind?” Discover that the real need is accountability, not visibility. Pivot to emphasize ownership cues and handoff confirmations.</p><p><strong>Lesson</strong>: If those two judgment points seem small, consider what happens when even one goes wrong.</p><h3>How Judgment Errors Compound</h3><p>These judgment points don’t exist in isolation — they ripple across the system like dominoes.</p><p>A SaaS company interviews only enterprise clients, despite SMBs accounting for 70% of its revenue. This Customer Selection error cascades through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation — accumulating $315K over 10 months. The real need could have been validated in three weeks for under $10K.</p><figure><img alt=""A flowchart showing how a single poor judgment decision cascades through multiple stages. Starting with “Customer Selection” error (interviewing only enterprise clients), the diagram shows dominoes falling through Problem Framing, Solution Judgment, Feature Prioritization, and Evidence Interpretation. Each stage shows increasing cost and time investment, ending with $315K spent over 10 months to solve the wrong problem when the real solution could have been validated in 3 weeks for under $10K."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*bJm6WJGE0uzRp6pehjP3GQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Now consider AI’s impact: With AI-powered development, that same cascade might occur in five months instead of 10 months — you fail twice as fast, yet at the same total cost. AI doesn’t make bad judgment cheaper or less damaging — it just accelerates how quickly those judgment errors compound.</p><p>The same cascade works in your favour when early judgment is sound. A clear problem definition shortens solution cycles, tightens validation loops, and compounds learning.</p><p>This is why cross-functional judgment matters — different perspectives catch different errors. Diverse perspectives help teams identify flaws in assumptions and uncover alternative interpretations. A user researcher identifies Evidence Interpretation issues. An engineer identifies Technical Approach problems. A designer notices Problem Framing gaps. A customer success rep recognizes Opportunity Selection misalignment. Each perspective is a checkpoint against cascading failure.</p><p>(In smaller teams, these roles may overlap or not exist as separate positions — one person might play multiple roles. What matters isn’t the org chart, but ensuring these different perspectives inform decisions. The 19 judgment points remain critical regardless of team size or structure.)</p><h3>Discovery as Continuous Practice</h3><p>Most teams treat discovery as a phase; the best treat it as a habit. Discovery doesn’t stop at launch. It’s continuous: discover → deliver → learn → discover again.</p><p>After shipping, teams face a flood of signals. The challenge isn’t finding feedback — it’s making sense of it. Each post-delivery judgment point informs the next discovery cycle: Signal Selection shapes Customer Selection, Pattern Recognition refines Problem Framing, and Learning Extraction improves Evidence Interpretation.</p><p>As Beyer (2025) demonstrates in his guide to Teresa Torres’ Opportunity Solution Trees framework, continuous discovery requires ongoing customer touchpoints and systematic experimentation. Teams that treat discovery as continuous develop judgment faster. Every cycle sharpens judgment for the next cycle’s 19 judgment points. Over time, teams that make these decision points visible move from individual judgment to shared judgment — a collective sensemaking muscle that compounds learning.</p><h3>Assessing Your Team’s Judgment</h3><p>Use this quick self-assessment to identify where your team’s judgment most often falls short.</p><p>Many teams skip several judgment decisions, letting process and habit decide by default. This assessment makes them visible.</p><h4>Framing Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we validate the problem before building solutions?</li><li>Can we articulate the job our customers are trying to do?</li><li>Have we explicitly mapped assumptions?</li><li>Do we know which customer segments we’re serving and why?</li></ul><h4>Solution Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we test the riskiest assumptions first?</li><li>Can we explain why we rejected alternatives?</li><li>Do we prioritize based on risk and learning?</li><li>Have we generated multiple solution approaches before committing to one?</li></ul><h4>Validation Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we interpret evidence objectively?</li><li>Do we have explicit confidence thresholds?</li><li>When we pivot, can we articulate what evidence prompted the change?</li><li>Do we distinguish between what users say and what they mean?</li></ul><h4>Post-Delivery Judgment</h4><ul><li>Do we track the right signals after launch?</li><li>Do we extract learning systematically from outcomes?</li><li>How quickly do we incorporate post-launch insights into the discovery process?</li><li>Can we explain what success or failure taught us about our reasoning?</li></ul><p>Many teams find they’re stronger in some domains than others, and that balance shifts over time. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s visibility and deliberate improvement.</p><p>Focus on the domain that most needs strengthening. For <strong>Framing judgment</strong>: understand the underlying progress customers seek, not just what they say. For <strong>Solution judgment</strong>: generate three distinct approaches before committing. For <strong>Validation judgment</strong>: make confidence thresholds explicit and, as Nousis (2019) demonstrates, systematically test your biggest unknowns. For <strong>Post-Delivery judgment</strong>: track the right signals, extract insights, and feed them back into the discovery process.</p><p>Knowing which parts of your judgment need strengthening is the first step toward improvement — and self-awareness is where progress begins.</p><h3>Your Next Move</h3><p>You now have a diagnostic tool. You can:</p><ul><li>See where your team’s judgment is strong versus where it needs strengthening</li><li>Identify which judgment points you’re skipping entirely</li><li>Trace which judgment points have caused your biggest failures</li><li>Map how poor decisions early cascade later</li></ul><p>Here’s your three-step action plan:</p><ol><li><strong>Review the 19 judgment points with your team.</strong> Identify which points you’re skipping and which have caused your biggest failures.</li><li><strong>Pinpoint the three judgment points that most need strengthening.</strong> Use the assessment questions to diagnose where judgment breaks down most often.</li><li><strong>Choose ONE judgment point to address in your next sprint.</strong> Don’t try to fix everything. Start with your most prominent blind spot.</li></ol><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>The Discovery Judgment Framework’s diagnostic component — the 19 Judgment Points — maps where meaning-based judgment determines success across Framing, Solution, Validation, and Post-Delivery domains.</li><li>AI excels at pattern-based reasoning, identifying correlations and clustering themes, but only humans provide meaning-based judgment to interpret what patterns signify and decide what’s worth pursuing.</li><li>As AI increases judgment density, the number of consequential decisions rises — making judgment quality the highest-leverage area for improvement.</li><li>Judgment points cascade — early errors compound, but strong early framing multiplies learning and value.</li><li>Cross-functional judgment catches cascading errors — diverse perspectives spot different failures at different points.</li><li>Start with diagnosis: identify the three judgment points that most need strengthening before trying to strengthen all 19.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Beyer, S.

<h4>What do the last five years of academic research tell us about how design is changing?</h4><figure><img alt=""Slightly abstract clay sculpture of a human head, with a serious tone"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eSMmoOfViZP5xEds"" /><figcaption>AI is reshaping the UX practitioner.

How can we cut through the static to see the real picture?</p><p>Enter academia.</p><p>Over the past five years, numerous academic journal papers have been published about AI and UX design. While the wheels of academia turn slowly, we get a significant trade-off for its glacial pace: objectivity and methodical rigour.</p><p>In other words: a healthy dose of perspective.</p><p>The goal of this article is to summarise academic findings relating to four questions:</p><ol><li>Where is AI being used in the UX design process?</li><li>What are the advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design?</li><li>How do UX design practitioners feel about using AI?</li><li>What are the takeaways for future use of AI in UX design?</li></ol><p>The key sources for this article are two <a href=""https://library.leeds.ac.uk/info/1404/literature-searching/15/systematic-reviews"">systematic reviews</a> from 2025: one <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">published in <em>Advances of Human-Computer Interaction</em></a>, and another <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">available on the open-access scholarly platform ArXiv</a>. In total, this article summarises findings from 17 academic sources which are referenced at the end. Typically, these studies base their findings on surveys, interviews, focus groups and other research methods to collect insights from UX and HCI practitioners.</p><p>So forget everything you’ve read from LinkedIn hype merchants, ‘thought leaders’ or doom-mongers.</p><p>Let’s summarise what the science says.</p><h3>1. Where AI is used in the design process</h3><p>The highest usage of AI in UX design is in the <strong>testing</strong> phase, suggests <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">one of our 2025 systematic reviews</a>. According to this paper, 58% of studied AI usage in UX is in either the testing or discovery stage. This maybe shouldn’t be surprising, considering generative AI for visual ideation and UI prototyping has lagged behind text generation.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing number of studies looking at AI usage in UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*68bsGgzn3STeRh1mRsJtEA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AI usage in the UX design process (Luo, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what AI’s commonly being used for in each design stage:</p><h4>Discovery</h4><ul><li>Identifying design problems</li><li>Understanding user needs and behaviours</li><li>Creating user personas</li></ul><h4>Ideation</h4><ul><li>Co-creating solution concepts</li><li>Exploring design alternatives</li><li>Predicting product values</li></ul><h4>Prototyping</h4><ul><li>Generating UI designs</li><li>Converting sketches to prototypes</li><li>Checking for GUI guideline violations</li></ul><h4>Testing</h4><ul><li>Predicting user experience</li><li>Identifying usability issues (e.g. heuristic evaluations)</li><li>Planning and analysing user testing</li></ul><p>In terms of what AI tools UX practitioners are using, here’s a breakdown which is both informative but already slightly out of date:</p><figure><img alt=""Graph showing AI usage in UX design with ChatGPT leading the way"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*prI1D36s13QeOnnQG-taug.png"" /><figcaption>Frequency of AI models used across UI/UX design studies (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>Summary</h4><p>UX practitioners are clearly making use of AI across the design process, with ChatGPT being the most popular tool.</p><p>However, while ideation and prototyping with AI gains a lot of attention, it’s the <em>testing</em> phase where the most studies have examined utilising AI — and it’s also significantly studied in the discovery phase. This disparity may even out as AI continues to improve at generating UI designs.</p><h3>2. Advantages and drawbacks of using AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve grouped these insights from academic papers into broad themes. You can see that for every benefit of using AI in the UX design process, there are risks and pitfalls to avoid.</p><h4>Speed, cost and quality</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>AI can speed up UX design in numerous ways, from research and ideation to prototyping and testing. For example, it can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3658619.3658628"">accelerate concept iteration</a> in the early stages of the design process compared to traditional UX methods. This has obvious implications in terms of <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10115412"">reducing delivery timeframes and project costs</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Seahorse design concept generated by the AI tool Midjourney"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AJ0q0Q62hV8bx5KL984ECQ.png"" /><figcaption>Concept co-creation with Midjourney (Maceli, Smith and Bhakta, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> AI generated design ideas can be <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">homogeneous, generic and lacking in consistency</a>, meaning the time and cost of human input must be considered to ensure the final designs are sufficiently distinct and cohesive. (That is, if we care about designing better — or simply good — solutions, and not just <em>faster </em>solutions.)</p><h4>Efficiency versus innovation</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>The use of AI can <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">relieve UX designers from mundane and tedious tasks</a>, allowing them to concentrate on activities that require more critical thinking and emotional engagement. Essentially, there are huge opportunities to offload a lot of grunt work to AI systems. But designers need to be careful about this, because…</p><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-reliance on AI designs could lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3409120.3410638"">fixation on minor optimisations rather than out-of-the-box thinking</a>. This means designers need to find a balance between efficiency and innovation — by avoiding dependence on AI where human creativity and agency would add value leading to better solutions.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing what AI can and cannot do in the design process"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kAEQ1IPqJKQJX2eDBMU65g.png"" /><figcaption>What AI can and can’t do (Li et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Skills and development</h4><p><strong>Advantages: </strong>There’s clear <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404983.3405506"">potential for AI to lower the skill threshold required for designers</a> in UX. Which makes sense, as prompting is easier to learn than all the features and functionality of Figma. This change allows a wider range of people to contribute design ideas without traditional visual design tool skills.</p><figure><img alt=""Series of sketched, designed and generated UI screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1007/1*lKKQRvtXf8KGR-nH2anUPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Sketched input versus manual design and generated AI output (Buschek, Anlauff and Lachner, 2020)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Drawbacks: </strong>Over-dependence on generative AI tools might impede development for UX novices, as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615335.3623035"">repetitive tasks help cultivate UX design skills and judgement</a>. Junior designers might be at higher risk of negative cognitive effects from AI generally, as <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">young people exhibit higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking skills</a>.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>It’s a mixed bag, basically. For all the opportunities that AI brings to UX design, there are plenty of challenges and traps practitioners can fall into. Some of these issues will be solved by technology improving, but others require skilful and mindful integration of AI into UX design processes.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing challenges using AI in UX design with hallucinations at the top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kmOGmOvjO0jbcZVAOwLvGQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI challenges in UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>3. How UX practitioners feel about using AI</h3><p>These are reflections from UX professionals about their experiences of using AI in the design process. I’ve categorised them as either positive or negative sentiments, adding a few comments of my own (in parentheses).</p><h4>Positives</h4><ul><li>Using AI in the design process can make <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">UX practitioners feel both more effective and efficient</a>. (I hesitate to use the phrase ‘super-powered’, as The Incredibles tells us: when everyone’s super, no-one is.)</li><li>Designing with AI helps develop skills in prompting, which is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">emerging as a core design skill</a>. (It’s surely only a matter of time before we start seeing <em>Prompting is Designing</em> UX books hitting the shelves.)</li><li>Generating design variants with <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3661624"">AI avoids the ‘blank page’ problem</a>, where UX designers struggle to get started. (Even for professionals, the blank canvas of a design file can sometimes be intimidating.)</li><li>Collaboration with AI can<em> </em>feel like a <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">complementary partnership between human cognition and AI technology</a>. (Similar to a senior designer guiding a junior designer.)</li><li>Using <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660703"">AI helps facilitate collaboration with stakeholders</a> by streamlining idea sharing and exploration. (Basically, AI can help make the sometimes arcane practice of UX clearer and more accessible to stakeholders.)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Four photos from a design focus group on AI, showing people with colourful sticky notes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1012/1*zmWAQEFMce3Ca1vsl6AkyQ.png"" /><figcaption>Focus group on AI and UX collaboration (Wang et al., 2024)</figcaption></figure><h4>Negatives</h4><ul><li>Designing with AI can also feel like being a <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1404647/full"">client commissioning a contractor rather than <em>designing</em></a>. (In other words: designers can feel like the AI is doing the fun, creative bits while they write the brief.)</li><li>When UX designers feel like they’ve outsourced creative tasks, it can lead to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3491101.3503564"">diminished sense of ownership over the results</a>. (How invested can you be if you didn’t even draw a single rectangle?)</li><li>Creating an effective prompt can be a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">time-intensive process with a high cognitive burden</a>. (Although in future this could be mitigated by refining prompting templates and support resources.)</li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><p>The positives outweigh the negatives, but there are clear issues to resolve. This includes UX practitioners’ sense of identity as designers, as well as the time and mental effort required to craft effective prompts, generate outputs and carry out continual refinements.</p><h3>4. Takeaways for future use of AI in UX design</h3><p>I’ve tried to categorise these suggestions into meaningful themes. They typically crop up in the discussion and conclusion sections of academic papers.</p><h4>AI increases efficiency, but people still matter</h4><p>The biggest impact of AI in UX design is the <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">increased efficiency across the design process</a>. However, AI cannot replace human interpersonal communication, collaboration, creativity or originality; therefore it’s important to <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642114"">balance pursuing efficiency while preserving the human-centred nature of UX design</a>.</p><h4>Humans need to remain in the loop</h4><p>UX designers should adopt a <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/human-in-the-loop"">human-in-the-loop</a> approach to validate AI output, improve model performance and <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10034833"">avoid overreliance on automated systems</a>. However, designers should be mindful that <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512943"">AI tools could potentially <em>reinforce</em> their existing biases</a> instead of challenging them. This is an area where critical thinking skills are absolutely, well, critical.</p><figure><img alt=""Word cloud with prompt engineering, real-time feedback and modular design featuring prominently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/1*RurZhxCwxTpuUlk--9Yg1w.png"" /><figcaption>Word cloud of best practices for AI and UI/UX design (Ahmed and Imran, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h4>AI policies are needed for ethical practice</h4><p>Adoption of AI <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04469"">must be ethical and inclusive as well as efficient</a>. To alleviate concerns about ethics, data privacy, ownership, and accountability, organisations should <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3643834.3660720"">set up and communicate policies on AI usage</a>. Too many UX practitioners are still driving ahead, often alone, without clear internal strategies or policies for generative AI.</p><h4>UX designers need specific AI training</h4><p>To successfully integrate AI into design team processes and workflows, UX practitioners would <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10382802"">benefit from training to develop proficiency</a> in crafting and refining prompts, assessing and criticising AI-generated output, and accounting for AI intricacies and limitations. There’s a world of difference between dabbling with AI in design and using it as effectively as possible.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>So what’s the story? How <em>is</em> AI impacting UX design?</p><p>Well, it’s clear from the academic studies that traditional design methods are being innovated: UX practitioners are harnessing AI, leading to efficiencies and lowering costs for organisations in the process. The benefits are undeniable. UX design has fundamentally changed in the past 2–3 years, and it’s probably career suicide to deny that.</p><p>In fact, more UX designers might need to let go of conventional design stages and activities to <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/ahci/3869207"">allow for even <em>more</em> innovative processes empowered by AI</a>. For example, strictly adhering to established workflows and handover processes ignores the potential to go from concept to functional, testable solution rapidly with AI.</p><p>However, there are potential drawbacks if AI usage in UX design is over-relied on, and used mindlessly. Without sufficient critical thinking, we can easily end up with generic, biased designs that don’t actually solve user problems. In some cases, we might even spend too much time on prompting and vibing with AI when we could have simply sketched or prototyped something ourselves — creating more sense of ownership in the process.</p><p>Many of these findings might feel obvious to a lot of people. But of course the point of rigorous research is often to validate what you <em>think </em>you already know. This deep dive into academia shows us what we really <em>do </em>know, for sure.

<h4>Is design standing in the way of me showing up in community?</h4><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from TheNapMinistry Threads that says ““Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C7FlVluvY4cAD69gy3ui3g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/DPkNek0ke20/?hl=en"">I recently saw a post</a> from The Nap Ministry that said:</p><blockquote><em>“Hey, here to say you don’t have to start a project, club, new invention or initiative as we focus on community, connection and the analog world. You can just hang out with your friends, say hello to your neighbor and spend more time offline.”</em></blockquote><p>The post struck a chord in me. I’m often the first to create a themed party or a logo for an event. I love a well-designed gathering with intentional activities and plans. But reading the post, it also made me think about all the times where I got stuck in the planning phase and never got to actually “doing” the thing I was planning in detail because I ran out of time or energy.</p><p>As much as curated spaces, planned interactions, crafted products, and intentional takeaways can enhance experiences and deepen connection, could too much design also stand in the way of us building and engaging in real communities?</p><p>What really happens when we overly design our communities?</p><h3>When we overly design, planning halts action.</h3><p>Planning the perfect event or building the perfect structure can feel productive, but it often becomes a stall. We wait until the idea is polished, until the branding feels right, until the schedule lines up, until we can justify gathering people around something that looks “enough.”</p><p>We often say that design is about iteration, but in practice, the planning and polishing can take over. The more we perfect something, the further we drift from the natural rhythms that actually allow community to form. Real connection needs space to unfold in ways we can’t predict. We don’t know what will happen — and that’s the point.</p><p>Community doesn’t usually grow from perfection. It grows from proximity. It grows from repetition. It grows from the very ordinary act of being around each other without needing a grand reason.</p><p>Sometimes a simple “want to grab a coffee?” is more powerful than a six-part series with a mission statement. Sometimes sitting on the couch while someone cooks dinner does more than any beautifully crafted activation. Sometimes an unplanned walk with a neighbor teaches us more about connection than a structured meetup ever could.</p><p>Starting small keeps the door open. It lowers the stakes. It reminds us that community isn’t something we architect; it’s something we practice. And the more we practice, the easier it becomes to move from idea to action without needing the perfect design as permission.</p><p>If we want more community, the answer is often simple: start where we are, with what we have, and with whoever is already nearby.</p><h3>When we overly design, ordinary engagements can become exclusive clubs.</h3><p>There’s a difference between creating supportive structure and shaping something so tightly that only certain people feel welcome. Over-designing can quietly turn everyday engagements into exclusive clubs, even when the intention is inclusivity.</p><p>I recently read the article <a href=""https://www.notion.so/Designing-or-not-for-community-289649f8ce0b80ff94ede7742537e55e?pvs=21""><em>We’ve Squeezed the “Life” Out of Civic Life</em></a> by Sam Pressler for Connective Tissue, which explores how professionalism can stand in the way of true civic life. He writes:</p><p><em>“When we create ‘spaces’ or build ‘fields’ — as we’ve done throughout the social sector — we end up professionalizing and specializing sets of activities. And when we professionalize and specialize these activities, we signal that these activities are only for some people and not for everyone else. Professionalization and credentialization can help increase the ‘quality’ of practice within a field, but this is done by intentionally erecting barriers to that practice. These barriers show up through the training and credentialing activities themselves, and through the creation of insider cultures, languages, and networks.”</em></p><p>Pressler describes this as “professionalized management,” but it’s also another way of thinking about overly designed community spaces. We build structures to optimize and make things efficient, but when it comes to relationships, those same structures can quietly become obstacles for the dedicated people who were showing up and putting in time from the start.</p><p>He continues:</p><p><em>“The creeping professionalization of civic life has shifted the everyday democracy responsibilities of community membership and participation to the domain of nonprofit management. As credentialed managers assume the roles once held by ordinary citizens and neighbors, formal programs take the place of informal groups and activities, and participation and membership become experiences that are channeled and controlled rather than seen as holistic ways of being.”</em></p><p>When we professionalize or overly design the spaces meant to bring us together, we risk losing the informal, everyday participation that community depends on. Work shifts from ordinary neighbors to credentialed managers. We move from organic connection to structured programs and in the midst of it all, we loose sight on the natural rhythms of relationships. To keep engagement open and alive, we have to leave room for the unpolished, the unplanned, and the people who show up simply because they care.</p><h3>When we overly design, we limit surprise and magic.</h3><p>Many social clubs now have robust brands and curated activities that look more like shopping experiences than the social gatherings we used to know. In the article <a href=""https://grouphug.substack.com/p/what-we-lose-when-optimizing-community""><em>What We Lose When Optimizing Community</em></a>, community builder Elise Granata explores what we lose when we “Shopify” our social lives.</p><p>Run clubs, social retreats, and book clubs use polished online presences to attract members and entice participation. These experiences are meant to support us in the loneliness epidemic, but Granata highlights how their branded, tightly designed nature can create a barrier. We start to feel like we need to know exactly what we’ll get out of something before we go. We scan social accounts and websites to decide if it’s for us. The element of surprise disappears, and we show up expecting an outcome — or as Granata says, <em>“We lose the feeling that comes with a little mystery and a healthy amount of risk.”</em></p><blockquote><em>“When we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen, you know what happens? We get to be surprised.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>— Elise Granata</em></blockquote><p>This focus on expectation can get in the way of simply being with what is and letting curiosity and surprise guide our next moves.</p><p><a href=""https://www.priyaparker.com/the-new-rules-of-gathering"">Priya Parker</a> says every gathering needs a purpose. While I agree in some ways, there’s also a magic in the unplanned spaces that emerge from the natural <strong>rhythms of relationships.</strong> Reading a book while a friend watches reels. Crafting while someone is cooking. “Time together” might be the purpose, but does it really have to be predetermined?</p><p>Sometimes the purpose only emerges after the event has already happened. The people who show up create the purpose together rather than blend into a pre-determined one. Pre-determined purposes can end up placing expectations on what something is and isn’t.</p><h3>Finding the balance</h3><p>One of my guiding practices in design these days is to not only ask <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-how-might-we-to-at-what-cost-b635a595afd2""><em>how might we</em> but also <em>at what cost</em>.</a> This helps mitigate unintended consequences. Sometimes the thing we want to design for becomes the very thing we design against if we’re not careful.</p><p>Community, relationships, and connection are messy, unpredictable, and unpolished — and that’s where the magic happens. If we want real connection, we have to leave space for magic to unfold as we just hang out with our friends, say hello to our neighbors, or spend more time offline.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=2b5abca0046a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-or-not-for-community-2b5abca0046a"">Designing (or not) for community</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI for Non-Techies</h4><p>I spent my first week diving headfirst down the Lovable rabbit hole while building my course for<a href=""https://www.moonlearning.io/""> moonlearning.io</a> for non-technies.</p><figure><img alt=""no hype beginner tips"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMWfpyD76-3hExUc-fUdOg.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Spoiler: I didn’t ship a unicorn before breakfast, but I did come out with a grounded beginner guide to get you started right.</blockquote><p>From the outside, Lovable looks almost too simple: type a prompt, boom, full-stack app.<br />Inside? A whole different ecosystem nobody prepares you for.</p><p>This first week taught me far more than I expected. No hype, no “SaaS in 10 minutes” screenshots, just the parts that genuinely helped me move, build, and understand how the tool actually is set up and behaves.</p><p>Here’s the beginner’s map I wish I had on day one:</p><h3>1. Your first prompt quietly decides your fate</h3><p>Your first prompt matters more than people think. It sets the tone for the entire build. Write it like a mini blueprint:</p><figure><img alt=""promting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zQFhLxBP7bxN0HOmh_oQOQ.gif"" /></figure><p><strong>What I’m building =</strong> project overview<br /><strong>Who it’s for =</strong> target users<br /><strong>Main pages</strong> <strong>=</strong> app structure + future flow<br /><strong>Key feature</strong>s <strong>=</strong> core functionality + what’s coming later (login, payment…)<br /><strong>Design vibe =</strong> visual direction<br /><strong>What not to do = </strong>guardrails + exclusions<br /><strong>Ask for help = </strong>Tell Lovable to review the prompt and ask questions before building.</p><p>Fill this out with your vision and plan, then ask another LLM, like ChatGPT, to improve it for Lovable use.</p><p>📌 <strong>Extra Tip:</strong> If the first result feels messy or off, <strong>don’t try to rescue it</strong>. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.</p><h3>2. The Custom Knowledge file is the project’s brain!</h3><p>It's a bit hidden inside your settings, but it's fantastic! You drop in the rules and context you want, and Lovable carries them through everything it builds. You don’t need long essays, just a few sharp lines. Anything you’re sick of repeating goes here, and Lovable remembers it for the whole project. It’s not code. It’s guidance.</p><figure><img alt=""custom knowledge"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pg15n6Oj9xe-LH51nzoLtw.png"" /></figure><h3>3. Learn the modes, or you’ll go in circles</h3><p><strong>Agent Mode → </strong>Builds, refactors, and gets things done.<br /><strong>Chat Mode → </strong>A space to think out loud without touching your code.<br /><strong>Code Mode → </strong>The raw editor when you want full control.<br /><strong>Visual Edit → </strong>Make quick, intuitive changes right on the screen.</p><figure><img alt=""modes"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1oK5UdpohUvQX60OpmFCeg.png"" /></figure><p>The moment you understand when to switch, your stress level drops by half. And yes, it’ll save you some money too, since you’re not burning tokens on accidental work.</p><h3>4. Version history will save your sanity</h3><p>Jump back. Preview. Restore.<br />Edit old messages to explore a different path without trashing your current work. This is the closest Lovable gets to emotional support.</p><figure><img alt=""histiry"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0CO2mUOaGu2tAe8Nzabd3A.png"" /></figure><h3>5. Designers, breathe</h3><p>Visual Edit is not Figma.<br />You’ll get “functional Tailwind energy,” not pixel poetry.</p><p>Good enough to ship is where we’re at.<br />I’m going down the rabbit hole on how to improve this, plus working on a Figma Make course, so make sure you subscribe to my <a href=""https://www.moonlearning.io/newsletter"">newsletter</a>, and I'll be happy to keep you posted.</p><h3>6. Security is surprisingly handled well</h3><p>This used to be my loudest anxiety.<br />Lovable runs a pre-publish health check: exposed keys, weird logic, risky pages… all flagged with explanations and fixes.</p><figure><img alt=""error"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qO9fwumn_NNSnuETcKATaA.png"" /></figure><p>You still need to care, but you don’t start from zero.<br />Dev friends: I’d love your take here, since security isn't my superpower and it matters. So please DO comment!</p><h3>7. Cloud without fear</h3><p>Lovable Cloud runs on Supabase, but you never touch Supabase directly.<br />No dashboards. No wiring. No random SQL from StackOverflow.</p><figure><img alt=""cloud"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uSmw-ispL_jxQN4iOvAJfw.png"" /></figure><p>You just say “Add login” and it sets up the database, auth, tables, storage, and security.<br />Non-tech builders finally unclench here.</p><h3>8. Use AI features with zero setup</h3><p>Summaries, chatbots, translations, sentiment checks, document Q&amp;A — already wired in. (You only pay extra for the LLM usage.)</p><figure><img alt=""integrated API"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Gnch_TKIeCYQuuGLRShD5A.png"" /><figcaption>Ready-to-use APIs in Lovable</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Stripe →</strong> Handles payments for your app.<br /> <strong>OpenAI →</strong> Adds AI features using OpenAI models.<br /> <strong>Anthropic →</strong> Adds AI features using Claude models.<br /> <strong>Resend →</strong> Sends emails through a modern email API.<br /> <strong>Clerk →</strong> Manages users, auth, and identities.<br /> <strong>Three.js →</strong> Builds interactive 3D graphics.<br /> <strong>D3.js →</strong> Creates data-driven visualisations.<br /> <strong>Highcharts →</strong> Produces polished charts and dashboards.<br /> <strong>p5.js →</strong> For creative coding and interactive visuals.<br /> <strong>Runware →</strong> Generates images from text.<br /> <strong>ElevenLabs →</strong> High-quality text-to-speech.<br /> <strong>Make →</strong> Visual tool for automating workflows.<br /> <strong>Replicate →</strong> Runs and fine-tunes open-source AI models.<br /> <strong>Stability AI →</strong> Open-model image generation and more.<br /> <strong>Twilio →</strong> Adds SMS and communication features.<br /> <strong>n8n →</strong> Visual workflow automation with integrations.</p><p><strong>And if Lovable doesn’t support an API yet, you can drop the docs into the chat, and it still hooks it up!</strong><br />As someone who used to fear API integrations… this felt like witchcraft.</p><h3>9. Learn prompting! It changes everything</h3><p>Use <strong>location + behaviour + guardrails</strong>.<br /> “On /settings, add X. It should do Y. Don’t touch Z.”</p><p>Break tasks into small pieces — max three at a time.</p><p>📌 <strong>Magic trick:</strong> add this to your main prompts: <br /><em>“Ask me anything you need to understand this prompt fully.”</em>Lovable slows down, asks questions, and builds what you <em>meant</em>, not what you accidentally wrote. SOOOOOO GOOD!</p><h3>10. Working on it!</h3><p>Any good list has 10 points, right? Well, this is a work in progress!</p><h3>My honest summary after week one</h3><p>A full rollercoaster.<br />At first, it feels like magic. Then you realise (like any real tool) you still need to understand how it thinks.<br />You still need docs ( I did that for you and summarised them in the course!)<br />You still need to level up your prompts.<br />You still need to shift from “instant SaaS” to “collaborating with a very fast robot.”</p><p>And that’s fine.</p><p>Lovable isn’t a replacement for thinking.<br />It’s a multiplier for anyone who typically gets locked out of the building.</p><blockquote>And if today’s version feels clunky… remember this:<br /><strong>In AI, today is the worst this tool will ever be.</strong><br />The curve is brutally fast.

<h4><strong>As AI mirrors how we design and learn, our role evolves from creating interfaces to defining the signals that shape intelligent experiences.</strong></h4><blockquote>A quick note before we dive in. This essay continues the thinking I introduced in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d""><em>From design to direction: bridging product design and AI thinking</em></a>. While it is not required reading, it might give helpful context as I build on some of the ideas from that earlier exploration. Do not worry, I will be here when you return.</blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a signal plus a robot element representing AI will lead towards more targeted generative experiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*RMLNlIo1dX8HPoHTnndtPQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration for how signals will be key in a more generative experiential future.</figcaption></figure><p>In my first thought piece, I discussed how AI concepts overlap with the work of product designers as we optimize across three key levels: the interfaces we aim to make frictionless, the journeys that help users find value, and the connection to the business outcomes we hope to achieve.</p><p>That work is becoming even more important today. As AI-driven and generative tools move into our day-to-day workflows, the experiences we design no longer stop at the interface. Interfaces can now generate, adapt, and learn from what users do next. The quality of those learning loops depends on the quality of the signals we build into them.</p><p>As we move from static interfaces to generative ones, understanding the signals produced by our experiences and how those signals tie back to a user’s intent becomes foundational. These signals help generative systems reduce model loss, meet expectations, and continue doing what we care about most: helping people make progress in ways they find meaningful.</p><p>In this essay, I will share an approach for connecting instrumentation efforts to high-level business goals and how that prepares us to map signals to intent in ways that shape iterative optimization loops for generative experiences.</p><h3>Understanding what to measure: defining meaning before data</h3><p>There is a lot of writing out there about instrumentation and telemetry, so I will only touch on the basics here. Many of us have heard terms like attrition, cart abandonment, or error rate. We usually hear them through conversations with product managers who reference these numbers as indicators of progress or where improvements are sought after. But I would ask you if you truly know terms like these mean when thinking about the bigger picture?</p><p>Let’s start simple and work out from there by settling on two things. First, let’s define t<a href=""https://www.intercom.com/blog/finding-the-metrics-that-matter-for-your-product/"">elemetry as the raw data we collect.</a> Instrumentation, on the other hand, is the act of deciding which of those data points matter.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating websites with numerous signals causing confusion for AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*_UH2OjwJE7okOjG565EFBQ.png"" /><figcaption>Imagine signals as a bunch of news stations all going at once at the same time with the same volume. Just like how we would be unable to focus intelligently, the same can be said for AI.</figcaption></figure><p>We could instrument every single action in a product, but without knowing what is <em>truly</em> meaningful, all we have is noise. The same challenge applies to AI systems, believe it or not. A model trained on large amounts of similar data might recognize correlations, but without context or intent, it cannot know where to focus.</p><p>Deciding what matters does two things. It guides our analysis toward insight instead of noise, and it makes our systems more efficient. Over-instrumentation, taught to me by my data and analytics partners at a prior role, increases storage and processing costs and makes it harder for both humans and machines to understand what users are trying to do.</p><p>By deciding what to focus on before we collect data, we can curate meaningful signals. These signals connect behavior to intent and intent to organizational outcomes. That is the foundation of this framework: shaping experience data so it becomes direction for both product teams and intelligent systems. Bare with me and let’s talk business.</p><h3>Defining what matters</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting certain telemetry signals being selected for instrumentation efforts to educate our teams and AI tools."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*xlEncsYKVieJ1yf2Zia9_A.png"" /><figcaption>When we contextualize signals around what is meaningful, both our teams and AI can start to make sense of all the noise.</figcaption></figure><p>When we design digital experiences, countless events occur on the front end and back end. Some happen autonomously, some because of user actions. Each is a potential signal, but we need a structured way to interpret them. One useful lens is <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/personas-jobs-be-done/""><em>Jobs to Be Done</em></a> (JTBD).</p><figure><img alt=""Framework illustration listing, from top down, company goal, organizational goal(s), Measurement objectives/OKRs, KPIs, and Signals to show how these support one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*aDjnFLyYqaFkBQOawVNIIw.png"" /><figcaption>Each row, from the bottom, should ladder up and support the goals above them to create a stable structure connecting in product signals up to company goals.</figcaption></figure><p>To start, most companies, no matter their size, are fundamentally trying to create value and generate revenue. If we acknowledge that end goal, we can place it at the top of our framework. You may already be familiar with terms like <a href=""https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/pricing-strategies-and-sales-proposals/get-to-know-your-revenue-model""><em>Average Contract Value</em> (ACV) or <em>Average Order Value</em> (AOV)</a>. These are common ways organizations measure growth and understand how customers perceive the value they offer.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating overall framework with AOV filled in at top for company goal conveying all subsequent elements support this high-level goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*L59_F2lwhp5oHu-wNIHPhQ.png"" /><figcaption>We always need to identify the reason we do what we do, and typically it involves money.</figcaption></figure><p>Within companies, different groups support the business in different ways. For example, a large online store might have a website team focused on the digital shopping experience and a customer support team helping customers resolve issues. If increasing AOV is a company priority, the website team may set a goal like:</p><blockquote><strong>Improve cross-sell or upsell effectiveness.</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example organizational goal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*Adbi0dEL7_2z-nH_oUf97Q.png"" /><figcaption>Various internal organizations will have their own goals typically created at executive levels.</figcaption></figure><p>From there, we next have the <em>Measurement Objective</em>. This is where we identify the type of behavior we want to influence to support the organizational goal. It is common for multiple measurement objectives to exist for the same goal, especially in larger companies.</p><p>In our online store example, one measurement objective might be encouraging users to add additional items before checking out. To make this meaningful, we can express it as an OKR. Atlassian has a helpful overview of<a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr""> how OKRs function</a> in cross-functional teams if the concept is new.</p><p>A possible OKR might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase average items per cart from 1.6 to 1.9.</strong></blockquote><p>This is still fairly high-level, usually tied to a quarter or fiscal year, but it moves us closer to meaningful, measurable work.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example measurement objective added."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*fW7-KK5eZrBE0Y1H_WikAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Remember OKRs are not KPIs and sit at a higher level.</figcaption></figure><p>Below this sits the <em>Key Performance Indicator </em>(KPI) layer. KPIs are the specific metrics we can directly influence through design and iteration. They give us the levers we can adjust and monitor as we learn. If KPIs feel a little abstract, Asana has a <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">great explanation</a> of how teams use them as measurable signals of progress.</p><p>A related KPI might be:</p><blockquote><strong>Increase add-to-cart rate for recommended items by fifteen percent this quarter.</strong></blockquote><p>This gives teams something concrete to experiment with, design for, and measure.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of framework with example KPI filled in."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*muzWF_MjqtyjYKFjUOB4-w.png"" /><figcaption>KPIs can rotate quarterly (common) and still leave room for teams to ideate on how to meet that particular goal.</figcaption></figure><p>With all of this in place, we now have a path from:</p><blockquote><strong>AOV → organizational goal → measurement objective → OKR → KPI</strong></blockquote><p>Now we can move closer to the design layer: understanding user intent and determining the right signals to collect.</p><h3>Connecting signals to intent</h3><figure><img alt=""Illustration with signal section of framework filled in, directing audience to review table of examples below."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*ER93jIm8Wc3a22hlA9sWfg.png"" /><figcaption>As alluded to, there is no one end-all signal. It will take a critical look and collaboration across product and data and analytics teams to capture the right signals for your org.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s assume our KPI example from before aligns with a JTBD that looks like this:</p><blockquote><strong>When I am shopping for something I need, I want to easily discover related or complementary items so my order feels complete.</strong></blockquote><p>To understand whether users are making progress toward that job, we need to collect telemetry data from key activities. Not every event will matter, but the right ones reveal intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Table of sample signal categories which related to overarching shopper Job detailing how they potential signal various intents AI could pick up on."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*v1HviC_KmaYp-a9xFEhkYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Examples of signals related to the core Job and their connection to identifying a shopper’s intent.</figcaption></figure><p>Signals help us see not only what users are doing but whether they are moving in the direction that represents meaningful progress. Positive signals show alignment. Negative signals reveal friction or mismatched intent.</p><p>This creates a full path from business outcomes down to the behaviors that reflect real value.</p><h3>How the framework extends into generative AI</h3><p>Everything up to this point applies to traditional products where designers create fixed interfaces. Generative experiences change the structure of the work. Instead of designing every step, we are designing the conditions a system uses to decide what to show, what to emphasize, and how to adapt.</p><p>Generative systems do not follow pre-built screens. They follow patterns, predictions, and signals.</p><p>In generative experiences, intent can surface explicitly through a question, a prompt, or a choice, or implicitly through behavior. <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">Google’s PAIR guidebook</a> talks about this distinction between explicit intent and intent inferred from behavior, which forms the basis for how AI predicts what comes next.</p><p>Once the system infers intent, it predicts what the user needs next. That prediction determines what gets generated, whether that is a layout, a set of recommendations, content variations, or the next step in a flow. Even so, we still need a way to understand whether the prediction was correct. <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">Microsoft’s Human-AI Interaction Guidelines </a>reinforce this by encouraging systems to make their reasoning visible and understandable, so people can verify whether predictions make sense.</p><p>This is where the framework becomes essential. Organizational goals, OKRs, KPIs, and JTBDs give us a standard for what “good” looks like. They describe the journey and the progress that represent value for users. The signals we instrument become evidence of whether the generated experience actually supported that progress.</p><p>Even when a generative system produces something entirely new, we can still evaluate it. We are not comparing the UI to a previous layout. We are comparing behavior to expected signals. If users are moving forward, the inference was correct. If users hesitate, ignore content, or abandon, the system has made the wrong assumption. <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">OpenAI describes a similar idea</a> in their work on learning from human feedback, where systems compare predicted outcomes to desired ones.</p><p>This gives designers two places to focus optimization efforts. We can refine the experience that was generated, or we can refine how the system infers intent. Sometimes this means improving interface patterns. Sometimes it means strengthening the signals we collect. Sometimes it means giving users clearer ways to express what they want.</p><p>Either way, the work becomes the same. We check the signals produced by a generative interface against the expected signals tied to a JTBD, and we use that comparison to guide how the system adapts.</p><p>This is how designers contribute to AI-driven experiences. We are not only designing what users see. We are designing the understanding the system relies on to generate it.</p><h3>Where we go from here</h3><p>All of this sets up the next step. Generative systems cannot rely on signals alone. They also need to understand our components, patterns, and design systems in deeper, more semantic ways. <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">Figma has written about this shift</a> in their guidance on semantic design systems, emphasizing that AI needs component meaning, not just component visuals, to generate interfaces responsibly.</p><p>In the next article, I will explore how semantic design systems help shape what generative systems create, and how that connects to the broader ideas of encoding, pattern representation, and meaning within AI models.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><p>If you would like to explore some of the ideas mentioned in this article, here are a few helpful starting points:</p><p><strong>Instrumentation and product measurement</strong><br /> • What is a KPI? — Asana<br /> <a href=""https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi"">https://asana.com/resources/key-performance-indicator-kpi</a><br /> • How OKRs work — Atlassian<br /> <a href=""https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr"">https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr</a></p><p><strong>AI, intent, and prediction quality</strong><br /> • People + AI Guidebook — Google PAIR<br /> <a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/</a><br /> • Learning from human feedback — OpenAI<br /> <a href=""https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/"">https://openai.com/index/learning-to-summarize-with-human-feedback/</a><br /> • Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction — Microsoft Research<br /> <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/</a></p><p><strong>Design systems and meaning</strong><br /> • The future of design systems is semantic — Figma<br /> <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/"">https://www.figma.com/blog/the-future-of-design-systems-is-semantic/</a></p><p>These pieces reflect similar themes around intent, signals, and how intelligent systems learn.

<h4><em>A shift towards token-first and AI-assisted systems</em></h4><p>Figma releases updates at a pace that feels pretty overwhelming. A new feature drops, you learn about the feature, then integrate it into your workflow. But soon after, more features are released and your workflow feels outdated again…like it’s an endless enhancement cycle.</p><p>For many designers, especially ones who manage large Design Systems, it’s hard to find time (and energy) to understand which features actually matter and how each Figma update affects your day-to-day work.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma features shown with component slots, Figma MCP, and extended collections"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HRFlQZdzrw0vNPHuxFgVIQ.png"" /></figure><p>But <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/"">Figma’s last few rounds of updates</a> focus on a token-first, structured, and AI-assisted workflow. Instead of circling around convenience features or quality of life updates, Figma is reshaping how Design System teams think about variables, code alignment, and how AI can expedite the process.</p><p>So which features should you focus on and what does each update actually mean for Design Systems? Let’s break down 3 critical updates recently rolled out with variables, component slots, and Figma MCP.</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>Variables have been at the forefront in supporting token-first systems. Figma recognized the common use case of multi-brand Design Systems, and its latest updates makes variables even more scalable. Let’s look at the new extended collections, new mode limits, and exporting variables.</p><h4>Extended collections</h4><p>There have been issues with multi-brand systems not meeting their adopter needs due to the limitations of Figma variables. Product teams would create hacks by copying variable collections into their own files, recreating themes, or even rebuilding token structures from scratch… meaning system updates and governance became broken across adopters.</p><p><strong>But with extended collections, Design System teams can support multiple brands/ products that require their own custom theme, while keeping variables in sync with the core system.</strong></p><p><strong>How extended collections work:</strong></p><ul><li>A Design System team publishes a core (parent) variable collection</li><li>Designers across the company can extend the core collection with their own brand-specific themes (overriding only the values they need)</li><li>The extended collections stay linked to the parent collection (and will inherit updates like new variables or token updates)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of the extended collection’s modal for Figma variables"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DYlDw55gSnH-5KKWtZ_ymg.png"" /><figcaption>Extended collections allow multi-level branching</figcaption></figure><p><strong>But there are still limits of extended collections:</strong></p><ul><li>You cannot edit the variable’s alias name, scope, or mode in extended collections</li><li>Extended collections still require strong naming conventions and structure</li><li>Product designers may struggle to understand which token is pulling from where unless documentation is clear</li><li>They require more governance and a review process must be established for Design System members to ensure correct usage</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Extended collections are only available for full seat users on Enterprise plans. I know many Organization plans also need this feature, so it’s disappointing it’s only available to premium accounts (please don’t shoot the messenger).</em></blockquote><h4>Increase in mode limits per plan</h4><p>Many Figma users have been personally victimized by how many modes were given to Professional and Organization plans. For instance, if a Design System supports 5 breakpoints (between X-Small and X-Large), they would not have been able to use variables to represent proper responsiveness. So the increase in how many modes you can use within each variable collection is better suited for team needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Professional:</strong> 10 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> 20 modes per collection (up from 4)</li><li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Unlimited modes with extended collections (up from 40)</li><li><strong>Starter:</strong> Not eligible (variables aren’t included in this plan)</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Figma variables showing many modes for a collection named “Breakpoints”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6n7IZQAtbtFR3ENo9SLh9g.png"" /><figcaption>Figma increased the amount of modes given to each plan type</figcaption></figure><p><strong>By increasing the capacity for modes, Figma is encouraging teams to move more variation into variables rather than building larger, heavier component libraries</strong>. Instead of teams finding “hacks” around the mode limitations, Design Systems can now have fewer overrides and duplicated components.</p><h4>Import and export as JSON</h4><p>Figma must have noticed many plugins were created to allow designers to import and export variables, like the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1256972111705530093/export-import-variables"">Export/Import Variables plugin</a>, because now they’ve introduced a built-in feature to serve this purpose.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some accounts that should have this feature may still not have access (I still do not as of December 2025.)</em></blockquote><p><strong>Though it seems like a less significant update, it has huge implications for the maturity and governance of Design Systems</strong>. This helps teams adopt a “source of truth” mentality due to tokens from the design tools syncing with version-controlled repositories.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the import and export variables feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X2y0XiNElF6zMr5bxZEziw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of import/ export variables feature from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, importing and exporting directly from Figma supports easier migration with fewer mistakes, automated updates of tokens, and a possible future of continuous integration between design and code.</p><h3>Component slots</h3><p>Figma components are powerful, but can also be rigid. If a designer needs to customize a component instance, they often have to find workarounds like detaching the component… a big “no-no” to Design System teams.</p><p><strong>But slots offer greater component flexibility without detaching. Basically, slots are placeholder containers inside components that let designers edit and customize content within an instance.</strong> And instead of relying on the Design System team to create product-specific components and increase library complexity, designers can insert the layer themselves.</p><p>Slots also allow Design Systems to specify which components are allowed inside a slot. So while designers have flexibility, they’re still working within system-approved patterns.</p><figure><img alt=""Demo of the component slots feature in Figma"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4wMiSfcsEahJHZmROX2NTQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Image of component slots’ demo from </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjIaN_wlWg&amp;t=1313s""><em>Figma Schema</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits and limits of slots</h4><p><strong>Some more “pros” of slots used in Design Systems are:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots mirror how components work in frontend frameworks so they align closer with code implementation</li><li>Components are simplified and clean by avoiding common flexibility workarounds</li><li>Complex components like cards and modals become easier to adapt across product teams due to slots’ scalability</li><li>System compliance improves due to slots’ design freedom within guardrails</li></ul><p><strong>Now let’s talk about the “cons” of slots:</strong></p><ul><li>Slots instances require careful planning to avoid overly complex or vague component designs</li><li>Slots are not ideal for strict system patterns, like notification and messaging usage</li><li>System adopters have a learning curve to understand how to use slots without breaking away from the Design System</li><li>Slots increase Design System maintenance because slots instances must be defined, documentation must be written, and code must be aligned</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Slots are only available by early access sign-up for paid plans (no starter plan). </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaZNBEWTahxSYh4FDpUNzQlwM3HKw_Eg0U-hwgXETCtAxm8A/viewform""><em>You can apply for access through Figma’s Google form</em></a><em>, but your plan’s admin must complete the form on your team’s behalf.</em></blockquote><h3>Figma MCP (model context protocol) server</h3><p>Figma’s MCP allows AI tools, like Claude or Cursor, to access information from your Figma files. The MCP creates shared context between design and code, and enables AI to generate component code, tokens, and even documentation straight from your Design System.</p><p>You might be thinking, “What (tf) is an MCP?” Basically, MCPs are a standardized way for AI to communicate with external data and tools, like Figma. So when the MCP server is enabled, AI agents can see your system’s component structure, design tokens, and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>Though MCPs can give AI the same knowledge a seasoned Design System team member has, they should be viewed as assistants versus replacements to human designers.</strong></p><h4>Benefits and limits of MCP</h4><p><strong>An MCP supports Design Systems in the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>Generates component code based on context in Figma</li><li>Accurately maps design tokens (like colors, spacing, and type)</li><li>Speeds up the documentation workflow by using live Figma context</li><li>Keeps component structure and naming consistent</li></ul><p><strong>But an MCP has limitations for Design Systems, like:</strong></p><ul><li>It can’t read entire projects; it’s better used for small pieces of the system</li><li>It can’t assume interaction behaviors unless you expose and specify it</li><li>Its output still requires review and refinement from seasoned designer/ dev</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Important note<em>: </em></strong><em>The Figma MCP is currently one-way; you can go from Figma to code, but not from code to Figma.</em></blockquote><h4>Set up Figma MCP</h4><p>Figma includes both remote and desktop servers. The remote server (hosted remotely by Figma) is available to all seats and plans, and the desktop server (hosted locally on your computer) is available to Dev and Full seats on paid plans.</p><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Users with View or Collab seats on paid plans are limited to 6 tool calls per month.</em></blockquote><p><strong>For the remote server:</strong></p><ul><li>Using your preferred development tool (between Claude, Cursor, or VS Code), configure the MCP server with the URL <a href=""https://mcp.figma.com/mcp"">https://mcp.figma.com/mcp</a></li><li>Open a Figma design file from your browser → Switch to Dev mode</li><li>In the right panel, select “Set up Figma MCP” to set up your preferred development tool</li></ul><figure><img alt=""“Set up Figma MCP” button in Figma’s Dev Mode’s right panel to set up the remote server"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4SwOaQ815R74gss4Ptoo5A.png"" /><figcaption>Select “Set up Figma MCP” button in Dev Mode’s right panel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>For the desktop server:</strong></p><ul><li>Go to “Preferences” → Select “Enable desktop MCP server”</li><li>Select your MCP client (like VS Code or Claude)</li><li>Switch to Dev mode → Make sure MCP is enabled in the right panel</li></ul><figure><img alt=""How to select “Enable desktop MCP server” in Figma’s preferences menu"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gDqH_QkiR-7_I66BP7Wglw.png"" /><figcaption>“Enable desktop MCP server” selection in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>For more details on Figma MCP, view <a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/sections/35280374295831-Figma-MCP-collection"">Figma’s MCP collection</a> for tutorials on setup and best practices.</p><h4>Tips when using an MCP</h4><ul><li>Start with atomic components (like buttons) before trying more complex ones</li><li>Work with one component at a time versus entire projects</li><li>Ask AI to reference any existing components to follow your best practices</li><li>Provide full context (like components behavior and interactions)</li><li>Avoid using hard-coded values or detached components (use the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/801195587640428208/design-lint"">Design Lint plugin</a> to check for missing styles)</li></ul><p><strong>If something looks wrong in the AI output, you can:</strong></p><ul><li>Review the Figma components for errors or missing context, then remediate as needed</li><li>Ask AI to regenerate the component or documentation</li><li>Show AI a screenshot of the issue and ask why something is off (like the padding)</li></ul><p>Figma’s latest updates mark a shift in how Design Systems can scale, maintain consistency, and adapt to product needs.

<h4>An exploration of causes, costs and competitive advantages connected to design maturity in product organisations</h4><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed slide titled “Design Maturity: Moving beyond usability to strategic advantage.” Below the title are three neon-style icons: a document labelled “FAQ” in orange, a central flowchart with the word “GOAL” in blue, and an “Opportunity Service Map” diagram in orange showing connected nodes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcVcbXVTWcub1SJiaQPbNA.png"" /></figure><p>High‑performing product organisations depend on maturity across all disciplines — design, product management, engineering, data, editorial, architecture. When one discipline is not being fully utilised, the whole organisation suffers, because maturity is systemic. But design maturity is sometimes misunderstood as a craft issue. Sometimes design is equated with usability. But true design maturity expands an organisation’s capacity to work well in uncertainty. So if you want to create the future, rather than just predict it, you need to find ways to achieve design maturity.</p><h3>Design maturity is more than usability</h3><p>I’m a design leader, so this matters to me personally. But a lack of understanding and investment in design maturity matters to everyone in a product organisation. When one function is underutilised, the entire system suffers. IDEO defines design as “sensemaking + imagination”. It’s the reason design is such a valuable partner to product management — <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/the-value-of-design-in-a-product-organisation-850661d1b22f"">design extends sense-making into difference-making</a>. Product management excels at sense-making. It synthesises data and combines analytical skills with empathy to make decisions and provide direction — ultimately holding accountability for the success of the product. But without design maturity, an organisation can lose out on the creativity and divergent thinking strengths of design. This comes with costs. <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20design/our%20insights/the%20business%20value%20of%20design/mckinsey-bvod-art-digital-rgb.pdf"">McKinsey’s <em>Business Value of Design</em> (2018)</a> found that design maturity correlates directly with financial and product performance.</p><p>But many organisations unconsciously define design too narrowly. The dominance of UX has led many non-designers to conflate and confuse the value of design with interaction design, usability and surface-level detail. Even <a href=""https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/"">Cagan’s model, for example, places design chiefly in the usability domain</a>. This framing is not wrong for managing delivery risk. But it reduces the perceived scope of design’s contribution. We’ve seen this in the past, when <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">Jakob Nielsen’s early usability heuristics</a> became the <em>default</em> definition of design work in low-maturity organisations.</p><p>But thinking of design as solely delivering “usability” within this context is limiting. “Usability” is necessary but not sufficient for an organisation to make the most of design. The result is a reduced role focused on UI, interaction flows, accessibility compliance and removing usability risks. This is all important, but it’s table stakes. When design gets trapped here, the organisation is often limited to incremental change. Organisations that use design only as a mechanism for managing usability risks do deliver safe, predictable, incremental improvements. But they might miss category-shifting ideas. They may also find themselves falling back to stakeholders for direction-setting or executing a <a href=""https://psychsafety.com/the-hippo/"">HIPPO’s vision</a>, because they’re underpowered in the skills needed to generate, communicate and manage diverse insights and ideas effectively. They’re likely to be limited to communicating vision in logic-biased prose rather than category shifting poetry that design-enabled product management is capable of.</p><h3>Climbing the ladder…</h3><p>When a product organisation is immature, design is equated with wireframes, flows, accessibility checks or research to eliminate risk. This work is necessary but insufficient for value creation. <a href=""https://ddc.dk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Design-Delivers-How-design-accelerates-your-business.pdf"">The Danish Design Ladder</a> describes how organisations evolve through:</p><ol><li><strong>Non-design</strong> — Design is absent or decorative.</li><li><strong>Design as styling</strong> — Form-giving, surface-level.</li><li><strong>Design as process</strong> — It’s an integrated element of development.</li><li><strong>Design as strategy</strong> — It’s a tool for shaping business models and futures.</li></ol><p>Most product‑influencer narratives peak at level 3 at best. But mature design can go further: into strategy, systems, and the shaping of opportunity itself.</p><p>The Danish Ladder says design will have the biggest impact when it’s deeply embedded in the strategic planning of an organisation. This is because design is a process of translation. Through artefacts, design translates ideas into value-generating products and services. As design undertakes this “translation” it also inevitably transforms ideas, manipulating constraints and capabilities to optimise the design. Design is therefore most effective when it’s able to influence both problem-framing and solutioning at the strategy level. Design isn’t art. It’s a process for solving real problems for real people by understanding them and getting creative to make progress and a positive difference.</p><p>When design is only allowed to operate at surface levels, or even when it’s called on to “execute” a strategy, you’re missing out on potential value. To non-designers this point might feel like “discipline inflation.” I get it, we all want to feel important. We all want a seat at the table. We all want to argue that we’re the secret to competitive advantage and need to “hold the pen” on the strategy. I don’t think that’s true for design in every context. The sense-making, convergent tendencies of product management mean that in most cases design shouldn’t be the dominant decision-maker in a product organisation. But they should be included in strategic work — and work that is most ambiguous — for the simple reason that designers are brilliant at having and managing ideas.</p><h3><strong>Idea management: The missing discipline?</strong></h3><p>Design is a systematic, creative, opportunity-generating discipline. When organisations misunderstand it as only enabling usability risk-management, they prevent themselves from operating at higher maturity. Organising around risk (value, usability, feasibility, viability) is sensible. But risk management isn’t the whole job. If you only reduce risk, you only reduce possibility.</p><p>Designers are trained to expand possibility and enable delivery by moving fluidly between divergence and convergence. A mature design practice surfaces new possibilities from research, signals, or anomalies. It looks across journeys, systems, and time — not just features. It detects patterns that suggest new value. It turns weak signals into opportunity areas. All of these core competencies of a skilled product designer are powerful and valuable — but so far, they’re not particularly unique to design. In some cases, they may even be more naturally suited to the convergent mindset of a product manager. But design does bring something extra. Design is a structured discipline for managing ideas. It doesn’t just detect patterns — it invents new ones. And it turns weak signals not just into opportunity areas, but into articulated opportunities that other disciplines can experience and understand quickly and cheaply to collaborate. Design done well looks like:</p><ul><li>Divergence (exploring many possibilities)</li><li>Convergence (narrowing to the strongest)</li><li>Visualisation (making intangible futures and assumptions visible and testable)</li><li>Iteration (enriching ideas through critique)</li><li>Integration (seeing relationships as systems and experiences emerge)</li></ul><p>Let’s look at the impact that this can have in practice…</p><h4><strong>Three hypothetical approaches</strong></h4><p>Imagine three different approaches to the same project. The context is high in ambiguity. The market context is highly competitive. To operate effectively the organisation needs to combine multiple talents, each with their own levels of maturity and different cultures. Likewise, the technical landscape is complex with a mixture of technical debt and emerging technologies that few in the team have experience of using. We step into the multiverse and see how three teams might approach the task:</p><p>Team A starts their discovery and execution by a PM creating a strong, detailed PRFAQ. It places users right at the centre of a story of the future. This sharpens the narrative across disciplines. It’s an inspiring picture that teams can get behind, so it<strong> a</strong>ligns stakeholders around a single vision. The FAQ section answers the questions that are front of mind. But the document imagines an end‑state rather than discovers one. It privileges linear, verbal thinkers who love prose. It’s like a piece of rhetoric, so it also risks a false certainty.</p><p>Team B create a detailed and comprehensive Opportunity Solution Tree (OST). It allows them to multi-track, exploring data and customer conversations to build an abstract map of opportunities. The team attaches data to branches to help prioritise the biggest opportunities and they work along branches, logically validating opportunities and bringing design skills in to generate possibilities. The team works on it together, collaboratively, sharing perspectives and having rich conversations amongst themselves and with users. It encourages exploration before convergence. And it helps the team track evidence and hypotheses together. But it’s weak at representing lived experience or systemic relationships — it’s an abstraction of a problem space. Sometimes the team struggles to navigate the structure of the ever-expanding tree. And it’s hard to hold the whole structure in your head at once. It makes systems thinking, journey‑based context, understanding time and flow harder, because it’s natively hierarchical rather than relational.</p><p>Team BBC is led by a skilled leader, experienced in multidisciplinary collaboration including design. They like the multi-tracking divergence and evidence-based decision-making of the OST, but they think that can make it even stronger. They create an Opportunity Service Map. It’s a shared artefact that still operates at an abstract level but brings the product landscape to life — it helps the team visualise experiences before, during and after customers interact with the product. It helps teams understand the experience and the backstage systems that power it. They talk to users, feeding in insight and operating with empathy. The team works collaboratively, as they do with the OST, but now they overlay opportunities directly onto a service blueprint. They’re curious, so they sidestep the “<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/teresatorres_continuousdiscoveryhabits-curseofknowledge-activity-7203470831937613825-vXO8/"">curse of knowledge</a>.” They start with problems and “why” questions, then they move to lo-fi ideation. They work collaboratively using techniques like <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper?srsltid=AfmBOoqX9Jcf5a_86yRXxXxYHI2rBgB0r09EfY6vqnIzHcjoUEV84eb0"">SCAMPER</a> to explore and refine ideas. Then they prototype — they select the method depending on the concept and what assumptions they need to investigate. They regularly create cheap sacrificial concepts and test with users. Because the Opportunity Service Map shows frontstage, backstage, enablers, time, friction, confidence and impact it connects ideas and assumptions to the reality they operate in. This keeps exploration broad yet situated.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LzNFN2DEfGWpjG6c3stA2w.png"" /><figcaption>Limiting the impact of design to usability and execution is risky business. Divergence and convergence and a cocktail of multidisciplinary collaboration will usually lead to better results. But the top performing teams understand where and how design can add most value.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Immaturity in one discipline hurts the whole system</strong></h3><p>The best teams I’ve ever worked in operate more like Team BBC. Teams A and B exhibit many strengths of an effective product team. But Team A’s design immaturity forces them to execute a vision that is handed to them. When a team uses a PRFAQ to translate customer obsession and insight into action, it’s a brilliant way to ensure decisions in delivery align with a coherent user outcome. But teams first need to be able to generate this insight and have invented a vision of how to meet it. A PRFAQ is evidence of the synthesising power of product management. It can boost accountability and provide a single-threaded leader with a contract to fulfil. But it won’t help you create.</p><p>Product management isn’t about managing a static thing — we’re managing not only what the product is and how it’s performing now, we’re often managing what it can and should become in the future. Product teams are responsible for delivery and discovery. Design maturity is so powerful because it introduces comfort and competence in dealing with the ambiguity of invention.</p><p>OSTs are therefore a signal of increased design maturity because they help encourage teams to work “outwards as well as backwards” — diverging and multitracking. This looks more like design — moving forwards <em>and</em> backwards, diverging and converging across multiple tracks, iterating to refine and optimise. Once you add in creating artefacts that act as experiments as you make progress, you see how and where design adds value.</p><p>Design helps teams explore from the present into multiple plausible futures before committing to one. An organisation without maturity in design might only ever develop the competence to work backwards from a chosen future or execute with an inherited or fixed set of constraints. With design maturity an organisation is much more likely to be able to blend the talents of product management and engineering with design to work forwards and backwards, manipulating problem-framing and solution-making to help the organisation find the most valuable future, no matter their context.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side graphic comparing the Stacey Matrix and the Cynefin Framework. The left panel shows the Stacey Matrix with four zones — Simple, Complicated, Complex and Chaotic — arranged along axes of agreement and certainty. The right panel shows the Cynefin Framework with its five domains — Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Confused — displayed as a cross-shaped diagram with brief guidance on how to act in each domain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ydkg8peuMaITWGYW_0e2Fw.png"" /><figcaption>Both the Stacey Matrix and Cynefin describe the different contexts a product organisation is likely to operate in — and they suggest how process might need to flex to increase the chance of team success.</figcaption></figure><p>Modern organisations operate across multiple contexts. Mature product teams know that some work is simple or complicated and work through it accordingly. The most mature teams can also identify and operate in complexity and chaos. To work well in complex domains you need strong, confident disciplines, distributed decision-making and a willingness to explore unknowns.</p><p>When design maturity is low, the whole organisation becomes less capable of operating in uncertainty. Product management might end up filling the gap — but you’re likely to have fewer, weaker ideas. Not because product managers and other disciplines can’t have ideas, but because design as a discipline has evolved to manage them most effectively. Each discipline has a core strength and purpose. This is why you need design — because it adds unique and valuable skills and because immaturity in one part becomes immaturity everywhere, as everyone is forced to generalise to fill the gap.</p><p>We can look at two helpful models to understand this further. Robert Kegan’s theory of adult development describes how people evolve in their “mental complexity” — their ability to reconcile ambiguity and competing truths. At the Socialised Mind, identity and direction are shaped by the expectations of others. Decisions are anchored in fitting in, meeting external standards and aligning with prevailing norms.</p><p>At the Self-Authoring Mind, individuals develop an internal compass. They can understand and appreciate the expectations of others while also generating their own frameworks for judgement and action.</p><p>A smaller group shift further into the Self-Transforming Mind, where they can integrate multiple frames at once and work flexibly in paradox, ambiguity and change. Kegan talks about individuals. But I think you can use these stages to describe teams.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing Robert Kegan’s three stages of adult development — Socialised Mind, Self-Authoring Mind, and Self-Transforming Mind — mapped along a horizontal timeline. Each stage includes traits such as reliance on external expectations, developing an internal compass, and integrating multiple perspectives. The diagram also includes brief labels describing how leaders operate at each stage. Kegan talks about these levels in the context of personal development in his book An Everyone Culture."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kUuz2i-GCGtp-gfyfEXscg.png"" /></figure><p>A multidisciplinary team mirrors these stages. A Socialised-level team performs competently within the dominant discipline’s worldview (often PM or engineering). They optimise for alignment and predictability — they “organise to execute”. A Self-Authoring team begins to define its own integrated way of working across disciplines by co-creating a shared approach grounded in collective purpose and context — they’re empowered to solve problems. A Self-Transforming team goes further: it can switch modes depending on the problem space — convergent when needed, divergent when needed, exploratory in uncertainty, decisive in clarity — they’re <strong>empowered to find problems</strong> and invent the future.</p><p>Operating in ambiguity demands high maturity across disciplines. The lowest common denominator of people playing multiple roles or the over-dominance of a single discipline won’t work. Strength and maturity in each discipline is required, so that the organisation and its teams aren’t trapped by any one discipline’s identity but can metabolise all of them to meet the moment. When teams mature to this point, they stop behaving as a collection of functions and start operating as an adaptive system capable of solving harder, more ambiguous problems than any discipline could manage alone.</p><p>Kegan’s developmental lens pairs naturally with Amy Edmondson’s work on psychological safety and teaming. Edmondson argues that in environments of high uncertainty and high interdependence teams perform best when members can speak up, question assumptions, surface risks, and integrate diverse perspectives without fear. That’s only possible when individuals move beyond the Socialised Mindset and when the team behaves at a Self-Authoring or even Self-Transforming level — able to adapt how it works together.</p><h4>Building maturity</h4><p>When design is strong, every discipline benefits. In simple or complicated contexts, disciplines can operate independently and with lower levels of maturity. Product management can set a goal, engineering can implement with rigour, design can ensure usability. But as complexity increases, the future stops being something you predict and starts being something that emerges from interaction. At a certain point, predicting becomes riskier than designing. No discipline has the full picture. You need the exploration, translation and reframing muscles that design brings — finding gaps and opportunities, making ideas tangible, and helping the team update its understanding of the problem, the constraints and what’s possible. At its best, design surfaces opportunities before they calcify into problems, synthesises research into multi-level insights, prototypes to explore strategy (not just UI), and connects journeys, systems and stories into experiences that actually matter. It helps shape direction alongside PM, engineering, editorial, data and architecture — but only when it’s included early enough, high enough and meaningfully enough.</p><p>Maturity rarely develops evenly across an organisation. But you can accelerate the maturity of design by involving and empowering designers where ambiguity, opportunity and risk are highest. These are the areas where linear planning breaks down, expertise alone stops being enough, and teams need experimentation, creativity and distributed judgement.</p><p>Simple shifts can bring greater design maturity to an organisation:</p><ul><li>investing in framing as well as solving</li><li>intentionally cycling through divergence and convergence</li><li>mapping opportunities into the systems they live within</li><li>critiquing ideas to sharpen, not to narrow — and to build rather than diminish creative confidence</li><li>pairing narrative tools (PRFAQ) with experiential ones (prototypes) and making richer abstractions of opportunity spaces — finding ways to show, not just tell people what the future should be like.</li></ul><p>Importantly, these shifts don’t weaken other disciplines — they strengthen them. They help PM and engineering build design literacy without forcing those teams to compensate for an underpowered design function.</p><p>Design maturity isn’t about risk reduction; it’s about strategic advantage. It helps organisations spot new value early and gives teams the confidence to pursue it. If you expect your organisation to shape the future, not just survive it, your teams need the maturity to discover, deliver <strong><em>and</em></strong> design what comes next. The future we prefer won’t arrive ready-made — it will be built by the organisations that design it.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9f45fd4e20c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-need-design-maturity-in-a-product-organisation-and-how-to-get-it-9f45fd4e20c3"">Why you need design maturity in a product organisation, and how to get it</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
