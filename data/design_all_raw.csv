<h4>Why designing for ongoing reflection matters</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YdEqBs6grwOdVyas5r5wmg.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a character unpleasantly gift wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>It’s that time of year again where apps confidently tell us who we are. This year, Spotify informed me that I’m 78 years old in Spotify years (I’m 33 in human ones). I personally thought my affinity for Chapel Roan would have shaved off a decade or two but I guess not! Strava had thoughts about my running habits. YouTube summarized my viewing habits and decided I was an Adventurer, whatever that means. Even LinkedIn had something to say about who I’d been professionally!</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBtrompAT6QsWV11msQQYA.png"" /><figcaption>Image of YouTube, LinkedIn and Spotify Wrapped</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly I don’t want to be a hater, these year-end wrap ups are fun! They feel personal. They often even feel accurate. But also they create an uneasiness and raise a question I keep coming back to. <strong>How do these systems actually decide who we are?</strong></p><p>At a high level, most of the systems I mentioned learn about us through our behavior. Some of that behavior is subtle, like how long we linger, what we skip, when we hesitate. Some of it feels more intentional like likes, follows, comments, subscriptions etc. In most cases, we’re not carefully declaring who we want to be to our products.</p><p>Over time, we learn that these implicit behaviors function as levers. If we want less of something, we skip it. If we want more, we engage. We adapt ourselves to these janky systems. It’s a very narrow kind of control because we don’t know the weight of each actions on our experience. Then once a year, we’re handed a polished summary of who the system thinks we are. But there are better ways to explore this.</p><p>Awhile ago, I had the opportunity to work on a project for a company called Ground News. Their goal is to aggregate news sources into one place in order to give you a clearer picture of your news diet. Part of how they do that is through a feature called <a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage""><em>My Media Bias</em></a>. This feature returns your media consumption data back to you in a structured, legible way showing what sources you read, how they’re distributed across the political spectrum, and where potential blind spots might exist.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of the design for My Media Bias showing all the different ways to see bias"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yBtPNS4Qc0D9lDAtm47SBQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ground.news/my-news-bias-vantage"">Image of the design for My Media Bias</a></figcaption></figure><p>The design intent wasn’t to tell people what their biases were, but to make their own consumption data visible in a way that could be inspected and revisited over time. <strong>Over time</strong> is a distinction that matters. Ground’s approach treats visibility as part of the ongoing experience, not a once-a-year summary. That kind of continuous feedback supports insight and intentional adjustment in a way that opaque behavioral feedback loops don’t.</p><p>In truth there’s a reason most large platforms privilege behavioral signals. From a systems perspective, <a href=""https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781121"">they work</a>! Observed behavior (what we click, watch, skip, or linger on) is abundant, continuous, and highly predictive of what we’ll do next. Decades of recommender systems research show that these implicit signals consistently outperform self-reported preferences when it comes to predicting future interaction.</p><p>And I can’t deny that, but these signals only describe what happened, not what a person is trying to do. That’s where explicit preferences matter. They’re messier, slower, and harder to collect but they’re the only place intent actually lives. When systems treat stated preferences as secondary or optional. They often sideline the user’s own goals.</p><p>What’s interesting about these year-end summaries is the kind of relationship they establish between the system and the person using it. You can see what the system thinks of you, but you can’t interrogate it, correct it, or guide it in any explicit way. The moment for reflection arrives only after the system has already learned everything it’s going to learn from you that year.</p><p>When assumptions are visible as they’re being formed, users have the opportunity to respond with intention rather than reaction. That’s a fundamentally different kind of agency. It treats people less like sources of signals and more like collaborators in the modeling process.</p><p>Systems that meaningfully shape what we see, hear, and engage with are making value-laden decisions on our behalf. When the only way to influence those decisions is through opaque behavioral feedback, users are left guessing how to express intent.</p><p>Wrapped features are interesting because they acknowledge that people want to understand how they’re being seen. The problem is that so far all of the examples I’ve seen stop short of giving users the tools that would actually support that understanding. There’s no invitation to adjust or say this doesn’t quite feel right.</p><p>To be clear, I’m glad Wrapped exists. I hope more companies keep doing these kinds of reflections. They offer a rare glimpse into how these systems see us, what they prioritize, and where their interpretations fall short.</p><p>The more interesting question isn’t whether Wrapped gets us right or wrong. It’s why reflection shows up as a once-a-year artifact instead of an ongoing conversation. If systems are going to model us continuously, it’s worth asking why we’re only invited to reflect after the fact, rather than participate while that model is still being formed.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9e04820ac1fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/well-thats-a-wrap-9e04820ac1fb"">Well, thats a wrap…</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Designing trustworthy AI for healthcare products.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BPMSzNXvppl613yAsV2cgw.png"" /><figcaption>User holding a phone using an AI healthcare assistant</figcaption></figure><p>AI is entering one of the most human domains: healthcare. It helps people track sleep, manage chronic conditions, monitor mental health, and navigate loneliness. It listens, advises, and sometimes comforts. Yet despite these advances, hesitation remains, not because the algorithms are weak, but because the experience does not always feel reliable.</p><p>In this context, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not just an emotional response. It is about system reliability, the confidence that an AI assistant will behave predictably, communicate clearly, and acknowledge uncertainty responsibly. In healthcare, that reliability is not optional. Even when AI performs well, people still hesitate. They ask: <em>Can I rely on this? Does it really understand me? What happens if it’s wrong?</em></p><p>Patients will not act on guidance they do not trust, and clinicians will not adopt tools they cannot interpret. Yet most discussions about healthcare AI focus on accuracy, regulation, or data quality. The lived experience of reliability, the part users actually engage with, often remains underdesigned.</p><p>Trust is not built by algorithms alone. It is shaped by clarity, empathy, and predictable behavior. Micro-decisions matter, how an AI care assistant expresses uncertainty, the tone it uses when discussing symptoms, and how transparently it explains its limits. These design choices determine whether people rely on a system when it matters most.</p><p>For healthcare designers, the role extends beyond usability. We design for psychological safety, ensuring technology does not confuse, mislead, or cause harm. <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-role-of-ux-in-ai-driven-healthcare-2ed0ffc15801""><strong>Roxane Leitão (2024)</strong></a> describes this shift as UX moving from interface design to <strong><em>risk mediation</em></strong> in AI-driven healthcare.</p><h3><strong>Trust is a design problem, not an AI problem</strong></h3><p>Conversations about trust in AI often drift toward technical questions: <em>How accurate is the model? How clean is the data? How fair is the output?</em></p><p>These questions matter, but they miss a core truth: users do not experience algorithms. They experience interfaces. Jakob Nielsen’s observation that <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-new-ui-paradigm""><strong>AI is the first new UI paradigm in 60 years</strong></a> underscores this shift: intelligence is now expressed through interaction, not screens alone.<strong> </strong>People engage with tone, timing, and transparency. They form mental and emotional models of a system based on how it behaves under uncertainty.</p><p>Take AI-powered symptom checkers. Many rely on similar clinical models and datasets, yet users trust some far more than others. The difference is rarely accuracy alone. It lies in how uncertainty is framed, when human escalation occurs, and whether the system explains its reasoning.</p><figure><img alt=""Symptom checker demo from ADA Health"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZPMhikb0CCQDaIj3tHrMgA.gif"" /><figcaption>ADA Health © Symptom checker demo</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em>When a chatbot says, </em><strong>“Based on what you shared, this could be consistent with a mild infection,”</strong> <em>versus</em> <strong>“You might have an infection and should seek care immediately,”</strong> <em>the underlying model may be identical. The experience is not. One response supports informed judgment; the other triggers anxiety. That shift affects behavior, follow-up, and long-term trust.</em></blockquote><h3><strong>The emotional layer of accuracy</strong></h3><p>Healthcare AI is becoming more precise, but precision alone does not drive trust. What matters is whether people feel they can rely on the system in practice.</p><p>In its reporting on AI and chest X-ray diagnosis, The New York Times<strong> </strong>described a recurring pattern: AI systems performed well in benchmarks, yet experienced radiologists made better decisions in real clinical settings. The story emphasized that the problem was not technical failure, but what happens when AI moves from controlled environments into everyday medical practice. Radiologists explained that they interpret images in context, weighing patient history, ambiguity, and uncertainty. By contrast, <a href=""https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ai-nhs-tests-radiologist-lung-disease-diagnosis-jl5h3t59w?id=17515457033&amp;gad_source=1""><strong><em>the AI systems featured in the article</em></strong></a> could detect patterns but struggled to explain why a finding mattered or how confident it was. Clinicians did not reject AI; they stressed that it worked best as an assistant, not an authority. When conclusions arrived without context or visible uncertainty, hesitation followed, not because the AI was wrong, but because it was difficult to rely on safely.</p><p>Interfaces that feel inconsistent, cold, or evasive undermine confidence, even when the model is strong. Conversely, systems that communicate clearly, behave consistently, and acknowledge uncertainty support reliable decision-making, even when answers are imperfect.</p><p>As AI becomes part of daily health routines, designers play a key role in:</p><ul><li>Turning complex care flow into clear signals users can trust and act on</li><li>Deciding when the system should sound confident, cautious, or humble</li><li>Communicating risk and uncertainty without creating unnecessary fear</li></ul><h3><strong>Designing the micro-interactions of reliability</strong></h3><p>Reliance is built through micro-interactions:</p><ul><li>How the AI care assistant responds to “<strong><em>I’m tired”</em></strong></li><li>Whether it remembers prior concerns or treats every interaction as new</li><li>How it communicates limits or inability to help</li><li>Whether it sets realistic expectations instead of overpromising</li></ul><p>These signals accumulate, creating either a sense of dependable consistency, or its absence.</p><figure><img alt=""The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*igRBOAa4hzdnKyBvBRbBaA.png"" /><figcaption>Julian Chokkattu for Wired © «The Fitbit App Is Turning Into an AI-Powered Personal Health Coach »</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/9Az-rDDEuT8?si=Jsc4H8XaVA4EI28k""><strong>Fitbit’s AI Coach</strong></a> offers a useful example. As Julian Chokkattu described in <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/fitbit-app-ai-personal-health-coach/""><strong><em>Wired</em> (2025)</strong></a>, Fitbit’s shift toward an AI-powered health companion focuses less on prediction and more on explanation. It does not diagnose or claim medical authority, yet millions rely on it daily for sleep insights, recovery guidance, and activity suggestions. Its credibility comes from consistency, data grounding, and clear boundaries. By explaining why it makes suggestions, for example, “<em>Here’s a breakdown of what your data tells us</em>…” and framing guidance as optional rather than prescriptive, the system informs rather than instructs. Credibility, here, is designed, not declared.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9YCpC1hQKHz4or0a5om7Dg.png"" /><figcaption>Fitbit AI Health coach using Gemini ©</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-advisor/?srsltid=AfmBOoqA5zX5G67vLW5h-GqgPToLWFdkdumhxP55SWiGVnEo8iXqdQED""><strong>Oura</strong></a><strong> © </strong>provides another example. Its AI-generated readiness and sleep insights frame daily scores as directional signals, grounded in trends across sleep, heart rate variability, and recovery data.

Users expect empathy, yet systems must remain factual. They want guidance, but AI cannot diagnose. They seek simplicity, but transparency introduces complexity.</p><p>Balancing these tensions is where UX becomes strategy. Design is no longer about polish or delight. It defines the relationship between humans and technology in moments of vulnerability. As <a href=""https://www.g-co.agency/insights/healthcare-ux-design-transforming-patient-journeys-for-better-care""><strong><em>G &amp; Co. (2025)</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>describe, healthcare UX increasingly functions as care choreography, aligning emotional, informational, and clinical layers. Trust in healthcare AI is not a technical output, it is a design outcome.</p><h3><strong>Designing for trust: three core principles</strong></h3><h4><strong>Progressive transparency</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant explains its actions without overwhelming users. It communicates what it knows, what it does not, and how it reached its conclusions.</p><blockquote><em>For example, instead of saying, </em>“<strong>This application does not provide medical advice,</strong>”<em> the system might say, </em><strong>“I’m not a doctor, but I can help you understand your symptoms and decide whether to speak with a healthcare professional.”</strong><em> Making uncertainty visible, such as indicating “70% confident,” while offering next steps reassures users and preserves agency</em>.</blockquote><h4><strong>Calibrated empathy</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant adjusts its tone to the user’s context, acknowledging emotion and uncertainty without amplifying anxiety. AI mental-health products like Wysa © and Woebot © exemplify this approach, guiding users toward coping strategies or human support without emotive excess.</p><p>If a user says, <strong>“<em>I’m feeling anxious</em>”</strong> a helpful response might be, <strong>“<em>Here are a few techniques that may help”</em></strong><em>, or </em><strong><em>“I can help you find professional support</em>”</strong> rather than a generic emotional reaction like, “<em>I’m sorry you’re feeling that way </em>❤️.”</p><p>Active listening cues such as <strong><em>“It sounds like…”</em></strong>, avoiding overly friendly avatars, and maintaining emotional consistency make empathy functional: it recognizes feelings while guiding toward clear next steps.</p><h4><strong>Consistent reliability</strong></h4><p>The AI care assistant behaves predictably across interactions, so users know what to expect. Consistency appears in voice, style, context awareness, privacy considerations, and responsiveness. Making the system’s actions visible reduces confusion from sudden silences or unexpected behavior. Holistic consistency also limits AI hallucinations <strong><em>(</em></strong><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01670-7""><strong><em>npj Digital Medicine, 2024</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong> and prevents misleading outputs. Predictable systems reduce cognitive load, letting users focus on health rather than interface interpretation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hingehealth.com/fr/fr/about/our-approach-to-ai/""><strong><em>Hinge Health</em></strong></a> illustrates these principles in practice. Its AI-driven programs integrate clinician oversight to maintain progressive transparency, guide interactions with calibrated empathy, and deliver consistent, predictable feedback. This approach reinforces trust, human judgment, and patient agency simultaneously.</p><h3><strong>DesignOps and collaborative design</strong></h3><p>In healthcare, a good user experience must also be safe and accountable. DesignOps plays a critical role; key design decisions, ethical, clinical, and psychological, should be documented and defensible. Alignment across UX, product, data, and clinical teams creates shared accountability.</p><p>High-performing teams involve clinical co-design early, run cross-disciplinary reviews, and treat user research as validation, measuring trust as a real outcome. When trust becomes a shared goal, the product shifts from tool to <strong><em>companion.</em></strong></p><h3><strong>Measuring the UX of trust</strong></h3><p>When users interact with AI care assistants, clicks and retention are not enough. Emotional insight matters. Beyond engagement metrics, teams increasingly track:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived reliability:</strong> <em>Does this assistant give credible answers?</em></li><li><strong>Transparency recall:</strong> <em>Do users understand its limits?</em></li><li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> <em>Did the experience reassure or confuse?</em></li></ul><p>These measures reflect a growing shift toward <strong>trust as a design KPI</strong>, supported by qualitative research and sentiment analysis.</p><h3><strong>Design as a layer of safety</strong></h3><p>Safety in healthcare AI is not only technical or clinical; it is experiential.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear disclaimers</strong> reduce misuse</li><li><strong>Timely reassurance</strong> reduces anxiety</li><li><strong>Predictable care flows</strong> reduce cognitive load</li></ul><p>The design system, therefore, is not just aesthetic, it’s behavioral infrastructure. It shapes how people feel in moments that matter. That’s a responsibility, not just a craft. In healthcare, good design can literally make people feel safer, and act safer.</p><figure><img alt=""Heidi Health is an AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0NC8tqa_GAcYv8k4bFwNuQ.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Heidi Health ©</strong> An AI scribe for clinical documentation that incorporates clinician review to refine outputs, adding a layer of reliability that automation alone cannot provide.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Human-in-the-loop as a design choice</strong></h3><p>Visible human oversight is a strong trust signal. On <a href=""https://huma.com/products/huma-intelligence""><strong><em>Huma Therapeutics</em></strong></a> ©’s platform, generative AI synthesizes data and drafts insights, but clinicians review every output. AI supports care without replacing accountability. Making human oversight visible transforms AI from an invisible authority into a transparent assistant. Trust becomes tangible because responsibility remains clear.</p><figure><img alt=""Huma Intelligence automates health data summarization to streamline administrative workflows."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Il_jS0VxSV-b5qBg5ijOcw.png"" /><figcaption>Huma Intelligence (Hi) © automates health data summarization to streamline administrative workflows.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>What’s powerful about this example isn’t the brand or the technology itself; it’s the design choice to make human oversight visible, intentional, and reassuring. That’s how trust moves from being an abstract value to something tangible in the experience.</blockquote><h3><strong>Closing thought</strong></h3><p>Designing AI for healthcare means designing for trust, vulnerability, and agency, simultaneously. <strong><em>Trust</em></strong> is not abstract. It can be designed, documented, measured, and protected. The goal is not to make machines appear human, but to make technology worthy of human reliance. In digital health, <strong><em>trust</em></strong> is not a luxury; it is a prerequisite.</p><p>When we build a health AI assistant or companion, we’re inviting vulnerability. People share their symptoms, their fears, their habits. They’re stepping into a space where mistakes, misunderstandings or miscommunications really matter. Our responsibility as designers is to make that exchange safe, by showing limits, guiding with care, and behaving consistently enough that users know what to expect.</p><p>Ultimately, the next frontier is agency: empowering people with control, not just information.</p><p><strong>I hope this article sparks new ways of thinking about design in AI healthcare.

<h4>Generative AI and the long history of artistic automation</h4><figure><img alt=""An AI-generated image in the style of a Renaissance drawing. The drawing features a Renaissance era studio but with futuristic elements such as robot arms and mechanical computers"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qtSUcZMRdCQn9eZJtfBeyg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image generated via Google Nano Banana</figcaption></figure><p>The discourse surrounding generative AI in the creative arts is frequently characterised by a sense of historical rupture, a seismic shift unlike any that has come before. Critics often frame the emergence of Large Language Models and diffusion-based image generators as an unprecedented existential threat to the ‘soul’ of human expression, a black swan event that may signal the end of human creative sovereignty. However, when we look back over the history of Western art and technology, it becomes clearer that this anxiety is not a new phenomenon but rather a recurring structural feature of the relationship between human intent and technical innovation. Whenever a new tool emerges that threatens to lower the barrier to entry or automate a process previously governed by arduous manual labour, the established artistic class has responded with a mixture of moral panic, accusations of ‘soullessness,’ and a retreat into essentialist definitions of <a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">what constitutes ‘true’ art</a>.</p><p>To understand this moment, we must contextualise AI within the history of artistic tools and conceptual shifts, while simultaneously confronting the very real socio-economic and ethical challenges it poses to the creative ecosystem.</p><h3>Deconstructing the toupee fallacy</h3><p>Early criticism of generative AI focused on the poor quality of its output. GenAI was not yet a threat because it could not compete with human creative output on quality or believability.</p><p>The visceral reaction against early GenAI perhaps stemmed from a hypersensitivity to anomalies that break the illusion of human authorship. The ‘uncanny valley’ describes a revulsion response to humanoid representations that are almost, but not quite, human — a phenomenon observed in robots, animatronics, and increasingly, AI-generated imagery. When an AI image displays six fingers or background incongruities, the viewer immediately labels it as ‘artificial’ and files it away as evidence that AI is easily detectable and low-quality.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href"">https://medium.com/media/eb1dab60a0821709bef73c934e03b92c/href</a><p>This creates a false impression of the technology’s overall capabilities through several reinforcing psychological biases. <a href=""https://gregrobison.medium.com/fooled-by-fakes-how-the-toupee-fallacy-blinds-us-to-high-quality-ai-content-a41e6b16b998"">The Toupee Fallacy</a> ensures that only the most noticeable (and typically worst) examples are identified, leading to the belief that AI is inherently detectable and of low aesthetic value. Flawless AI-generated images pass by unnoticed and unquestioned, creating a survivorship bias where only the failures are used to judge the entire category. This mental machinery is further fueled by the uncanny valley, where minor glitches like extra fingers are perceived as deep moral or spiritual failures rather than technical ones. Finally, anchoring bias causes us to fixate on these first ‘bad’ impressions, leading to a resistance to recognizing that these models improve exponentially over time.</p><p>This desire for authenticity can be observed in the ‘Invisible CGI’ phenomenon in the film industry. To guard against a backlash toward CGI in cinema, studios frequently market films by claiming “No CGI was used,” despite employing thousands of digital artists to composite scenes, remove safety rigs, and enhance environments. This practice was the subject of a video essay by Jonas Ussing titled <a href=""https://youtu.be/7ttG90raCNo?si=-FBLjvFtoqSpG8VI""><em>“NO CGI” is really just INVISIBLE CGI</em></a>.</p><p>When the CGI is ‘invisible,’ the public credits the ‘practical’ mastery of the director; when it is ‘bad,’ the technology is blamed. Direct experience becomes an unreliable guide to overall quality, as the viewer samples from the bottom of the distribution while remaining oblivious to the top performers.</p><h3>The mechanization of vision: from Vermeer to the silicon brush</h3><p>The most persistent argument against GenAI is that it removes the skill of the artist, allowing an amateur to produce high-quality work without the arduous training traditionally associated with mastery. Yet, the history of the Old Masters suggests that ‘skill’ has always been a fluid concept, frequently augmented by hidden technical aids. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockney%E2%80%93Falco_thesis"">Hockney-Falco thesis</a>, proposed by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles Falco, argues that the dramatic rise in naturalism in Western art from the early Renaissance was not due solely to improved talent, but to the widespread use of optical devices such as the camera obscura, camera lucida, and curved mirrors.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustrated diagram of the function of a camera obscura"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UE8Pr5R_ZtcI2ioTCIRrhw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration of a “portable” camera obscura studio in Kircher’s Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae (1645).</figcaption></figure><p>Johannes Vermeer is often cited as the archetype of this intersection between art and technology. Analysis of Vermeer’s work reveals ‘circles of confusion’ (pointillés) — optical artifacts that are physically impossible for the human eye to perceive but are characteristic of the ‘imperfect lenses’ of 17th-century camera obscuras. These halations of light on reflective surfaces, such as polished wood or glass, suggest that Vermeer was not ‘eyeballing’ his scenes but was instead ‘transcribing the intensities of light’ projected onto his canvas. Furthermore, the maps hanging in the background of Vermeer’s interiors have been found to be cartographically precise, a level of accuracy that <a href=""https://www.americanscientist.org/article/camera-obscurities"">strongly supports the use of a projection device</a>.</p><p>The historical trajectory of these aids directly parallels modern AI capabilities. The camera obscura, used by Vermeer and Canaletto, functioned by projecting a real-world scene onto a flat surface for tracing–a process mirrored by modern tools like Stable Diffusion’s ControlNet, which provides a structural ‘sketch’ for a model to fill. Similarly, the camera lucida, a prism device allowing an artist like Ingres to see the subject and canvas simultaneously, parallels current ‘image-to-image’ techniques that transform a base composition into a polished work.</p><p>Critics of the Hockney-Falco thesis, much like critics of AI, argue that such tools take away from the greatness of the masters. They maintain that a ‘man of genius’ should not require mere mechanism to achieve realism. However, experiments by Tim Jenison demonstrated that an individual with no formal training as a painter could reproduce a Vermeer-like image using a system of lenses and mirrors available in the 17th century (see Penn &amp; Teller’s documentary <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3089388/?ref_=nm_knf_t_1""><em>Tim’s Vermeer</em></a>). Jenison’s work proved that Vermeer’s genius was not necessarily found in the manual dexterity of his hand, but in his choice to use technology to capture light in a way that was previously unthinkable.</p><p>Critics might argue that Vermeer still required the manual dexterity to apply the paint, whereas AI automates the image creation itself. This highlights the first major ‘shade of grey’: the transition from the handcrafted image to the ‘mechanically assisted’ image is centuries old, but the <em>degree</em> of automation in AI represents a quantum leap that challenges our definition of artistic labor.</p><h3>The human algorithm: the atelier system and the ‘broken pipeline’</h3><p>A secondary critique of AI-generated art is that it is ‘dehumanised’ because a machine performs the labour. This argument relies on the romantic myth of the ‘lone genius’ labouring in solitude, an image that has long permeated art history but rarely reflects the reality of major historical commissions. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, artistic production was organised through <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">guilds and the atelier (workshop) system</a>.</p><p>In the studios of masters like Raphael and Peter Paul Rubens, the master functioned more as a creative director than a solo laborer. Raphael presided over a ‘hive of activity’ in Rome with more than fifty assistants. He would provide the ‘cartoons’ (preparatory drawings), while the actual brushstrokes were often executed by pupils who specialized in specific tasks: one might paint the drapery, another the clouds, and a third the architectural backgrounds. <a href=""https://serenademagazine.art/were-the-old-masters-really-working-alone-inside-the-renaissance-atelier/"">The master would reserve for himself only the most critical elements</a> (faces and hands) before signing the final work.</p><figure><img alt=""A engraving print showing a bustling Antwerp atelier: at centre the master paints Saint George and the Dragon, while an assistant mixes oil pigments, a youth copies a sculpture, and other hands grind colours and paint portraits."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eGZNn9jArnSh27NBXLG4sA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Invention of Oil Painting, by Philip Galle, c. 1580–1605. Showing a bustling Antwerp atelier: at centre the master paints Saint George and the Dragon, while an assistant mixes oil pigments, a youth copies a sculpture, and other hands grind colours and paint portraits. Source: Royal Museums of Greenwich, London</figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI functions as a digital extension of this atelier system. The prompter acts as the ‘master,’ handling conceptualisation and curation, while the algorithm acts as the Apprentice or Journeyman, taking on the labour of pigment grinding (data preparation), underpainting, and the execution of complex backgrounds or environmental details. Even the specialists of the Renaissance, who focused solely on flesh or water, find a modern equivalent in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models trained to reproduce specific styles or objects with high fidelity.</p><p>This system reveals that the ‘master’s signature’ represented a brand and a vision, not necessarily the manual labour of the signer. A painting signed ‘by Raphael’ fetched more than one painted by an unknown journeyman, even if the journeyman performed 90% of the manual labour. Generative AI is the latest iteration of this ‘operational elevation,’ allowing the artist to focus on strategy, decision-making, and leadership instead of routine monitoring or manual repetition.</p><p>Yet, here lies a profound contemporary downside: the <a href=""https://people-work.io/blog/junior-hiring-crisis/"">Junior Hiring Crisis</a>. In the traditional atelier, the apprentice performed ‘grunt work’ (grinding pigments, stretching canvases) in exchange for training and a pathway to mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the change in senior and junior employment rates after the launch of ChatGPT. Senior employment continues to rise post-ChatGPT but junior employment is shown to be declining."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*azsnHgpU4d5kWox-yMkUmQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5425555"">A study from Harvard</a> published in October 2025 cites that early-career employees from 22–25 years old are experiencing greater unemployment while senior hiring remains stable or even growing.</figcaption></figure><p>AI is likely to continue ‘eating the bottom of the career ladder.’ By automating the entry-level tasks that once served as a rite of passage, such as proofreading copy, resizing layouts, or simple coding, the technology is dismantling the traditional apprenticeship model. Recent data indicates a sharp contraction in early-career roles; UK tech companies, for instance,<a href=""https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/uk_tech_grad_jobs/"">cut graduate roles by 46%</a> in 2023–2024. This broken pipeline suggests that, while AI may offer ‘operational elevation’ for senior professionals, it threatens to leave the next generation without the foundational experiences required to develop professional judgment.</p><h3>The Luddite misunderstanding: wages, not aesthetics</h3><p>The term ‘<a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/luddite"">Luddite</a>’ is frequently weaponised in modern discourse to dismiss critics of AI as technophobic. However, the actual history of the Luddite movement provides a more nuanced lens. The original Luddites were skilled textile workers in the early 19th century who objected to the use of machinery to circumvent standard labour practices and undermine the livelihoods of skilled craftsmen.</p><p>This historical legacy is reflected today in three distinct ways. The original Luddites of 1811 fought against mechanization as a tool to lower wages and hire unskilled labour, just as modern professional artists fear market saturation by AI-assisted ‘amateurs’. The Neo-Luddite movement of the 20th century expanded this into a philosophy of distrust toward technology as a system of social control, paralleling modern critiques of AI as an ‘alienating’ force that separates art from nature. Finally, the Romantic Movement’s reaction against industrialisation, which celebrated the ‘lone genius’ and ‘sublime nature’, underpins the current ‘soul in art’ argument that AI lacks genuine human feeling.</p><p>The Luddites were reacting to a shift from a domestic system, where craftspeople were paid usual price, to a factory system that prioritised efficiency. They were not against technology per se (many were skilled operators); they were against its inappropriate application to lower wages and de-skill the workforce. When applied to the arts, this argument is often misunderstood as a claim that AI makes ‘bad art.’ In reality, the fear is socio-economic: that AI will make cheap art that devalues human labour. Just as the power loom did not destroy the concept of clothing, AI is shifting art from a manual-labor economy to a conceptual-curation economy.</p><h3>The intellectual divorce: conceptual art and the ‘idea as machine’</h3><p>The move toward conceptualism in the 20th century fundamentally challenged the requirement for an artist to possess manual technical skills. Marcel Duchamp’s invention of the ‘<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp"">readymade</a>’ in the 1910s declared that the creative act resided in the choice of the object, not its manufacture. By taking mass-produced objects like a urinal (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)""><em>Fountain</em></a>) or a snow shovel (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Advance_of_the_Broken_Arm""><em>In Advance of the Broken Arm</em></a>) and placing them in a gallery, Duchamp argued that art should <a href=""https://www.thecollector.com/marcel-duchamp-readymades/"">‘serve the mind’ rather than the ‘retinal’ sense</a>. This perspective validates curation as the primary creative act in generative art.</p><figure><img alt=""The sculpture ‘Fountain’ by Marcel Duchamp – a found urinal which the artist signed R. Mutt"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*L2l9k4a1MTGbQRe8lhTQ2Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Marcel Duchamp Fountain, 1917, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz</figcaption></figure><p>Sol LeWitt famously extended this in 1967, stating: “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art”. For LeWitt, <a href=""https://infiniteimages.toledomuseum.org/essay/coded-nature"">the execution is a “perfunctory affair”</a>. He often provided loose instructions for <a href=""https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/"">Wall Drawings</a> that were then executed by assistants. Because the planning and decisions are made beforehand, the artist is free even to surprise himself. This is a verbatim description of generative art, where the prompt acts as the machine that executes the work.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of ‘Wall Drawing 11’ by Sol LeWitt – it features lines applied to a wall which is divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/487/1*1EaGFycbyNzUsOuAJ5gtug.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Wall Drawing 11</em> by Sol LeWitt — ”A wall divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed.”</figcaption></figure><p>Yoko Ono’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit_(book)""><em>Grapefruit</em></a> (1964) furthered this by offering ‘instruction pieces’ that could be realised by anyone in their imagination or as an action. She viewed her work as a “recipe for creating reality,” where the artist relinquishes control to the audience. In this framework, the artist is the architect of a possibility space, a role shared by Joseph Kosuth, whose “<a href=""https://www.moma.org/collection/works/137438"">idea as idea</a>” prioritized the conceptual premise over the physical manifestation.</p><p>The modern AI user who explores the ‘latent space’ of a model is the modern heir to this tradition. However, in outsourcing much of our thinking to machines we risk ‘cognitive atrophy.’ While we may increase efficiency, we may lose the creative trial-and-error, the messy process that is essential to creative growth and identity.</p><h3>The evolutionary remix: jazz, sampling, and the laws of culture</h3><p>A central ethical argument against GenAI is that it ultimately steals from human artists. The training of AI models requires large-scale ingestion of copyrighted material, often without consent or compensation. Critics describe the process as ‘strip-mining’ human expression. From an ethical standpoint, many creators feel that using their life’s work to build a product that might eventually replace them is a fundamental violation of creative rights.</p><p>This assumes that human creativity is <em>ex nihilo</em> (springing from nothingness) rather than being a recursive process of transformation. Kirby Ferguson’s <a href=""https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc?si=OFgCxW97n2QFFKb0""><em>Everything is a Remix</em></a> philosophy argues that all creative work is built on three pillars: Copy, Transform, and Combine.</p><p>This recursive process is visible across various media. In jazz, ‘standards’ serve as a foundational language for musicians to improvise upon, turning popular melodies into exploratory pieces of free jazz. Hip-hop sampling utilizes the ‘copy, transform, combine’ method using turntables and samplers to recontextualize existing beats into new lyrical meanings. Folk music relies on the passing down and <a href=""https://heretakis.medium.com/everything-is-a-remix-the-myth-of-originality-and-the-truth-about-creativity-inspired-by-kirby-94259048fb17"">altering of melodies over generations to evolve cultural narratives</a>.</p><p>The legal landscape in 2025 remains a ‘law unmade.’ While some judges have ruled that AI training is highly transformative and qualifies as fair use, others have rejected this defense when training data is sourced from shadow libraries of pirated books such as LibGen. Futurist Jaron Lanier has proposed ‘<a href=""https://theaiinsider.tech/2025/02/26/vr-pioneer-jaron-lanier-on-data-dignity-and-elevating-human-innovation/"">Data Dignity</a>’ as a solution, a system that moves away from the black-box model to one where the most unique contributors to a model’s output are acknowledged and compensated via data trusts or ‘Mediators of Individual Data’ (MIDs).</p><p>Generative AI represents the digital culmination of a generations-long chain of inheritance. It functions by predicting outcomes based on latent space weights, effectively synthesising billions of artistic ‘quotations’ into a new expression. Roland Barthes’ <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author""><em>Death of the Author</em></a> argued that a text is a “tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture”. AI models are the most sophisticated intertextual looms ever created; they do not ‘steal’ in the sense of removing an object, but rather presuppose and embed prior expressions into new contexts. The liberation of ‘remix thinking’ frees us from the impossible burden of originality and gives us permission to start where others left off. The question of the legal permission to train and make use of all prior links in the chain of inheritance still remains to be solved for now.</p><h3>The false equivalence: craft vs. art and the amateur’s dilemma</h3><p>A common critique of AI is that it creates a false equivalence between the professional and the amateur. This debate mirrors the historical reaction to photography. Critics in the 19th century argued that photography was a “<a href=""https://daily.jstor.org/when-photography-was-not-art/"">thoughtless mechanism for replication</a>” that lacked the “refined feeling” of a human genius. However, the history of art shows that manual craft does not always equal high art.</p><p>This spectrum of production is well-documented. Bob Ross used an instructional, ‘wet-on-wet’ manual technique to promote a democratic form of craft that, while widely popular, was often excluded from the high art canon. Conversely, Thomas Kinkade utilised an assembly-line factory model where original paintings were digitally transformed into lithographs and ‘enhanced’ by technicians. Kinkade was commercially professional but critically labeled as kitsch.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the tv artist Bob Ross holing a paint palette and brush in front of one of his canvases"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/278/1*yV7-8STcOx4tzhDHj45nrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Bob Ross at his easel</figcaption></figure><p>Prompt engineering via natural language represents a similar shift. While the tool allows high variance, professional output requires the same iterative curation and historical dialogue used by traditional masters who spent years training to guard their status. The tool does not confer professional status; the consistency and depth of the vision do. AI makes everyone an image generator, but becoming an artist still requires the intellectual labor of curation and thematic depth. GenAI has the ability to uplevel creatives at every level of expertise. Yes, it can enable the novice or amateur but when harnessed by the experienced professional it has the potential to lead us to new and exciting horizons.</p><h3>The unsynthesised truth: synthesisers and the “no bullshit” backlash</h3><p>The musical world offers a direct historical parallel to the visual AI controversy through the introduction of the synthesiser. In the early 1970s, <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/synthesizers-impact-heavy-metal/"">the synthesiser was viewed with intense suspicion by the rock establishment</a>. The band Queen famously included “No Synthesisers” declarations on their album liner notes up until 1980. This was not a rejection of electronic sound itself, but a ‘commitment to the unsynthesized’ intended to prove their ‘technical prowess’ as musicians who could create complex sounds using only guitars and overdubbed vocals.</p><p>Critics of that era, such as those at <em>Melody Maker </em>magazine, often mistook Brian May’s innovative guitar harmonizing for synthesizers. The band used the ‘no synths’ policy as a marketing hook to separate themselves from disco groups and to assert a hierarchy of ‘real’ music over electronic devices.</p><figure><img alt=""A photograph of the liner notes to Queen’s ‘A Night at the Opera’ album. It features a list of performers on the album as well as the disclaimer ‘No Synthesisers!’"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zn3SAEYmk0GhOpn5Jua2Ig.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Liner notes from Queen’s <em>A Night at the Opera</em> album</figcaption></figure><p>However, by the mid-1980s, the ulterior motives of even the staunchest holdouts were revealed. Iron Maiden, who had proclaimed “No synthesisers” on their 1983 album <em>Piece of Mind</em>, heavily embraced guitar synthesisers just three years later on <em>Somewhere in Time</em>. They found that the technology allowed them to explore “conceptual themes such as robotics and artificial intelligence” in a way that traditional instruments could not</p><p>The transition from “no synths” to “synths as standard” highlights the recurring pattern: technology is initially rejected as a ‘detriment to technical prowess,’ then used as a ‘special effect,’ and finally integrated as a ‘more complex musical layer’. Today’s AI tools are in the ‘special effect’ stage, facing the same backlash that once targeted the Moog and the Fairlight CMI.</p><h3>Toward a new synthesis of creative agency</h3><p>The systematically refutable arguments against generative AI in the arts are almost entirely rooted in a misunderstanding of both art history and cognitive bias. When we peel back the layers of Romantic mythology, we find that the history of art is a history of technological integration. Perhaps Vermeer’s genius was his mastery of the camera obscura; Raphael’s genius: his management of a human algorithm; Duchamp’s genius: the conceptual choice that liberated art from the hand.</p><p>Generative AI does not represent a break from this tradition, but its most democratic evolution. By acting as a digital atelier, a conceptual machine, and an intertextual loom, AI allows for an ‘operational elevation’ where humans can focus more on the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ of creation, rather than the ‘how’. Physical craft will not disappear, it may even be elevated in value within this new creative context.</p><p>The future of art is, as it has always been, intelligent and powered by people. The ‘soul’ of the work resides in the intent of the creator, the curation of the expert, and the historical dialogue that no machine can engage in without a human partner. AI is not the end of art; it is the beginning of the most complex atelier in human history, one that requires us to be more human, not less.</p><h3>Further reading from UX Collective</h3><ul><li><a

At that exact moment, Singapore Polytechnic was hosting its annual <a href=""https://www.sp.edu.sg/courses/schools/sma/happenings/detail/industry-events/dt-ux-summit-2023"">Design Thinking and User Experience (DT | UX) Summit</a>. Upon hearing he would be in town, the organiser moved quickly to invite him, and soon after, Don was on stage delivering an impromptu keynote about his latest book, <a href=""https://beta.thestorygraph.com/books/09c28083-fa28-4b89-b718-02703100879d""><em>Design for a Better World</em></a>.</p><p>What began as a chance encounter has since grown into a historic partnership. That one-off meeting paved the way for the <a href=""https://dnda25.sp.edu.sg/"">2025 Don Norman Design Award (DNDA) Summit</a>, marking the first time this prestigious event has been held outside of the United States and recognising Asia’s expanding influence in design for societal impact.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman"">Don Norman</a> is a titan of the industry. Often called the “Godfather of UX”, he pioneered the concepts of affordances and mental models, though the internet perhaps knows him best for “Norman Doors”, his famous critique of poorly designed entrances.</p><figure><img alt=""A Norman Door is a door whose design confuses the user, such as a handle that looks like it should be pulled when it must actually be pushed.

It is the classic example of design that fails to communicate its function, leading people to blame themselves for a designer's mistake. (image source: <a href=""https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/the-design-of-everyday-things"">Woodbury</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>(image source:</p><p>Now at 90, Don shows no interest in slowing down. Eschewing a quiet retirement, he endured gruelling long-haul flights to engage with the community firsthand. While he remains quick to critique poor design, he is equally driven by an insatiable curiosity about people. Throughout the DNDA conference, he bypassed the typical “celebrity” routine, choosing instead to listen to the stories of everyone he met.</p><p>Over three intensive days, Don connected with countless changemakers, insisting that their contributions be recognised through the DNDA platform. Ultimately, it was Don’s opening and closing remarks that defined the event’s core mission: the evolution from Human-Centred Design (HCD) to Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+).</p><p>Here are the key insights shared by the emeritus professor on the future of our craft.</p><h3>1. The Artificial Nature of Our World</h3><p>We might point to AI as the obvious answer, but the reality goes beyond the digital realm. A look around the places we live gives clues about how things are placed by people: the names of streets, the flattened terrain for buildings, or the borders of nations. So long as something is an invention of an idea, it was designed not by designers alone but by policymakers, historians, and citizens. This means this “amazing mess” of artificial constructs can be questioned, undesigned, and redesigned to make a better world.</p><figure><img alt=""Design is an invention of ideas, from street names to national borders, meaning our “artificial” mess can be questioned and redesigned. (image source: shuttlestock)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*nrE7iuUFIrc6W-ni.jpg"" /><figcaption>Design is an invention of ideas, from street names to national borders, meaning our “artificial” mess can be questioned and redesigned. (image source: <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/shutterstock.com/image-photo/palm-jumeirah-island-dubai-united-arab-111748157"">shuttlestock</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Redefining Awards and Conferences</h3><p>This concept brought a new awareness for Don about the constructs that matter to him. He questioned the notion of awarding only well-known companies and instead rewarded early-career pioneers who need traction. He questioned the format of conferences, favouring an “unconference” approach where participants became speakers. “Chaotic but stimulatingly authentic” sums up the experience of being able to collectively own a narrative.</p><figure><img alt=""True impact comes from shifting focus from big corporations to early-career pioneers and replacing rigid expert panels with “unconference” dialogue. The image shows the unconference format, where the audience becomes the expert panel.

Scaling Through Nature’s Metaphors</h3><p>When Don’s team realised they needed to scale HCD+ larger, they looked to nature for metaphors. <strong>Dandelions</strong> represent the ability to spread like weeds, creating an exponential effect. An <strong>Umbrella</strong> represents bringing different bodies together.</p><p>However, Don updated his metaphor after hearing from Dr Wong Sweet Fun regarding <strong>corals</strong>. Unlike the “Great White Shark” model (which eats everything else) or the “School of Fish” (which represents standardisation), the <strong>Coral Reef</strong> model allows diverse organisms to reach an equilibrium of coexistence. Proliferation is possible when you provide a frame with the right conditions.</p><figure><img alt=""Moving from the “Great White Shark” of mass participation to the “Coral Reef” model allows for an ecosystem where diverse ideas coexist and flourish.

(image source: <a href=""https://www.peakpx.com/en/hd-wallpaper-desktop-eqiwi"">PeakPX</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>4. From Problem Solver to Conductor</h3><p>Could artificiality also apply to the current role of the designer? While there is a long-standing perception that design is primarily about making things attractive, Don Norman challenged us to be <strong>problem finders</strong>. Rather than solving for symptoms, we must identify root causes. This is a shift that often forces designers out of their comfort zones and beyond the traditional boundaries of the craft.</p><p>If the original intent of design is to facilitate change, then we must do more than just draft a plan; we must see its implementation through. Currently, an understanding of engineering, business, and politics is missing from many design curricula. A relentless focus on aesthetics in education not only leaves designers ill-equipped for the complexities of the modern workplace but also prevents them from ascending to senior leadership roles in the global arena.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ux-or-px-why-naming-matters-5cf890f64a9a"">UX or PX? Why naming matters</a></p><p>Admittedly, moving into these spaces may lead to a situation where designers do not know everything. According to Don, that is actually an advantage. Being a “beginner” does not hamper creativity; instead, it provides the intellectual room for entirely new approaches. Don recognises this as the true power of design, which is the ability to enter new fields and synthesise fresh understandings. Ultimately, the modern designer must act as a <strong>conductor</strong>, someone who can synchronise and bridge conversations across various disciplines with enough knowledge to guide meaningful outcomes.</p><h3>5. AI, Emotion, and the Power of Story</h3><p>Don speaks passionately about the possibilities of using AI as a powerful and “thinking” digital library. He recognised that it is still in a developmental stage, likely requiring another 15 to 20 years to fully mature. However, he drew a sharp distinction between <strong>cognition</strong>, which is the ability to process information, and <strong>emotion</strong>, which is the feeling of the world. AI possesses cognition but lacks emotion. While it can provide comparisons or data, it requires a human to use emotion to finalise decisions.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-be-the-designer-in-the-ai-loop-e14a5fb8c375"">How to be the designer in the AI Loop</a></p><p>This is why stories remain the most effective way to connect people. Don shared that in the boardroom, a personal anecdote is often the finishing move that makes data relatable and leads to a concrete decision. AI can be a fantastic collaborator by removing obsolete skills from design education, allowing designers to focus on creativity and people. By using AI to learn the languages of business or finance, designers can ensure their work is actually implemented.</p><h3>6. The Shift to Humanity-Centered Design (HCD+)</h3><p>Don circles back to the true power of design. The problem with Human-Centred Design (HCD) is not that it was inherently wrong, but that it often misses the broader picture of humanity and the systemic issues facing our world. We must consider how the world is impacted by the mining of materials, the pollution from our energy sources, and the erosion of cultures through addictive digital technologies. These concerns led Don to champion Humanity-Centred Design (HCD+).</p><p>Design often possesses a “quiet” quality where designers finish their work and hand it off. This creates a design bubble that isolates practitioners from other critical disciplines. Don’t let “loving design” prevent you from engaging with the broader organisation. Don offers a straightforward solution: rather than designing <em>for</em> people, designers should design <em>with</em> all. By joining the conversation among diverse communities and corals, designers can place their emphasis on the <strong>quality of life </strong>rather than just profit and efficiency.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-we-need-to-have-a-change-of-heart-with-ux-metrics-1c229e830914"">Why we need to have a change of HEART with UX metrics</a></p><h3>A Personal Note of Thanks</h3><p>Thank you, Don Norman, for coming to Singapore. Your work has been inspiring since I first learnt about affordances from your books 15 years ago. Back then, “user experience” still felt undefined, yet it shaped who I am today as a design manager.</p><p>During the conference, you reminded us that it is not enough for organisations to learn to speak “design”; we must also learn to speak theirs. You challenged us to influence policy, business, and communities. Beyond the collaterals, it was the conversations and your curiosity that mattered most.</p><p>You’ve shown us what it means to turn ideas into action for a better world.

Velocity tells you how fast you’re moving — and in which direction.</strong></p><p>A car travelling at 100 mph in circles has tremendous speed but zero velocity. It goes nowhere. It only burns fuel, overheats the engine, and eventually becomes a hazard to everything nearby.</p><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey"">Stephen Covey</a> put it more bluntly: “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction.”</p><p>Sam Altman reportedly <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/12/02/altman-code-red-memo-urges-chatgpt-improvements-amid-growing-threat-from-google-reports-say/"">issued</a> an internal “code red” at OpenAI in December 2025 — an emergency directive to focus resources on improving ChatGPT whilst delaying initiatives like advertising or Pulse triggered by Google’s launch of <a href=""https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#gemini-3"">Gemini 3</a>. The flagship product that triggered the current AI frenzy, deployed to hundreds of millions of users, needed an internal alarm bell. Not because it had fundamentally failed. But because in the race to stay ahead, the product itself required urgent consolidation before it could bear the weight of continued competition.</p><p>This isn’t an isolated corporate moment. It’s the logical endpoint of what researchers <a href=""https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njtip/vol18/iss2/1/"">Houser and Raymond</a> identified in their 2021 analysis: an AI race that “lacks definition, a goal, or even an aspirational dream” — yet we keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line.</p><h3><em>Motion</em> is not progress</h3><p>We measure “leadership” in the AI race through release dates, funding rounds, model sizes, benchmark wins. These are metrics of <strong><em>motion</em></strong>, not <strong><em>progress</em></strong>. They tell us who is accelerating — not who is steering.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll"">Lewis Carroll</a> understood the danger: “If you don’t know where you are going, any road will get you there.”</p><p>And when steering disappears, two failures cascade: products become the strategy — you ship because you can, not because you should. <br />And users become raw material — queries as data, confusion as engagement, vulnerability as conversion.</p><p>We’ve seen this pattern before. Facebook’s “move fast and break things” contributed to outcomes such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal"">Cambridge Analytica</a>, the amplification of ethnic violence in <a href=""https://systemicjustice.org/article/facebook-and-genocide-how-facebook-contributed-to-genocide-in-myanmar-and-why-it-will-not-be-held-accountable/"">Myanmar</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/news/the-myth-of-metas-free-speech-places-democracy-at-risk/"">algorithmic radicalisation</a>. The company <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-on-facebooks-new-motto-2014-5"">changed</a> its motto — but only after harming democracies. That’s speed without velocity: motion that creates value for shareholders whilst externalising catastrophic harm onto societies.</p><p>The advertising rumours around OpenAI matter not as scandal, but as signal. When a product loses strategic clarity, monetisation stops being a consequence of direction and becomes a substitute for it. This is profitable aimlessness.</p><h3>The speed trap</h3><p>The real divide between the United States and Europe is no longer “regulation versus innovation.” It is <strong>speed versus velocity</strong>.</p><p>America has chosen speed. Deploy faster, scale bigger, monetise quicker. Ask forgiveness later — if anyone is still empowered to ask. This is innovation as extraction: build, break, capture, repeat. Humans become datasets. Long-term damage becomes acceptable externality. Consent becomes a legal checkbox rather than an ethical foundation.</p><p>Europe has chosen velocity. Not mere movement, but movement <em>towards something</em>: a society where rights don’t evaporate when a model improves, where consent is not a checkbox, where accountability has a name, a process, and an enforcement mechanism.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is choosing direction.</p><p>Critics argue — rightly so — that European regulation has slowed deployment. That whilst Brussels debated AI Act provisions, Silicon Valley shipped products to hundreds of millions of users. That market leadership matters, and hesitation costs.</p><p>True. But incomplete.</p><p>Because the question isn’t “who shipped first?” It’s “who shipped something that can scale without collapsing and who can articulate why it needed to exist at all?” <br />Speed means nothing if you cannot answer what problem you’re solving.</p><p>The OpenAI code red memo is an existence proof: shipping fast doesn’t guarantee shipping well. And when trust collapses, market leadership becomes a liability, not an asset.</p><p>The GDPR didn’t slow European innovation — it prevented European companies from building on foundations of exploited data that would later crumble. <br />The AI Act isn’t delaying deployment — it’s preventing deployment of systems that would later require expensive retrofitting or complete abandonment.</p><p>Europe isn’t slow. Europe is avoiding the expensive mistake of building systems that cannot scale with trust.</p><h3>Guardrails are compasses</h3><p>The European regulatory framework is doing something more sophisticated than restriction. It is building infrastructure.</p><p><a href=""https://gdpr-info.eu/"">GDPR</a> doesn’t prohibit data usage — it demands transparency: what you collect, why you collect it, how long you keep it, who you share it with, and what rights people retain. That is not restriction. That is direction.</p><p>The <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/"">AI Act</a> doesn’t ban artificial intelligence — it categorises AI systems by risk level and mandates transparency, human oversight, and accountability proportional to potential harm. High-risk systems affecting employment, education, healthcare, law enforcement must meet minimum standards before deployment. This is infrastructure for trust.</p><p>The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-act"">Data Act </a>ensures that data generated by connected devices remains accessible to users and can be shared across services, preventing monopolistic data hoarding. It creates foundations for competitive markets and genuine user agency.</p><p>But the real power of European regulation lies not in what it prohibits, but in what it insists upon:</p><p><strong>1. Accountability means someone can answer when things go wrong.</strong> Not “the algorithm decided.” Not “the model optimised for engagement.” But a named human being who can explain the logic, justify the outcome, and bear responsibility for the consequences.</p><p><strong>2. Transparency means systems can be understood.</strong> Not just by engineers who built them, but by citizens affected by them. If we cannot understand how decisions are made, we cannot contest them. And if we cannot contest them, we have abdicated governance to machines that cannot be held responsible.</p><p><strong>3. Responsibility means consequences attach to choices.</strong> When an AI system fails, when it discriminates, when it causes harm — there is a legal pathway for redress. This is the foundation that allows innovation to scale with trust rather than collapse under its own externalities.</p><p>Consider <a href=""https://e-estonia.com/estonia-and-automated-decision-making-challenges-for-public-administration/"">Estonia’s</a> digital governance <a href=""https://loti.london/blog/estonia-insights/"">framework</a>. Every government algorithm that touches citizen data requires human approval, logging, and audit trails. The result? One of the world’s most digitalised societies — and one of the most trusted. Speed of deployment matched by clarity of accountability.</p><p>Or think about the <a href=""https://iapp.org/news/a/digital-welfare-fraud-detection-and-the-dutch-syri-judgment"">Netherlands</a>’ court ruling against the government’s welfare fraud detection algorithm. The <a href=""https://www.asser.nl/news/interview-curtailing-the-surveillance-state-anticipating-the-syri-case-judgment"">system</a> was fast, efficient, and… discriminatory. The court demanded transparency and accountability. The ruling didn’t stop innovation. It redirected it towards systems citizens could actually trust.</p><p>This is velocity: movement with direction, protected by accountability.</p><h3>The race makes cooperation impossible</h3><p>Here is the danger that few acknowledge: <strong>the race narrative makes global cooperation impossible.</strong></p><p>Not difficult. Not unlikely. Structurally incompatible<em>.</em></p><p>When nations frame AI development as existential competition, every shared standard becomes potential weakness. Every regulatory alignment becomes strategic vulnerability. Every moment of cooperation risks exploitation by adversaries who might be moving faster in the shadows.</p><p>As Houser and Raymond observed: an AI race can keep selling the emotional story of “winning” without ever crossing a finish line. The race narrative fractures the possibility of building AI systems grounded in shared values, mutual accountability, and collective benefit.</p><p>Without cooperation, we do not get faster innovation. We get incompatible systems, fragmented standards, and a technological landscape where human rights are jurisdiction-dependent accidents rather than universal guarantees. We get a world where the same AI system can respect privacy in Brussels, ignore it in San Francisco, and weaponise it in Beijing.</p><p><strong>The future of AI depends on cooperation, infrastructure, and uniform standards</strong> — on shared definitions of harm, shared accountability mechanisms, shared ethical foundations. But velocity requires shared bearings. Speed doesn’t. Speed just requires a competitor.</p><p>This is not speculation. This is happening now. And the window for choosing differently is closing.</p><h3>The architecture of endurance</h3><p>The Renaissance was not built in haste. It was intentional. European cathedrals took generations to complete. Their builders knew they would not see the finished work. Yet they built with precision, with vision, with responsibility to those who would inherit what they created. Ideas were allowed to mature. Beauty was given time to emerge. Architecture was designed for endurance, not obsolescence.</p><p>Contrast this with structures built for speed: temporary, disposable, optimised for immediate utility. They served the moment. Then vanished, leaving nothing worth preserving.</p><p>We face this choice now. Build fast and disposable, or build to last. Optimise for quarterly returns, or generational impact. Compete for market share, or create foundations worth inheriting.</p><p>Europe remembers this lesson. America seems determined to forget it.</p><h3><strong>Choosing direction</strong></h3><p>If you are responsible for AI strategy, governance, or risk management, velocity requires three shifts:</p><p><strong>First, reframe your metrics.</strong> Speed metrics — deployment velocity, time-to-market, model performance — must be balanced by direction metrics: clarity of purpose, user safety outcomes, accountability pathways. If you cannot measure direction, you cannot manage it.</p><p><strong>Second, build </strong><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><strong>accountability</strong></a><strong> chains.</strong> Every AI system needs a named human who can explain, justify, and take responsibility for its decisions. If you cannot identify that person, you cannot deploy the system responsibly. These chains cannot be retrofitted — they must be designed from day one. There’s an old IBM memo from 1979 worth remembering: “<em>A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision</em>.”</p><p><strong>Third, treat compliance as architecture.</strong> European regulations aren’t restrictions to work around — they’re scaffolding for building systems that can scale globally. If your system can meet GDPR and AI Act requirements, it can operate anywhere. If it cannot, you’re building for a fragmenting market.</p><p>The organisations that understand this now will have structural advantages when markets consolidate around trustworthy systems.</p><h3>Beyond the finish line</h3><p>The choice isn’t “Europe versus America.” That’s the race story trying to recruit you.</p><p>The choice is speed without accountability, or velocity with direction.</p><p>Europe’s bet: innovation scales only when trust scales with it. Real progress requires more than computational power — it demands wisdom.</p><p><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmddnge9yro"">America’s</a> bet: trust can be retrofitted later. Speed creates its own legitimacy. Winning justifies the means.</p><p>The code red memo is what it looks like when “later” arrives.</p><p>Every algorithm, every neural network carries within it the echoes of human decision-making. Our challenge is not to fear these technologies, but to consciously shape their ethical foundations. Our deepest innovations emerge not from machines, but from the human capacity to reimagine possibility.</p><p>The question before us is whether we’ll exercise that capacity — or surrender it to the illusion that speed equals progress.</p><p><strong><em>Author’s Note:</em></strong><em> The thinking, research, and arguments in this article are entirely human.

Not a moonshot. Not a revolution. Just something that solves a real problem.</p><p>In the past, bringing that idea to life required capital, a team, and time. Today, it requires a laptop and a collection of AI tools. With AI filling the gaps, a working prototype can be <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">vibe coded</a> in weeks, if not hours. The product is tested, refined, and launched, and for a brief moment it appears successful.</p><p>Then reality intervenes.</p><p>Within months, near-identical products emerge, <a href=""https://medium.com/@skooloflife/99-of-ai-startups-will-be-dead-by-2026-heres-why-bfc974edd968"">copied and shipped at machine speed</a>. What began as a solo effort quickly becomes a crowded category, and any early differentiation disappears. Soon after, a large technology company notices the pattern. Without meaningful distribution or a loyal audience to defend it, <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/perplexity-ceo-big-tech-will-copy-ai-startups/"">the idea is absorbed into an existing platform as a feature</a>. A few months later, the startup is effectively gone.</p><p><a href=""https://futurism.com/future-society/ai-startups-vibe-coding"">This outcome is no longer unusual. It is becoming the norm.</a></p><p>What this reveals is uncomfortable but important. AI does not kill startups. It exposes ideas that never earned credibility. If a product can be imagined, built, and shipped by almost anyone, it can also be copied by almost anyone. That is not a failure of innovation so much as a stress test — one that reveals how thin many ideas were to begin with.</p><p>I saw this firsthand early in my career.</p><p>My first startup experience was at a publishing company building a new journal and news platform for <a href=""https://jadpro.com/"">advanced practitioners in oncology</a>. On paper, it was an extremely narrow niche. But the niche alone was not what made the product work. Plenty of people could have identified the same market and built a similar platform.</p><p>During that time, I watched multiple medical-content startups with solid ideas fail, even though the problems they were trying to solve were real and obvious.</p><p>We had a well-established advanced practitioner in oncology serving as editor-in-chief — someone deeply respected in the field, with years of lived experience and professional trust behind their name. That changed everything. It shaped how the content was framed, how the platform was perceived, and whether practitioners were willing to engage with it at all.</p><p>What mattered was credibility.</p><p>The product succeeded not simply because it existed, but because people trusted who it came from. That distinction is where many modern startups will fail. AI makes it easy to build products—it does nothing to establish why anyone should trust them.</p><p>What will survive in this new AI environment are <a href=""https://productify.substack.com/p/the-complete-guide-to-product-moats"">products with real moats</a>. And a moat is not clever functionality, a polished interface, or speed to market. It is whatever does not collapse under replication — distribution, trust, proprietary data, embedded workflows, regulatory friction. AI has a way of <a href=""https://strategeos.com/blog/f/defensive-moats-in-the-age-of-llms-when-ai-commoditizes-your-ip?blogcategory=Business+Consulting"">stripping away the illusion</a> and revealing which products actually possess these advantages.</p><p>This dynamic feels brutal, but it is ultimately corrective. AI eliminates products that existed largely because building used to be hard. In doing so, it creates space for work rooted in context, relationships, and accumulated judgment. The bar has not necessarily been raised — it has been clarified.</p><p>Some of the most durable moats are not technical at all. They are human. Trust earned over time. Expertise in a narrow, underexplored domain. Lived experience that shapes how a problem is understood. Perspective refined through accountability. Features can be copied. Credibility cannot.</p><p>AI excels at reproducing outputs. It struggles to reproduce identity, reputation, and judgment. Products that are extensions of who someone is, rather than just what they have built, are far harder to erase.</p><p>So what does a viable strategy actually look like?</p><p>It is not building faster, shipping more features, or out-executing competitors. AI has already neutralized those advantages. Competing on speed or efficiency is no longer a strategy when <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2024/02/07/as-ai-rapidly-becomes-a-commodity-time-to-consider-the-next-step/"">execution itself has been commoditized</a>.</p><p>The real shift happens upstream. Founders must stop asking what they can build and start asking what they are uniquely positioned to justify. That justification does not come from novelty. It comes from credibility accumulated long before the product exists. From being embedded in a domain deeply enough that the solution reflects judgment, not just capability.</p><p>In practice, this means fewer generic products and more opinionated ones. Products that make tradeoffs. Products shaped by experience rather than tooling. AI can help build them, but it cannot supply the authority behind them.</p><p>It also means that trust, reputation, and distribution are no longer problems to solve after launch. They are part of the product itself. If an idea can be detached from its creator and absorbed by a platform without resistance, it was never defensible to begin with.</p><p>The startups that survive this era of AI will not look like traditional startups. They will resemble institutions, disciplines, or professions — things with continuity, authority, and accountability. Their advantage will not be speed. It will be standing.</p><p>AI is not ending startups. It is forcing them to justify their existence.

But if you’ve ever felt like a blank page was staring back at you, you know that absolute clarity is often the enemy of a great idea.</p><p>I recently ran a workshop called <strong>“Writing Clear Requirements for Humans and AI”</strong> that explored a different path: using “Vibe Coding” (rapid prototyping) not to build a final product, but to explore the messy, conceptual space where the best ideas live.</p><p>Here is how you can use three specific Gemini Gems to move from a vague “vibe” to a battle-tested requirement.</p><h3>1.

It isn’t about becoming an engineer; it’s about making your thinking much stronger earlier in the process. It’s about “rubber ducking” your decisions, externalizing your thinking so you can look at it in a more objective way, with a machine before you bring it to your team.</p><p>Instead of staring at a template, start with the <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1y8nq4XH7FCB3dj-nY4wp0vZDD4TZd5_a?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Brief Coach</strong></a>. This Gem acts like a consultant, interviewing you to extract the “what” and “why” of your project.</p><ul><li><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> It guides you through sections like Goals, Critical User Journeys (CUJs), and “Moments That Matter” — those key points of high emotion where the experience is won or lost.</li><li><strong>Fill the Gaps:</strong> If you’re stuck, it can even suggest content to help spark your thinking.</li><li><strong>The Artifact:</strong> You end up with a structured markdown spec that serves as the “context” for everything else you do.</li></ul><h3>2. The Power of the “Bad” Idea</h3><p>We usually try to hide our bad ideas. But in the exploration phase, a “bad” idea is a gift because it helps you define what is actually good.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1MwUzwm6OMCFNhd9SFdulMImqsV4IwcvU?usp=sharing""><strong>Spec Variation Tool</strong></a> takes your initial spec and generates four different ways to realize it to open the aperture of what you are considering.</p><ul><li><strong>Variation Axes:</strong> It tests different assumptions by varying factors like automation levels or interaction paradigms.</li><li><strong>The Provocative Spec:</strong> One of these is intentionally a “provocative” or “bad” version designed to highlight anti-patterns and what <em>not</em> to do.</li><li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> By quickly prototyping these in tools like Google AI Studio, you can see where a concept falls apart. This helps broaden the aperture of exploration rather than just meandering through a single conversation.</li></ul><h3>3. Stress-Testing with a “Rude Engineer”</h3><p>You don’t want the first person to find a flaw in your logic to be your VP during a review. You want to find it yourself, in the privacy of your own AI chat.</p><p>The <a href=""https://gemini.google.com/gem/1xWCiskHjI_wyXtHdIRIGvKq4FlMwYUqp?usp=sharing""><strong>Viewpoint Simulator</strong></a> pressure-tests your spec from multiple, highly biased perspectives.</p><ul><li><strong>The Panel:</strong> It simulates voices like a Product Designer, a Privacy Expert, and even a “Rude Senior Engineer”.</li><li><strong>The Benefit:</strong> The “Rude Engineer” is blunt and skeptical about ambiguity or over-engineering. Because it’s a machine, the feedback isn’t personal. It’s just a tool to help you find your own blind spots.</li></ul><h3>The Future: From Static Boards to “Living” Gems</h3><p>One of the most exciting shifts I’ve been thinking about is the change in how we workshop. We’ve all seen Miro boards full of sticky notes that never get looked at again.</p><p>I believe every Miro should be a Gem. The future of workshopping is a system that collects and keeps distributed context up to date. This allows us to distribute context not only about how to do the workshop later but notes from the workshop itself can become distributed context to be used when needed. Almost like a workbench to create future docs based on everything discussed so far.</p><p>Instead of a static summary, we need a system that creates constantly updated drafts or “views” for different stakeholders, whether that’s for engineering, design, or legal review. This system of drafts is always in flux as the context is updated, we learn new things, and we make hard decisions.</p><h3>Conclusion: Taking it Back to the Team</h3><p>Prototypes and specs are both necessary conversation pieces. The prototype gives the “vibe,” but the spec captures the complexity and nuance that a prototype alone cannot.</p><p>When you take these artifacts back to your team, here are the next steps to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Set Clear Expectations:</strong> Make it crystal clear that these prototypes are tests to aid in decisions, not the final product to be built.</li><li><strong>Use Tools Live:</strong> Try using these Gems live in meetings. Hearing how an engineer or designer interprets the AI’s feedback can spark valuable discussions.</li><li><strong>Don’t Replace, Collaborate:</strong> These tools aren’t meant to replace designers or engineers; they are meant to spark discussion. Use them to say, “Here is what I care about; here is some stuff to look at if it’s helpful”.</li><li><strong>Keep a Decision Log:</strong> Document what you decided <em>not</em> to do. This path of exploration helps others understand exactly how you arrived at your final direction.</li><li><strong>Help Write Agent Specs:</strong> PMs can better integrate into the development process by helping write the specs that AI agents will use to do work.</li></ul><p>Next time you’re starting something new, don’t aim for immediate clarity. Use these Gems to find that “just enough confusion” that leads to a breakthrough.</p><p><em>This article was crafted by the author, with help from Gemini, which drew from the author’s engaging workshop transcript and related materials.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=11faeedb5274"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-pms-can-vibe-code-to-build-stronger-requirements-11faeedb5274"">How PMs can vibe code to build stronger requirements</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
