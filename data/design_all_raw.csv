<figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person balancing on a tightrope while a large hand with scissors approaches the rope from the side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*n2weUqH4sYpW47u47ZKRPA.png"" /></figure><h4>When AI answers before you understand.</h4><p>I never decided to go all in on AI, it just kept showing up.</p><p>At first, in small, practical ways. Generating content for design mocks or writing simple scripts to automate boring tasks. I even built a Figma plugin to easily rename all the icons in our icon library, to avoid the repetitive work, but also because I was curious if I could make it work.</p><p>One thing led to another. I started playing around and started finding excuses to explore. I built an iOS app to keep track of daily exercise, started playing with V0 and Lovable to quickly brainstorm and generate rough design directions.</p><p>Then the play started to become serious, when I took a stab at shipping real production PRs into the Shopify admin, and even more serious after I joined the Sidekick team.</p><p>I wasn’t forced. I didn’t plan it. It was just inevitable.</p><p>When you get a sharp knife, you don’t keep cutting with the blunt one.<br />But somewhere along the way, I started noticing that this knife could slip.</p><h3>From wandering to answers</h3><p>Early on I changed how I approach research online. I stopped defaulting to Google search and started relying more on Perplexity, and other similar tools.</p><p>On paper, it’s an obvious upgrade. Direct answers, cleaner summaries, fewer tabs open, and much less noise. But something subtle disappeared in the process.</p><p>No more random blog posts from 2010, fewer half-relevant Reddit rabbit holes. Almost nothing that pulled me somewhere unexpected.</p><p>I stopped wandering, I started extracting.</p><p>Super efficient, but over time, that efficiency started to shape how I thought. I was moving faster towards answers, but along narrower paths. Ideas felt more predictable, and I was less surprised by where I ended up. The work converged quickly, sometimes too quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of several people walking in the same direction with zombie-like posture, while one person in the middle shrugs and looks confused."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GxRLUzumiwbRWV9DHeQEKA.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Design almost never benefits from straight lines. Some ideas only show up when you take the long way around, when you don’t quite know what you’re looking for yet. When there’s room for detours, dead ends, side-quests, and a bit of adventure.</blockquote><p>That’s when I started noticing how much the tools were quietly changing where my attention went.</p><h3>When speed feels like understanding</h3><p>The popular narrative is that AI makes people ten times faster. That’s not false, but it’s missing something important.</p><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/7-tips-to-design-faster-ae01c6fa71f2"">Speed always mattered in design</a>, because it enables you to explore more options, learn sooner, and iterate your ways towards something better. Which is super valuable when you know what you’re aiming for.</p><p>What changed with AI wasn’t that reality, it’s the fact that now I can do things that I wouldn’t have attempted at all.</p><p>It’s not just making me explore more ideas faster, prototype thoughts sooner. It’s also giving the capability to touch code areas that I used to treat as off-limits, to ship production PRs. Crossing boundaries that previously felt like someone else’s job.</p><p>This shift is real, and it’s empowering.</p><p>But there’s a catch, when something becomes easy or possible, it can feel understood. The act of doing replaces the work of learning. I could change things confidently, quickly, and convincingly, and in the process mistake that fluency for comprehension.</p><p>This is where the delusion creeps in. AI makes you believe you’re quickly unlocking new capabilities before you actually earn the right to do so. You believe that because you can change something easily, you understand it.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person diving underwater with a flashlight, illuminating a large iceberg hidden beneath the surface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q22c40M7zQHC7IQHRQci6w.png"" /></figure><p>That confusion between ease and understanding showed up for me very concretely when I started shipping production code. I tried to start small, a spacing fix. Something contained, just visual polish. Turns out to be one of the hardest things I could have picked, according to an engineer that reviewed my PR.</p><p>The spacing issue wasn’t local, it was the result of deeper inconsistencies across shared components. I only understood that after that very patient engineer walked me through the system and its dependencies.</p><p>Shipping production software inside a large organization still has gravity. There are stakeholder, reviews, guardrails, dependencies, and real consequences. No amount of prompting turns that into a free-for-all, and that’s a good thing.</p><p>Ultimatly, after properly understanding the problem we didn’t just fix the symptom, we fixed the core problem. But when I asked Claude (in Cursor) to fix the issue, it did. Quickly and bluntly. It ignored system constraints, because it didn’t know they existed, and I didn’t know any better.</p><p>Confidence without context is a delusion. Being able to make something with AI isn’t the same as understanding what you’re making.</p><h3>When the tool sets the direction</h3><p>Most conversations about AI in design drift quickly toward how people are using it. One-shot prompts, workflows, tool stacks, prototype hacks. The tool becomes the story.</p><p>“How did you make this?” quietly replaces a more important question: “What were you trying to accomplish, and why?”</p><p>That shift matters, because when the <em>how</em> comes too early, it starts shaping the outcome. You optimize for what the tool is good at, and adjust the problem to fit the workflow.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a hand lifting a person like a chess piece above a chessboard while the person holds another chess piece."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FNnATLGJ0-9VcRbDRaVD2w.png"" /></figure><p>The demos look technically impressive and you get results quickly. It feels like magic, but strong design direction doesn’t come from execution tricks. It comes from intent.</p><p>When the <em>how</em> leads, quality follows the path with least resistance, not necessarily the one worth taking.</p><p>Earlier this year I was tasked to create an illustration style with AI.<br />I explored several directions that were heavily shaped by AI’s strengths and limitations at the time. The results were interesting, and I would go as far as saying a couple directions were an improvement over what we had, but they didn’t stand on their own.</p><p>The direction couldn’t convincingly last over time, and even though we got really close to shipping it, a key stakeholder put a pause in the project, and rightfully so.</p><p>That failure wasn’t because AI was bad at illustration, it was because I let the tool define directions before an idea had earned its shape. Also the fact that it as an AI generated style started to matter more than whether the actual direction.</p><p>The problem wasn’t usefulness, it was timing.</p><p>I feel this a lot when I try to prototype genuinely new ideas with AI.</p><p>I start refining prompts, then refining the prompt that refines the prompt. I sketch something in Figma, just to explain what I mean. Suddenly, I’m no longer exploring the problem space, I’m negotiating with a probabilistic system.</p><p>The focus shifts. I’m not designing the idea anymore, I’m designing for the tool.</p><h3>What gets pushed aside</h3><p>AI trains impatience. When it doesn’t get things right fast enough, I feel friction. And that friction shows up precisely where slowness actually matters.</p><p>A pencil and paper, or a blank Figma canvas, let me dump ideas out of my head without having to explain myself. I can contradict myself, I can be sloppy, I can discover the problem while working on it.</p><p>AI demands certainty much earlier, it struggles when the input is fuzzy, novel or still forming. When constraints need to bend and evolve, instead of locking everything too soon.</p><p>Those are exactly the moments where design needs space to reflect, not quick answers. Design starts with ambiguity, not clarity. With ideas that are still fragile and half-formed. With thoughts that don’t quite line up yet.</p><p>Designers need time to wonder.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person lying across the hands of a large clock, staring upward as time passes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Bx2OxnNRZvHWWichuwj4nQ.png"" /></figure><p>Time to poke ideas without knowing where they’ll land. Time to follow threads that might go somewhere. Time to sit with something unresolved long enough for it to surprise you.</p><p>That space used to exist more naturally, now it’s getting compressed.</p><p>When answers arrive too early, they create a sense of progress, but lack depth. You move forward, but not inwards. You lock in the first thing that makes sense, because it arrived quickly.</p><p>Reflection doesn’t vanish on its own, it gets pushed aside. If you don’t protect it, it doesn’t survive.</p><h3>Judgement is the real multiplier</h3><p>The same tools in the hands of different designers don’t produce similar results. They amplify what’s already there.<br />You don’t get taste, judgement, context, and design sensitivity for free.</p><p>AI doesn’t level the field, it widens the gap.<br />Because it doesn’t replace judgement, it leans on it.</p><p>A weak designer doesn’t suddenly produce great work with better tools. They just produce mediocre work faster. A strong designer uses the same tools very differently. They explore more directions, but they also discard aggressively. They recognize what’s obvious and push past it.</p><p>The tool augments you, not design in the abstract. So what you bring to the table as a designer actually matters even more now.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person blowing bubbles shaped like light bulbs, floating in the air."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zicX1MIaCzEIaSTahJfYIA.png"" /></figure><p>I felt this clearly while preparing a workshop earlier this year. I started by dumping everything out of my head. Ideas, doubts, half-formed thoughts. Only after that I used ChatGPT to explore formats, exercises, and ways to structure my sessions.</p><p>It was incredibly helpful, and a speed boost. But only because I already had a sense of direction. I still had to decide what to keep, what to ignore, and what actually felt like me, because ultimately I need to feel comfortable standing in front of people and own it.</p><p>I’ve noticed this pattern repeat. Once something exists, like a sketch or rough idea, AI can be a helpful partner to expand your options, challenge assumptions, and suggest variations.</p><p>It’s great at reacting to something concrete, but doesn’t do it pro-actively.<br />AI is not curious, it’s optimized to continue your thoughts, not to come up with new ones. So if you use it as a starting point, that’s where you dilute your intent.</p><h3>What gets lost when everything feels like magic</h3><p>I’m happy to hand off repetitive busy work to AI. The kind of effort that burns time without building judgement. Removing that toils is a real win, especially because it clears space.</p><p>But some struggles are worth keeping.</p><p>AI is extremely good at multiplying output, but learning doesn’t compound just because you did more things. It compounds when you compare, discard, and understand why one direction is better than another.</p><p>Iterating through bad ideas. Refining a design until it finally feels right. Figuring out how to explain your thinking to other people. Being wrong and having to course-correct. Sitting with uncertainty longer than is comfortable. These moments may not look efficient, but they are formative. That’s where taste comes from.</p><p>Without these loops, experience doesn’t compound. It flattens.<br />It’s like trying to learn how to draw by tracing pictures. You’re going to get a decent result faster, but you’re not actually learning.</p><p>A lot of people talk about design replacing juniors, and paint a world where a single super senior designer, with the right tools, can do everything. Strategy, exploration, execution, polish. Basically, they’re the maestro, and they play all the instruments. That’s a lot to carry alone.</p><p>What this misses, is the fact that junior designers aren’t a tool. <br />They don’t just execute. They question decisions and propose alternatives. They bring a unique perspective, sometimes naive, that makes the work better. They’re not invested in obeying and pleasing you, and just doing what they’re told.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person sitting on one end of a seesaw while a laptop falls onto the opposite end."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8T_3airHWTgAift2j5361A.png"" /></figure><p>When AI is your only partner, the expectation flips. It’s all on you.</p><p>Even if you’re lucky to have colleagues around, you’ll notice that most feedback changes when people aren’t actively working on the same problem. You get reactions instead of debate. Validation instead of pushback.</p><p>Creativity gets quieter, more internal.</p><p>Human friction still matters. Not just for the sake of quality and innovation, but to keep you from fooling yourself.</p><h3>Design matters more now</h3><p>Design doesn’t disappear because systems can generate things. If nothing else, designers still have to shape these system’s interactions, mental models, build trust and failure modes.</p><p>The chat interface is the beginning, not the end. They’re a convenient starting point, but not a natural destination. We’re already seeing that evolution is starting to happen with tools like Cursor introducing mixing conversation with direct manipulation. That feels like an early signal, not a finished answer.</p><p>Working on Sidekick has made especially clear to me how young and rudimentar these tools still are. A lot of their behaviour is still evolving, and the potential is immense.</p><p>Recently, I worked on our app-generation baseline prompt and design guidance, where I had to decide what the model should optimize for, and just as importantly, what it should avoid.</p><p>This kind of work doesn’t look like traditional feature design. It’s closer to shaping behaviour, explaining intent, providing examples, anticipating needs and misuse. Designing guardrails without locking everything down… sounds a lot like design systems, doesn’t it?</p><p>The difference now, is that we have a real opportunity to make these tools feel more human. To meet people where they are, instead of forcing everyone through a single predefined flow, or pre-baked set of components.</p><p>Interfaces don’t have to be static anymore, they can adapt to context, intent, and experience. But that space needs to be thoroughly explored.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person climbing stairs while carrying an oversized pencil, which is being used to draw the steps."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rwFNspeNLcFGHajwxrf55Q.png"" /></figure><p>It needs design. It needs designers to wander, to tinker, and more importanly, to have fun.</p><h3>Where the cut happens</h3><p>None of what I said above means AI doesn’t belong in early design.</p><p>AI has meaningfully changed how I work. It helps me explore directions faster, summarize large contexts, bridge into code, and offload repetitive work so I can spend energy where it actually matters.</p><p>What’s important is not what AI can do, it’s what I do with it.<br />Used too early, it collapses uncertainty before ideas have earned their shape. User a bit later, it becomes a powerful partner, reacting to intent instead of defining it.</p><p>This isn’t a question of AI’s capability, it’s a question of YOUR capability and timing.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a person cutting into a thought cloud with a knife."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LwqhobBWnLhLn6zN-xUOSg.png"" /></figure><p>This reminds me of the first Japanese chef’s knife I ever bought.<br />It looked beautiful. Perfect balance and incredibly sharp. It cut through almost everything with no effort… including me.</p><p>One of the first things I did with it was slice my hand. The knife went through my skin with no resistance. I still have the scar.</p><p>The knife wasn’t the problem, it was doing exactly what it was designed to do. I just wasn’t ready to handle it.</p><p>AI feels powerful, easy to use, and only getting sharper. If you’re not careful, it lets you move so fast that you skip the moments where attention and judgment matter most.</p><p>So the question isn’t if AI is sharp enough for you to use it. <br />The real question is whether you’re paying enough attention to where and when you’re cutting.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading! <br />If you feel like connecting, I’m on </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/halfool/""><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/halfool_draws/""><em>Instagram</em></a>,<em> and </em><a href=""https://x.com/halfool_draws""><em>X</em></a><em>.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b1014292335d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-sharp-tool-can-still-ruin-the-cut-b1014292335d"">A sharp tool can still ruin the cut</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>and why I’ve been making Bob Dylan songs about Sonic the Hedgehog</h4><figure><img alt=""Cat holding various objects from phones to tarot cards infront of 2025 text"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RHYn-0zB5LzBS1VLBCE8og.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>End of 2025 Reflections. illustration by author.</em></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, AI stopped feeling like just a tool to me and started to feel more like a mirror.</p><p>This thought really struck me while generating music with Suno AI. Through the process of creating, I was channelling my raw emotion, emotions I hadn’t realised I was even dealing with at the time. Is this how musicians feel when writing songs?</p><p>This AI tool, like so many I’ve used this year, did not help reflect just my productivity, but also showed me my intentions, my taste, and sometimes even my nostalgia. In a way, the songs I was generating were more truthful about what was happening in my life than I was willing to admit.</p><p>Hell, I was producing so many songs at one point that they started subtly referencing one another with a lyric here and there, creating my own mini music universe. I made a <a href=""https://suno.com/s/Cw2XE2hMNCJTavEU"">Bob Dylan-style narrative about Sonic from the comic,</a> weaving in philosophical concepts. I remixed <a href=""https://suno.com/s/nyXDFnMujFIS8dzB"">If You’re Strong You Can Fly from Sonic CD</a>. I turned classic poems into music: <a href=""https://suno.com/s/dJAscTp2gfe8kajG"">The Tyger</a> and <a href=""https://suno.com/s/LQrLMIHXyKzNXpU6"">The Raven</a>.</p><p>I appreciate these experiments because they prompt me to critically examine whether AI-generated artefacts are inherently more detached from us as creators. Because this raises important questions about the nature of ownership in collaborative creation with AI. While it is possible to use AI while still maintaining ownership of the resulting ideas, this requires one’s ability to articulate, defend, and integrate them into one’s own conceptual framework. Ultimately, if we fail to maintain active engagement with the creative process and merely delegate tasks to AI without reflection, there is a risk that delegation becomes abdication of responsibility and authorship.</p><h3>Where we’re heading</h3><p>I think we’re at an inflexion point for product management and knowledge work more broadly. The tools we have now enable us to operate at a scale and speed that was unimaginable even two years ago. But that acceleration comes with a cost: we’re less practised at the slow, deliberate thinking that leads to insight.</p><p>In the field of product management, I have long suspected that the future belongs to generalists, and I’ve never been more sure of that. Those who can think and do, who understand engineering, data science, UX, marketing, and sales deeply enough to prototype, test models, run discovery, and build strategies that excite teams will be the most successful. The single-domain specialist is increasingly a relic.</p><p>The most important thing we can do is maintain our attention, take accountability for our actions and deliverables, and resist the weaponisation of our curiosity. That’s the work ahead.</p><h3>From tarot to moon ceremonies</h3><figure><img alt=""Author Hanging out at Avebury Hedge for the Sprint Equinox"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jPY3cB6x5G9oBqfCN1Dxeg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Hanging out at Avebury Hedge for the Sprint Equinox</figcaption></figure><p>Last year, I joked about using tarot cards for sprint planning. This year, I’ve built on that theme. 2025 was the year I got introduced to moon ceremonies and magic stones. I understand many will read that and think I’ve gone potty, but hear me out.</p><p>Like tarot, I don’t really believe these things have any inherent power, but they are useful for reflection by forcing you to recognise where you are right now and set an intention. But what’s surprised me: these silly ceremonies are very engaging. Friends, family, even colleagues: people WANT to be involved in the silly gathering. Curiosity, novelty, disgust, whatever it is, it’s just fun. There is something about putting people in a scenario where we can all share in the collective chaos of the universe and support each other through whatever insights we find. Friendship is not natural. It needs work because to be human is to be an animal that needs witnesses.</p><p>Anyway, those are just the highlights. Below are more reflections that gave me pause this year. Dive in, and I hope they inspire and invoke thoughts that set you up for a great 2026.</p><h3>The Reflections</h3><h4><strong>On debate and changing minds:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>The best way to resolve a conflict or debate is to make the argument of your opponent better than they could.</strong> You literally have to make a better version of their argument, state it back to them, then ask, “Did I miss anything?” That clarity of understanding is the foundation for any possible change of mind for all parties involved, including ourselves.</li><li><strong>Changing somebody’s mind is one of the hardest things to achieve, and aggressive approaches tend to backfire.</strong> There is one thing that works, though: show curiosity. Be interested in what they are saying and try to understand why they think that way. This will provoke a considerably more open-minded response from others. Curiosity: the same thing social media weaponises against us, but when genuinely deployed in conversation, becomes one of our most powerful tools for connection.</li><li><strong>When debating, people tend to prefer the position of those who don’t really hold one of their own.</strong> LLMs are perfect for this and thus a great tool for finding common ground.</li></ol><h4><strong>On AI and tools:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>The most important thing, I think, that most people in knowledge work should be doing is learning to vibe code.</strong> Vibe code anything: a diary, a picture book for your mum, a fan page for your local farm. Anything. It’s not about learning to code, but rather appreciating how much more we could do with machines than before. This is what I mean about the generalist product manager: being able to prototype, test, and build without being held back by technical constraints. I was able to relaunch <a href=""https://adrianraudaschl.com"">my website</a> in a fraction of the time it took me years ago, adding interactive effects and custom graphics that would have taken weeks before. I could finally create a website that feels like me: not only a record of things I’ve done, but also a place for experiments like a mini social media feed, all without the long nights solving silly problems like deploy configs.</li><li><strong>Learn to work creatively with LLMs in this order of importance: combinational, exploratory, and novel.</strong></li><li><strong>If you let AI do all the writing and planning without understanding the thinking behind it, you’ll lose connection to the outcome.</strong> The key is maintaining ownership: can you defend the ideas, explain the reasoning, and adapt the direction mid-process? If yes, you’re using the tool. If not, the tool is using you. Like I said at the start: the danger is delegation turning into abdication.</li><li><strong>When working without AI, teams outperformed individuals by a significant amount, and teams working with AI outperformed everything else.</strong> (<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5188231"">Research source</a>)</li></ol><h4><strong>On leadership and politics:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Aligning the goals of many people begins with understanding what a good outcome looks like for each of them.</strong> This was my biggest learning from bringing together groups with very different approaches to product development.</li><li><strong>Paranoia grows with success.</strong> I suspect that’s natural, as you have more to lose, and now you are exposed to far more signals. Keep an eye on it and always be prepared to lose something with the hope of gaining more in return.</li><li><strong>You need to learn to love politics, and you also need to understand that politics gets more childish the higher you go up in the organisation.</strong></li><li><strong>Sometimes you need to just call out the mood in the room.</strong> That we have gone off track, that there is tension, that we need to take a moment to step back. To do this well, ask a question rather than declare it: “Are we still aligned on our goals here?” invites reflection better than “We’ve lost sight of our goals.”</li></ol><h4><strong>On building and creating:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Don’t build a prototype with the goal of making a solution. Prototypes are best used as questions, not answers.</strong></li><li><strong>Thoughtless thinking is a state we should all strive for.</strong> Henrik Karlsson’s “<a href=""https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/wordless-thought"">When Is It Better to Think Without Words?</a>” explores this beautifully: how our most profound thinking often happens in a pre-verbal state, before we’ve forced our thoughts into the constraints of language. This is the slow, deliberate thinking I mentioned earlier: the kind that gets harder to access as our tools get faster.</li><li><strong>Three intelligences: human, artificial, and community.</strong></li><li><strong>To do the most important things, you have to say no a lot and disappoint many people, even without a complete plan, even without fully understanding why, in the hope that the space created will be filled with something more valuable.</strong></li><li><strong>So much of what is worth doing requires an almost irrational commitment to pushing through pain that would break most people.</strong></li><li><strong>You win either by climbing the mountain ahead of you or building one beneath you.</strong></li><li><strong>A great work emerges from an invisible ecology of lesser works.</strong></li><li><strong>Sometimes you just need to build a faster horse.</strong> There ain’t no shame in admitting that. Spotify was just the faster horse in a world of iTunes.</li></ol><h4><strong>On life and perspective:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Experience is what you get when you don’t get what you want.</strong></li><li><strong>Strengths and weaknesses are often two sides of the same coin.</strong></li><li><strong>The older I get, the more I realise there aren’t a lot of people who are stupid, but there are allot of people who are incurious.</strong> In many ways, I can’t blame them. Social media continually weaponises our curiosity against us.</li></ol><h4><strong>On friendship:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>When having a party, invite a few close friends to come 30–60 minutes early to set up and hang out with you.</strong> Those moments before everyone arrives, when you’re just arranging chairs and testing the speaker system, are often more valuable than the party itself. Uri’s “<a href=""https://www.atvbt.com/21-facts-about-throwing-good-parties/"">21 Facts About Throwing Good Parties</a>” captures this wisdom: parties succeed not through perfect execution but through creating the conditions for genuine connection. Like the moon ceremonies and tarot, it’s about creating space for people to witness each other.</li><li><strong>We are biologically wired to return favours, even unearned ones.</strong> This works both ways: be mindful of what you accept and what you give.</li></ol><h4><strong>In the future:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Image generation models have reached a tipping point this year.</strong> The most recent models can perform amazing style transfer and contextual image transformations, and they can now reliably produce text with context. I foresee an explosion in visual learning aids and exploration next year. When designing Christmas cards this year or a t-shirt design for LeapSpace, I could layer so much more information: aggregating all my experiences from the year into a symbol-rich card, or blending the most important scientific discoveries with my love of 2001: A Space Odyssey and our product logo. It’s not just about generating images anymore; it’s about encoding meaning and narrative visually. The same way I encoded narrative into those Sonic songs: remixing what you love through your own lens.</li><li><strong>I’ve started getting more sophisticated with using AI in different work environments.</strong> Using IDEs like Cursor, I’ve set up folders of documents with custom instructions on how to interact with and retrieve them to help make informed decisions, answer questions, or continue building my knowledge base. It’s still early, but I really like this idea of the working directory knowledge base that grows with you and is managed by AI.</li><li><a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15168""><strong>World models</strong></a> look super interesting. For those unfamiliar, world models are AI systems that build internal representations of their environment, allowing them to predict outcomes and reason about their surroundings. Recent research argues they should develop structured, adaptive representations similar to how young children intuitively learn about the world. Google DeepMind’s <a href=""https://deepmind.google/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/"">Genie 3</a> even has this awesome visual and interactive version, generating dynamic, navigable worlds at 24 fps with real-time interaction. I can imagine that when they get more consistent, do text really well, are easily promptable and can do style transfer and brand consistency, they’ll be incredible for games and entertainment.</li><li><strong>What hits me is this idea of having simulated environments for our best ideas.</strong> It doesn’t have to be a high-fidelity environment necessarily, but one with a set of parameters that can be controlled, understood, and evolve. I often think of the Creature pets from Lionhead’s Black and White game from the 2000s: this was, at the time, state-of-the-art AI in a game of all things! Your behaviour towards the creature, if you treated it nicely or poorly, would directly impact its behaviour and personality towards itself, your villagers and the world around it. This was all part of a more complex system for the creatures, which was also influenced by other factors, such as the skills they were taught, the food they ate, and the events that shaped their lives. All of it, effectively, a bunch of parameters that the game would adjust based on your actions. Treat your creature poorly, punish it in confusing ways and not feed it, over time it will become sickly and cowardly. I often think about this and how modelling a system like that could be a template for working with increasingly complex AIs. That, rather than prompting with instructions and context, we were to give it personality traits and, in addition to collecting memories, adjust those parameters to provide context over time. It’s a different way of thinking about AI interaction: not as tool use, but as relationship building.</li></ol><h4><strong>Travel and discoveries:</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Hot spring waterfalls in Beitou, Taipei"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WFbYDSI6G74uX-7pXb5aHQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Hot spring waterfalls in Beitou, Taipei</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>After seeing one of my favourite shirts ruined on a sweaty 12-hour flight to Tokyo, I discovered Muji’s undershirts.</strong> Now essential for both comfort and confidence (no under arm stains for me), and keeping my nicest shirts safe! Means slightly less washing too: top tip.</li><li><strong>The two-phone travel strategy for China: carry one phone for all the Chinese apps and a second to translate the screen of your primary phone.</strong> Chinese apps are built with a completely opposite philosophy to the West’s simplicity, dense with options and configurations. But what struck me most was the gamification of everything. From the potential to win a free Luckin Coffee to getting a random discount on your subway fare. It’s so alien and different, as if you’re encouraged to participate in the economy with the hope of winning. Every transaction becomes a tiny lottery. Fascinating from a design perspective, maddening from a user one.</li><li><strong>If you love hot springs, you need to visit Beitou in Taipei.</strong> Most people never visit Taiwan, but if you’re a hot spring lover, this place is absolutely worth the trip.</li><li><strong>A country can be in economic decline, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t be graceful.</strong> Japan is a master at this.</li><li><strong>Comics over anime.</strong> I got really tired of watching most things and found myself returning to source material: One Punch Man, Dragon Ball, Death Note, BLAME!, and The Invincible. The <a href=""https://stctp.zone/"">Sonic the Comic podcast</a> was a surprisingly detailed hit of nostalgia. Same Sonic that inspired those AI-generated songs I mentioned: everything connects back to what we loved first.</li><li><strong>The Trimui Brick Hammer became my new favourite toy this year.</strong> A retro gaming handheld that plays SNES, GBA, PS1, even some Dreamcast and N64 games, all in a compact metal body that feels far more premium than its cost. Perfect for train commutes, flights, and, more importantly, for disconnecting from my phone for all my entertainment. I even installed a custom OS on it, so it’s also now my iPod.</li><li><strong>The Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L has become the greatest bag I’ve ever had.</strong> Sometimes you just find that perfect piece of gear that fits exactly how you move through the world.</li><li><strong>The new iPhone earned its place for two reasons: the orange colour (finally, some personality in tech) and insane all-day battery life.</strong></li></ol><h4><strong>On health and awareness:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>At the start of the year, I was plagued by sickness until February.</strong> It was just a really bad cold/virus, but it encouraged me to finally get some blood tests done as a checklist. I saw a few things I didn’t like, but especially concerning low vitamin D and calcium levels. That event finally encouraged me to optimise my nutrition. Ten months later, an updated blood test shows me things are going in the right direction, and I feel really good.</li><li><strong>The Oura ring helped me get a handle on how stressed I am at any given time.</strong> I started strong with silent retreats and meditation, but didn’t keep that up. However, just recognising the stress has been useful. Attention to what’s happening in your own body is as important as attention to your work.</li><li><strong>Using foam rollers has brought me so much back relief after months of desk work.</strong></li><li>The Ordinary’s balancing and clarifying serum completely transformed my skincare routine. Simple discoveries made a huge difference.</li></ol><h4><strong>Borrowed wisdom that stuck:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>“If nothing interrupts you, you are not living; you are a screensaver.”</strong></li><li><strong>“Fear is the greatest trick your enemies can play on you. Respect fear, but never give into it.”</strong> Timothy Snyder’s “<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tyranny-Twenty-Lessons-Twentieth-Century/dp/1847924883"">On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century</a>” remains essential reading on how fear becomes the primary tool of manipulation, and why refusing to submit to it is an act of resistance.</li><li><strong>“Big tech like to see themselves invested in spreading knowledge and curiosity, but most of them prosper when spreading fear and stupidity.”</strong> The weaponisation of curiosity I keep coming back to.</li><li><strong>“Collecting is our desire to create a system that competes with the destructiveness of time itself.”</strong></li><li><strong>“You craft your most authentic self by encountering the ways others have done so themselves.”</strong></li><li><strong>“A dark infinity swallowed up our lights.”</strong>: David Rose (<a href=""https://unherd.com/2025/05/inside-britains-underworld/"">source</a>)</li><li><strong>“People like you more when you are working towards something, not when you have it.”</strong>: Drake</li><li><strong>Glamour offers a promise of escape and transformation.</strong></li><li><strong>After water, sand is the second-most-used material in the world.</strong></li></ol><h3><strong>Reading that shaped my thinking:</strong></h3><p>Edward Packard’s “<a href=""https://edwardpackard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nine-Things-I-Learned-In-Ninety-Years.pdf"">Nine Things I Learned in Ninety Years</a>” offers the kind of wisdom that only comes from a life fully lived. And “<a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/populist-phantom-threat-democracy-bartels"">The Populist Phantom</a>” helped me understand why so many people now describe themselves as disconnected from traditional institutions: sometimes what looks like populism is just people responding rationally to systems that have stopped serving them.</p><p>Have a brilliant 2026, everyone.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=207b512396a1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-product-managers-48-reflections-on-2025-207b512396a1"">A product manager’s 48 reflections on 2025</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h3>A UX carol</h3><h4>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</h4><figure><img alt=""Stylized illustration titled “The Ghost of UX Past”: a nostalgic attic scene where a modern young man with a smartphone stands beside a seated person using an old desktop computer. A ghostly figure holding a book labeled “HTML” points at the retro screen displaying a hit counter for a website."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nrlgpOj8kMplYupM.png"" /></figure><p>It was Christmas Eve, 2025, and like any other day, Ulysses Xavier was doom-scrolling LinkedIn.</p><p>Ulysses was a UX designer — or a “Product Designer,” or maybe a “Digital Experience Architect,” or a “Product Experience Manager,” depending on which day you asked him. Currently, however, he felt more like a Figma monkey. He sat in his Scandinavian designer chair, bathed in the orangey light of a dual-monitor setup (because you gotta filter out that blue light), reading yet another hot take about how AI had rendered his so-called career — which was kind of a joke, anyway — obsolete.</p><p>“Bah,” Ulysses muttered, quickly archiving yet another generic rejection email from a job application. “Humbug.”</p><p>He closed his eyes, wishing for the good old times when designers did all the user research and customer journeys by themselves. When he opened them, his MacBook and monitors were gone and his Spotify playlist “Coffee Shop Background Noises” replaced by the screeching, static-filled sound of a 28.8k modem connecting to the internet.</p><h3>The First of the Three Spirits</h3><p>Standing before him was an ethereal, slightly translucent figure dressed in flannel and holding a copy of <em>HTML for Dummies</em>.</p><p>“I am the Ghost of UX Past,” the figure said, its voice crackling like a 32-kbps RealAudio. “Come with me.”</p><p>Suddenly, Ulysses was back in 1995. He saw an attic. A solitary figure sat hunched over a CRT monitor, coding in what looked like a very old-school Apple Notes, typing on a keyboard that seemed way too clunky and loud.</p><p>“Is that ... a developer?” Ulysses asked.</p><p>“No,” the Ghost corrected. “That is Max. He’s what’s called a webmaster. In this era, there are no silos. He designs the page, writes the HTML, configures the server, and crops the JPEGs in Photoshop. He’s like a general contractor of the web.”​¹</p><p>Ulysses watched Max struggle. He was using invisible tables for layout because CSS didn’t really exist yet.² He was embedding headers as images because there were only a handful of fonts like Times New Roman and Courier available.³ It looked like a horrible mess … and painful.​</p><p>“It looks terrible,” Ulysses whispered, eyeing a blinking hit counter.</p><p>“It’s <em>foundational</em>,” the Ghost retorted. “There is nothing like ‘user experience’ yet — Don Norman has only started coining the term at Apple recently.⁴ But look at the ownership. Look at the freedom. There are no stakeholders blocking tickets. There’s just the creator and the user. It’s chaotic, yes. But it’s pure creative problem solving … well, maybe more creative than solving, to be fair.”​</p><p>“What is he using?” Ulysses asked. The ghost put a hand on his shoulder: “It’s called Notepad.”</p><p>Ulysses realized something. The constraints of the past — the technical limits, the lack of tools — forced immense creativity, even if the pages often seemed ugly. But these people weren’t just pushing (ugly) pixels; they were actually wrestling a giant squid.​</p><h3>The Second of the Three Spirits</h3><p>The scene dissolved into a sterile, open-plan office. Ulysses was sitting at a desk that looked like it rather belonged in a hospital. He noticed that on his monitor, there was a Zoom call with 45 participants.</p><p>“Am I … in a Zoom call … in an office? Why?”</p><p>“That’s the exact question I ask myself everyday … I’m the Ghost of UX Present, by the way,” sighed a weary figure who had appeared at his side, wearing a hoodie and looking noticeably burned out.</p><p>Ulysses looked around in confusion. He saw hundreds of designers churning out high-fidelity mockups in Figma, moving pixels by 4px increments. He saw their anxiety as Slack channels quickly filled with requests from stakeholders and management.</p><p>A couple of desks down, one of the designers was just laid off by his manager, “because revenue is bad and we have AI now to save costs.”</p><p>“Look at them,” the Ghost gestured. “They are terrified.”</p><p>Where the Ghost had gestured, Ulysses now saw analytics dashboards floating in the air like holographic projections. He couldn’t identify all the numbers<a href=""https://2008.maxspeicher.com/2022/09/26/steal-this-blog-post/"">,</a> because they seemed to be using Liquid Glass, but he saw the more than 250,000 tech layoffs from 2023.⁵ He saw the job market flooded with bootcamp graduates who had been promised secure and high-paying UX jobs.​⁶</p><p>“They feel like assembly line workers,” Ulysses said, recognizing the feeling. “Figma monkeys.”⁷</p><p>“Precisely,” the Ghost nodded. “They see product managers doing user research and creating wireframes. They see AI generating layouts faster than they can think. They are fighting for a seat at the table, but once they get there, they just take orders.”​⁸</p><p>The Ghost showed him a designer arguing with a stakeholder. The designer wanted to do discovery research; the stakeholder just wanted the screens done by Friday.</p><p>“We have become obsessed with the <em>artifacts</em> of design,” the Ghost said sadly. “Screens. Flows. Wireframes. We forgot that our job isn’t to make files. It’s to ensure the product works for the user. And because we act like factory workers, we are surprised when business treats us like a cost center to be optimized.”​</p><p>Ulysses felt a pit in his stomach. “Is this it? Is this how it ends? Replaced by AI, apathy, and alienation?”</p><h3>The Last of the Spirits</h3><p>The Zoom call and the office around it faded. Ulysses found himself in a quiet, sunlit room. There were no screens. No keyboards. Just people talking, gesturing, and collaborating. All of them were wearing tags: Human-Centered Product Manager, Interaction Systems Architect, Behavioral Product Strategist, Experience Integration Lead, and Cognitive Systems Engineer.</p><p>A tall, calm figure stood there. This Ghost didn’t look scary. It looked … Ulysses didn’t know how exactly, but maybe something like empowered?!</p><p>“I know what you think. You’ve looked at the job titles and now you think UX is dead,” the Ghost said. “But you are confusing the <em>title</em> with the <em>discipline</em>. We are all designers in one way or the other. I used to be called a ‘UX designer,’ but that was a long time ago.”</p><p>“Where are the screens?” Ulysses asked, looking for a laptop.</p><p>“Gone,” the Ghost smiled. “Or rather, the ideas of ‘screens’ and ‘average users’ are gone. Why would we design one interface on just 5 different screens, but for millions of users? The ‘average’ user never existed anyway.”</p><p>The Ghost waved a hand, and Ulysses saw a vision of the future:</p><h4>1. The End of the Screen (as we know it)</h4><p>“People here don’t draw pages,” the Ghost explained. “They define systems and constraints. They design components and the rules that govern them — ‘The header is always top,’ ‘Component A prioritizes over Component B,’ and so on. An AI takes those components and rules and generates hyper-personalized interfaces for every single user, adapted to their specific device and context.”</p><h4>2. The Designer as Educator</h4><p>Ulysses saw a Human-Centered Product Manager sitting with a Behavioral Product Strategist and a Cognitive Systems Engineer in what seemed to be a very intensive coaching session. “We stopped fighting the inevitable,” the Ghost said. “We embraced the fact that stakeholders, engineers, and product managers want — and need — to be involved in design. So we became force multipliers. We realized that — just like with research—you can’t prevent ‘non-designers’ from designing. But they need support and guidance to ensure the best outcome for the user. Now, our job is to empower <em>everyone</em> to solve their problems with the right design methods, so we can focus on the really wicked stuff and strategy. Oh, and you of course noticed already, but we all got new titles and merged with other disciplines, because in the end, <em>everything</em> is design and nobody understood UX correctly, anyway.”​</p><h4>3. The Death of the “Monkey Worker”</h4><p>“But what about AI?” Ulysses asked. “Did it replace us?”<br />“Obviously not. It replaced the monkey workers,” the Ghost answered firmly. “It replaced the rote production of UI assets. But it couldn’t replace the creative problem solving. Real designers aren’t monkey workers. They are strategic partners. The term ‘UX Designer’ might have vanished from job descriptions, merged into Product or Engineering, but the <em>practice</em> of UX is more vital than ever. Because one thing is for sure: there’ll always be users, and there’ll always be experiences.”</p><h3>The End of It</h3><p>Ulysses Xavier woke up with a start. The orangey light of his monitors seemed to hum softly.</p><p>He looked at his LinkedIn feed again. The doom-mongering articles were still there. The job market was still tough. But for the first time in months — maybe years — he didn’t feel cynical.</p><p>He realized that if he kept clinging to some kind of nostalgic understanding of UX from 1995, 2005, or 2015, he would indeed become a fossil. But if he embraced the shift? If he stopped designing screens for made-up personas that didn’t exist and started designing systems and strategy for an AI to build upon?</p><p>“UX isn’t dying,” Ulysses whispered to his empty room. “It’s merely growing up and finding a new identity.”</p><p>He sat up, opened LinkedIn Learning and typed: “How to build AI systems.” Then, he created a new document and began to jot down the concept for a proper design system for his websites.</p><p><em>Hi! 👋🏻 I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilianspeicher/""><em>Max</em></a><em>, a Product Design Director and Freelance Product Consultant with a Ph.D. in computer science.

<h4>AI didn’t create the craft crisis in design — it exposed the technical literacy gap that’s been eroding strategic influence for over a decade.</h4><figure><img alt=""Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RUyj6Nw2PozgI2F1o8ToIA.avif"" /><figcaption>Dylan Field at Figma 2024 Config (Source: <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma blog</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>At <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-happening-at-config-2024/"">Figma’s Config 2024</a>, CEO Dylan Field stood before 10,000 designers and typed a simple prompt: <em>“A personal portfolio website for a sustainable Middle Earth architect.”</em> Seconds later, a complete UI layout materialized on screen. The crowd watched as Figma’s AI generated wireframes, layouts, and design systems from text prompts.</p><p>Field’s pitch was seductive: “In a world where more software is being created and reimagined because of AI, designing and building products is everyone’s business.”</p><p>Everyone’s business. The democratization promise we’ve heard before — this time powered by GPT-4o and Amazon’s image generators. Some features got huge reactions. The Rename Layers tool earned cheers. But on social media after the event, a different story emerged.</p><p>Designer <a href=""https://sdw.space/figma-ai-and-lost-jobs/"">Sebastiaan de With wrote</a> what many were thinking: “Figma AI will kill most — if not all — of these entry-level design jobs… if someone can simply get that poster (and 10 more like it) generated in a click, people will opt for that most of the time.” The anxiety wasn’t about the technology. It was about what the technology revealed: if AI can do your job with a text prompt, what exactly is your job?</p><p>Then came <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/figma-disables-its-ai-design-feature-that-appeared-to-be-ripping-off-apples-weather-app/"">the Apple Weather app incident</a>. Within days of launch, someone noticed Figma’s AI was generating designs that looked suspiciously like Apple’s Weather app. Not inspired by. Actually resembling. Field disabled the feature and admitted the company had rushed to hit a Config deadline. The feature relaunched months later as “First Draft,” with better guardrails.</p><p>But the damage was philosophical, not just technical. The promise of AI democratizing design ran headlong into a paradox nobody wanted to say out loud: these tools don’t make design accessible to everyone. They make design accessible to people who already understand what they’re looking at.</p><h3>The Paradox Nobody Mentions</h3><p>Here’s what actually happened when non-technical users got their hands on AI design tools.</p><p>In May 2025, accessibility expert <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli tested Figma Sites</a> — the company’s new publish-to-web feature that promised to turn Figma designs into live websites. He ran automated tests on Figma’s own flagship demo sites. The results were brutal: <strong>210 WCAG violations</strong> on one demo site. Another had 107 violations. Images with no alt text. Contrast ratios failing basic accessibility standards. The HTML output was what Roselli called “div soup” — everything rendered as generic container elements, even headings and navigation.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing 210 WCAG accessibility violations detected in Figma Sites demo, with critical errors highlighted in red including missing alt text and contrast issues"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u1udQD4giE_5_j7PMPHSBw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">Adrian Roselli</a>’s blogpost on Do Not Publish Your Designs on the Web with Figma Sites…</figcaption></figure><p>The technical implementation was worse. Drop caps were created using background-colored underscores, a technique that belonged in 1974 typewriter manuals, not modern web development. One commenter created a satirical video called “Introducing: Webbed Sites.” Another posted a reaction titled “Figma’s New Horrific DIV Generator.”</p><p>This wasn’t an AI training problem. This was an expertise problem masquerading as a democratization tool. Figma Sites generated technically valid HTML that was utterly inappropriate for actual use. If you don’t know why that’s a problem, the tool won’t help you. If you do know why it’s a problem, you probably wouldn’t use the tool.</p><p>The pattern repeated across every AI design tool that launched in 2024–2025. V0 by Vercel produced code that stopped mid-generation. Users reported the AI losing context and forgetting previous work. Bolt.new earned a 1.5-star rating on Trustpilot, with users reporting they spent over a thousand dollars in tokens just trying to fix code problems. One developer burned through 20 million tokens on a single authentication issue. Critical files went missing. Projects deployed with blank screens.</p><p>Claude Code, despite being one of the more capable AI coding tools, experienced performance degradation so severe that GitHub users reported 30–40% drops in development speed. Tasks that previously took one day required two or three. The most telling detail: Anthropic had to publish an official postmortem admitting infrastructure bugs caused the AI to produce broken code with odd characters.</p><p>And then there was <a href=""https://techstartups.com/2025/05/24/builder-ai-a-microsoft-backed-ai-startup-once-valued-at-1-2-billion-files-for-bankruptcy-is-ai-becoming-another-com-bubble/"">Builder.ai</a> — the cautionary tale everyone should study. Valued at $1.5 billion with backing from Microsoft and Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, Builder.ai promised AI-powered app development. The company employed over 1,500 people and raised $445 million. In May 2025, it filed for bankruptcy. The reason? The “AI” was actually 700 Indian engineers manually coding everything. The Wall Street Journal had exposed this back in 2019, but the company limped along for six more years. Enterprise clients experienced apps crashing under basic user loads. A former employee later joked that the “AI” stood for “Another Indian.”</p><p>The paradox crystalizes: tools marketed as democratization require <em>more</em> technical knowledge than traditional workflows, not less. You need to understand prompt engineering, debug AI-generated output, recognize when the AI is hallucinating, and know enough about technical constraints to evaluate whether what the AI produces is actually feasible.</p><p>We told ourselves AI would level the playing field. Instead, it raised the floor. If you can’t tell the difference between functional code and broken code, between accessible design and inaccessible design, between scalable architecture and technical debt, these tools just let you fail faster.</p><h3>How We Got Here</h3><p>The craft crisis didn’t start with AI. AI just made it impossible to ignore.</p><p>Somewhere in the early 2010s, the design industry made a collective decision: designers don’t need to code. <a href=""https://mralancooper.medium.com/should-designers-code-cde3ef9d6621"">Alan Cooper</a>, the father of Visual Basic and interaction design pioneer, wrote definitively that coding wasn’t necessary for top-notch designers. Design Thinking became the dominant framework, emphasizing empathy and process over technical craft. Design bootcamps proliferated with promises of career changes in six months, explicitly advertising that no coding knowledge was required.</p><p><a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/google-ux-design-certificate-on-coursera-is-it-worth-it"">Google’s UX Certificate</a> on Coursera states clearly: “UX design requires no knowledge of coding.” For $300 and six months at 10 hours per week, you could become a UX designer. Bootcamps charged $10,000 for 12-week programs focused on wireframing, prototyping, and user research — not technical implementation.</p><p>This wasn’t gatekeeping by engineers. This was the design industry telling itself a story about what designers needed to know. The story went like this: designers focus on users, empathy, and problem-solving. Engineers focus on implementation, code, and technical constraints. Clean separation of concerns. Everyone stays in their lane.</p><h3>What we lost wasn’t the ability to code. What we lost was the ability to participate in technical conversations.</h3><p>Understanding why an API limitation makes a feature infeasible. Recognizing when performance constraints should influence design decisions. Knowing enough about technical debt to engage in build-versus-buy discussions. Being able to evaluate whether AI-generated code actually works or just looks like it works.</p><p><a href=""https://rogerwong.me/2025/07/design-talent-crisis"">Roger Wong</a>, analyzing the design talent crisis in 2025, put it bluntly: entry-level designers at Big Tech now represent just 7% of all hires — a 50% drop from 2019. How do designers develop taste, craft, and strategic thinking without doing the foundational work? The industry created a pipeline that produces designers who can talk about empathy but can’t evaluate technical trade-offs.</p><figure><img alt=""Bar chart showing tech industry layoffs from 2020–2024, with peak layoffs of 167,000 in Q1 2023 and 150,000+ layoffs continuing through 2024"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dkXedIBWDnc8-94nlUD-Kw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/"">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-major-tech-layoffs-in-2024-so-far/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The consequences show up everywhere. <a href=""https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/10-ways-to-improve-design-to-development-handoff/"">UXPin research</a> found that 62% of developers spend significant time redoing designs due to communication breakdowns. Not because designers made bad aesthetic choices. Because designers proposed things that were technically nonsensical, or missed constraints that would have changed the entire approach.</p><p>A designer proposes a feature without understanding that it requires a new API endpoint, which requires backend changes, which requires database migrations, which means a three-month timeline instead of a three-week timeline. The feature gets de-scoped or killed. The designer learns their proposals aren’t strategic input — they’re suggestions engineers will simplify into whatever is actually buildable.</p><p>This happened so many times, in so many companies, that it became the pattern. Designers create mockups. Engineers override them based on technical constraints the designer didn’t know existed. The designer spends days in “alignment meetings” trying to advocate for the user, but can’t speak the technical language needed to actually influence the decision. Business stakeholders step in to make product calls because they can at least understand the technical constraints, even if they don’t understand users.</p><p><a href=""https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/"">Rune Madsen</a>, in his essay “Product Design Is Lost,” captured this perfectly: designers found themselves “in a place between strategy and implementation, yet they are not fully empowered to influence either.” We’re filling our time with checklists instead of focusing on the very thing that makes designers relevant. We’ve been painted into a corner.</p><p>The industry did this to itself. And we called it progress.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>Here’s the part that makes designers defensive: we lost influence long before AI showed up. AI just exposed the gap.</p><p>The “Great Design Handoff” wasn’t a single event — it was a slow erosion of strategic control. Growth teams took over conversion optimization. Algorithms dictated layout and personalization. Business stakeholders made product decisions. Design leaders found themselves defending the existence of their teams rather than shaping product strategy.</p><p>The evidence is everywhere. <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90976682/design-giant-ideo-cuts-a-third-of-staff-and-closes-offices-as-the-era-of-design-thinking-ends"">IDEO</a> — the company that popularized Design Thinking — lost half its headcount between 2020 and 2025. Revenue dropped from $300 million to $100 million. Google laid off over 100 designers in November 2024, cutting some cloud design teams in half. IBM eliminated its chief design officer position entirely. Autodesk cut 1,350 employees in December 2024. Across tech, <a href=""https://www.computerworld.com/article/3816662/tech-layoffs-in-2024-a-timeline.html"">150,000+ jobs disappeared in 2024</a> alone.</p><p>But here’s the telling detail: only one major company hired a chief design officer in the second half of 2023. PayPal. That’s it. Executive-level design roles are disappearing across corporate America, and it’s not because AI replaced them. It’s because the roles stopped delivering strategic value.</p><p><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91027996/the-big-design-freak-out-a-generation-of-design-leaders-grapple-with-their-future"">Fast Company reported</a> on a March 2024 conference where design leaders from P&amp;G, Ford, Verizon, GE Healthcare, and other Fortune 500 companies confronted the question directly: “Is Design Dead?” The consensus wasn’t about AI. It was about business priorities. Design has been deprioritized during a business cycle championing technology and marketing.</p><p>Netflix provides the clearest case study. Eighty percent of all viewing hours come from algorithmic recommendations. The homepage layout, row ordering, and even the thumbnails users see are determined by algorithms, not designers. Netflix’s personalization saves over a billion dollars per year in subscriber retention. When the business case is that strong, design becomes an execution function serving algorithmic strategy.</p><p>Growth teams present a similar challenge. <a href=""https://andrewchen.com/how-to-build-a-growth-team/"">Andrew Chen</a>, a prominent growth expert, notes that growth teams work best when they can run lightweight experiments quickly. Design-conscious companies resist this because their incentives reward large, complex projects rather than many small changes. So growth teams route around design, making decisions that move metrics even when they compromise user experience. Princeton found that <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/dark-patterns-examples"">1 in 10 of 11,000 shopping sites</a> used dark patterns. Zurich University found 95% of popular Android apps had at least one dark pattern. The European Commission found 97% of apps used by EU consumers contained dark patterns.</p><p>These aren’t isolated bad actors. These are systemic outcomes when growth imperatives override design principles, and designers lack the technical fluency to advocate effectively in those conversations.</p><p>The root cause is simple: most product decisions are fundamentally technical. They involve technical constraints, technical trade-offs, technical debt, and technical feasibility. If you can’t participate in technical conversations, you can’t influence product strategy. You can’t influence product strategy, you end up in alignment meetings explaining user needs to people making technical decisions you don’t fully understand.</p><p>This is why the handoff happened. Not because AI replaced designers. Because designers couldn’t articulate why technical decisions should consider user impact in language that resonated with the people making those decisions.</p><h3>This Isn’t About Coding</h3><p>Let me be crystal clear: this is not an argument that designers should learn to code production software.</p><p>This is about strategic literacy. Understanding enough about technical systems to make informed design decisions and advocate effectively for users when those decisions are being made.</p><p>There’s a difference between writing production code and understanding what code does. Between implementing a database schema and knowing why data models influence user workflows. Between configuring a build pipeline and recognizing when technical debt is accumulating in ways that will limit future design possibilities.</p><p>Strategic literacy means you can:</p><ul><li>Evaluate whether AI-generated code is functional or broken</li><li>Understand API constraints well enough to design features that are actually feasible</li><li>Recognize when performance implications should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Participate in technical debt conversations because you understand what’s being traded off</li><li>Spot when “technical constraints” are actually implementation choices masquerading as limitations</li></ul><p>The design engineers who maintained influence through the 2024–2025 crisis weren’t necessarily writing backend services. But they understood technical systems deeply enough to design with constraints in mind, advocate for users in technical conversations, and ship work that didn’t require wholesale engineering rewrites.</p><p><a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">Rauno Freiberg at Vercel</a> describes his role as providing “the Design team with Engineering firepower to lead and ship our own projects end-to-end.” <a href=""https://ui.land/interviews/paco-coursey"">Paco Coursey at Linear</a> says design and code don’t feel separate to him. These aren’t people who abandoned design for engineering. They’re people who refused to treat design as separate from implementation.</p><p>The counter-argument is always gatekeeping: requiring technical knowledge excludes people from design. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to strategic irrelevance. Roger Wong’s research shows entry-level hiring has collapsed. Matt Ström warns that if we don’t train junior designers now, we’ll have no senior designers for complex work AI can’t do. Design Week points out that students aren’t being equipped with essential technical skills.</p><p>We told designers they didn’t need technical knowledge. Then we eliminated their jobs when they couldn’t influence technical decisions. That’s not inclusion. That’s malpractice.</p><p>The question isn’t whether designers should code. The question is whether designers should understand the medium they’re designing for. Whether they should be able to evaluate their own work. Whether they should have enough technical fluency to advocate for users when technical decisions are being made.</p><p>That’s the baseline for strategic relevance.</p><h3>What Changes</h3><p>The opportunity here is clearer than the design industry wants to admit: technical understanding is learnable, and the designers who develop it will have influence that others don’t.</p><p>Look at what technical literacy enables. <a href=""https://www.bbva.com/en/airbnb-design-thinking-success-story/"">At Airbnb</a>, a designer studying the star rating system realized replacing stars with hearts could feel more personal. That design change increased bookings by more than 30%. Not because the designer had great visual taste. Because the designer understood the technical system well enough to identify a high-leverage intervention.</p><p>At <a href=""https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542"">GitHub</a>, designers contribute production code to the Primer design system. They don’t do this because they want to be engineers. They do it because understanding the technical implementation makes them better designers. They can prototype with real constraints, collaborate with engineers as peers, and ship work that actually functions.</p><p>Vercel’s design engineering team operates with “aesthetic sensibility with technical skills,” which allows them to “deeply understand a problem, then design, build, and ship a solution autonomously.” This isn’t a replacement for traditional design — it’s an expansion of what design can influence.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Vercel’s design engineering"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3IIzfKxMtEWgJwU93GFyaw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=""https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel"">https://vercel.com/blog/design-engineering-at-vercel</a></figcaption></figure><p>The technical skills that matter most:</p><ul><li>Understanding data models and how they constrain user workflows</li><li>Knowing enough about APIs to design technically feasible features</li><li>Recognizing performance bottlenecks that should influence interaction patterns</li><li>Evaluating AI-generated outputs for technical correctness</li><li>Understanding how design systems map to component libraries</li><li>Participating in build-versus-buy discussions with actual technical context</li></ul><p>None of this requires a computer science degree. It requires curiosity about how things actually work and a willingness to learn technical fundamentals.</p><p>The designers maintaining strategic influence through 2024–2025 aren’t the ones with the best Figma skills. They’re the ones who can participate in technical conversations, evaluate trade-offs, and advocate for users in language that resonates with engineers and product leaders.</p><p>This is the path forward. Not back to “designers should code” debates from the 2010s. Forward to “designers should understand the systems they’re designing for” as a baseline professional expectation.</p><h3>The Reckoning</h3><p>When Figma’s AI generated Apple Weather app clones, it revealed that many designers couldn’t articulate what made a design original beyond surface aesthetics. When Figma Sites produced <a href=""https://adrianroselli.com/2025/05/do-not-publish-your-designs-on-the-web-with-figma-sites.html"">210 WCAG violations</a>, it showed that accessibility knowledge wasn’t widespread enough to catch obviously broken output. <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/ai-generated-ux-and-the-growing-accessibility-debt-how-to-fix-it-8109fda7d9d5"">Research shows</a> that 81% of homepages have low-contrast text, and when AI trains on this data, it perpetuates systemic exclusion. When Builder.ai collapsed after six years of pretending AI was doing what engineers actually did, it demonstrated how easy it is to fake technical competence in an industry that stopped valuing technical craft.</p><p>The designers who maintained influence through this period share one thing: technical depth. Not necessarily coding ability, but deep understanding of technical systems. They can evaluate AI output. They can participate in architecture discussions. They can advocate for users in technical terms that actually influence decisions.</p><p>The designers who lost influence — and there were many, given 150,000+ layoffs — often shared a different trait: they treated design as separate from implementation. They created mockups for engineers to “build.” They relied on tools without understanding outputs. They couldn’t evaluate technical trade-offs or participate meaningfully in technical conversations.</p><p>The question facing the industry isn’t whether AI will replace designers. It’s whether designers will develop the technical literacy needed to remain strategically relevant in a world where most product decisions are fundamentally technical.</p><p>Some will argue this sets the bar too high. That requiring technical understanding excludes people. But what actually excludes people is creating a professional track that leads to irrelevance. Entry-level hiring has collapsed. Design leadership roles are disappearing. The “Great Design Handoff” already happened, and it wasn’t to AI — it was to growth teams, algorithms, and business stakeholders who could at least speak the technical language of trade-offs and constraints.</p><figure><img alt=""A venn diagram showing what is design engineering."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pQ35G-p558gX5yK0L8l1gQ.avif"" /><figcaption>Image Source: <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers"">https://maggieappleton.com/design-engineers</a></figcaption></figure><p>The industry told designers they didn’t need to understand implementation. Then eliminated their influence when they couldn’t participate in implementation discussions. That’s not AI’s fault. That’s ours.</p><p>The technical reckoning is here. The designers who face it with curiosity about how systems actually work will have opportunities the industry hasn’t seen in years. The designers who keep insisting technical knowledge isn’t their job will find that strategic influence isn’t theirs either.</p><p>The choice, as always, is ours to make.</p><p><em>What technical knowledge do you think designers need most? Where do you see the craft crisis showing up in your work?</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=434bcb652848"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-ai-is-exposing-designs-craft-crisis-434bcb652848"">Why AI is exposing design’s craft crisis</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
