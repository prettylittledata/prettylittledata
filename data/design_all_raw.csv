Now they tell us.</h4><figure><img alt=""A sepia-toned photograph of a man in a suit and tie, standing outdoors in front of a blurred brick building.

You weren’t just searching for information, you were learning how to judge it.</em></p><p><em>Now the answer shows up at the top.</em></p><p><em>We don’t navigate information anymore. <br /></em><strong><em>We negotiate truth.</em></strong></p><p><em>And like any negotiation, the outcome doesn’t just depend on what is said. It also depends on how it’s delivered.</em></p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is </em><strong><em>unquoted, installment 9. It’s on </em></strong><a href=""https://www.fadedpage.com/sc/innis.php""><strong><em>Harold Innis</em></strong></a><em> and how his forgotten idea about media bias can help us understand why search has become a negotiation for truth.</em></p><h3>How delivery shapes belief</h3><p>In the mid-1900s, Harold Innis was studying why some forms of knowledge last a long time and others disappear quickly. His answer: <a href=""https://www.newcartographies.com/p/harold-innis-and-our-time"">the way information is delivered carries a bias.</a></p><p>What he called <a href=""https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/innis.htm"">media bias</a> wasn’t what you would think of as being political. Instead, this was structural. Every medium (or delivery method) tilts truth in a particular direction. Innis divided this communication into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-biased media</strong> like stone tablets, clay, and oral tradition: durable, slow to produce, hard to distribute. Designed to preserve memory across generations. <br />They were costly to create, so what made it into stone was meant to last.</li><li><strong>Space-biased media</strong> like paper, newspapers and radio: fast, scalable, and easy to spread. Great for moving information across distance. The tradeoff is that the information is easy to forget.</li></ul><p>Each method has different consequences if you’re wrong. You definitely don’t want to carve a mistake in stone. But you’ll toss an opinion on the radio without much hesitation.</p><p>Innis believed civilizations leans one way or the other. The problem is when they lean too far, things start to crack. For instance, the more a culture chases speed, the more it sacrifices memory.</p><p>That worried him, because when speed becomes the goal, friction disappears. And when friction disappears, belief forms too easily.</p><p>When that happens, people start believing things without remembering why. Information flies everywhere, and everyone believes a little bit of everything, but nothing deeply enough to sustain conviction, trust, or memory.</p><p>Which brings us to the delivery method shaping a lot of decisions today: the <strong>answer engine</strong>.</p><h3>The frictionless answer</h3><p>Innis taught that every medium tilts truth by setting the cost of being wrong (back to the idea that stone carried a level of permanence).</p><p><strong>Answer engines flipped that equation.</strong> They’re fast, free, available and project absolute confidence… while carrying almost zero accountability.</p><p>That’s the bias of the delivery system we live with now: <strong>it produces answers that <em>look </em>like truth but are endlessly changeable.</strong></p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>That mismatch matters. It’s not just a technology problem, and it’s deeply philosophical.</p><h3>Truth as a system</h3><p>Truth has always carried signals about how seriously to take it. I think about how headlines hint at urgency or a broadcast voice carries authority. Even a blog post tells you something about the author behind it.</p><p>Answer engines strip that information away. What’s left is a paragraph that’s floating above information that is constantly shifting around.</p><p>That’s why I think <strong>negotiation</strong> is the right metaphor. We aren’t testing competing claims anymore. We’re reacting to how the system delivers them. If it looks fine, we believe it.</p><p>Innis understood that the way information is delivered is more important than the content. It sets the probability of belief.</p><p>When answers are this easy to generate, its the delivery method that convinces us, not the accuracy of the information. Over time, we stop asking whether something is true and start assuming it must be… because it looked complete when it showed up.</p><h3>The context problem</h3><p>So we arrive at the issue brands are <em>actually</em> facing.</p><p>Brands assume the challenge is volume. Publish more, post more… rank more. But the challenge isn’t content. <strong>It’s context.</strong></p><p>Most brands are still playing an old game… chasing backlinks, tweaking keywords, and pumping out pages to satisfy algorithms that ranked links instead of resolving questions.</p><p>That used to work… when brands controlled the narrative. When it paid to write carefully sanitized copy that sounded official, without saying anything useful. When brands do that now, they don’t look like they’re being careful. They look evasive.</p><p>But now that same content gets torn apart, summarized, and served out of context.</p><p>This is an answer-first world. You can be right and still not be trusted.</p><p>That’s another paradox: <strong>trust now lives even further downstream from your content. It’s perceived by the reader only after they’ve read what the answer engine tore apart.</strong></p><h3>What we build from here</h3><p>If search is now a negotiation, brands can’t keep showing up the old way.</p><p>Publishing more just to publish more doesn’t make brands more believable. (You can look at stats on your content if you don’t believe me.)</p><p>Instead, I think brands need to work on understanding customer friction, offering context, and helping people weigh what to believe… even when the answer isn’t perfect. <strong>That’s how you build trust with your customer.</strong></p><p>Take financial services (where I spend my time).</p><p>Most banks write content to align with their own products and services. But answer engines aren’t asking what helps the brand. They’re asking what helps the reader.</p><p>So if you’re writing a piece called “What should Gen Z do with their tax return?”, and every answer just funnels them toward your checking account, you’ve already lost. Not because your product is bad… but because your answer wasn’t complete.</p><p>I think this will be the difference. Some will try to control the story and shape the narrative, while the winners will help people understand their options — even if one of them doesn’t benefit them directly.</p><p>Harold Innis warned us: When speed becomes the goal, memory becomes a casualty<em>. </em>Answer engines are fast, but if they erase the process of belief-building, trust doesn’t scale with them.</p><p>The organizations that adapt will realize that truth isn’t something you publish once and forget. It’s something you shape, over and over, in the ways your words and products survive being summarized.</p><p>In the long run, what people believe isn’t decided by what ranked. It’s decided by what <em>held up</em>.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ad3ea06886b2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">Negotiating truth</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Design management is harder (and better) than I thought</h4><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn diagram of x’s and o’s with lines and arrows pointing out various movements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wFclA7SgV_V8vIyc0aH4fQ.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve been a design manager since 2022. Like many others in this role, I’ve been slowly shaping and reshaping my management values. This is where I’m at now. I’ll likely update this over time, or do a part 2.</p><p>I was an individual contributor (IC) for over 20 years before moving into management. Even then, I was reluctant to take the job because I enjoyed doing the work so much. So I’m familiar with ICs, how they think, and what sorts of things they think about. Things like craft, product quality, three-month timelines, career development, and recognition.</p><p>Now that I’ve been in management for a while, I also see how leadership thinks too. They’re thinking about strategy, year-long roadmaps, revenue, and the overall health of the organization.</p><p>I have a foot in both worlds, which will be a common thread in this article. I can help ICs think a little more strategically, and I can help leaders stay closer to the work.</p><p>Whether or not “manager” is in my title, I try to be that bridge, and to help everyone around me get just a little bit better.</p><h3>It all starts with team health</h3><p>No one does their best work when they’re stressed, burned out, or afraid to speak up. Great collaboration comes from trust and honest feedback that never feels personal or belittling.</p><p>I try to build that culture:</p><ul><li>Giving people both async and live ways to contribute, so it’s not just the loudest voice or one in an optimal timezone that wins.</li><li>Making it normal to share work early, not just when someone “feels it’s ready for critique.” We’re going to get leadership’s feedback at some point, better to get it early when there’s still time to address it and possibly change direction.</li><li>Being realistic about bandwidth and not overcommitting folks. I sometimes have to talk someone out of saying “yes” to something when they don’t realistically have time for it.</li><li>Encouraging experimentation and making room for failure as folks drift into adjacent roles. Especially now as research, design, product, and engineering move closer together.</li><li>Being vulnerable myself: sharing a past failure with the team, saying “I don’t know the answer”, or admitting when I’m struggling.</li></ul><p>With a healthy team culture, everything else gets easier.</p><h3>Player coach</h3><p>Some managers are comfortable not doing design anymore. Not me. I prefer being a player-coach, coaching the team and still doing some actual design work myself.</p><p>Most of the leaders I respect are close to the craft. Especially now, when AI enables everyone to build more, there’s less room for people who don’t actually do the work. I spend about equal time between people problems and craft problems.</p><p>I need real knowledge of the craft to be a useful thought partner. If I drift too far from the work, I stop speaking the same language as my ICs. I miss the little details that matter. Without that context, my input feels generic and surface-level.</p><p>Being good at the people side helps me move projects forward by unblocking decisions, aligning folks around a goal, and building momentum.</p><p>Getting better at the craft makes meme better at the work itself. The product experience, along with its complexity and details. The thing customers actually experience.</p><p><strong>You need both to lead well.</strong></p><p>That said, I’m mindful not to take on any large or “critical path” projects. My design contributions usually involve things like designing small features, covering a project when a designer is on PTO, bug fixes and polish, taking “busy work” from my ICs, and starting larger vision work to hand off to someone else.</p><p>This keeps me hands-on, but not in the way. That balance is important for me. That balance is important for me.</p><h3>Delegation is a sliding scale</h3><p>Delegation is often treated like a light switch. You either do the work yourself or you hand it off completely. In reality, it’s more of a sliding scale.</p><p>Sometimes you take on the task yourself. Sometimes you work alongside someone. Other times, you let them run with it. The right approach depends on the situation, their experience, and how much I want to check in along the way.</p><p>For example, I stay involved in the day-to-day of important projects. For smaller ones, I might delegate fully and just say, “Let me know how it turns out” or “Holler if you need anything from me.”</p><p>It’s less about rules and more about knowing my team.</p><h3>Avoid becoming a bottleneck</h3><blockquote><em>You may be lying to yourself when you say, “I’m the only one who can do this”. — </em><a href=""https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-delegate-with-high-standards""><em>Wes Kao</em></a></blockquote><p>Wes’s quote stuck with me because I’ve caught myself doing exactly that. In the past, I’ve been guilty of “hiding” in the work I’m already good at, keeping it from others. I tell myself no one else can do X, but deep down it’s also pride in being the one who does it well.</p><p>It’s important to be honest and call myself out in situations like this.</p><p>There are going to be new things that are ambiguous and uncertain, and it’s going to feel tempting to delay thinking about those and focusing on what I know. There will always be too much on my plate. The job is to decide where I’ll have the most impact, usually not by falling back on what I’m already good at. That might mean passing on a design review I’d normally jump into so I can focus on a hiring decision instead.</p><p>An example is HTML email: Every job I’ve had in the last 10 years, I’ve been known as “the email guy” who knows how to code HTML emails. That may be true when I first join, but I make sure to document what I know so others can help themselves. As an example, I created an email design system during my time at Stack Overflow so each product team could build their own emails without being email experts.</p><p>Another example is design feedback. I can’t review everything in real-time, and I don’t want that to slow my team down. So I documented what I look for: my taste, established UX conventions, our design system, and the comments I repeat most often, and made a custom GPT for my team to use. I even added some of my boss’s feedback style.</p><p>The goal isn’t always to <em>replace</em> me, but to help my team go farther without me.</p><h3>Clearing the path</h3><p>A big part of my job is helping my team <a href=""https://jordivillar.com/blog/becoming-irrelevant"">focus</a> on the work that matters most. That means filtering out noise before it ever reaches them. Not every request deserves their attention. I’d rather say no early than let distractions pile up. Pushing back is not always comfortable, but protecting the team’s focus is part of my role.</p><p>I also spend time clearing fog. Ambiguity slows people down. By sharpening the problem, setting constraints, or filling in missing context, I can help the team move faster and make better decisions.</p><p>And then there’s tension. Between what leadership wants, what the team needs, and what the product should become. I absorb that tension so my team doesn’t have to. That might mean telling leadership we need to slow down, or explaining to the team why priorities just shifted.</p><p>The team gets the clarity. I carry the weight.</p><h3>Just enough process</h3><p>Process helps teams stay on track, but too much of it kills creativity and momentum. When checkpoints and approvals pile up, the work starts to feel like factory output. I’ve seen projects where the design review process added more overhead than the design itself. No bueno.</p><p>My goal is to have enough structure to guide the work, but allows detours along the way for folks to find the right solution. Like prototyping an unexpected idea.</p><p>I teach designers to use their own judgment so they need me less for permission and more for refinement. Figma’s Jonas Downey has <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-a-resilient-design-team/#_5-be-judicious-about-process"">a few great prompts</a> to get designers thinking:</p><ul><li>What would you decide if it was fully up to you?</li><li>How would you explain this to a user?</li><li>How does it support our business?</li><li>How could we simplify it?</li></ul><p>I love using these in design reviews to get the discussion going when the group is quiet, and they always spark better conversations than another checklist would. These nudge people toward clearer, stronger work without adding more process.</p><h3>The manager’s quiet kind of high</h3><p>I’ve made peace with not getting that <a href=""https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2024/06/21/the-manager-s-unbearable-lack-of-endorphins"">daily high</a> from making something with my own hands. I get satisfaction from watching my team build great stuff and grow personally, and knowing I played a part in it.</p><p>There’s power in those indirect wins:</p><ul><li>Clearing the path so someone can ship something they’re proud of.</li><li>Coaching someone today so their work months from now is stronger.</li><li>Rejecting the urgent-but-low-impact so the team can focus on what matters.</li></ul><p>Like when a designer nails their review with leadership, a coworker compliments one of my reports, or our work moves an important metric.</p><p>These moments aren’t always loud or concrete, so I keep a section for them in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/why-you-should-have-a-brag-document-eb6cc82ec80a"">my brag document</a> so I don’t forget about my wins as a manager.</p><h3>Don’t forget who you are</h3><p>Design work is tough, even in the best conditions. As a manager, one of the things I enjoy most is finding ways to take pressure off the team when things get especially stressful.</p><p>I still upload unhinged custom emojis to company chat, host silly birthday games over Zoom, and drop funny links in chat.</p><p>[cowboy emojis: Cowboy emojis, a tradition started by <a href=""https://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/custom-emojis/"">a former co-worker</a>.]</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m mindful of what I say publicly because I realize the weight my words and actions carry as a leader in the company. But it’s important to lighten the mood once in a while That spirit finds its way back into the work and helps people feel psychologically safe.</p><h3>Everyday is winding road</h3><p>Like I said earlier, I’m still learning and my thoughts are evolving.

He collaborated with business leaders every step of the way.</p><p>Jacek is now an art director for the Bonnier Business Press, overseeing papers in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and the work he oversees consistently wins major prizes (including another SND world’s-best in 2007 for Estonia’s <em>Äripäev</em>), despite their small teams and limited resources.</p><figure><img alt=""Jacek Utko quote: Design can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down.

<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
