<h4>We are building LLMs to sound human. When we add personality and emotional tone, we increase the risk that people will trust them like people. Design them as tools. Not as companions.</h4><figure><img alt=""cover image with article’s title “When tools pretend to be people” written upside down as the branding of Design, Explained"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M3Cztq9D9r-XHNvmMIW7mg.png"" /></figure><p>People ask AI systems for therapy, moral judgment, and legal authority. The interfaces we design invite this behavior. Think about how these systems present themselves. Conversational framing. Continuous memory across sessions. First-person responses that sound like someone talking back to you. Every one of these is a design choice. We chose them. And these choices feed a reflex humans already have: we project intention onto objects and tools.</p><p>This reflex is old. We naturally anthropomorphize nonhuman entities, even when it’s clear we’re interacting with machines. We anthropomorphize vacuum cleaners. We name our cars. What’s different now is that we’re designing experiences that exploit this behaviour deliberately at scale.</p><blockquote><strong>Anthropomorphization </strong>is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics, behaviors, intentions, or emotions to nonhuman entities.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>AI humanization</strong> is an intentional design choice that encourages users to perceive AI systems as having human-like qualities such as personality, emotions, or consciousness.</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/""><em>Humanizing AI Is a Trap</em></a></blockquote><p>When you write system responses in first person, the output sounds like authority. When you add polite phrasing, it implies consideration behind the words. When you program emotional tone into responses, it suggests the system cares about the outcome. We added these features because they make the interaction feel natural. But natural here means human. And that’s the problem.</p><p>These systems sound fluent. They maintain context across long conversations. They respond without hesitation. For most people, that’s enough evidence the system understands them. Fluency looks like competence. Memory looks like understanding. The gap between “this is a tool” and “this is an entity” closes without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>Here’s where I want you to pay attention. When we frame tools as agents, something shifts in how people use them. Responsibility moves. Decisions start to feel outsourced. When something goes wrong, the mistake feels external rather than shared.</strong></p><p>Good judgment develops through friction. You try something. It fails. You adjust. You learn what works through repetition and error. But if we build AI systems that absorb the posture of authority, users lose that friction. They stop checking. They stop questioning. They trust the output because the interface taught them to. This isn’t misuse. This is what we designed the system to encourage.</p><p>The consequences are already visible. In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o"">sued the company over the death of their teenage son</a>, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life. The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.</p><p>In a separate case, the suspect in a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/11/chatgpt-murder-suicide-soelberg-lawsuit/"">murder-suicide that took place in August</a> posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fueled the alleged perpetrator’s delusions. Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law &amp; Innovation Institute at the University of California Law, said more users struggle with AI psychosis as “Chatbots create the illusion of reality. It is a powerful illusion.”</p><p><strong>These aren’t edge cases. They’re what happens when systems we’ve designed blurs the boundaries between tools and agents.</strong></p><p>Someone asks an AI system for medical advice. The system responds fluently, confidently, in first person. “I recommend you try this treatment approach.” The person follows it. Not because they verified the information, but because the interaction felt like talking to a knowledgeable professional. The system created that feeling. We created that feeling. We built the confusion.</p><p>Platforms generating AI girlfriends are experiencing a massive growth in popularity, with millions of users. AI girlfriends can perpetuate loneliness because they dissuade users from entering into real-life relationships, alienate them from others, and, in some cases, induce intense feelings of abandonment.</p><blockquote>“Most of these searches are initiated by young single men drawn to AI girlfriends to combat loneliness and establish a form of companionship. These “girlfriends” are virtual companions powered by the increasingly sophisticated field of artificial intelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202408/the-dangers-of-ai-generated-romance""><em>The Dangers of AI-Generated Romance</em></a></blockquote><p>Look at a knife. It has limits you can see and feel. Sharpness. Weight. The geometry of the edge. You never ask a knife what you should cook for dinner. You never ask if the meal was meaningful. Those decisions stay with you because the tool’s boundaries are obvious.</p><p>AI interfaces hide their limits. An empty chat box suggests no constraints. It looks ready for any question. That openness isn’t neutral. It’s an active design choice that tells people the system can handle whatever they type. Then when people misuse it, we blame them for not understanding the technology.</p><p>We need to give AI the same kind of framing we give physical tools. Clear affordances. Visible constraints. An obvious boundary between what the system produces and what we must decide.</p><p>Right now, most interfaces erase that boundary completely. The chat paradigm implies conversation. Conversation implies exchange between two minds. But one side is pattern matching at scale. The interface hides that difference.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W8GmYrp7czyvcnaIQaABQg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a>, Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><h3>What would visible limits look like?</h3><p>Start with pronouns. Use third-person language in system responses. “Here is a summary” instead of “I think the main point is.” This single change removes the illusion of authorship. The output stops sounding like someone’s opinion and starts reading like generated text.</p><p>Show uncertainty. When the model lacks confidence, display that visibly. Not buried in a disclaimer, but in the response itself. Confidence scores. Probability ranges. Explicit markers that say “this answer is less reliable.” Make the gaps in knowledge visible instead of hiding them behind smooth conversations.</p><p>Reset context visibly. When you start a new session, make that boundary clear. Break the illusion that the system remembers you across time. Continuous memory makes the system feel like it knows you. That’s intimacy. Tools don’t need intimacy.</p><p>Stop calling output “messages.” Call it what it is: generated text. Label it. Frame it. Make the mechanical nature of the process visible in the interface itself.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. These changes hurt engagement metrics. Anthropomorphic design works. People stay in the interface longer. They use it more often. Revenue scales with usage time. Making the system feel less human means people will use it less, and that conflicts with business goals. But engagement built on confusion carries costs we’re only starting to see.</p><p>Users develop dependency on systems they don’t understand. They delegate judgment to pattern recognition without realizing that’s what they’re doing. They mistake fluency for accuracy. They treat consistency as truth. And because the interface never taught them the boundaries, they don’t know when to stop trusting the output.</p><p><strong>When we erase the line between system output and human judgment in AI interfaces, we make the wrong design decisions. We’re building humanization into the system as strategy. We’re doing it on purpose because it increases engagement.</strong></p><p>You have agency here. When you design AI experiences, you decide how it presents itself. You control the pronouns in system responses. You choose whether to show confidence levels or hide them. You determine whether context persists invisibly or resets in clear ways.</p><p>These decisions shape how people understand the tool’s role and their own. They determine whether users develop judgment or dependency.</p><p>So ask yourself: where does the system end and where does judgment begin? In your current interface, can users see that line? Or have you deliberately blurred it to make the interaction feel smoother?</p><p>The chat paradigm became default because it felt intuitive. But that isn’t the same as honest. And right now, we need more honesty in how these systems present themselves.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/"">Humanizing AI Is a Trap</a></li><li><a href=""https://vaughntan.org/aiux"">Designing AI tools that support critical thinking</a></li><li><a href=""https://1984.design/psychology-of-design/authority-bias/"">Authority Bias</a></li><li><a href=""https://intelligence-curse.ai/"">The Intelligence Curse</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">The Shape of AI | UX Patterns for Artificial Intelligence Design</a></li><li><a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">The People + AI Guidebook</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4283748d33e1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-tools-pretend-to-be-people-4283748d33e1"">When tools pretend to be people</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Regardless of the many variables, failure to deliver a project will always be due to foundational risk factors that compromise its successful completion.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I9fjCC06uT3V0DzhmCmJpQ.png"" /><figcaption>When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been almost 20 years since I started my career in product design, and, as you might imagine, many things have changed dramatically since then. One of the main characteristics of the technology industry is the constant evolution of its dynamics, roles, processes, technologies, experiences, and even business models. Those changes are inevitable and will continue.</p><p>In retrospect, I see that there is one reality that has not changed much over the last 20 years and remains a constant issue to this day: <strong>building technology products can sometimes be a discouraging and exhausting process,</strong> from junior positions to senior management levels.</p><p>Why do we suffer every time we need to build something? Why is there so much burnout among today’s tech professionals? Why is it that, regardless of the industry, company, or technology, we always hear the exact phrases: “I’m exhausted, I feel drained by this job.”?</p><p>Well, those are valid questions that still haunt me 20 years after my first web design job. It seems like there’s no choice in this environment but to suffer.</p><p>As I mentioned before, a lot has changed in the tech industry. At the beginning of my career as a junior designer, watching leaders have complex conversations for hours was sort of a path I wanted to follow. To me, that was an expression of strategy, power, and importance within a company. Now, when I remember those meetings full of bureaucracy, all that comes to mind is a waste of time, resources, and money, but above all, <strong>not-so-clear project directions.</strong> The “tech machine” was slow, gigantic, and less efficient than it is now.</p><p>A few years later, the agile methodology hit the industry with a beautiful promise: to build products without needing the perfect scenario or the final product; instead, a quick, viable version will work as a measure of user feedback, which will lead the product to evolve. Agile is still a living practice today, and many companies and teams use it to shape product development dynamics. But was agile the final solution we needed to make the tech product creation less painful? My answer is NO, it wasn’t, and the reasons why, no matter frameworks or methodologies, we are still stuck in a toxic product-creation spiral are due to these factors.</p><p>The three risk factors of building a tech product:</p><h3>Unsuitable people for the role</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aI-H6qmhu2TiU58V7naPlg.png"" /><figcaption>Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource.</figcaption></figure><p>This factor is the number one cause of a product project’s failure. When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved. Why is this factor the most dangerous in a project’s building process? Because at the end of the day, it’s people who are responsible for control and making things happen from the beginning to the final stages, not technology or some autonomous process, so when we talk about products and quality, we are actually pointing to the people who made it possible.</p><blockquote><strong>“All products are a mirror of the people who built them.”</strong></blockquote><p>Regarding non-talented people in technology, I’ll talk about roles such as product, design, dev, and other positions involved in creating digital products. Part of the issues that surface when dealing with unsuitable people in a project are:</p><p><strong>Business misunderstanding:</strong> People who are unable to understand where the company or the product is going are highly likely to make wrong calls and take the project in the wrong direction, creating a waste of time or money, discouragement within the team due to the constant re-work, and from that point on, all efforts will be inefficient. Consequences of this issue: missed dates, unclear or unconvincing project goals, inefficient metrics, and confusing product expectations, or what I call “<em>ghost problems,”</em> which are the product’s functions that were never considered to have, and people for not understanding all the product’s functionalities, expect.</p><p><strong>Lack of systems thinking: </strong>Untalented people are unable to see the project as a connected entity, part of a whole, with serious consequences at all stages, especially at the final stage. One of the basic things to master when starting a new project is to be aware of all possible connections or collateral impacts on other products, especially if you work in a product ecosystem. Not taking this information to the table in the early stages of a project will affect planning, the accurate scale of the challenge, and potential dependencies on other actors or functionalities.</p><p>You can deliver or ship a product, but without this information, your solution is incomplete, and you will probably have to go back to square one, this time with rising costs and frustration from teammates.</p><p><strong>Improvised way of working:</strong> I’ve seen many people start a project without a clear path, and experience has taught me that results are often poor because valuable work can be left behind. When working without a basic sense of order, you will react to everything rather than plan and take control of your next move. As you guessed, ownership here is nonexistent because your time will be spent on damage control rather than having relevant conversations with others.</p><p><strong>Unproductive communication:</strong> Projects are simple; it’s all about progress, steps, time, capacity, numbers, and other factors. The proper language for conversations is about key information, for example: “overall progress is at 75%; so far, we have reached the following milestones, and we have these warnings that could potentially put the X deliverable in jeopardy.” I know this is a simple way to show it, and it might involve a lot of considerations, but in essence, that’s pretty much what you need to talk about.</p><p>Unproductive communication occurs when the person in charge of these conversations begins to tell complex stories with dialogue, subplots, and even twists, making the key points of the conversation unclear, leaving more doubt than certainty, and also consuming the time of the other members of the space. I think good communication is about finding the perfect tune for the message you want to deliver to the right people at the right time. Not strategically developing this skill will lead to unclear agreements <em>(my opinion vs. your opinion)</em>, which will steer the project down subjective paths that are sometimes inefficient for the business.</p><p><strong>No signs of accountability:</strong> Are you familiar with affirmations like this: “It’s not my fault, I shipped as expected, but the X team or the Y person didn’t deliver as supposed to.” Who loses in this scenario? Everyone, when everything is from everyone<em> (in low-seniority environments)</em>, no one is responsible for anything.</p><p>These positions within the team are dangerous for the project and the company because you face people who don’t play fair or, at least, aren’t team players.</p><p><strong>No problem-solving mindset:</strong> Problems are inevitable; the whole point is how to approach them. Having people who panic when things are not going well and bring chaos to the team or stakeholders is less than practical. It is just noise with no answers. A solving mindset is an underrated skill that, in my opinion, can make the difference between shipping high-quality products and delaying things to the point of generating frustration among people or killing the production momentum within the team. Problems sometimes are the fuel people need to find a differential spark that can make your product unique.</p><p>So far, in my experience, these are the things that make it challenging to create products from a human perspective. We are not perfect, and that’s a reality we live with, and it is also a beautiful thing, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that we shouldn’t do things to help navigate these complex nuances.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pgmHL8XwG0Afn5py7Opj8Q.png"" /><figcaption>A talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</figcaption></figure><p>As I said, we are complex beings, and external factors can influence our everyday performance. Still, if we take an objective look at what is necessary when executing a product build, these are some simple things to consider.</p><h4>Company and team context matter</h4><p>Not all companies are the same, just as not all people are. There are tons of factors that make every company and its teams unique; so, when finding someone to jump into a product-creation dynamic, make sure this person is a good fit for what’s about to happen and how people interact. In companies where bureaucracy is high, for example, you may need a type of person who can handle high-power profiles or even non-technological roles. Still, the situation is different in small, agile companies, where a hands-on profile can be more productive than focusing solely on strategy or meetings. Make sure the person you are looking for has a background in a similar company and team context, as that will make the transition to the new role smoother.</p><h4>Skills visible in the field, not only on a resume or a job vacancy</h4><p>To me, there is a lot of bluff among professionals today who claim they have achieved remarkable things in previous positions. Still, experience has taught me that one thing is to say in sophisticated words on a resume or a LinkedIn page than to demonstrate in action, where sometimes theory is irrelevant, and the most critical thing is your ability to solve problems and make decisions for the project, team, and company. When promoting someone or hiring a new team member, make sure whatever this person says is true <em>(for example, in a business case challenge)</em>. In this way, I’m sure that when the challenge arises, your new asset will overcome it with excellent results.</p><h4>Sense of community over single stars</h4><p>One powerful thing we have is the sense of unity, and when high-difficult times arise, it is incredible to feel the support from your teammates. With a strong sense of community within the team, challenges can be easier to digest.</p><p>I remember one time at a former job, we faced the biggest product challenge so far in my career: we were running against time to build an entire digital entertainment ecosystem for LATAM and US Hispanics at the same time, but even with such pressure on us (the product team), we were able to deliver as expected despite long night work shifts and weekend sessions. After several months of massive effort, all that remained was the feeling of having achieved an excellent product with the best people on your side.</p><p>People are the number one risk factor in whether a product thrives or fails. Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource. Conversely, a talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</p><h3>Over-complex technology or processes</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pPI9_8X4dKFEUWaYHWoGdg.png"" /><figcaption>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated.</figcaption></figure><p>The second risk factor for failing to create a tech product is adopting technology or processes that teammates don’t fully dominate or even understand. Trends in technology are part of everyday life, but that doesn’t mean your company has to adopt every new method, tool, role, or technology that emerges. As I said before, context <em>(company and talent)</em> matters; technology, roles, or processes should be according to the people who will handle them. Bringing sophisticated dynamics to a non-senior team will only create frustration, confusion, and delays to your projects.</p><p>People often underestimate the power of basics; I’ve seen many fantastic products built with a straightforward approach, and they’re so simple that people can master them quickly. One of the beauty outcomes of starting from simple product creation approaches is that, after learning the technique, it comes to innovation, and from there, I’m sure creating a product will be a joyful process of discovery.</p><p>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated, but after 20 years of experience, I have to say it’s not always the case.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lZqZ7gNrlsAtrpmRWsrlFA.png"" /><figcaption>Ideate a sequence of steps where people feel comfortable enough to start developing things without the fear of not knowing what they are doing.</figcaption></figure><p>From senior positions or high leadership levels, understanding what your company or team needs and what it is capable of is the most crucial insight when creating new work dynamics.

We all know that AI allows us to ship products twice as fast as before, but to me, it is also a double-edged sword that can cut you if you don’t know how to use it properly.</p><p>AI, as a technology, is like a wormhole that lets you get to the other side in seconds, but treating it as the sole protagonist of the story might be a mistake. The majority of the results AI gives you when you prompt something are based on global-scale context; sometimes that’s enough for your needs, but sometimes, if the AI lacks the proper context, it is highly probable to provide a vague answer.</p><p>A common mistake with AI solutions is misunderstanding the new product dynamic: the possibility of starting from “the solution” towards users, rather than the other way around, as we were used to. When this scenario is treated as an absolute <em>(design, product, and development)</em>, we can overlook small things that could make our product flawed.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hMjqLNh26aaqGRZ_520q7g.png"" /><figcaption>Do not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty; what we know is really valuable.</figcaption></figure><p>It is good to adopt AI as a new core technology for your team, company, and even your culture, but so far, use it as a lever for your progress and don’t start leaving human expertise behind. There is still a lot of hysteria about whether AI will replace us, and following market trends in layoffs without any fundamental basis only increases the fear among tech professionals. My advice on this issue is not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty <em>(it will be in time, and we’ll lose the war against it)</em>, but right now, what we know is really valuable. My prediction with AI <em>(I can be wrong)</em> is that people will appreciate human nuances and imperfections in all creations rather than AI’s fake perfection.</p><p>With all these years of experience in the design field, I now look at things differently, and not every new tool impresses me as it did when I was a kid seeking knowledge and experience. I’m still learning for sure, don’t get me wrong, but with all this technological evolution in almost 20 years, I’m more into getting to basics to solve things and guess what, it always works; we humans are complex and that’s the beauty of UX, we understand humans <em>(the good and bad things)</em> and as I write this article, I realize this is a deep human reflection of how we sometimes, make something more complicated that it should be when the solution sometimes is right there in front of us.</p><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eTjJRViX-X810u9AeQqqaw.png"" /></figure><p><em>To write this article, I want to credit all the fantastic information sources and other authors who wrote about related topics, all from another exciting perspective.</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/the-product-lens-looking-at-the-world-through-a/product-management-vs-project-management-understanding-the-skill-requirements-b3b2deef911b""><em>Product Management vs Project Management: Understanding the Skill Requirements</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/dont-follow-the-ai-trap-stop-and-think-how-and-when-to-use-ai-in-product-design-b9565931093b""><em>Don’t follow the AI trap: stop and think</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/not-every-feature-needs-ai-a-practical-guide-on-gen-ai-in-product-design-452275c08279""><em>Not every feature Needs AI: A Practical Guide on Gen-AI in Product Design</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/music-for-thought/ai-wont-kill-live-performance-it-might-save-it-6cdafdf0fa2b""><em>AI Won’t Kill Live Performance.

Layers of player experience</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Usability</h3><p>According to the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, usability is about how easily and pleasantly users can achieve their goals when interacting with a product.</p><p>It is an important factor for a product’s success and popularity. In some cases, usability can be one of the key or a unique selling point: Apple’s <em>“It just works”.</em></p><p>I’ve never seen a game that people play just because it has a pleasant UI. However, audiences get used to a certain level of interaction quality from other domains: mobile apps, web products, automotive infotainment systems.</p><p>When a game’s UI does not meet these expectations, it negatively affects usability and, as a result, the overall game experience. <strong>Сompetition drives progress </strong>(<em>or burnout</em>).</p><figure><img alt=""A meme with two images of Doge dogs.

The number of platforms and content options has multiplied. One moment players are fighting a boss in a game, and the next moment they have already spent four hours watching AI-generated cats cheating with panthers.</p><p>We can divide competitors into<a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-competitors-business""> three categories</a>. For example, I am thinking about playing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> on PS5.</p><h4>Direct competitors</h4><p>Games from a similar AAA subset within the same genre: <em>open-world, survival horror, post-apocalyptic shooters, …</em></p><h4>Indirect competitors</h4><p>Other games that provide a similar emotion, feeling — competitors for experience rather than genre: <em>Ori</em>, <em>Cuphead</em>, <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em></p><h4>Replacement/substitute competitors</h4><p>In this case, competitors for time and attention. Some examples:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Media and streaming</em></strong><em> (Netflix, Prime, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Twitch)</em></li><li><strong><em>Mobile applications</em></strong><em> (e-commerce, dating)</em></li><li><strong><em>Social media</em></strong><em> (TikTok, Instagram)</em></li><li><strong><em>Offline activities</em></strong><em> (sports, board games, travelling)</em></li></ul><p>A large number of options can trigger choice paralysis or lead people to choose the simplest one — scrolling through a social media feed. Many of these replacement competitors didn’t exist in the 2000s, so my choice as a child was simpler: <em>play Crash Bandicoot and watch Nickelodeon cartoons</em>.</p><p>Today, the market offers hybrid solutions. For example, Netflix has been adding games to its library for several years, aiming to capture even more of users’ time and attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional image showing three smartphones aligned side by side, each displaying a different game splash screen, with Ubisoft and Netflix Games logos above, representing a multi-game mobile platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FRQ3-Kd8KS2ueu_7ZfXAMg.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Netflix and Ubisoft are partnering to create three exclusive mobile games for Netflix members. </em><a href=""https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-partners-with-ubisoft-to-create-three-exclusive-mobile-games-for"">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Heuristics</h3><p>Let’s return to usability and heuristics. Of course, this alone will not win a game the <em>Game of the Year</em> award at <a href=""https://thegameawards.com/winners""><em>The Game Awards</em></a><em> </em>— perhaps, a chance to compete in the <em>Innovation in Accessibility</em> category. However, a well-developed usability layer can reduce the risk of users leaving for competitors, and as we can see, there are plenty of them today.</p><p><strong>Usability heuristics</strong> are general principles that help evaluate and improve the ease of use of a system. They are not limited to digital interfaces and are effective across many domains and products. These heuristics are often based on observation and practical experience rather than mathematical formulas or psychological terminology. The most well-known set is<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/""> Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics</a>.</p><p>I used these 10 as a foundation, along with the work of Celia Hodent (<a href=""https://celiahodent.com/ux-practices-epic-games/""><em>Developing UX Practices at Epic Games</em></a>), and consolidated them into an updated set of eight.</p><figure><img alt=""List of usability heuristics with arrows highlighting grouped items: items 3 ‘User control and freedom’ and 5 ‘Error prevention’ are connected with a bracket pointing to ‘Error Prevention and Recovery’; item 7 ‘Flexibility and efficiency of use’ has an arrow pointing to ‘A11Y and Flexibility’."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FosqKLxwqgH90lUFlWvKdw.png"" /><figcaption>Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and updates</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong></li><li><strong>Match between the system and the real world</strong></li><li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></li><li><strong>Error prevention and recovery</strong></li><li><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong></li><li><strong>Accessibility (A11Y) and flexibility</strong></li><li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></li><li><strong>Help and documentation</strong></li></ol><p>Next, I will take a closer look at each heuristic and share a few examples that came to mind. There are countless examples and solutions around us, developing this awareness is extremely valuable for designers.</p><h3>1. Visibility of System Status</h3><p><em>Design should always communicate what is happening in a clear and timely manner for the user. Use visual, auditory, and tactile channels to inform players about game events (</em><strong><em>informative signs</em></strong><em>), encourage them to perform certain actions (</em><strong><em>inviting signs</em></strong><em>), and provide clear feedback on their interactions (</em><strong><em>feedback</em></strong><em>). All game features and possible interactions should have clear signs and appropriate feedback.</em></p><p>The main role of the HUD interface is to inform the player about game states and events — for example, health, available character actions, position on the map. Which information should be shown or hidden depends on the game and its context.</p><figure><img alt=""First-person view with HUD elements showing team status, timer, score, ammo, health, and interaction prompts, while a diegetic wrist-mounted device on the player’s hand displays an active drone interface integrated into the game world."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aCiH3803d_xPfZLqaTX18Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege X</figcaption></figure><p>In game <strong>menus</strong>, this may include stats, character balance, available actions, or messages explaining why certain options are unavailable.</p><figure><img alt=""Armor upgrade menu showing stats, required resources for upgrades, and the message “Not Enough Resources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RspNBl9KFDO_XLS0uhz30w.png"" /><figcaption>Upgrade Menu in God of War Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>An example from <strong>industrial design</strong> that comes to mind is an elevator: when we approach, we can see the system status — which floors the elevators are on, whether they are moving, and if they are operational. Based on this information, we decide which elevator to call. We press a button and receive feedback — the button lights up until the elevator arrives, and the floor number changes.</p><h3>2. Match Between the System and the Real World</h3><p><em>Design should communicate in the users’ language: words, phrases, models, and concepts. Follow real-world conventions so that information is presented in a natural and logical order.</em></p><p>This is especially important for UI text, often called <strong>UX copy</strong>. It makes up a significant part of the interface and can make the user experience delightful — or, conversely, frustrating.</p><p>The screenshots below show examples of HUD widgets: they mirror the layout of buttons on the input device (gamepad, keyboard, Nintendo Switch, etc.). This helps players quickly understand what to do and which button(s) to press.</p><figure><img alt=""Hint widget: L-stick + X for action ‘Climb’; nearby icons for Y, A, and B actions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g8E3vC1lCAo64QkMxVg02g.png"" /><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)</figcaption></figure><p>This approach makes interactions feel more natural, as it aligns with our mental and physical models. A consistent pattern or standard can be seen across the three game examples.</p><figure><img alt=""Three examples of HUD widgets from Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man 2, Assassin’s Creed Shadows with action buttons and indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fglgClLwFKyD25HynRGPgg.png"" /><figcaption>HUD widgets for weapons, abilities, consumables</figcaption></figure><h3>3. Consistency and Standards</h3><p><em>Interface elements should be consistent and adhere to accepted standards.</em></p><p>Why reinvent the wheel when you can <em>steal like an artist</em>? The radial weapon selection menu (<em>Weapon Wheel</em>) is used in games to provide quick access to weapons or items.</p><figure><img alt=""Item selection wheel from Red Dead Redemption 2 showing Dead Eye Tonics, highlighting Chewing Tobacco."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ry4Cpk4E7ndic8TtcANEpg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon selection wheel from Far Cry 6 showing MS16 S rifle with armor-piercing rounds highlighted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8_N1xxiQow2G6Xx3OQpKZg.png"" /><figcaption>Radial Menu in Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), Farcry 6 (2021)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Navigation </strong>in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> (2022) is similar to YouTube or other TV apps.

Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3><p><em>Information needed for interaction should be visible or easily accessible when required. This reduces memory load by keeping objects, actions, and parameters clearly visible.</em></p><p>For example, a list of available actions or controls in a specific game context:</p><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 6 airplane screenshot: control info panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5OrnlFBK7BoF0YnYYEQ8Rw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon shop interface with catalog and control panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2UO9rBVokYoSmjbjq0jh3A.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 6 (2021), Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The option to open a map legend and recall the meaning of icons is another example:</p><figure><img alt=""Game screen from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown showing map with legend on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ez8WaDLwyuZm2Cet_iN7_A.png"" /><figcaption>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool implementation can be seen in <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. On the left is diegetic UI — the character points to world tiles on the doors — while on the right, a non-diegetic panel provides the player with information about this location, quests, and collectibles. This reduces the amount of information the player needs to remember or search for.</p><figure><img alt=""Character standing near wooden doors with world symbols; UI panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rn_HY8g7LKDIz8u50T0mTw.png"" /><figcaption>God of War: Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>In many applications, a <strong>Recent Files</strong> function serves the same purpose: it shows the last opened documents or projects. Users don’t need to recall the exact file path or name — they simply recognize and select the item they need.</p><h3>5. Error Prevention and Recovery</h3><p><em>Try to prevent errors that are not part of the core experience, where challenges and obstacles are intentionally designed. If an error does occur, help players recover quickly and understand its cause.</em></p><p>The first examples that come to mind are confirmation pop-ups<strong> </strong>— an extra step in interaction, but designed to prevent mistakes.</p><figure><img alt=""Dishonored 2 UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZ0XdOqwNX15G6SV9TmaXA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Horizon Forbidden West UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i8pBxCGFSUhohhXg.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Dishonored 2(2016)</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West(2022)</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hi-Fi Rush UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zkCuKFQ4_kTeltSiyf5bnA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""XDefiant UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CtUWlXba2MqkaW0i3qYcxw.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Hi-Fi Rush(2023)</em> and <em>XDefiant(2024)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the button order in the pop-ups: in the first case, <strong>No–Yes</strong>; in the second, <strong>Yes–No</strong>. It seems the world has not yet standardized it. Currently, I lean toward clearly labeling actions. Instead of generic Yes/No, use explicit labels like <strong>Exit, Delete, Buy</strong>, and <strong>Back, Cancel</strong>, etc. This way, users can understand and anticipate the outcome of their actions just by reading the buttons. I’ve seen this approach across platforms such as TV, iOS, and PlayStation.</p><p>Interestingly, for confirming critical actions, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Figma </em>use similar design solutions. In WoW, deleting a character requires typing the word <strong>“</strong>DELETE<strong>”</strong>, and in Figma, deleting a team requires typing the team’s name to confirm the action.</p><figure><img alt=""World of Warcraft character deletion confirmation dialog over game background, asking to type ‘DELETE’ to confirm."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0SLga3uDXb21AR4_dzL7XA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Figma interface showing a team deletion confirmation popup with warning text and input field to enter team name."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*htyeVWkAx4g8_ehE-XQTTQ.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>6. Accessibility and Flexibility</h3><p><strong><em>Accessibility</em></strong><em> refers to the qualities that make an experience open to all, according to </em><a href=""https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf""><em>the Inclusive 101 Guidebook, Microsoft Inclusive Design</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The more customization options a game provides, the more accessible it can be for players. However, it’s not necessary to <em>anchor</em> on creating hundreds of options and categories. It’s better to explore new, more refined UI solutions — perhaps some automatic synchronization of game and platform settings or even <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/""><em>AI: intent-based UI paradigm</em></a>. Still, if there are many settings, a <strong>search function</strong> in the game can be helpful, similar to those in iOS, Android, Windows, or Call of Duty.</p><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Ukrainian with left-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4jNDZhj2eqI3xqdnVc2D_Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Arabic with right-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AvB7P_cjhF_y-Eu6M6sH2Q.png"" /><figcaption>Mirrored UI for Accessibility settings in XDefiant (2024) in Ukrainian and Arabic</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Flexibility</em></strong><em> ensures effective interaction for both new and experienced users.</em> For example, hotkeys, shortcuts, macros, and personalized settings. In <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, players can switch weapons either through the overlay menu or using shortcuts. The menu shows the assigned keyboard keys (1, 2, 3…) as a reminder of this interaction method.</p><figure><img alt=""Scene from Resident Evil 4 (2023): character in a dark room, weapon selection menu on the right with labeled hotkey slots."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ysA2iGSZMBC5UOP2SXlMag.png"" /><figcaption>Resident Evil 4 (2023)</figcaption></figure><p>It is also important to consider <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/accessibility-by-design""><strong>Accessibility by Design</strong></a><strong>”</strong> — an approach where accessibility is incorporated from the start, rather than added later as an option. By tackling root causes instead of consequences, this saves dev time and resources. Standards and guidelines like the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"">Xbox Accessibility Guidelines</a> are helpful references.</p><h3>7. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3><p><em>Design should not include information that is irrelevant or rarely used. The system should have a simple, uncluttered design that focuses on the core elements of interaction.</em></p><p>This is especially important when designing HUD elements due to limited screen space and the player’s attention resources. The team must define priorities and the display order of HUD widgets.

<h4>UX isn’t decoration; it is the mechanism that converts product value into business revenue.</h4><p>As a C-level executive at two consecutive VC-backed startups (ARxVision, AdInMo) and Senior Manager at major players like Ubisoft and the BBC, I’ve utilized design to solve critical P&amp;L issues. The hardest part has often been building the business case to convince decision-makers to invest in user experience. Here are two distinct examples where UX was directly tied to business success.</p><p>In some cases, early-adopters, adventurers who need your product so much that they’ll be willing to go through a bad user experience to access the value a product delivers. This is usually a positive because the fact that a user is willing to go through a painful UX signals that the solution solves their problem well-enough. When this is the case, improving the UX will increase the efficiency of the solution (reducing friction) and increase customer satisfaction. So in this context <strong>UX is a growth tool</strong>.</p><p>In other cases bad UX can truly be a barrier to adoption, it totally comes in the way and blocks users from benefiting from any of the value a product aims to deliver. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Don Norman calls this <strong>The Gulf of execution</strong></a>: the difference between what a user wants to do with a product and how the product allows them to do it. If the gap is too big, the user stops trying and the product fails, the business fails.</p><blockquote>“Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.” — The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</blockquote><figure><img alt=""an equation of BusinessValue = ProblemSolved x UXQuality"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GnMkL2l0h5bdZwXNZ-JpHg.png"" /><figcaption>In that sense, UX is a <strong>value multiplier</strong> for the solution your product delivers.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>UX can make or break the business</strong>. Here are two illustrations of this statement from my own experience. The first example is an extreme case because it is an accessibility wearable for people with disabilities, so UX matters more than ever. The second example is more subtle because it targets Unity developers and we assume they are technical, and therefore might not care about or need a premium UX.</p><h3><strong>ARxVision — Making the world accessible with AI</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aVAwCjoNvunPS4UI7GZM2A.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of the ARx Unboxing experience, showing how parts are laid out in a specific order, guiding users and managing their expectations.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led a VC-owned company who launched a wearable device for individuals with blindness. We launched an early private beta as we wanted to learn from users and not build in a silo. This was entirely a case of provoking problems to measure their importance.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The learning from multiple beta launches, was that UX problems were directly threatening the business.<strong> Bad onboarding often resulted in a product return, directly harming the P&amp;L</strong>. I also observed that most competitors were charging high prices to make-up for in-person expensive training, my view was always that if a product is designed well enough, in-person training shouldn’t be required.</li><li><strong>Action: </strong>I designed an interactive unboxing and onboarding experience simulating in-person training thanks to a generative AI powered experience.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The onboarding drastically reduced returns and support tickets, but also enabled our customers and ourselves to capture more value than our competitors who were way more expensive because they were still relying on middle men in-person sales and training to make up for bad UX, when our users 17 to 88 were able to get set up in minutes thanks to our design (and how Sales, Product, Engineering, and Design beautifully joined forces to deliver that experience).</li></ol><h3><strong>AdInMo — In-Game ads SDK that monetise without interrupting the game.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PljCNOivsDdCLlgT99pwdw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of AdIbMo’s customer dashboard with a 6 step interactive onboarding flow</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led product and design in a company building an in-game Ad SDK for mobile game Unity Developers.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The SDK was live in a number of games and worked well, but new features increased complexity, resulting in broken integrations, or cancelled integrations. Broken integrations generated misleading data, misleading our company direction. Cancelled integrations were revenue losses — both affecting the P&amp;L.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> My team tackled this problem by designing an end-to-end onboarding flow and interactive tools to provide live feedback, certainty, and reduced overheads for our customers.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The redesigned code interface and onboarding flow for the SDK meant an integration could be completed in 10mn, we became better at tracking drop off points and best of all, <strong>we started recording developers self-serving and integrating the SDK without the sales team getting involved</strong>, building a new engine of growth for the company.</li></ol><p>These 2 examples show how when strategically used, design can directly impact a company’s success. In both examples, I did not over invest in design initially in order to identify the pain points before addressing them, but I was carefully watching users and ‘waiting around the corner’ for problems, almost provoking them to measure their importance. If I wasn’t ‘looking’ for these problems, my team and I could have missed opportunities to fix them, or even worse, fixed something that didn’t need to be fixed.</p><blockquote>The quality of a solution is a product of how well we understand the problem it solves and for whom — all of which falls within the scope of design. Ultimately, this means Design is not just about aesthetics; it is the strategic intelligence that maximises Business Value.</blockquote><p>In both cases, I didn’t over-invest in “pixel perfection” initially. I used a lean approach — waiting to see where users struggled to access value — and then deployed design strategically to remove those specific barriers.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey data</a> backs this approach, showing that companies who treat design as a cross-functional business lever (not just a studio) see 3<strong>2% higher revenue growth</strong> than their peers.</p><p>Real UX isn’t just about making things easy (or pretty); it’s about making the business viable.</p><h3>📚 Further Reading &amp; References</h3><p>For those interested in the data and theory behind these concepts, here are the foundational resources referenced in this article:</p><ul><li><strong>The Business Value of Design (McKinsey &amp; Company):</strong> The definitive report analysing 300 companies over five years, proving that top-quartile design scorers increase revenues and shareholder returns at nearly twice the rate of their industry peers. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">Read the full report here.</a></li><li><strong>The Gulf of Execution (Nielsen Norman Group):</strong> A deeper dive into Don Norman’s framework on why users fail to interact with products. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Read the summary here</a>.</li><li><strong>Product-Led Growth (OpenView):</strong> If you are interested in how companies like Stripe and Duolingo use product experience as their primary growth engine, OpenView’s guide is the industry standard. <a href=""https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/"">Read the guide.</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=207cfe19fdc1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ux-directly-impacts-p-l-207cfe19fdc1"">How UX directly impacts P&amp;L</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
