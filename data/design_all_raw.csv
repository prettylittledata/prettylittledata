<h4>The future of work in the age of AI and deepware.</h4><p>There is a photograph from 1930s East London that should be mandatory viewing for anyone anxious about AI taking their job. It shows Mary Smith, a “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-up</a>” — <strong>a woman whose entire profession consisted of walking the streets at dawn, shooting dried peas at bedroom windows with a long bamboo pole to wake workers for their factory shifts.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Photograph from 1930s showing Mary Smith, a “knocker-up,” wielding a bamboo pole with dried peas, shooting them at bedroom windows to wake factory workers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rkCJ0XioJKqdRXNE.jpg"" /><figcaption>Mary Smith, a “knocker-up” in East London (1930s)</figcaption></figure><p>Mary charged sixpence a week for this service. Then the alarm clock arrived, and Mary’s job vanished.</p><p>Do we mourn the knocker-up today? Do we rage against the tyranny of the alarm clock? Of course not. Because what happened to Mary is what has happened throughout every technological revolution: certain tasks became obsolete whilst entirely new categories of work emerged.</p><p>Yet here we are in 2025, gripped by the same ancient panic. <em>AI is coming for our jobs</em>, we are told. The robots will replace us. The future is bleak.</p><blockquote>Let me offer a different provocation: AI is not coming for your job. It is coming for your tasks. And if you cannot distinguish between the two, then yes — you should be worried.</blockquote><h3>The evolution we refuse to see</h3><p>Human work has always been in flux. In nomadic societies, we hunted and gathered. Agriculture tethered us to land and rhythms of seasons. Industrialisation moved us into factories, trading physical labour for wages. The information age shifted us again — this time from brawn to brain, from making things to managing data, information, and knowledge.</p><p>Each transition has redefined not just what we do, but what remains uniquely human about work. We moved from physical exertion to cognitive processing. Now we have built what I call “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>deepware</em></a>” — neural networks and machine learning systems layered atop our traditional software and hardware. <br />These architectures can process, pattern-match, and produce at speeds we cannot fathom. Yet in our rush to innovate, we have convinced ourselves that <em>deepware</em> can carry the weight of responsibility our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> — our human brains and nervous systems — seems increasingly willing to surrender. We are moving again, but this time the question is whether we are moving forward or simply moving away.<br />Because this time, the shift is not from physical to mental. It is from execution to <strong><em>responsibility</em></strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal timeline infographic titled “The Evolution of Human Work.” It shows five large coloured circles connected by a black arrow, each representing a stage of labor. Nomadic (Hunting): “Physical survival, hunt and gather.” Agricultural (Farming): “Tied to land and seasonal cycles.” Industrial (Factories): “From muscle to machine labour.” Information (Knowledge): “Brains over brawn: data and knowledge.” Deepware (Responsibility): “Execution shifts to responsibility and ethics.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ImgkXpy6k2_U53LUT5K7XQ.png"" /><figcaption>The evolution of work, from hunting to responsibility.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Narayanan"">Arvind Narayanan</a> at Princeton observes, jobs are not monolithic entities. They are bundles of tasks. Some tasks are routine and susceptible to automation. Others require distinctly human qualities: judgement, ethics, accountability, wisdom.</p><p>The question is not whether AI can perform tasks. It demonstrably can, often better than we can. The question is who takes responsibility when those tasks produce consequences in the real world.</p><h3>Outputs are not outcomes</h3><p>This distinction matters more than most organisations realise.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is what a process produces. Code. Copy. Designs. Legal briefs. Medical recommendations. Outputs are the tangible results of a system executing its programmed or prescribed function — the direct product of following steps, rules, or algorithms. The term emerged in the industrial era, literally describing the quantity of coal or iron a mine could extract in a given period. Output depends entirely on the efficiency and capability of the process that generates it.</p><p><strong>Outcome</strong> is what happens when that output meets reality. An outcome requires context, interpretation, application, and crucially — <em>intentionality</em>. Outcomes demand understanding not just what was produced, but why it matters, who it affects, and what consequences ripple from it. Where outputs measure productivity, outcomes measure impact. They are the ultimate change or consequence that results from applying an output with purpose and judgment.<br />AI can generate outputs. It cannot, however, create outcomes. Because outcomes require something <em>deepware</em> fundamentally lacks: the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)""><em>wetware</em></a> capacity for responsibility.</p><p>Computers cannot be held accountable, as IBM recognised in 1979. That truth has not changed. What has changed is our willingness to pretend otherwise.</p><figure><img alt=""IBM’s note stating: A computer can never be held accountable. Therefore a computer must never make a management decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KxrF3PVHDs2TbLRh.png"" /><figcaption>IBM note, 1979</figcaption></figure><h3>The accountability vacuum</h3><p>We have already seen the cost of this pretension. A <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/06/03/attorneys-court-ai-hallucinations-judges/"">lawyer</a> in the US submitted AI-generated briefs filled with fabricated cases. A trial in <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/offbeat/articles/2025-08-15/australian-lawyer-apologizes-for-ai-generated-errors-in-murder-case"">Australia</a> was delayed because no one verified the AI’s outputs. These were not technological failures — these were failures of human responsibility.</p><p>When a professional says “the AI recommended it,” they are engaging in the same moral abdication as someone saying “I was just following orders.” Both statements attempt to transfer accountability to something — or someone — <a href=""https://emerge.digital/resources/ai-accountability-whos-responsible-when-ai-goes-wrong/"">incapable</a> of bearing it.</p><p>This is the dangerous seduction of <em>deepware</em>: it offers us the illusion that we can delegate not just tasks, but responsibility itself.</p><p>We cannot. We must not.</p><p>The future of work, then, is not about humans competing with AI for task execution. It is about humans stepping into roles where we exercise oversight, judgement, and accountability over the outputs that AI produces. This is not replacement. This is elevation.</p><p>But only if we prepare for it.</p><h3>The skills <em>deepware</em> cannot replicate</h3><p>Here is what the regulations already understand, even if organisations do not: responsible AI demands responsible humans. <br />The <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai"">EU AI Act </a>mandates human oversight, transparency in decision-making, and clear accountability chains. Not as bureaucratic burden, but as fundamental safeguard.</p><p>Because here is the uncomfortable truth about <em>deepware</em>: it learns from historical data, which means it perpetuates historical biases.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cangrade.com/blog/hr-strategy/hiring-bias-gone-wrong-amazon-recruiting-case-study/"">Amazon’s</a> recruitment algorithm discriminated against women. <a href=""https://fairnow.ai/workday-lawsuit-resume-screening/"">Workday’s</a> hiring system did the same with 40+ candidates. <a href=""https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/even-a-small-typo-can-throw-off-ai-medical-advice-mit-study-says"">MIT</a> research found that AI healthcare systems told female patients they were more likely to “manage illness at home”. <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/search/can-you-review-this-article-an-G_Tc8IpkTOyF.Bj47m8IfQ"">Judicial</a> algorithms found Black defendants more culpable.</p><p>These are not glitches. These are features of systems trained on data that encoded decades of invisible discrimination.</p><p>So when we talk about the future of work, we are really talking about the future capacity of humans to think critically about the machines we build. To question their outputs. To interrogate their processes. To identify bias. To imagine consequences. To demand better.</p><p>This requires a different skill set entirely:</p><p><strong>Critical thinking: </strong>the ability to evaluate claims, identify assumptions, and distinguish correlation from causation.</p><p><strong>Systems thinking: </strong>understanding how components interact, how changes ripple, how second and third-order effects emerge.</p><p><strong>Lateral thinking: </strong>seeing connections across domains, applying insights from one context to another.</p><p><strong>Scenario planning: </strong>running mental simulations of possible futures, stress-testing decisions before implementation.</p><p><strong>Consequence thinking: </strong>asking not just “can we?” but “should we?” and “then what?”</p><p>Notice what these skills have in common. They are uniquely human. They require <em>wetware</em> that is fully engaged, not atrophied from disuse.</p><h3>The extension that could replace us</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan"">Marshall McLuhan</a> wrote in 1967 that <em>“all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems to increase power and speed.</em>” <br />The wheel extended our legs. The telescope extended our eyes. Now <em>deepware</em> extends our cognitive capacity.</p><p>But here is McLuhan’s warning, implicit in every page: when an extension becomes too powerful, we risk forgetting the limb it was meant to serve. We outsource function, and eventually, capability atrophies.</p><p>Consider the calculator. Brilliant tool. But an entire generation now cannot perform basic arithmetic without one. The extension has replaced the skill.</p><p>Now scale that to <em>deepware</em>. If we allow AI to think for us — to analyse, to recommend, to decide — without maintaining our own capacity to audit and override, we risk something far more dangerous than job loss. We risk becoming obsolete not because machines replaced us, but because we voluntarily stepped aside.</p><h3>The choice that defines the next era</h3><p>The future of work is not a future without humans. It is a future where humans do fundamentally different work: the <strong><em>work of being responsible</em></strong>.</p><p>This means verification before deployment. Critical thinking over speed. Systems thinking over isolated innovation. Accountability at every level.</p><p>It means training a generation not just to prompt AI, but to <em>interrogate</em> it. Not just to deploy models, but to <em>govern</em> them. Not just to consume outputs, but to construct meaningful <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>It means recognising that as our <em>deepware</em> grows more sophisticated, our <em>wetware</em> must grow more rigorous. Every layer of AI we add demands an exponential increase in human oversight.</p><p>This is not optional. This is existential.</p><p>Mary Smith lost her job when the alarm clock arrived. But she did not lose her capacity for work — she adapted. Her children worked in offices, not on streets. Her grandchildren worked in roles she could never have imagined.</p><p>The same will be true for us, but only if we make a conscious choice: to remain conscious. To refuse the abdication of responsibility that <em>deepware</em> makes so seductively easy. To recognise that outcomes require human judgement in ways that outputs never will.</p><p>Our <em>wetware</em> remains the most sophisticated technology we possess. In the age of <em>deepware</em>, it is also the only thing preventing a future where machines own not just our code, but our agency.</p><p>The next time someone shows you what AI can do, we need to ask them something more important: who is responsible when it goes wrong?</p><p>Because in the end, the future of work depends not on what machines can produce, but on whether humans remember that we, and only we, can be held accountable for what happens next.</p><p><em>For a deeper exploration of the deepware-wetware framework and why responsible AI fundamentally depends on active human cognition, read: </em><a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749""><em>When Deepware meets Wetware: the uncomfortable truth about responsible AI</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a9293109b3be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">When machines make outputs, humans must own outcomes</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture.

Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts.

It is statistically coherent but culturally vacant, a reflection of averages without values.</p><p>Scaled up, these outputs flood culture with forms that only pretend to carry meaning. The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In that talk, Fabricant revealed a simple yet powerful insight:</p><blockquote><strong>as designers, what we work with is behavior, shaping it, understanding it, and ultimately impacting lives.</strong></blockquote><p>His words have stayed with me over the years, guiding my journey as a designer and researcher in the fields of HCI and Interaction Design.</p><p>Time has passed. I’ve worked across various companies and projects, yet Fabricant’s phrase, <strong><em>“Behavior is our medium,”</em></strong> resonates now more than ever. Too often, those of us in design are consumed by efficiency metrics, conversions, and growth. You know the acronyms well: CAC, NPS, CSAT, LTV, ARPA, WAU, MAU, the endless race of numbers. It’s easy to get lost designing for what drives revenue or satisfies stakeholders. I understand; this is the reality of capitalism. I don’t view design purely from a ‘romantic’ perspective.</p><p>I believe good design must generate value and revenue, both for people and for the company. But that’s not the point I want to focus on in this article. Stay with me as we explore something deeper.</p><h3>Behavior change</h3><p>Behavior change, or <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">behavior modification (Bandura, 1970)</a>, is a branch of behavioral science that draws on fields such as cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and other social science disciplines to understand, influence, and alter human actions.</p><p>Defining behavior change is a complex task, as many researchers offer differing definitions. Here, however, I want to propose a different approach: to separate the term “behavior change” into two distinct parts.</p><p>First, we need to clarify what we mean by behavior. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as any observable action in response to stimuli, or the way in which something functions.</p><p>The notion of “change,” on the other hand, implies a shift in habits, attitudes, or routines. This definition should help us establish a common ground moving forward.</p><p>Over time, key thinkers such as <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/operant-conditioning-a2-2794863"">Skinner</a> (1932), <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Bandura</a> (1970), <a href=""https://online.yu.edu/wurzweiler/blog/prochaska-and-diclementes-stages-of-change-model-for-social-workers"">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente</a> (1983) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion"">Kahneman &amp; Tversky</a> (1991) <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235413094_NUDGE_Improving_Decisions_About_Health_Wealth_and_Happiness"">Thaler &amp; Sunstein</a> (2009), <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19135907/"">Fjeldsoe</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303848"">Duckworth</a> (2016) have shaped the field, highlighting behavior change as a pathway to better outcomes for individuals, society, and the planet.</p><p>Yet, while behavior can be studied objectively, it is inevitably influenced by subjective factors, personal perceptions, internal beliefs, and cultural norms. For instance, changing energy-use habits may depend on how people perceive cost savings (<strong>perception</strong>), why they care about sustainability (<strong>belief</strong>), and the cultural value placed on nature (<strong>context</strong>).</p><p>In HCI/IxD, even if it is not always explicitly acknowledged by practitioners, behavior is central to the user experience. We cannot discuss UX without addressing user behavior. When we design the UI or the information architecture of a digital product, we are inherently shaping behavior.</p><p>Although rooted in longstanding theory, behavior change in HCI and IxD is a relatively recent focus, especially when we consider that the commercial internet only began in the late 1990s, followed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble"">the dot-com boom</a> of the early 2000s. The application of behavior change in digital products remains an emerging area. As <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603497"">Rapp et al.</a> (2023) point out, it is only in recent years that design has begun to seriously explore how technology can drive behavioral shifts, spurred by digital advances and a growing recognition of human factors in design.</p><p>Today, designers frequently employ behavior change techniques, evidence-based methods grounded in psychology and social science, as key components in interventions aimed at shaping user behavior. Yet, many of these efforts fail to produce meaningful or lasting change.</p><p>For instance, the use of game elements such as leaderboards, stars, points, and visual cues may capture users’ attention temporarily, but these techniques often do not sustain long-term engagement or behavioral impact. I don’t want to discourage designers. Rather, I believe we should embrace behavior change as a vital discipline within design.</p><p>Behavior should be treated as a design material, just as technology once became our material. If we use behavior thoughtfully, we can create better products. More than that, I believe there is a broader and more meaningful opportunity before us: to design for behavior. Not to make people addicted to products, but to help them grow as human beings, better parents, citizens, students, and professionals. Because if behavior is our medium, then design is our tool for empowerment.</p><h3><strong>Behavior as design material</strong></h3><p>Merriam-Webster defines material as the elements, constituents, or substances of which something is composed or can be made, or something (such as data) that may be worked into a more finished form.</p><p>In design, materiality refers to the qualities, affordances, and constraints of the substances or media through which designers give form to ideas. Traditionally, this included wood, metal, fabric, or plastic, tangible materials whose properties shape what is possible.</p><p>In HCI/IxD, materiality extends beyond the physical to include computation, code, data, time, and interaction patterns, each carrying its own “material” characteristics. As Wiberg (2017) explains, a material can be anything, physical or immaterial, that designers can shape to facilitate interaction between the user and the system. Similarly, Norby (2011, p. 4) argues that “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289345018_Between_the_tag_and_the_screen_redesigning_short-range_RFID_as_design_material"">for industrial and interaction designers, computational technology may be seen as materials that can be used to shape designs.</a>” Historically, as Wiberg (2017, p. 6) emphasizes, “<a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037518/the-materiality-of-interaction/"">materiality has always been a central concern in interaction design, influencing how interactions are structured and experienced</a>”.</p><p>A design material is any medium that designers manipulate to create form, meaning, and experience. To function as a design material, it should possess qualities that can be explored and appropriated, impose constraints that guide creativity, and enable expression in interaction. Researchers in HCI have argued that computation and interaction themselves are design materials because they actively shape what design outcomes can emerge.</p><p>From this perspective, materiality is a central component for interaction designers. However, beyond computational materials, there is a growing recognition that behavior itself can be considered a design material. Behavior includes both <strong>system behavior — how a digital or physical system acts and responds</strong>, and <strong>user behavior — how people act within or in response to the system. </strong>As <a href=""https://fall14se.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/alan-cooper-robert-reimann-david-cronin-christopher-noessel-about-face_-the-essentials-of-interaction-design-wiley-2014.pdf"">Cooper</a> (2007) emphasized, systems must respond appropriately to user actions, making behavior a cornerstone of design.</p><p>This is where the materiality of behavior reveals its unique complexity. Unlike wood or code, human behavior is inherently unpredictable and contextual. It carries its own agency, is shaped by emotions, and is influenced by several external factors.</p><p>Designing with behavior, therefore, is a dynamic and relational practice: the designer carefully sculpts the system’s behavior with the intention of influencing, guiding, or facilitating certain user actions, while recognizing that the outcome is always a co-creation, a dialogue between the system’s rules and the user’s unpredictable will.</p><p>Behavior has distinct qualities such as timing, rhythm, predictability, and adaptability. It also constrains what is possible, as the way a system behaves defines which actions become meaningful for the user. Moreover, behavior is expressive: a robot moving slowly and smoothly communicates friendliness, whereas abrupt and jerky movement communicates aggression. Unlike static materials, behavior unfolds over time, meaning designers sculpt temporal patterns as deliberately as physical form.</p><p>A practical example of this dynamic is Duolingo’s “streak.” The designed system behaves as a visual counter that increments daily and resets to zero if a lesson is missed, directly seeking to shape user behavior by fostering a daily learning habit. This visual cue leverages psychological principles such as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176524000399"">loss aversion</a> and the satisfaction of maintaining progress to promote consistency. It exemplifies behavior as a material: the designer is intentionally shaping the properties of human motivation to “sculpt” a desired routine.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the goal-setting calendar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lyeIALmaRQZ8SKyX.gif"" /><figcaption>Streak Goal-Setting Calendar. Source: <a href=""https://dribbble.com/alisale"">Alisa Le</a></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, interaction design is less about static objects and more about how things and people behave toward one another. In this sense, behavior is not a byproduct but the very substance of interaction design. It is a design material because it carries properties, constraints, and expressive potential that designers can intentionally shape, just like wood, metal, or code.</p><h3>The focus should remain on Human</h3><p>Design, technology, and computing are ultimately about people. Design is created by people, for people, and with people, not the other way around. Yet so much of what we build today fails to support what truly matters to individuals. <strong>Why, in an age of intelligent systems and smart computing, are we still primarily designing for task completion and efficiency?</strong> <strong>Why is interaction design so often stuck in a mindset of consumption?</strong></p><p>We should be designing for transformation to make interactions between people and technology smoother, more meaningful, and more human. This could mean creating systems that foster deep focus instead of constant interruption, that support memory augmentation rather than replacement, or that facilitate genuine connection.</p><blockquote>Technology should not be a cage. It should be a set of wings.</blockquote><p>Instead, we too often create systems that trap users in loops of distraction and consumption. Look around: technology has made us faster and more efficient, yes. But it has also made many of us more anxious, disconnected, and dependent. For countless users, hours are lost to social media feeds instead of invested in rich, real-world interaction. We are outsourcing cognition, offloading memory, letting machines think for us. That is not an empowering future; it is a cage.</p><p>As designers, our focus must remain on humans. We carry the responsibility to design for both human needs and business needs, balancing them while always grounding our work in human well-being as a non-negotiable foundation.</p><p>As interaction designers, we have a responsibility to use technology to empower, not to confine. And yet, look at us now: we are becoming trapped, uncertain, drifting. The algorithm is leading; we have forgotten that it is we who must define how the algorithm interacts with humans, not the other way around.</p><h3>Designing for behavior change</h3><p>Although there is a wide range of techniques and methods available for designing behavior change, many designers still lack the skills to apply them effectively. First, when approaching behavioral science in design, or behavior design, designers often encounter significant challenges. For some, behavior change feels “too scientific,” requiring a foundation of knowledge they may not yet possess. Moreover, behavior itself is complex, making it difficult to translate theory into practice.</p><p>Second, many designers rely heavily on pre-defined tools such as cognitive biases or behavior design pattern libraries, but struggle to develop their own understanding or creative approach to behavior change. Finally, despite the existence of influential models such as the <a href=""https://behaviordesign.stanford.edu/resources/fogg-behavior-model"">Fogg Behavior Model</a>, the <a href=""https://www.prodpad.com/glossary/hook-model/"">Hook Model</a>, and the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/organizational-behavior/the-com-b-model-for-behavior-change"">COM-B Model</a>, the field still lacks well-defined heuristics and design techniques that can be consistently applied in practice. As a result, applying these frameworks in real-world projects remains a major challenge for designers.</p><p>Although designing for behavior change is challenging, when we as designers consciously treat behavior as a design material, we open the door to creating a deeper and more lasting impact on both people and the planet. Designing products and services that guide people toward positive outcomes requires a solid understanding of human behavior.</p><p>As Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 10) point out, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">designing for behavior change is not a new concept; it’s well-rooted in design practice.</a>” Since the late 19th century, and throughout the 20th century, thinkers like <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/f/f8/Papanek_Victor_Design_for_the_Real_World.pdf"">Papanek</a> (1971) and <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/building-better-world-making-people-smile/"">McDonough</a> (2002) have explored how design can influence human choices and actions.</p><p>More recently, this conversation has expanded into the domain of interaction design, where scholars such as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=908493"">Lockton</a> (2005), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222616442_Design_for_sustainable_behaviour_strategies_and_perceptions"">Lilley</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">Niedderer et al.</a> (2018) have advanced the field by exploring how digital products can be intentionally crafted to shape user behavior in meaningful ways.</p><p>Traditionally, design was closely associated with the creation of physical objects or visual communication. From a linguistic perspective, the verb <strong><em>to design</em></strong> implies crafting something with purpose and intention. As McDonough (1992) stated, <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/the-hannover-principles/"">design is the first signal of human intention.</a> <a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f"">Every product we encounter in the world carries with it the intentions, whether conscious or not, of the designer or team that created it (Nzongo, 2022).</a></p><p>As a practitioner, I see design as a powerful and flexible tool that can be approached from multiple angles to support and influence behavior change through thoughtfully crafted products and experiences. Design isn’t just about form or function; it’s about shaping interactions, decisions, and ultimately, outcomes.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 11) capture this well when they state, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">The capacity of a designer lies in creating change through design by transforming the existing situation into a preferred one.</a>” In this sense, design becomes a form of intentional intervention, an opportunity to shift the current state of things toward something better, whether that means encouraging more sustainable habits, improving well-being, or supporting meaningful social change.</p><blockquote>Design for behavior change represents the next frontier in design.</blockquote><p>We must adopt a broader perspective, as Norman (1984) did when connecting design to behavior, emphasizing that artifacts are created to facilitate actions through their physical, symbolic, or social functions. From this viewpoint, design inherently drives transformation, shaping attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 9) highlight this transformative power, arguing that design has shaped modern society and continues to influence behavior in profound ways. Forcato (2015, p. 78) reinforces this perspective, noting that “<a href=""https://www.infodesign.org.br/infodesign/article/view/302"">design has always influenced behavior, whether intentionally or not.</a>”</p><p>Designing for behavior change isn’t just an idealistic goal; it’s a necessity. As Fabricant points out, behavior is our medium, and we should be using it to empower individuals and transform our communities. <strong>If behavior is the medium, then design is the tool for shaping it.</strong> <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2016.10.001"">By applying behavior change techniques and social theory</a>, we have the potential to design digital products that go far beyond surface-level aesthetics. I truly believe we can and should create tools that support deeper, more meaningful change.</p><h3>Designing for fitness habits</h3><p>In this project, I applied principles from social psychology and behavioral science to design a fitness app focused on fostering long-term well-being, not just logging workouts. The goal was to create a system that supports intrinsic motivation and sustainable habit formation.</p><p>The design leverages two interconnected features: progressive self-monitoring and a meaningful achievements system, grounded in a cohesive theoretical framework.</p><h4>Fostering intrinsic motivation through self-monitoring and identity</h4><p>At the core of the design lies the principle of self-monitoring, a key technique in the <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol24/iss1/28/"">persuasive systems design</a> (PSD) model. The app enables users to track their performance and compare progress against personal goals.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a training monitoring app interface featuring a progress chart, performance metrics, goal indicators, and an avatar that allows users to visualize their body evolution over time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oGoPJTBntiwJVefS3vsk4w.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This continuous feedback loop is crucial for sustaining motivation. According to <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), such feedback fosters positive emotions like satisfaction and pride as users observe their own improvement, directly strengthening their sense of competence, a fundamental pillar of intrinsic motivation.</p><p>To strengthen this connection, the app incorporates a 3D avatar as a virtual representation of the user. This feature leverages the <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15554120231202175"">proteus effect</a>, a psychological phenomenon in which individuals unconsciously begin to align their behavior with the identity of their avatar. This “imagined self” acts as a powerful, internalized motivator, reinforcing commitment by allowing users to visualize their future, healthier selves.</p><h4>Reinforcing progress with a theory-driven reward system</h4><p>The motivation generated through self-monitoring is further reinforced by a carefully designed achievements system. While badges act as external rewards, their true power lies in their ability to validate effort and signify mastery. This aligns with <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/254999"">expectancy theory</a> (Behling &amp; Starke, 1973), which suggests that motivation is driven by the belief that effort leads to success — badges make this “success” tangible.</p><p>Additionally, the system operates on the principles of <a href=""https://www.potentialunearthed.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reinforcement-Theory.pdf"">positive reinforcement</a> (Skinner, 1938), where desirable behaviors, such as consistent training, are followed by a rewarding outcome. The ultimate aim, however, is to guide users from external reinforcement toward internal satisfaction. By visualizing achievements, the system strengthens the user’s sense of competence, thereby continuing to support the intrinsic motivation emphasized in <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT).</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the training app interface where users can view the badges they have earned during workouts, which they can share on social media."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DKSW8fYpWVwadh2PMB7soQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This project exemplifies how interaction designers can move beyond surface-level aesthetics to create products that facilitate meaningful, positive change. By consciously applying behavior change principles using self-monitoring to build competence, an avatar to support identity, and achievements to reinforce progress, we can create tools that empower users and support their long-term well-being. It is a practical demonstration of using behavior as a design material with intention and responsibility.</p><p>Read more about the <a href=""https://medium.com/ux-user-experience-design-em-portugues/tecnologia-persuasiva-projetando-produtos-que-mudam-h%C3%A1bitos-0981011113af""><strong>project details at this link.</strong></a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>We can’t limit ourselves to designing only for task completion or task success. This approach is becoming outdated. It’s time to look toward a new horizon and embrace behavior as a design material.</p><p>As intelligent systems (AI) become increasingly prevalent, understanding human behavior is no longer optional; it is essential. Our responsibility as practitioners grows: we are not only shaping how these systems behave, but also influencing the behaviors humans develop when interacting with them. As designers, we must acknowledge this impact.</p><p>Every screen, every system, and every micro-interaction represents an opportunity to shape behavior. In essence, we are already designing behavior. The critical question, then, is not whether we influence behavior, but what kind of behavior we are enabling and with what intention.</p><p>Designing for behavior change is not about control; it is about care. It requires using our tools, research, empathy, theory, and craft to act responsibly and intentionally. As we move further into an age of AI and autonomous systems, the choices we make today will shape the habits, values, and actions of tomorrow.</p><p>Let’s choose to design for good. Let’s choose to design for change. Because when we design for behavior, we’re not just designing experiences — we’re shaping futures.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6d143562c909"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/behavior-is-our-medium-6d143562c909"">Behavior is our medium</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What I learned about AI in design-dev collaboration through hands-on experiments and a 3-month thesis project, and why it led me to DesignOps.</h4><figure><img alt=""A seated woman, viewed from behind, working at a desk with multiple screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H3j5Ozk4BOTHFd6ca_D9JA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>As the only designer on the team, seeing my developer colleagues deliver quickly thanks to AI made me consider ways to adapt. However, my thesis research led me in a different direction… <em>Credit: Unsplash.</em></figcaption></figure><p>“UX is dead.”</p><p>As a UX designer with a background in front-end development, I was struck by this phrase that kept popping up on LinkedIn. It also worried me a little for my future. But who exactly had killed UX?</p><p>The culprit seemed obvious: generative AI. Developers were embracing it faster than designers (or so <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328018930592034816/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7328018930592034816%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"">I read</a>). I realised that I used AI a lot when I was coding but barely touched it in my design work. Meanwhile, my developer colleague, an AI power user, was releasing features faster than ever.</p><p>This observation led me to a question that became the starting point of my thesis at <em>Les Gobelins Paris</em>: <strong>How could I, as the only designer on my team, keep pace and stay relevant in this changing environment?</strong></p><h3>The research that changed my mind</h3><p>I spent three months, from June to August 2025, actively investigating this question through my thesis. Many resources have shaped my understanding of AI and collaboration, from books such as <a href=""https://www.thedesignconductors.com/"">The Design Conductors</a> to articles like <a href=""https://blog.prototypr.io/dev-designer-collaboration-framework-bdef12799513"">Dev-Design Collaboration Framework</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/%40INI8labs/how-ai-tools-are-bridging-the-gap-between-product-thinking-and-frontend-code-059896c8c858"">How AI Tools Are Bridging the Gap Between Product Thinking and Frontend Code</a>.</p><p>Building on these foundations, my approach was deliberately comprehensive. For internal research at my company, I conducted AI experiments, tried various tools, and led three field tests at three crucial collaboration stages: scoping, prototyping and handoff. For external validation, I ran an online survey to which 28 designers answered, and conducted 6 interviews with designers and developers.</p><p>But the results surprised me. I expected to confirm my fears, developers racing ahead while designers fell behind. However, this observation wasn’t validated. That’s when I thought: <strong>Do designers really need to be faster and more productive?</strong></p><p>I understood that before finding ways to adapt, I needed to understand what AI really had changed between designers and developers. I refined my angle to a more relevant one: <strong>How is generative AI reshaping collaboration between designers and developers, from the scoping phase to the handoff?</strong></p><p>This reflection ultimately led me to view AI less as an isolated tool and more as an organizational topic (DesignOps).</p><h3>What I discovered</h3><p>Allow me to introduce the three members of the ‘product trio’ that will assist me in presenting my results:</p><ul><li>Marie, a passionate designer who is curious about AI</li><li>Tony, an astute developer who’s also an absolute fan of AI</li><li>John, Product Manager, who loves collaborating with his team</li></ul><h3>1. AI makes individuals faster, not teams better</h3><p>Marie represents 77% of designers using AI in my survey who reported speed gains since adopting it. She uses ChatGPT for interview guides and Figma Make for rapid prototyping. In one test, I reduced my prototyping time from two days to two hours using AI.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the survey percentages of answers to How AI has changed Work Pratices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V38YLBlYyWPu4kk0OKuJcg.png"" /><figcaption>Credit: Anna Lefour, with ClaudeAI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I found interesting:</strong> Marie’s relationship with Tony didn’t change at all. Both my data and interviews confirmed this pattern. AI frees up individual time, but teams rarely reinvest those savings into better collaboration. It’s rather used to focus on tasks that are seen as more valuable, like understanding users’ needs or developing strategic thinking.</p><h3>2. AI augments rather than replaces (for now)</h3><p>When Marie tried AI prototyping, she hit walls quickly. The tool sometimes ignored parts of her design system, created visual inconsistencies, and missed her design intentions. Tony experienced similar frustrations with AI-generated code that was more difficult to understand and failed to meet the company’s or his own quality standards.</p><p>In my handoff experiment, I tested how a developer approached a traditional Figma file versus one created with Figma MCP + Cursor. The developer I worked with found the traditional approach clearer and easier to interpret.</p><p><strong>What became clear</strong>, though, was AI’s potential as a thinking partner. For the scoping phase, I conducted a “synthetic developer” test (an idea based on the <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">synthetic user</a> experimentations), using ChatGPT to simulate developer feedback during scoping sessions. While it couldn’t match my real colleagues’ depth, it helped me prepare better questions and spot blind spots I’d missed.</p><figure><img alt=""A persona description in french that has been used in the writers’ synthetic dev test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption><em>My ‘synthetic developer’ persona was called Tim and was created to simulate developer feedback during the scoping process. I asked ChatGPT to embody Tim. I created a persona that matched the expertise level of the real developers. </em>Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>John, our PM, found similar value in AI prototyping. Even imperfect prototypes helped our ‘product trio’ to iterate and align more quickly, as well as develop a shared language around complex ideas.</p><h3>3. Adoption is prevalent, but lacks strategy</h3><p>Marie isn’t unique. Only 2 of 28 survey respondents said they don’t use AI at all. But adoption is happening in an exploratory phase mostly without global strategy:</p><ul><li>Some designers <strong>feel pressured to use tools</strong> that clash with their values</li></ul><blockquote>“I’d say it’s more pressure. I’ve been a bit resistant to AI because I don’t find that the efficiency outweighs the environmental cost at the end of the day. But I’m slowly changing my mind and I’m trying to use it for very specific things.” <br /><em>— 7th participant to user interviews (Product Designer)</em></blockquote><ul><li>Others received <strong>conflicting instructions on how to use AI</strong>, with designers being banned from using it and developers being encouraged to use it, and vice versa</li><li>Others describe frequent discussions about AI and tools, but <strong>no capitalisation on what was learnt</strong> through individual experimentation</li></ul><p>Companies are aware this is a key issue but <strong>implement solutions piecemeal. </strong>The result is fragmented practices, missed learning opportunities, and unequal access across teams.</p><h3>A different perspective on change</h3><p>What struck me most during this research is that <strong>AI isn’t fundamentally changing collaboration: it makes existing collaborative fundamentals even more crucial.</strong></p><p>Good collaborators can leverage AI more effectively. Teams with poor communication don’t magically improve just because they can prototype faster. Establishing frameworks that make designer-developer partnerships work becomes more important, not obsolete. The framework designed by Alicia Calderón González (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0BJAf0b3OY&amp;t=167s"">communication, collaboration, alignment</a>), Lead Design Strategist at Miyagami, which I discovered later in my research, seems even more relevant today.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration describing the three main steps in Alicia Calderòns’ collaboration framework: communication, collaboration, alignment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wjvC7HN0A86u21zO06n9fA.png"" /><figcaption>The ‘Unlocking Collaboration’ framework created by Alicia Calderón González is even more relevant today.

The key insight: we need to evolve from individual AI adoption to team-wide transformation.</p><p><strong>Governance:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Audit existing employee practices</strong>: Individual practices have already evolved to include AI, but in silos. Understanding current usage patterns helps identify where AI has already penetrated processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Process:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Create an AI usage charter</strong>: A shared framework helps align practices between designers, developers, and across the entire company.</li><li><strong>Establish guided experimentation</strong>: Create sandbox environments for testing AI in collaboration without impacting critical deliverables. Tools that bridge both professions offer particularly interesting opportunities for joint designer-developer experiments.</li></ul><p><strong>Operational Support:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Invest in shared training</strong>: Provide designers and developers with common foundations in prompting, technical basics, and chosen tools to create shared language and collective skill development.</li><li><strong>Enable effective documentation</strong>: Document what works and what doesn’t to define and evolve AI workflows based on experimental results.</li></ul><p>Bear in mind that AI is still in the exploratory stage and prone to instability. My goal here is not to offer an absolute framework of how things should be, but rather to provide actionable recommendations that will help to move beyond individual or silo adoption. The aim is to use AI to facilitate collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of collaboration with AI, with a robot head on top connected to a woman and two men by lines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*oVACV_9xaKCe4kuePkgMjQ.png"" /><figcaption>My recommendations aim to encourage the adoption of AI across different departments and establish shared practices between designers like Marie, developers like Tony, and product managers like John. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>This research had its limitations (small survey sample, context-specific tests, timing constraints), but comparing my findings with larger studies like <a href=""https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/reports/designer-developer-trends/"">Figma’s State of the Designer 2025</a> revealed consistent patterns across different contexts.</p><p>What I’ve observed is that teams are currently in an exploratory phase with AI, often lacking strategic coordination. <strong>The teams that will benefit most aren’t necessarily those who adopt AI fastest, but those who think most carefully about how it fits into their collaborative practices</strong>.</p><p>AI won’t replace design or development roles, but it is creating new opportunities for teams willing to experiment thoughtfully with how they work together.</p><p><strong>What’s your experience with AI in product teams? Have you seen it improve or complicate collaboration?</strong></p><p><em>Many thanks to all who contributed their time and insights to this research. Interested in exploring the recommendations in detail? Feel free to reach out to discuss!</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=701ec92ce60e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-in-designer-developer-collaboration-beyond-individual-productivity-701ec92ce60e"">Beyond individual productivity: rethinking AI strategy in product teams</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
