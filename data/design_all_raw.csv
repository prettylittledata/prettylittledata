<h4>An interview with Alexander Rose.</h4><figure><img alt=""Photo with a background of a mature 80–100 year old Redwood Tree closeup and inset is the tiny baby Redwood tree I have planted in my backyard. My logo, Redesign Everything, appears in the lower right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jteh8J5tMECO-YCAIME1mg.png"" /><figcaption>Image by Dave Hoffer. Inset is the little baby redwood tree I planted in my backyard.</figcaption></figure><p>Time is money. Move fast and break things. Crunch time. We hear these idioms repeated, and to many, they become true. You can live your life by these sayings if you like.</p><p>I prefer:</p><blockquote>“Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. — Virginia Woolf”</blockquote><p>Woolf seemed to recognize the spectrum on which time exists — its fluidity. Importantly, that time centers around humanity, because we track it. We frame it in terms of its past, present, and future. We observe its passage.</p><p>My preference doesn’t mean I don’t need a calendar. I desperately do. But some days I wish I didn’t. :) Time is something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit these days. As AI seems to be moving quite quickly, my children have grown into near-adults, and as I age, things seem to be moving faster. They’re not, but they seem to be.</p><p>If you’ve ever been in a car accident, time seems to slow down, while spending time with good friends can seem to move quickly. Temporal perception should feel familiar to everyone. There are numerous papers on this topic; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196844"">this one</a> provides a good breakdown, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-H4MKJSRXs"">this video</a> by David Eagleman is less dense. Eagleman experiments with time and proves that time doesn’t slow down, but your memory, triggered by your amygdala, captures the novelty of traumatic events “to attend to the situation at hand.” Memories are created in a kind of second memory system that you may need in the future to avoid or deal with the trauma at hand. So your brain has more memories to draw from, and you perceive time as elongating. Neuroscience is neat. Watch the video; his explanation is better than mine.</p><p>Depending on where you grew up, your cultural understanding of time may also differ.</p><p><em>“In general, Monochronic cultures view time as linear and separable, capable of being divided into units, and therefore emphasize doing ‘one thing at a time’. In contrast, Polychronic cultures view time as naturally recurring, and therefore emphasize doing ‘many things at one time.” Nonis, Teng, Ford 2005</em></p><p>The above definition is based on <em>Edward T. Hall’s 1959 book, The Silent Language. </em>Even though these binary stereotypes aren’t universal, studies support the assertion that place plays a role in how you perceive time, despite the difficulty in measuring these differences and their dependencies on context. (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273382690_Cross-cultural_Perspectives_on_Time"">Fulmer, Crosby, and Gelfand — 2014)</a></p><p>One context is the work you do. Your job affects your sense of time. I imagine that Paramedics and Quarterbacks likely think in <strong>seconds and minutes</strong>. If a patient goes into cardiac arrest, there seems to be an immediacy of action that other jobs lack.</p><p>The technology people that I’ve spent my career with…Product Managers and Software Developers, think in terms of <strong>weeks, sprints, and quarters.</strong> Our planning cycles contain deadlines, iterations, and launches. Even the CEO’s I’ve worked with often keep their time scales in shorter cycles as the technology can change quickly.</p><p>Urban Planners and Architects think in longer terms — <strong>years and decades.</strong> The scale of the work they do requires more time, and therefore, they have longer-term perspectives. The new Eastern span of the Bay Bridge in the SF Bay area took over a decade to complete and several years in planning since the impetus was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p><p>Few people think in <strong>centuries or millennia</strong>, but among them are Historians, Archaeologists, and Climate Scientists. Problems like the Climate Crisis, which affect us all, suggest that humanity has to step away from the numerous constructs that have affected the way we think about time and collectively shift to thinking more long-term. <br /> <br />This conclusion led me to wonder how many people I knew take a long-term view, and the answer was very few. Then I thought of Alexander Rose, who has spent his career thinking about the long-term.</p><p>I met Rose at Burning Man in 1999. His part of our camp was called Antarctica. He’d brought an 18-wheeler freezer truck out to the desert, and the idea was to crank up the air conditioning, have a DJ play music, and serve hot chocolate in this mobile club. It was delightful. He’d joined the Long Now Foundation in 1997 and worked there till 2024. He’s Director Emeritus at the Foundation and continues to consult on the Clock project, but he’s currently the Director of Long-term Futures at <a href=""https://automattic.com/"">Automattic</a>. That’s almost 30 years where his efforts had been focused entirely on long-term thinking, AND doing so by engaging in or starting <a href=""https://longnow.org/projects/"">numerous projects</a>. The <strong>Rosetta Project,</strong> for instance, is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages. <strong>The Manual for Civilization</strong> is a set of 3500 books that would help restart civilization (in case things go awry). I’ve attended numerous talks at the events they set up, and visited the Interval, a lovely bar they built that serves as both a place for drinks and a community space.</p><p>All of these projects are impressive individually, but together they form a collective to support the idea that we humans need to think about the long-term.</p><p>Among these projects is <strong>The Clock of the Long Now</strong>. What is that? Well, it’s a clock designed to function for 10,000 years (or more) that is, “An immense mechanical monument, installed in a mountain, designed to keep accurate time for the next ten millennia. The 10,000-year clock is hundreds of feet tall, engineered to require minimal maintenance, and powered by mechanical energy harvested from sunlight.” Its purpose? The official answer is: “The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.”</p><figure><img alt=""This is the face of the Clock of the Long-Now. It provides an account of time around its outer rings, but it has a kind of Steampunk aesthetic that reminds one of space and but also of mechanical things."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hfcqD676bCvqZbJHc7XDrA.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Clock face of the Clock of the Long Now. Credit: Rolfe Horn, courtesy of the Long Now Foundation <a href=""https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-clock-of-the-long-now/"">https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/the-clock-of-the-long-now/</a></p><p>It reminds me to take a longer view of things. Not all things, of course, but for those things that require long-term thinking, the clock<em> </em>is a persistent reminder that some things take a long time. Like the Redwoods I planted in my backyard — inset pictured above.</p><p>Also, it’s arguably the equivalent in terms of human achievement to Stonehenge or the Pyramids. <strong>Wow!</strong> <br /> <br /> I reached out and had a lovely conversation with Rose.</p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>Tell me about your background.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I grew up on the Sausalito waterfront in what was literally a junkyard with a bunch of hippies and artists. I grew up building things and basically wanted to be an inventor, but inventor schools don’t exist, so I thought Architecture was the way to go. I realized it wasn’t for me, and found Industrial Design at Carnegie Mellon. It’s one of the oldest programs in the country, and when I joined, I was very much looking forward to it being hands-on. When I started, they’d hired a new Dean who was very much into rhetoric, so after arguing with him on a relatively constant basis, he bumped me forward a year, and my degree took three years. I graduated in 1994. Afterwards, I moved back to the Bay Area and worked for LucasArts and Chrysler.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Me too. I also have an Industrial Design degree, but started working on web stuff when I moved to the Bay Area. What got you into the Long Now work?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I had been through a few cycles of the game development, and the days were long, but then we’d ship, and then nothing. They don’t need you at all, like a movie production. So I reached out to Stewart Brand, whom I knew growing up, and he told me about the conversations he was having around Long-term Thinking. That we’re living in a world that has long-term consequences like climate change, hunger, education…you name it…but our mechanisms aren’t set up to handle them. Strangely, benevolent dictators do this better, but those are few and far between.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Super few of those on the benevolent front, yeah. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yes, and Democracy, with its four-year election cycle, is particularly bad at this. How do you incentivize lawmakers to care about something 20 years from now when they won’t get the credit for it? Stewart introduced me to Danny Hillis, who started Thinking Machines…</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I worked for Brewster Kahle, who worked for Danny!</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right, so that’s how you ended up with our mutual friend at Burning Man in ‘99.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s right. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> So Danny Hillis is a computer scientist out of MIT, and he wrote an article for Wired in 1995. In it, he outlined his <a href=""https://www.wired.com/1995/12/the-millennium-clock/"">idea for the clock</a>. He and a number of people had been cooking up the Long Now Foundation through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Business_Network"">Global Business Network</a>. Steward set me up with several interviews, one that eventually led to the game company Blizzard, and the other was with his own newly founded project, Long Now. Even though the gaming industry offered more money, I really liked the idea of a 10000-year clock. I joined in 1997.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I know the Long Now Foundation has worked on a bunch of things, and not just the clock, but can you give me a brief background on the clock?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We built the first prototype that we took to TED. It debuted on New Year’s Eve 2000 in the Presidio at the Internet Archive offices, and then we shipped it to the <a href=""https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co531554/first-prototype-of-the-clock-of-the-long-now-1999"">Science Museum in London</a>. Then we built two more, one at the Interval in San Francisco and one for Nathan Myhrvold. I’d met Jeff Bezos at TED after he funded another one of our projects called Long Bets in 2001, and then he and Danny became friends. He was scouting sites for Blue Origin and came to our Nevada site for the clock, and we hiked together, and we all became friends. Bezos offered to fund the full-scale clock at a site he had in Texas, as the site we were looking to use in Nevada had several environmental challenges around access and elevation. Concurrently, many other projects were happening at Long Now. The Rosetta project, The Interval I mentioned, all the talks we’ve had. So now, we’re close to finishing many aspects of the clock, and I realized I didn’t want to administer a non-profit or raise money for the rest of my life. So I started doing research into how to hand off this first generation of work and create something multi-generational.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I read the <a href=""https://longnow.org/clock/faq/"">2024 Hillis FAQ</a> on the Clock. Where are you now?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Well, everything is installed. The clock is made up of modules stacked up 500 feet high, and while each module worked, we hadn’t had the whole thing assembled, so that’s what’s happening now. There are still some details to be dealt with, which we will hopefully be able to talk about soon.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Hillis mentions in the FAQs that it’s a work in progress.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yeah. There are a couple of things that will be left undone on purpose, but we’ve provided a kind of API, as it were. There are these anniversary chambers that are driven by the clock…an annual, a decade, a century, a millennium, and a ten-millennium one. The first has been commissioned, and we will hopefully do the decade one, but we’ll leave the others for future generations.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s really interesting. I read recently that the best way to think about the future is to establish institutions that will address the future, and yet our current regime is trying to dismantle the future as fast as it can.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The pendulum of justice usually swings in the right direction. :)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> The moral arc of the universe…</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We have these times that are tough to live through for sure, and they can take a very long time, but we hope that’s not the case. We might lose some stuff along the way, and then we’ll have to recreate those things.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> A super smart Designer I know, Bob Baxley says, “Look, they’ll destroy and the younger generation will build,” so he’s got a really hopeful view.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> If there’s one lesson that I got out of Long Now and studying long-term thinking, it’s that the very best way to think long-term is to give more optionality to the future. That you’re trusting the future to have more information on their present than you could project onto them from the past. They are going to make better decisions unless you have taken away their ability to make a decision. If you chop down all the old-growth redwoods, no one ever gets to decide about old-growth redwoods again for a thousand years. This is why the Pace Layers diagram is really good. If you’re chopping down these Redwoods and you’re doing it on the commercial layer. In that case, you’ve skipped Governance and Culture (and of course Nature — SIDE NOTE: If you’re unfamiliar with <a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">Pace Layers</a>, go check it out. Rose drew the diagram we’re all familiar with as an expression of Brands and many others’ thinking.)</p><figure><img alt=""Pace Layers is a diagram that depicts a series of curved lines vertically oriented (almost like a closeup cross -section) with a series of labels from top to bottom showing Fashion (with an additional squiggly line), Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, and Nature — each with an arrow moving off to the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IiD6hj6_X7FaD7mYaLUcNA.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of Pace Layers</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/</a></p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Does trust play a role here?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Absolutely. It’s about trusting the future, but it’s not what’s happening in our legislature right now. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the US Constitution) is excellent because they’re short. They’re principles to follow, rather than the 1000 pages of laws that no one reads.</p><p>(for example, the First Amendment — Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> They’re almost memetic representations. It’s a shame that some folks have boiled down the Second Amendment to “Don’t take my guns,” and it’s an easy thing to repeat.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> It’s a good example because they (the founders) should have left it more open to the principle and not about the object — the people should be allowed to defend themselves and leave that open to interpretation because what they didn’t know is that there’d be, you know, ICBMs and tanks. A lot fewer people would be dead.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s true, and that mentality just seems so hopeless. You touched on this a moment ago, but do you think Designers should have hope? For instance, in a hopeless scenario where the clock, situated in Texas, gets lost because Texas becomes a battleground…have you thought about that? Are you hopeful that it gets found again?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We designed it to be lost and found for sure, both in the way that it keeps time and has power that it can harvest from the temperature difference. It does more things when people are there, but when they’re not there, it conserves that energy of showing you the time and chiming and things like that. Some of the most successful stories of things lasting a long time are things that are lost, like the Dead Sea Scrolls. If they’re not lost, their chances of surviving sometimes go down. We chose its location based on it being far from human populations, so it is out of the path where humans may destroy and rebuild on a regular basis. We also put it where it’s nowhere near minerals that people would find valuable.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I hope to visit someday. How has your thinking about time generally changed over the course of your career?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I’m always kind of looking for a long-term angle on just about anything that I work on and that I think about. In some cases, it’s also discerning what doesn’t need to be thought about long-term and what should be ephemeral. Not everything needs to be long-term. Art and fashion need a lot of space to be ephemeral and playful. On the other hand, organizations like the WHO, which have been around for 40–50 years, have just gone through their first modern global pandemic, but they don’t seem to be well-positioned to provide all the data gathered and lessons learned for another one. They seem highly politicized and defunded. It’s sad, too, that the CDC is getting decimated. We’re in a position for the first time where we can share information instantly and broadly, and redundantly. We have the ability to gather data and collect data even when people are locked down, which didn’t happen during the Black Plague.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Or even the 1918 Flu Pandemic.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right. Neither situation had the means to understand what was going on globally. Even worse, is that we have European numbers on deaths but little information on African lives lost.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Switching gears a bit, can you talk about AI and its potential to help with long-term thinking?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The first time I remember it coming up was in a digital preservation conference we had back in ’98. It was actually <a href=""https://www.jaronlanier.com/"">Jaron Lanier</a> who said, “You know what would be a great use for AI is basically little agents that exercise boring data. Everyone’s preserving all the video games because they’re fun, but who’s preserving WordPerfect 2.0 and knowing if it’s not working on a current system?”</p><p>I don’t think that AI is going to be as destructive as many think. I think it’s going to cause a lot of differences, but I’m certainly not a big doomsayer about it.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> If we’re engaged with spectral thinking, AI exists on that spectrum. There will be bad actors who do horribly evil things, there’ll be some really, really cool advancements for humanity and society, and everything in between. It will take some jobs and create other jobs. There will be a shift.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> When people started freaking out about AI taking jobs was exactly when AI could start taking journalist jobs. Automation has been taking jobs for a long time…a dishwashing machine in a restaurant took a dishwasher’s job. Dishwashers are like the first robots, but no one cared because doing dishes was a chore, and dishwashers had no agency. But the day that ChatGPT could write an article better than about 75% of writers, the journalists all freaked out, and then they wrote a bunch of articles. When DALL-E came out, I saw real problems coming for the illustration market.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I teach over at California College of the Arts, and the Illustration Department in particular is very upset about AI. But it’s just one perspective. When <a href=""https://www.pentagram.com/about/paula-scher"">Paula Scher,</a> a Pentagram Partner, is willing to train an AI with an illustration style to generate hundreds of icons for <a href=""http://performance.gov/"">Performance.gov</a>, I appreciate her efforts to embrace the new tools, although she took a lot of shit for it. I think it’s going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride for a while. <br /> <br /> Listen, thanks very much for your time. I realize how valuable it is.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Happy to speak to you. Thanks.</p><p>After we spoke, I dug up the earliest reference to what would become the Long Now Foundation and the clock in an article by Hillis.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of a photo I took of the Wired Scenarios article from Danny Hillis. The quote that is most completely pictured here is: “I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oak. I have hope for the future.” — Hillis (1995)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5tsO1KCEOtjLUx7XkwLrbQ.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of Wired Scenarios from the library of the California College of Arts taken by Dave Hoffer</figcaption></figure><p>Several things struck me:</p><p><strong>Conception</strong><br /> <br />Hillis talks about conceiving of the clock, and he says,</p><blockquote>“My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, <a href=""http://www.well.com/user/sbb/"">Stewart Brand</a>, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It’s a Rorschach test — of time. <a href=""http://www.geffen.com/gabriel.html"">Peter Gabriel</a>, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist <a href=""http://www.spies.com/Eno/Enohome.html"">Brian Eno</a> felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now.”</blockquote><p>That’s a really good list of people to speak with about an endeavor like this.</p><p><strong>Execution</strong></p><p>Hillis talks about what it means to build such a clock and its longevity. Corrosion and power sources were actually less of a concern to him than people, as the real problem. What if, for instance, it lasted 500 years but was lost? Those who found it cared more about the metal that it was made of and scrapped it for parts.</p><blockquote>“In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last.”</blockquote><p>People’s construct of time has lasted a great deal longer than most clocks. It’s the ideas (bits) that last. Hillis is friends with Teller (of Penn and Teller), who suggested that Hillis film a documentary, establish the idea that the clock exists, but never really build it. Teller’s career was built on misdirection, but it’s an interesting take on longevity. Create the idea, not the actual clock.</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>What struck me the most was how Hillis ended the article:</p><blockquote>“I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future.”</blockquote><p>I’m with Hillis on this. I planted Redwood trees in my backyard, and I know I’ll never live to see them grow huge, but we have to have hope for the future, despite how bleak things look right now. Earlier in the article, Hillis talks about what the future might hold.</p><blockquote>“The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand.”</blockquote><p>Certainly, no one foresaw the place we’ve arrived at in this, our future. The English expression (misattributed to an ancient Chinese curse) — May you live in interesting times — seems especially significant. <br /> <br /> And yet, I still have hope for the future. I hope you do too.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Tse, P.U., Intriligator, J., Rivest, J. <em>et al.</em> Attention and the subjective expansion of time. <em>Perception &amp; Psychophysics</em> <strong>66</strong>, 1171–1189 (2004). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844"">https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844</a></p><p>Inner Cosmos with David Eagleman — Does time really slow down when you’re in fear for your life?

<h4>What happens when systems decide the human is ‘all-knowing’</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover design with title, ominous, with illustrative eyes peering through fur"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hefC9NVYPmY91g01Rlsdeg.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Ever click a button and have a system misbehave with no warning, feedback, or a way to undo, only to feel the repercussions minutes or a few days later?</blockquote><p>This is what I’ve coined “Designing for Omniscience” (and the horrors thereof). It’s what happens when a system assumes the human on the other end is ‘all-knowing’ and proceeds in silence. This arrogance of finality can scar (or scare) and have real world consequences beyond the screen, and in some cases, can be catastrophic.</p><p>Many systems are accidentally designed to act with certainty. I’ll unpack the hidden ghosts of imperfection in interfaces we rely heavily on to handle our finances, ensure smooth healthcare transactions, make online purchases, and govern how we secure our homes and travel.</p><h4><strong>Horror #1: Design systems devoid of humanity</strong></h4><p>To be human is to make mistakes. But every product makes a choice: to create space for human error, or silently treat it as intent. What happens when systems act in such a way that the human is blamed for the system’s oversight? Earlier this month, I found myself in this scenario with a healthcare portal.</p><p>It’s common knowledge through our collective experience as patients that some medical software is a patchwork of older systems and code at best. Don’t be surprised if there are cobwebbed corners of COBOL, responsible for critical system functions behind the curtain in municipal and financial software that you rely on.*</p><p>Both healthcare professionals and patients who rely on these tools are forced to use software that feels like a journey to the infancy of the internet. Part of the problem is that the software is optimized for the larger healthcare company at best.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for one persona is twofold:</p><ol><li><strong>The system is developed for the licensee’s benefit. </strong>Designed for data compliance, billing accuracy, and liability management, leaving a gap for the lived experience of patients (not to mention the most vulnerable populations seeking care);</li><li><strong>The system is brittle. </strong>When those least equipped (elderly patients, caregivers, busy parents managing entire family care), must navigate these systems, errors turn into billing nightmares or missed care, creating unnecessary burdens due to a system that assumes the patient is all-knowing.</li></ol><p>For nearly a decade, I used a popular digital payment service for online transactions. Adding a virtual card as one of my payment methods in my healthcare provider’s portal, I wasn’t aware that the system would decline payment despite a funded checking account. There was no alert, warning, or feedback provided. I didn’t need to triple check on a card in the portal before payment, nor did I get a signal that anything could go awry.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HShv6TOVGz6_5_6yKSTeSg.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first time, I assumed a temporary glitch in the portal since I’d never had problems with utilization. A day after the 2nd decline, I received formal communication framing a routine billing issue in alarmingly severe terms. Later, I discovered, the system allows users to upload payment methods that it cannot always reliably process due to privacy and compliance regulations that virtual cards are not held against. The typical user will never have this knowledge.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V6hUMbausOtApDLuXmOt2A.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a result of “Designing for Omniscience.” The software introduces a lived experience with a horrifying threat for the end user by prioritizing transaction finality and legal defensibility over people and their well being. The most vulnerable populations won’t experience ‘Designing for Omniscience’ as minor bug but as a systemic failure, one with no business incentive to fix. It’s software built on the idea that the intended beneficiary is 100% responsible for an unvalidated click.</p><h4><strong>Horror #2: Granting unearned ‘God mode’</strong></h4><p>Imagine you’re facing the cockpit of a commercial aircraft. These systems are built on a design ethos that assists users in their decision making, and have set up parameters to check human choices given environmental factors. Now, consider for a moment, while activating another control, you accidentally activate the thrust reverser, a device that redirects engine power to slow down on the ground. Sensors confirm when they can be deployed on the ground, but if activated during flight, the system does more than display a warning; <strong>it prevents you from taking the action.</strong> The system design for aeronautics employs situational awareness and anticipates human error to protect everyone on board.</p><p>In 2021 a video-on-demand streaming service sent a blank test email, subject line: “<strong>Integration Test Email #1</strong>” to 6 million subscribers, bypassing the internal test list. The mass mailing was sent by an intern who likely received insufficient system feedback when confirming, with no perceived consequences before clicking “Send.” Ask any Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) about a failsafe, and they’d wax lyrical about the concept of a “Game day.” A simulation environment that enables practicing for disasters and the ability to run various tests in a controlled learning environment before an incident.</p><p>The company’s help team took to a social media platform and apologized for the incident, but called out its intern.</p><figure><img alt=""We mistakenly stend out an empty test email to a portion of our HBO Max mailing list this evening. We apologize for the inconvenience, and as the jokes pile in, yes, it was the intern. No, really. And we’re helping him through it. — @ hbomaxhelp"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bxk8JbL7TCnBvyskRB-7kw.png"" /><figcaption>Twitter post from June 2021</figcaption></figure><p>What they didn’t expect was thousands of industry professionals sharing their stories of mistakes made with the tools they use to carry out their jobs. Most related to posts confirming they too experienced poorly designed hands-off systems, treating the “Send” button as low, if not no friction. In this case, the software assumed the user understood the volume of the distribution list chosen and confidently didn’t need draft mode or a sandbox, following the send command.</p><p>Being able to select a full list of subscribers from a test account is nerve wracking; then to hit send with no fail safe, is a design flaw with rightfully placed anxiety on the user. Here, the system assumed a level of confidence in the intern, who likely hasn’t garnered this level of trust, yet was afforded an unusual amount typically granted a senior or seasoned manager driving a marketing platform.</p><p>Without parameters like role-based access control (RBAC), there’s a projected fallacy of perfect knowledge onto humans by software, giving free rein and superpowers over decisions that can cause a ripple effect of issues. Imagine a system design deciding that a newly onboarded user would never confuse a test for six million subscribers.</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch illustration of Twitter posts from tech professionals, filled with support."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZVX3rEU2zfaNJXCIMfWP5g.png"" /><figcaption>Support on Twitter from other tech professionals. <a href=""https://x.com/rakyll/status/1405752437286133760"">https://x.com/rakyll/status/1405752437286133760</a>, <a href=""https://x.com/carotechie/status/1406070141604052994"">https://x.com/carotechie/status/1406070141604052994</a>, <a href=""https://x.com/chorne_/status/1405917919108685825"">https://x.com/chorne_/status/1405917919108685825</a></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Horror #3: Speed over protection</strong></h4><p>Imagine navigating a workflow with a wall of input fields and checkboxes to complete a task involving enormous sums of money, with no final summary or warning about the large sum of funds about to transfer hands.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of the hired financial management software."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VU6ZQIYFjiwn1jhDHUqbCw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: United States District Court Southern District of New York 2021, Figure 1</figcaption></figure><p>Financial tools, if not designed with the end user in mind, can be a minefield of detrimental UX challenges. In 2020, a financial institution intended to make a $7.8M interest payment to its lender. The institution employs a loan operating system to handle its financial transactions. The software was older and inherently complex. The interface mistakenly allowed a wire disbursement to the full principal, shy of $900 million.</p><p>A built in pause: When purchasing my home, before receiving a cashier’s check for an amount that my financial institution saw as unusual for my spending pattern, they paused. Seeing the recipient was an Esq., they assumed it was for a home down payment. The banker asked if it was for a down payment, and gave me a surprising, heartfelt congratulations when I confirmed. This subtle, in person fact checking process was designed with humans and connection in mind to protect the individual and the institution. The banking software missed this layer of contextual awareness, and the opportunity to flag high stakes was missed. This pause can catch errors before they become legal pain.</p><p>The product teams designing <strong>against</strong> omniscience today,</p><ol><li><strong>Create a pattern of verifying </strong>and communicate with context. Affirming: “Are you sure? You’re sending an email to 6M subscribers” or “$900M will be funded toward principal. Is this information correct?” allowing multiple people to check the summary.</li><li><strong>Enforce awareness and constraint.</strong> Building safe systems that warn you and prevent errors before they happen. When enforcing constraints, the system is designed to collect data for improved contextual awareness and pattern recognition over time, circumventing a crisis.</li><li><strong>Allow for good service management.</strong> They know that not every user needs access to ALL commands. Approvals and governance give far more freedom, reinforcing a culture of psychological safety in organizations, big or small.</li></ol><p>Every system’s design pattern carries the weight of necessary decision making, a decision about who carries the burden of cognitive load. It questions, “Will this flow remove the final confirmation for powerful commands?” “Will every weighted command be granted by default?” “Can we give users a choice on which failures to silence?” When designing, diverse teams can choose differently, building systems that balance power, protection, and forgiveness, making the choice for more efficient and safe software. The alternative gears us toward a future in which the very technologies built to serve us, as we quickly make advances, create larger implications if they are designed to continue to see users as omniscient. That’s the greatest horror of all.</p><p>*<em>Source:<br /></em><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/new-jersey-seeks-cobol-programmers-to-fix-unemployment-system.html""><em>NJ needs volunteers who know COBOL</em></a><em>… (2020), + NYDOL<br /></em><a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-cobol-is-so-problematic-why-does-the-us-government-still-use-it/""><em>If COBOL is so problematic, why does the US gov’t still use it?</em></a><em> (2025)</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=557ba3ea60e4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-horrors-of-designing-for-omniscience-557ba3ea60e4"">The horrors of designing for omniscience</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We phrase them like traps and treat the answers as evidence. That hasn’t stopped us from talking about sensitive topics, but it’s made talking things out feel very performative.</p><p>For me, it’s raised a harder question: What does tolerance actually mean? Because those most eager to claim it might be showing us its limits.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 11. It’s on Karl Popper and why our ability to reason is losing ground.</em></p><h3>The paradox that defined an open society</h3><p>In the 1940s, Karl Popper was watching Europe fracture under ideologies that promised perfection. Fascism on the right… communism on the left. Each claimed moral certainty, each silenced dissent, and both produced the same result: <strong>ruin</strong>.</p><p>He also saw that when societies built on freedom fail, they fail because they forget how to defend that freedom, not because they lack ideals.</p><p>That distinction is important and became known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance""><em>Paradox of Tolerance.</em></a></p><p>If a society is endlessly tolerant (even of those who would destroy it) its openness becomes the weapon that ends it. However, if it fights back by becoming intolerant in its defense, it destroys itself from the inside.</p><p>You can see the paradox everywhere.</p><ul><li>Online communities that tolerate every voice until no reasonable ones remain.</li><li>Workplaces where “all ideas are valid” slowly turn into echo chambers.</li><li>Governments that either over-police or under-protect, losing legitimacy both ways.</li></ul><p>This is where constraints become useful. When disagreement has rules that keep learning possible, a system can stabilize. Remove those boundaries, and what’s left isn’t conversation, it’s noise. Really loud noise.</p><h3>Is conviction incentivized?</h3><p>Popper assumed reason would have home-field advantage. That people, given access to enough information and debate, would use both to get smarter.</p><p>He didn’t live to see a world where information moves faster than understanding. Where the desire for attention replaced the desire for credibility, and the platforms built to democratize truth started monetizing conviction instead of reflection.</p><p>The <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/"">open society</a> he imagined depended on friction which included time to debate and learn. As we know too well, the systems we built removed that. Attention has become a metric of truth and if you can move fast enough, well, that’s a pretty good <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">negotiation tactic</a>.</p><p>That’s when the result starts to feel predictable. Moral confidence will always outperform curiosity, and when belief spreads faster than anyone’s desire to verify it, conviction becomes a competitive advantage.</p><p>That’s a design flaw Popper didn’t anticipate: <strong>We built networks that prize the expression of belief but penalize the act of changing one.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Philosopher Karl Popper sitting outdoors at a table, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt, writing in a notebook with a pen.

That means a system designed to protect disagreement so reason could do its work. But somewhere along the line, tolerance stopped being a discipline.</p><p>Let’s look at where things are today. The people most likely to describe themselves as <a href=""https://www.freiheit.org/mexico/limits-tolerance-poppers-paradox"">“tolerant”</a> often carry the firmest moral boundaries. Their openness ends right where their convictions begin. They don’t enter conversations to be open or change. Instead, they enter to show that they don’t need to be.</p><p>You can hear it in how people with conviction build their case. They take a broad topic and zoom in until only a small part is emphasized. That part becomes the whole argument, which to them, feels very clear. That’s why conviction feels like clarity. It’s not a wide view, it’s actually very narrow.</p><p>This is how those exchanges feel when they unfold.</p><ul><li>Questions feel phrased like traps.</li><li>Answers are scored like confessionals.</li><li>Statement are weighed for moral correctness before they’re considered for meaning.</li><li>There is little desire to ‘abstract’ or take a broader view of a topic.</li></ul><p>That’s how tolerance turns into ‘armor’. It wears the language of inclusion but moves like a defense strategy. It’s not there to protect dialogue (or friendship… or relationships) it’s there to protect the person’s identity.</p><p>True openness means arriving without a verdict. If your moral identity enters the room first, your curiosity never makes it through the da*n door.</p><h3>The consequence</h3><p>Conviction is exhausting. It‘s angry.</p><p>I get it. People are passionate, they’re frustrated and feel unheard. And they’re right… a lot of people don’t want to talk to them any more.</p><p>But look, I usually don’t disagree with what’s being said, so it’s not because they’re wrong, it’s because every conversation is abrasive.</p><p>That’s what conviction does. It makes conversation feel like a sentencing.</p><p>Rational people disappear because that’s something they don’t want to deal with. To them, it’s about progress, not persuasion… and that’s a distinction that never seems to register.</p><p>They’re watching the same movie… they just notice different things. For them, it’s more about trying to understand how the scene fits into the plot.</p><p>Reasoning is endurance. They‘re happy to be in the room… they just don’t need to win it.</p><h3>My reflection</h3><p>We can each decide what kind of openness we want to practice… the decorative kind that performs virtue while closing their ears (la-la-la), or the difficult kind that listens without any sort of defense.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed reading about Popper. His stuff was meant to keep societies <em>thinkable, </em>which applies to every system we build.</p><p>The biggest lesson? Reason isn’t polite — but it’s generous.</p><p>If reason feels endangered, it’s because too many of us confuse certainty with strength… and mistake agreement for some sort of progress.</p><p>An open society (and an open mind) only survive the same way: by staying corrigible (Which means being open to being corrected).</p><p>That’s not a weakness.<br />That’s design, baby.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=518c42ec62be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-paradox-of-tolerance-518c42ec62be"">The paradox of tolerance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How the new Sora app icon gives away more than meets the eye.</h4><figure><img alt=""Sora App Icon: A Visual Breakdown"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h_U-o0S_igR0xLB9nQxcBg.png"" /><figcaption>The New Sora App Icon is Giving Away More Than Meets the Eye.</figcaption></figure><p>Two weeks ago we saw <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/797752/openai-sora-app-1-million-downloads"">the release of the new Sora app by OpenAI</a>. Unfortunately the app is only available in the US and Canada, and I’m in neither. Since I can’t use the app itself, I thought I’ll do a breakdown of what I can actually see — the app icon, it looks simple at first glance but it packs a lot if we can deconstruct it. I’m doing this breakdown as a fun exercise in design appreciation, I know my breakdown will probably not going to align with the authorial intent behind it. If you like this breakdown please share it, now let’s dive in.</p><p>These kinds of breakdowns are akin to exercises I used to do while earning my Master’s Degree in Visual Communications, they can be a lot of fun but they’re intended to reveal hidden truths or meanings lurking in plain sight. Seeing with our eyes is great but analyzing a visual component in a written long-form article tend to make us (or at least — make me) think a little harder, to notice the things I can feel when looking at a visual work, but don’t consciously see.</p><p>Breaking down Sora’s app icon will require some knowledge of what the Sora app is. Sora is a mix of a social video app, like TikTok, but all the content is AI generated videos, not unlike Midjourney’s Explore page.</p><p>The Sora app also has a feature called “cameo” where you can generate videos of yourself, or any other person who gave the app permission, could be your friends or could be celebrities like Michael Jackson or even OpenAI’s Sam Altman (who appears in many of Sora’s videos).</p><p>The generated videos are not more than 10 seconds long and rendered with both sound and a moving watermark, to make it harder to spread as real footage. The app itself is invite only right now, but will probably be available soon to everyone, with better and more precise rules and guardrails in place. Even though the app feels like TikTok and got a lot of comparisons to TikTok in both the traditional media and social media — its app icon is very different.</p><figure><img alt=""OpenAI Sora new website, screenshot shows 4 AI Generated videos."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMhzoToX8aixuIrFPpGpzw.png"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s Sora website — on the right side are 4 generated videos.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>The little cloud</h3><p>The most prominent element in the Sora icon is without a doubt the cloud in the middle. At first we can see by its shape and angle of rotation that this cloud is the same as the ChatGPT icon — OpenAI’s only app except Sora.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon, ChatGPT app icon and both overlayed on one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sZUSB5cki_xyNyb23vFeHA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left to right: Sora app icon, ChatGPT app icon, both icons overlayed.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The reason I started by calling it a “cloud” is that it looks kind of like a cloud since it’s floating in the sky. This also can fit the AI narrative of making everything, including videos, in the cloud (in the technological sense of clouds). Generated AI images are also often compared to humans looking at the clouds and seeing things, and in that sense it would be really easy to see a cloud in this icon too. But when I tried to compare it to other clouds iconography used by tech companies, something amazing happened- I realized it’s not a cloud at all.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PpcopKEAVo8yQaO0bvpmeg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the other “clouds” are flat at the bottom so the cloud can actually stand upright when left alone on a desk, like a computer would. This might be an intentional aspect of cloud computing since they are computers behind the curtains, after all.</p><p>The Sora icon is different, so it’s not a cloud, it can also reference a thought bubble in the style of comics, since they have no flat part. Notice that these bubbles are for thinking, not speaking.</p><p>The thinking behind this might be that Sora generates videos in the speed of thought, any video you can think of will be done in mere minutes. The only barrier now is your own imagination, or your thought process, just like the thought bubbles in comics that can only hold so much text. Also, both comics and AI prompts use text in a very similar ”conversational” manner, so it’s only natural to use it for this icon.</p><figure><img alt=""Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_DErPy0iu-bjGI7V1kODdw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At this point you might think sure I believe you it’s a thought bubble, but why does this bubble have eyes, well I’m getting to it.</p><h3>Smiling with your eyes</h3><p>First of all let’s get the obvious out of the way — the eyes make it seem like a friendly robot, signaling this AI is a friendly one. Sora’s AI is a cute little robot that just wants to help you be more creative and is capable of no harm (roll your eyes now, please).</p><p>Of course, that’s not the whole story, the eyes have little AI “sparkling” emoji, as we all know this emoji (✨) was intended to signal magical stuff but was hijacked by the AI industry to signal if anything has AI in it. Much like the AI industry highjacked all of our content and scrapped everything humans ever created- they also highjacked the icon to represent it (again, roll your eyes).</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an anime girl with sparkling eyes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FGJHCLSs7F2EYhoVhcAUMA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: Smile Precure!, スマイルプリキュア！ (Episode 35)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This emoji, like all original emojis, was first made by Shigetaka Kurita for SoftBank- a Japanese telecom company. Kurita itself was asked by David Amel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw""><em>YouTube link</em></a>) about the usage of this icon for AI features and he didn’t like it. Of course anybody can use any emoji but since its meaning was originally supposed to be something else and the literal father of emojis doesn’t like it, I’ll consider this emoji stolen because they highjacked its meaning.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from David Amel’s video showing him talking and two sparkling amojis signifying either magical things or AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ADT0DP5Uz6zR6_7Le47u4w.avif"" /><figcaption>David Amel Emoji video (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw"">YouTube Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To bring it back to the Sora icon itself, if we’ll look closely at the eyes we can see that it’s not eyes at all, it’s holes that we can see the background through. What can be the meaning of those “holes for eyes” face, well — first of all let’s explore the most simple answer. A face with holes for eyes is a skull, the eyes decay and we’re left with only the bones.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an Emoji skull."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*52WES-3a-DkiTiXOWW9kUQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon vs a skull (via Apple’s Emoji)</em></figcaption></figure><p>A skull is obviously a dead person, but it can also refer to pirates because of their flag, known as the Jolly Roger or simply as the “skull and crossbones”. Pirates can mean a few things in the software business, first and the most likely explanation here is a nod to the famous Steve Jobs quote “it’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy”.</p><p>The meaning of this quote is that it’s better to explore the unexplored than to act inline — since the discovery of the new will always happen by “pirates”. Steve Jobs apparently felt so strongly about this quote that he did decorate Apple’s offices with the Jolly Roger flag in his first run at Apple.</p><figure><img alt=""Young Steve Jobs and John Sculley standing in frond of an Apple-made Jolly Roger pirate flag."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3aD_OJbftxwqTxSoODN3TA.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Steve Jobs standing in front of Apple’s Jolly Roger flag.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of course we’re all thinking about the other explanation of a pirate flag in the software industry and that’s pirated software. Pirated software is what the software industry calls a piece of software that users share among themselves without proper licensing.</p><p>That was (and still is) a crime when people did that and some people even got sued or fined for it. But when big companies do that, like OpenAI and other AI companies it’s somehow not a crime and they get to be worth billions of dollars instead. So they do really get to be pirates.</p><p>Another popular entity with holes for eyes is the Golem. The Golem is a famous European Jewish myth about a clay creature that becomes alive when a wise rabbi does some magic to awake him. The magic this rabbi is doing is to carve a word into the Golem’s forehead, the word in this instance can be analogous to a prompt the AI needs to do its magic, to become “alive”.</p><p>Both AI and the Golem in the story are not really alive but rather have the illusion of being alive. The Jewish tale is meant to be cautionary, the Golem is becoming unstoppable and tries to upstage the rabbi, much like AI is threatening to upstage human workers in many different industries today.</p><p>If you don’t like this Jewish parable you can think of The Terminator instead, it’s also a man-made entity that, once built, we lost any control over it. The Terminator again looks like a skull and again has no eyes (only lights, much like the sparkling in Sora’s no-eyes), so it’s a good enough reference, although I prefer the Golem analogy. The Terminator is also regarded as a cautionary tale against the dangers of AI, of course.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to a statue of the Golem."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g_t9O3KNj1dY8W9Y0atZlA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon vs The Golem (statue in Prague, Czech Republic)</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Stars at night</h3><p>Sora’s icon is also interesting, it is a linear gradient transitioning from blue up to a very dark blue, it’s brighter at the bottom and darker at the top, it also have tiny lighter pixels on it, presumably like stars in the sky.</p><p>OpenAI, I think, picked a blue background for a few reasons, first and foremost it’s reminiscent of other “social” apps, much like Facebook, LinkedIn and the original Twitter app. The transitioning to the darker color is meant to signal that it’s a more modern social app like TikTok, Threads and X (new Twitter) which all share a black background.</p><p>The Sora app isn’t just a video generation AI model, it’s a social app designed to feel much like TikTok and in that sense, they were spot on with the background colors, they signal they’re a new kind of social app but with some respect, or a nod, to the past that started it all.</p><figure><img alt=""First row: Sora, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.

<h4>What impact does digitization of electoral process actually have?</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fALUsm56qBpcYPmPfWG2fQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer</figcaption></figure><p>The mayoral election is around the corner in my hometown of Montreal, so I wanted to confirm whether I was registered to vote at my current address. What I naively assumed would be a simple task turned out to require a trip to a local community centre. I gave my name, they flipped through a binder, and gave me the thumbs up within 3 seconds of arriving. It felt like the ultimate “this could have been an email” moment and I lost two hours of my day confirming something I should’ve been able to check online in those 3 seconds.</p><p>Technology isn’t a silver bullet, and I’m far from a techno-optimist, but it <em>can </em>be a powerful vector for improvement. When designed carefully, it can increase accessibility, surface critical information, maybe even make it easier for people to engage civically in this context. For a long time, I assumed the main reason we hadn’t digitized more of the democratic process was good old-fashioned bureaucracy, a sluggish, underfunded government with outdated tools. I held a fundamental belief that if we simply made it easier to vote by letting people cast ballots from their phones or laptops more people <em>would</em>! More access = more engagement.</p><p>So I decided to investigate some interesting examples of places where they’ve managed to digitize their electoral process and see what the results were!</p><figure><img alt=""Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Pnh_PCN3gDlRGcYk"" /><figcaption>Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad</figcaption></figure><h3>Markham’s digital experiment</h3><p>We’ll start with an interesting homegrown example. <a href=""https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/tech/consult&amp;document=p5&amp;lang=e"">In 2003, the City of Markham,</a> a suburb north of Toronto, launched one of Canada’s first pilot projects to enable online voting in a municipal election. The initiative was small at first but had the ambitious aim of testing whether residents could safely and securely cast a ballot from their home computers!</p><p>As is often the case with public sector innovation, the city didn’t have the money or in-house expertise to develop its own secure digital voting infrastructure so it turned to a third-party vendor called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytl"">Scytl</a>, a Spanish company that specialized in using cryptography to secure elections. The way the system works is each eligible voter receives a Voter Information Letter by mail, this includes a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN). Then during the advance voting period, Markhamians? Markhamites? People from Markham would go to Markham’s election website, hosted by Scytl, enter their PIN, and authenticate their identity with personal information (such as date of birth and postal code) matched against the city’s registry. Once verified, they could cast their vote through a digital ballot interface! And voila, the vote was then encrypted and transmitted to a secure election server, where it remained sealed until game day(election day).</p><p>Seems straight-forward enough right? And, cherry on top, according to city officials, online voting participation increased in each cycle, particularly among seniors and people with mobility limitations! But here’s the kicker: despite the relatively simple process, turnout didn’t budge. Most of the people who voted online were the same people who would’ve voted anyway.</p><p>Unfortunately, Markham’s experiment became a reference point across Canada informing other municipalities’ approaches to digital voting. Also more importantly, the third party system that Markham was relying on, Scytl, eventually filed for <a href=""https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200514/481138885893/scytl-sandton-capital-liquidacion-venta-negocio-juez-voto-electronico.html"">bankruptcy in 2020, citing over €75 million</a> in debt. Causing us to ask the question: what happens when the company holding your digital ballots no longer exists? Without money to invest in an internal system and having to rely on third parties, can be potentially devastating. What if Scytl had gone bankrupt, during an election? Needless to say, Markham no longer allows e-voting, which makes me e-sad.</p><figure><img alt=""ivote interface showing how votes could be stolen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I7c20DI7UwdOvEO3.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1504.05646"">A proof of concept, that shows the exploit against iVote to inject malicious code that would surreptitiously manipulate the voter’s choices</a></figcaption></figure><h3>When e-voting went wrong</h3><p>While Markham was a valiant attempt, it was small potatoes dealing with local politics and might not in and of itself be representative of the potential impact of online voting at a national level. So let’s look at an example of how things can go, very, very wrong and very right. Starting with the bad.</p><p>In 2015, New South Wales Australia rolled out the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05646?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">world largest ever e-vote</a> system called iVote. This system allowed voters to cast their ballots online during the state election. Again the goal was to increase accessibility for people with disabilities and those living remotely, while also trying to modernize the voting experience by letting people vote from personal devices.</p><p>iVote purportedly was actually quite a nice app and the user experience was smooth and intuitive. Public communication about this new way of voting was also strong, causing nearly 280,000 votes to be cast using iVote in that election! Trouble is, in the days following the election, some pesky independent researchers discovered <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22270-7_3""><strong>severe vulnerabilities</strong></a> in the live system. Among them: an insecure external analytics script that could have allowed attackers to intercept or alter votes, and a verification process that could be manipulated to provide false assurances to voters.</p><p>What’s worse, there is no clear evidence of tampering, but the possibility was there and because of this they will never try to pilot a program like this again. This may have very well affected who took office and the downstream impacts of that are no joke. The point of this example is to highlight what is at stake if the system goes south, or should I say New South (I’m sorry). In this case, there was no clear evidence of hacking but the vulnerability existed and may have been exploited to favour one candidate or another. With consequences this high, how important is the convenience of voting online in contrast?</p><p><a href=""https://www.innovationaus.com/ivote-written-out-of-nsw-law-as-digital-voting-review-begins/"">iVote was quietly shelved</a> in the years that followed. They had lost the trust of the public despite a lack of evidence of hacking and what began as a promise of a modern democracy ended up as a prime example of how important security is in this conversation. The lesson from New South Wales is clear: building digital voting systems isn’t just about making them easy to use, it’s about making them impossible to doubt. And that requires more than good design. It requires deep, structural transparency, independent oversight, and a willingness to stop and re-assess when trust begins to weaken.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Estonia’s digital ID card"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wds6woYpODxmW6Pv.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of Estonias Digital ID card</figcaption></figure><h3>The shining beacon of Estonia</h3><p>Lastly, I’d like to pull up the most frequently cited example of a successful techo-democracy. Estonia! A small but mighty nation that is often on the cutting edge. They were the first country to launch internet voting at a national level in <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4343374.stm"">2005</a>. Their system called i-voting, allowed citizens to cast their ballots online from any internet connected device, for both national and municipal elections. When it initially rolled out, online adoption was around <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">2%</a> in the first year but it has since climbed to over <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">40%</a> of its population using online voting.</p><p>But, the reason this is possible is because unlike most countries, Estonia had spent the prior decade building a national digital identity card. This is a critical part of the puzzle unfortunately, and it’s what allows their digital voting program to be so successful. They already use their digital ID’s to file taxes, access their own medical records, and sign legal documents. So when the opportunity came to use this same, state-backed secure authentication method, it was a no brainer. They had the full infrastructure to roll it out.</p><p>Their i-Voting process is built for security and usability. Voters insert their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card"">digital ID card</a> (or they can use a mobile app), log into a government portal, and are presented with a digital ballot. Once completed, their vote is encrypted and then sent to a secure server. To guard against coercion or vote buying, voters can re-vote multiple times online. This protects against a common concern people have in e-voting, which is buying votes! Only their final submission is counted. And if someone chooses to vote in person on election day, it overrides any previous digital votes. Pretty ingenious.</p><p>Crucially, Estonia’s system includes end-to-end cryptographic verification. Voters can use a smartphone app to verify that their encrypted ballot was received and counted as intended without revealing who they voted for. The entire system is publicly audited, with detailed post-election reviews conducted by independent experts.</p><p>The Estonian system really is as good as it gets when it comes to a thoughtful, comprehensive and secure approach to digitizing democracy, and because of its long history it also offers us some concrete data on what effect digitization has on voter turnout. So here it is: 0.2 to 0.8 percentage points. That’s it. From 2005 to 2025. The painful truth is that if you’re looking to get more empowered citizens, focusing on access to voting is actually the last step in the process.</p><p>There are tangibly good reasons to invest in e-voting and they genuinely matter. From an accessibility standpoint alone, giving people with reduced mobility the ability to vote independently and securely is a powerful step forward. That, in itself, is worth the effort.</p><p>But if the goal is to dramatically increase engagement, we’re nowhere near a solution and I’m confident that the solution won’t be a purely technological one. What I uncovered is, if you care about people voting, it’s clear that access, especially technological access, is not the main bottleneck.</p><p>We need to stop obsessing over the ballot interfaces and start asking harder questions. Why don’t people vote in the first place? What would make them want to?</p><p>That’s where the real design challenge lies and that’s where we should be putting our energy!</p><p>P.S Don’t forget to vote in your next election</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cfd6674465a2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/can-technology-fix-voting-cfd6674465a2"">Can technology fix voting?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

This time, I brought this vision to life using <strong>Code Connect UI </strong>and its improved features like component mapping and MCP instructions.</p><p>In this article, I will share how I built an AI-ready workflow using agentic CLI tools like <strong>Claude Code</strong> and <strong>Codex CLI</strong>, combined with <strong>Figma</strong> <strong>MCP</strong> and <strong>Code</strong> <strong>Connect UI</strong>, to turn high-level prompts into production-ready code that directly reflects my design system and codebase.</p><h3>From Cursor to agentic CLI tools</h3><p>Cursor was my first real look into what AI-assisted coding could look like. But soon after, agentic CLI tools like Claude Code came to play offering more control and capabilities, making AI integration into traditional workflows more efficient than any other IDE plugin ever did before.</p><p>I began exploring Claude Code and Codex CLI, two command-line tools from <strong>Anthropic</strong> and <strong>OpenAI</strong>. Both can run locally inside a terminal or IDE, with immediate access to their respective models, and integrate with MCP<strong> </strong>Servers for external tool access.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex CLI terminal screenshot: A screenshot of a terminal running Codex CLI.

While IDEs act as middlemen, translating user requests through APIs or extensions, agentic CLIs connect directly to the models themselves, making interactions faster, more contextual, and more reliable.</p><p>This direct connection enables a truly agentic experience: Claude Code and Codex CLI don’t just respond to prompts; they reason, plan, and adapt within a project.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison diagram showing how AI-powered IDEs like Cursor and VS Code communicate with Claude through intermediary tools versus how Claude Code connects directly to the model.

One of them was a more user-friendly way of interacting with Claude Code on VS Code without the terminal.</p><figure><img alt=""VS Code with official extensions: A view of Visual Studio Code with two panes.

One where every color, type, scale, and component carries the same meaning in both Figma and code. Then, use that shared structure to build production-ready prototypes from simple prompts or wireframes.</p><p>To achieve this, I aligned Figma variables with CSS tokens, ensuring MCP Server, Claude Code, and Codex<strong> </strong>CLI all spoke the same design language, starting from the foundations.</p><p>The result was:</p><ul><li>A design system perfectly aligned with code</li><li>React components mapped to their corresponding design versions using Figma MCP and Code Connect</li><li>Storybook documentation for all the components</li><li>A GitHub repository for traceability</li><li>An automated workflow process for orchestrating the agentic CLI tools running in my project</li></ul><p>Building around these foundations was crucial. At the end of the day, when design and code share the same language, designers and developers don’t have to make assumptions, and similarly, AI tools don’t have to guess.</p><h3>Preparing and organizing the Figma file</h3><p>What makes perfect sense for every product designer is <em>structure</em>. In any design system, structure defines clarity, and documentation defines purpose. Together, they form the bridge that helps both humans and AI make accurate decisions about how design maps to code.</p><p>The design foundations must be well-defined and closely aligned with code. In my case, the Figma variables were not only given a name, but they were directly mapped to their code syntax, which in this case were CSS variables. This mapping is essential not only for smoother collaboration between designers and developers but also for making AI workflows possible by reducing ambiguity.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma variables mapped to CSS tokens: A screenshot from Figma’s variables panel listing color variables (e.g., black, white, grey‑200) alongside numeric scales and mapped values.

Providing all this level of context also helps AI agents understand design intent more accurately and make fewer assumptions when it comes to decision-making.</p><figure><img alt=""Typography tokens: An image from Figma showing a table of typography scale variables.

From day one, I was impressed with how Code Connect integrated more seamlessly with <strong>Figma MCP</strong>, while also connecting to <strong>GitHub</strong> repositories, creating a stronger and more reliable connection between design and code.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Code Connect UI with GitHub: A screen showing Figma Code Connect UI for a checkbox component.

This way, AI agents can better understand how a component should behave, with custom instructions, and even apply specific code overrides without touching the source code — all within Figma.</p><figure><img alt=""MCP instructions comparison (before/after): Two side‑by‑side panels comparing a component before and after applying an MCP code override.

My goal wasn’t only to make Claude Code generate components from designs, <strong>but</strong> <strong>to reuse the proper tokens, syntax, and patterns that already existed in the codebase</strong>.</p><h4>Project structure</h4><p>I built a<strong> React + Vite</strong> codebase, structured around three core folders:</p><ul><li><strong>styles</strong>: with <em>primitives.css</em>, <em>semantic.css</em>, and <em>components.css</em></li><li><strong>components</strong>: where each component included its .<em>tsx</em>, .<em>stories.tsx</em>, and .<em>css</em> file</li><li><strong>pages</strong>: a directory used for testing prototypes</li></ul><p>I provided both primitive and semantic CSS variables to establish a solid foundation of design tokens. With the help of the Figma MCP Server, Claude Code was then instructed to populate the components CSS file and implement the corresponding React components by referencing and applying those variables.</p><h4>Working with Claude Code</h4><p>The best way to work with Claude Code is within an <strong>IDE</strong> such as <strong>VS Code</strong>, either via terminal or its official extension. That way, code changes appear directly in the IDE, even if it is running in the terminal.</p><figure><img alt=""VS Code terminal: A screenshot of a dark terminal within VS Code running Claude Code. It shows logs of tasks and the integrated terminal output while Claude Code executes commands"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DTvqCnVjRIj1MihjPpwtVQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Claude Code within the IDE’s terminal.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A key feature of Claude Code is its ability to run multiple agents at the same time to perform different tasks. That way, I didn’t have to restrict myself to working only on one task at a time, but run multiple instances simultaneously to tackle different ones or break a complicated task into smaller ones.</p><figure><img alt=""VS Code terminal: Side-by-side terminal windows in VS Code showing Claude Code and Codex CLI running simultaneously. The left panel lists design token variables from a CSS file, while the right panel displays Claude’s analytical output summarizing token counts and usage patterns.

It needs to always know how to perform a task and under what conditions. When it runs, it consumes both time and tokens, which can come at a cost (especially if you are using API pricing), so the goal is to optimize its workflow to always follow the shortest, most accurate route.</p><p>To do that, I created a centralized file at the root of my repository that outlined the project structure and defined how Claude Code should behave across the entire project when handling different tasks. These guidelines included information such as which MCP Servers and tools should be used, when to run verification checks on the implementation, which naming convention should be followed for new files, and other details.</p><figure><img alt=""CLAUDE.md files illustration: Illustration of a central yellow folder connected to three subfolders below it, representing an organized project structure.

These files became the governance layer of my design system, ensuring that every implementation went through structured verification before being approved, and specific steps were consistently followed. The <em>root</em> file defines the global steps, while directories like <em>styles</em> and <em>components</em> have their own localized rules.</p><p>This modular approach led to faster responses and better accuracy. Each directory had its own <em>CLAUDE.md</em> file with localized instructions, like defining the format of the output I expected to get from Claude when it performed validation checks on components:</p><pre>#### Component-Specific Matrix Examples:<br /><br /><br />##### Button Matrix:<br />| Element | Property | Default | Hover | Active | Focus | Disabled |<br />|---------|----------|---------|-------|--------|-------|----------|<br />| Container | Background | #123c80 | #0c2855 | #092341 | #123c80 | #b7b8b9 |<br />| Container | Border | none | none | none | 2px outline | none |<br />| Text | Color | #fff | #fff | #fff | #fff | #6f7071 |<br />| Icon | Color | #fff | #fff | #fff | #fff | #6f7071 |<br />| Icon | Transform | none | none | scale(0.95) | none | none |<br /><br /><br />##### Card Matrix:<br />| Element | Property | Default | Hover | Selected | Focus | Disabled |<br />|---------|----------|---------|-------|----------|-------|----------|<br />| Container | Shadow | sm | md | lg | outline | none |<br />| Container | Transform | none | translateY(-2px) | none | none | none |<br />| Title | Color | #3c3e3f | #123c80 | #123c80 | #3c3e3f | #6f7071 |<br />| Description | Color | #6f7071 | #6f7071 | #5b5c5d | #6f7071 | #b7b8b9 |<br />| Icon | Opacity | 0.8 | 1 | 1 | 0.8 | 0.4 |</pre><p>This analysis compared the styling consistency of components against their Figma versions, producing a matrix to help Claude identify discrepancies in structure or token usage with precision:</p><figure><img alt=""Claude’s output matrix: A terminal screenshot presenting Claude’s output matrix.

At times, it disregarded instructions or produced inaccurate results. Acknowledging this, I designed my agents and <em>CLAUDE.md</em> files with layered safeguards, ensuring reliable fallback mechanisms when things went off track.</p><figure><img alt=""Verify‑design agent results: A terminal output showing the verify‑design agent’s assessment of a button component.

They can plan and execute these tasks independently while the main agent continues focusing on the overall workflow.</p><p>When a subagent is invoked, it operates on its own isolated context window. Think of it like a workspace that includes only the information relevant to its assigned subtask. Once it completes its work, it returns a distilled summary of its findings to the main agent, which then integrates them into the primary context.</p><figure><img alt=""A flow diagram illustrating how Claude Code subagents operate.

Meanwhile, the main agent maintains a slightly expanded context window without becoming overloaded. It’s important to note that <strong>a larger context window doesn’t always mean better performance</strong>; it often leads to vaguer reasoning and a higher risk of errors.</p><h4>Optimizing the agents’ workflow</h4><p>Making it easy for the agent to understand when to split a task and which agent to invoke is crucial. In my setup, the root file lists all available agents, ensuring Claude is always aware of which one to use and under which circumstances.</p><pre>## Available Agents (Overview)<br /><br />1. **design-verification**: For verifying component implementations match Figma designs and use correct tokens<br />2. **component-composition-reviewer**: For component creation/modification with nested components<br />3. **figma-code-connect-generator**: For ALL Code Connect related tasks<br />4. **token-analyzer**: For analyzing component token usage patterns and optimization recommendations<br />5. **a11y-accessibility-orchestrator**: Main coordinator for comprehensive accessibility audits using Playwright MCP and axe-core<br />6. **a11y-wcag-compliance-auditor**: Specialized WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance testing and legal compliance assessment<br />7. **a11y-color-contrast-specialist**: Expert color contrast analysis <br />8. **a11y-keyboard-navigation-tester**: Comprehensive keyboard accessibility testing and validation<br />9. **a11y-screen-reader-tester**: Screen reader compatibility and ARIA implementation testing<br />10. **claude-md-compliance-checker**: MANDATORY final step for EVERY task</pre><p>All agents were assigned to distinct responsibilities and triggered under specific conditions or manually when needed. Certain rules were also established to ensure that Claude never skipped or overrode these validations.</p><pre>## Quality Gates &amp; Blocking Rules<br /><br />### Cannot Proceed If:<br />- design-verification finds violations (when applicable)<br />- component-composition-reviewer finds violations (when applicable)<br />- token-analyzer recommends changes (when applicable)<br />- Build fails<br />- Lint fails<br />- claude-md-compliance-checker finds violations<br /><br />### If An Agent Fails:<br />1. Fix ALL reported issues<br />2. Re-run the agent<br />3. Only proceed when it passes<br />4. Then run claude-md-compliance-checker</pre><p>At the end of each task, my <strong>compliance-checker</strong> agent ensured that Claude had successfully followed the workflow outlined in the root <em>CLAUDE.md</em>. If not, then Claude would iterate again, fixing all the flagged issues before marking the task as complete.</p><p>The <strong>design-verification </strong>agent also had another crucial role,<em> </em>continuously validating that all React components matched the original Figma designs.</p><pre>name: design-verification<br />description: Use this agent to verify that component implementations match <br />their Figma design specifications. This agent automatically extracts design <br />data from Figma, analyzes component implementations, and ensures proper design <br />token usage and visual property compliance.<br /><br /># Tool Restrictions<br />tools: [&quot;Read&quot;, &quot;Grep&quot;, &quot;Glob&quot;, &quot;WebFetch&quot;, &quot;mcp__figma__get_code&quot;, <br />&quot;mcp__figma__get_variable_defs&quot;, &quot;mcp__figma__get_screenshot&quot;, <br />&quot;mcp__figma__get_metadata&quot;]</pre><p>This system of subagents and automation turned my workflow into a self-regulating environment. The next step was to extend this framework with <strong>MCP servers</strong>, enabling my agentic CLI tools to operate beyond their local boundaries.</p><h3>Beyond local boundaries by integrating MCP Servers</h3><p>I’ve already mentioned the <strong>Figma MCP Server</strong> and how crucial it is for bridging design and code in my <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/designing-with-mcp-server-bridging-design-systems-and-ai-for-developer-friendly-prototypes-4f08b0a0881d"">previous article</a>. What unlocks Claude Code’s and Codex CLI’s potential even further is their ability to interact with a wider range of <strong>external toolsets</strong> to perform actions that were previously impossible.</p><p>By connecting them to multiple MCP Servers, my CLI environment became much more than a local sandbox. It could navigate, test, and verify components in real time on <strong>Storybook</strong>, or fetch design context directly from Figma, all within a single prompt.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram showing how Claude Code integrates with external tools via MCP servers. “Claude Code” sits at the center, connected to the “Playwright MCP” on the left and “Figma MCP” on the right. Each MCP lists its available tools — Playwright includes browser navigation and form tools, while Figma includes screenshot, metadata, and design context tools.

One way to provide Claude with feedback is by sharing a screenshot, asking for a visual misalignment fix. A better way is to let Claude experience the misalignment itself, opening the browser, inspecting the interface, and analyzing the issue in real-time.</p><p>This is one of the many cases where <strong>Playwright MCP</strong> and its browser-level tools allowed Claude to test component interactions, collect console data, or even simulate user behavior during validation.</p><p>Combined with Figma MCP and other integrations, these workflows become truly agentic and automated. Subagents can now run these tools independently to perform validation checks while pulling design context from Figma and behavioral data from the browser simultaneously.</p><h3>Exploring Codex CLI</h3><p>For my experiment, Claude Code acted as the builder, and Codex CLI as the reviewer. I initially started using Codex CLI to verify Claude Code’s implementation and plan fixes. It proved especially helpful for accessibility improvements and code refinement, often suggesting more consistent or efficient component structures.</p><p>At first, Codex CLI didn’t natively support the Figma MCP Server, so it could only access designs indirectly through Playwright MCP or shared screenshots. Despite that limitation, it achieved great results, mostly because the codebase was already well structured, and each React component was built using the correct design tokens, accurately reflecting the Figma original designs.</p><p>However, this changed recently since Figma MCP is now officially supported, allowing Codex CLI to access design data directly.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex CLI and Claude Code side‑by‑side terminals: Visual Studio Code showing two terminal windows side by side: the left terminal runs Codex CLI tasks, while the right terminal runs Claude Code, illustrating that both tools can operate concurrently"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gAzLbOcVr9AkTybifYku9g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Codex CLI and Claude Code running in parallel on separate terminal windows.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Which one to choose</h3><p>Although Codex provides tools and features similar to Claude Code, I found that each tool excelled in its own domain. Claude Code was better at structuring the project, setting up governance files, automating and defining workflows, while Codex CLI specialized in code refinement, improving readability, accessibility, and performance.</p><p>Both are also accessible through the web or their mobile apps, allowing you to connect to your GitHub repository remotely. They can answer questions about code architecture and implementation, fix bugs, and even start or manage coding tasks while you’re away from your laptop. Once Claude completes its work, you can review the changes, create pull requests directly from the app, and continue working from anywhere.</p><p>From my point of view, together, they formed a balanced collaboration: <strong>Claude Code defined the framework and logic, while Codex CLI perfected the implementation</strong>. This pairing turned my workflow into an iterative design-code cycle that continuously refined itself.</p><h3>From wireframes to prototypes</h3><p>Once code and design share the same foundation, prototypes stop being mere mockups; they become <strong>previews of production</strong>.</p><p>To test this, I decided to put my setup to the ultimate test: <strong>transforming a simple, hand-drawn wireframe into a working prototype with a single prompt</strong>. Both Claude Code and Codex CLI were asked to execute the same task, with the same prompt, wireframe, design tokens, and design system.</p><h4>The setup and wireframe input</h4><p>Both tools communicated with the same design file through Figma MCP Server, where each design component linked to its corresponding code implementation via Code Connect.</p><figure><img alt=""Code Connect snippet (React): A Code Connect panel containing a React code snippet for a Button component.

(GIF)</em></figcaption></figure><h4>The single prompt test</h4><p>To keep the comparison fair, I used the exact same prompt for both tools. The only variation was the phrase<em> “Ultrathink this task”</em>, added for Claude Code to activate its deeper reasoning mode. Everything else, from instructions to references, remained identical, ensuring the results reflected each tool’s true capabilities.</p><pre>Ultrathink this task. <br /><br />- I want you to implement the wireframe shown in [Image #5] as a new page <br />called ClaudeWireframeToPrototype, using our existing design system. <br />You must only use our current design tokens and components to recreate <br />this page.<br />- Do not rely on any previously implemented pages as a reference.<br />- You'll notice that the wireframe includes annotations to help you understand <br />the required components and specifications. For any elements that aren't <br />explicitly defined, use your judgment to apply the most appropriate existing <br />components or tokens.<br />- Capitalize all button labels and align their placement according to the <br />wireframe.<br />- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy across all UI elements.<br />- The page must be fully responsive, so make sure to implement responsive <br />breakpoints consistent with our existing patterns.<br />- You need to act as both a Senior Designer and a Senior Front-End Engineer <br />for this task. As a designer, carefully select the correct tokens and <br />components that align with our design system constraints. As an engineer, <br />implement the page using proper composition, semantic HTML, and the defined <br />tokens and components.<br />- Once the implementation is complete, use Playwright MCP tools to verify <br />button positioning, text capitalization, and visual hierarchy consistency. Fix <br />accordingly if any issues arise.</pre><p><strong>The goal wasn’t perfection; it was</strong> <strong>alignment</strong>. I wanted to see whether both agents could translate low-fidelity wireframes into a functional prototype using the right components and tokens.</p><p>Additionally, since these prototypes pull components and instructions directly from the codebase (or the Figma file), the resulting output wouldn’t just resemble production; it would be <strong>production-ready</strong>.</p><h4>Claude Code workflow</h4><p>Claude Code was the first to take on the challenge. I used its <em>ultrathink</em> capability and <em>plan mode</em>, allowing it to thoughtfully execute this task while separating research and planning from code execution.</p><p>Once the implementation was complete, I prompted it to use Playwright MCP Server to get visual context from its implementation and verify that everything was in place. It took approximately <strong>14 minutes</strong> to complete the implementation, resulting in a responsive behavior and proper use of components and design tokens such as typography, colors, etc.</p><figure><img alt=""Claude’s implementation result: Side‑by‑side image comparing the original hand‑drawn wireframe to the page generated by Claude Code. The final page faithfully reproduces the wireframe’s layout with a header, a grid of content cards, a contact form and a questions section, followed by a dark footer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Wz19fWi3x7mHYejMYW22Zg.png"" /><figcaption><em>A visual of the final result implemented by Claude.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Although the implementation looked great, there was an issue with importing the header component properly on tablet and mobile viewports. However, this got easily fixed with a simple prompt right after.</p><p>There was definitely more room for improvement; however, I only intended to test what the first iteration looks like with no major refinements or changes. For what it’s worth, <strong>it overall managed to pull the right components and use them as expected, delivering a satisfactory result.</strong></p><p>You can watch Claude Code working on this task as I recorded its progress and present it through this video:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/ba08873025d6b4e7b2e11278b8a1cb97/href"">https://medium.com/media/ba08873025d6b4e7b2e11278b8a1cb97/href</a><h4>Codex CLI workflow</h4><p>Next, I gave Codex CLI the same brief and design input. Codex approached the task a bit differently, being less conversational and more autonomous in its decisions.</p><figure><img alt=""Codex implementation result: Side‑by‑side image comparing the wireframe to the page generated by Codex CLI. The final page resembles the desired layout but adds unexpected category labels and descriptions above each section; the contact form layout differs slightly, and a dark footer appears at the bottom"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uWYR-ZelpF01WYvKKkg20A.png"" /><figcaption><em>A visual of the final result implemented by Codex.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Its process ran for about <strong>20 minutes</strong>, slightly longer than Claude’s execution. The outcome, however, wasn’t ideal. All sections included an unexpected category label above each title and a short description underneath. The contact form layout also deviated from the original wireframe, while the logo wasn’t imported properly, and several issues were spotted on the responsive viewports.</p><p>These were relatively minor issues that could have been easily fixed with a few additional prompts. However, I intentionally chose not to do that, as my goal was to test how both tools would perform under identical conditions using just one prompt. It’s worth noting, though, that in other tests I conducted, Codex produced much stronger visual results and more sophisticated code, particularly in accessibility and structural logic, where Claude occasionally fell short.</p><p>You can watch Codex executing this task in my video below:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/c67dee28e17e955b25e1919b23a241b5/href"">https://medium.com/media/c67dee28e17e955b25e1919b23a241b5/href</a><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>In this experiment, <strong>Claude Code delivered a stronger overall result</strong>, while Codex took a few initiatives when it shouldn’t have. That was not a deal breaker, but for this single-prompt test, Claude was the clear winner.</p><p>What truly matters, though, is what this workflow unlocks. By combining tools like <strong>Claude Code</strong>, <strong>Codex CLI</strong>, and <strong>Figma MCP Server</strong>, designers can now transform wireframes or Figma designs into interactive, production-ready prototypes.</p><p>This approach accelerates ideation, bridges design and engineering, and enables early feedback from stakeholders or even users on pages powered by real, working code.</p><h3>What’s next</h3><p>From my perspective, the next step is <strong>bringing generated screens back into Figma</strong> in a way smart enough to detect components from code, translate design tokens into variables, and replicate auto-layout behavior directly from implementation. It only feels like the natural evolution of this workflow, and I think we’re getting very close to it.</p><p>Most importantly, this experiment proved that <strong>AI doesn’t replace design; it complements it</strong>. It can safely become part of both the design and production workflow, not by generating random layouts or meaningless code, but by following specific guidelines defined by the designer.</p><p>What becomes really essential is the <strong>design system</strong> itself. Now is the time to invest in them, especially after Figma’s latest <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/schema-2025-design-systems-recap/""><strong>Schema 2025</strong></a> updates, including features like <strong>Extended<em> </em>Collections</strong>, <strong>Slots</strong>, and more.</p><p>At the end of the day, it’s up to each organization to decide how it wants to move forward. Some may prefer quick solutions that generate designs or prototypes detached from any codebase, while others, especially larger teams with established systems and legacy code, will benefit more from connected workflows like this, where AI integrates with existing infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Design systems are now at a defining moment</strong>, proving their value not only to humans but also to machines. Structure will always take time, and it’s not always appreciated since it’s invisible, but it remains a small yet crucial investment toward a much greater opportunity; one where AI aligns with both the designer’s and developer’s intent to produce maintainable code and realistic, production-ready prototypes.</p><h3>Thanks for reading!</h3><p>👋 I’m Iasonas, a Lead Product Designer, currently exploring how better tooling can bring design and development closer together.
