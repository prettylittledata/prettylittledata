<h4>How to build your design competence in the age of AI.</h4><figure><img alt=""The image shows a person opening a door, symbolizing the unlocking of new knowledge"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nfHFozEsJo7EVnuHv2KNUA.png"" /><figcaption>Unlocking New Knowledge. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Being a designer has always been synonymous with being creative, transforming abstract and complex ideas into concrete solutions. However, in recent years, many professionals have been losing this creative spark, and with it, the very essence of the profession. We’ve witnessed an exponential growth of artificial intelligence tools within the creative industry. This, in itself, isn’t a problem; the real risk lies in becoming dependent on these tools.</p><p>Abandoning your own creative capacity and relying on AI to generate design concepts or evaluate solutions is a mistake that can compromise your professional autonomy and creative confidence.</p><p>In this article, I want to discuss why you shouldn’t rely solely on artificial intelligence tools, but instead focus on building your intellectual foundation as a designer. This foundation develops through both theoretical study and consistent practice in real projects; over time, it becomes the cornerstone of your <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51038-1_36"">repertoire and professional competence</a>.</p><h3>How to build knowledge in design</h3><p>Before discussing knowledge in design, it’s important to first understand what knowledge actually is. According to the dictionary, knowledge is the act of knowing or the state of being aware of something, whether through reason or experience. This definition highlights three central elements that deserve attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Act of knowing:</strong> understanding a phenomenon — knowing what it is, how it works, and why it works in a certain way.</li><li><strong>Through reason:</strong> acquiring knowledge through reflection, study, and theory.</li><li><strong>Through experience:</strong> referring to tacit knowledge, which is built over time through practice and observation of reality.</li></ul><p>When we bring this definition into the field of design, <a href=""https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2267&amp;context=drs-conference-papers"">knowledge in design</a> means mastering the principles, philosophies, methods, and practices that help us to solve problems in a structured and creative way.</p><blockquote>In the context of interaction design or digital product design, the nature of this knowledge is particularly complex. There is no universal list of skills that defines a good designer.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/68e9c90252b3"">André Grilo, Ph.D.</a> (2023), addresses this issue in his <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379221346_Competencias_em_Experiencia_do_Usuario_no_Design_de_Produto_Digital"">doctoral thesis</a> when discussing the competencies of digital product designers. According to Grilo, the field still lacks consensus on which knowledge is essential, precisely because the discipline continues to evolve.</p><p>Even so, companies set expectations, anticipating that designers will perform certain activities and deliver specific results, which is often mistaken for actual professional knowledge.</p><p>This is where we need to be careful: a job description is not synonymous with knowledge. A job description talks about tasks; knowledge concerns the judgment, understanding, and autonomy required to execute those tasks with insight. As Grilo (2023, p.94) points out:</p><blockquote><strong>“There are some epistemological issues in UX Design (UXD) that, in my view, are unavoidable in this theoretical discussion. The first concerns the scope of UX Design, due to its wide range of responsibilities. The second revolves around the relationship of UX with diffuse problems. The third relates to the specificity of User Experience as a construct within the theory of Digital Product Design.”</strong></blockquote><p>Several authors have attempted to define what interaction design and UX are, as well as how the discipline is organized, including Garrett (2001), Saffer (2006), and Six (2010). However, most focus on describing the discipline and its connections with other fields, without clearly specifying the types of knowledge a UX designer must master to excel in their practice.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the famous diagram by <a href=""https://medium.com/u/534e55e898c0"">Dan Saffer</a> (2008). While it is useful for visualizing the intersections and scope of the discipline, the diagram by itself does not reveal anything about the types of knowledge and competencies required for the practice of an interaction designer or a UX designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the disciplines and interdisciplinary connections within UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lPHCuGVD-NU8jxal.jpg"" /><figcaption>Disciplines and Interdisciplinarity in UX. Source: Dan Saffer (2008)</figcaption></figure><p>It is common for designers to feel confused when it comes to professional competencies and skills. The question often arises: Should I know everything about visual design? human factors or usability engineering? This confusion is natural when there is no clear competency model to guide professional development in the field.</p><p>Sometimes, designers wonder which skills are truly necessary to work as an interaction designer or UX designer. There was a time when mastering tools like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash was enough to be considered a competent interaction designer or web designer. That period produced many excellent software operators, but not all of them were truly designers.</p><p>When many of these professionals were questioned about their design decisions, there was often surprise or even responses like: “Why do you want to know how I did it?” There has always been a certain mystery surrounding designers’ decisions. I believe this is, in part, one of the reasons why our relationship with other professionals, such as developers, has historically been complicated.</p><p>Being unable to justify a design decision is as incoherent as hearing a surgeon, when questioned about a decision during surgery, say that they don’t know or cannot explain. Yet, it is still common to find designers who cannot articulate the reasoning behind their actions, a clear sign of a lack of reflection and professional maturity.</p><p>Being a designer goes beyond knowing how to use tools. The new generation needs to be careful not to fall into the same trap, now fueled by the use of artificial intelligence. The risk is producing professionals who master prompt engineering but do not truly understand the problems they are solving.</p><p>Building knowledge in design requires practice, reflection, and purpose. I personally developed my competence by working directly in the discipline, learning from projects, mistakes, and discoveries, rather than relying on tools. A designer needs to know how to do something and, above all, know why they are doing it that way.</p><p>Every design decision needs to be intentional, never vague or accidental. Design is, by nature, an act of choice, and every choice reveals an intention, whether conscious or not. As I discussed in my article <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f""><strong>When intention drives design</strong></a><strong>”</strong>, designing without intention is like navigating without a compass: you may reach somewhere, but it is unlikely to be the right destination.</p><blockquote>Intentionality is what distinguishes the designer as an author from the designer as an operator. The former creates meaning; the latter merely executes commands.</blockquote><p>Therefore, to build knowledge in design, designers need to understand which competencies they need to develop. Theory can be useful for this, helping to cultivate what Schön calls <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection-in-action</a>, <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection on action</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">knowledge-in-action.</a></p><p>However, designers must not forget to apply their knowledge in practice, as this is the ground where understanding is validated and transformed. It is through practice that new theories emerge, new solutions are tested, and the designer truly becomes a reflective practitioner and creator of knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Types of knowledge in design</strong></h3><p>The types of knowledge in design vary greatly, depending on the professional’s experience and the context in which they work. For instance, a digital product designer working in the finance sector will have different competencies from someone working in healthcare, dealing with domain-specific challenges, regulations, and user expectations.</p><p>In the finance sector, there are mandatory trainings related to anti-money laundering, as well as regulations from the central bank, that drive the development of financial software, knowledge that a designer in the healthcare sector may not possess or need. Additionally, the design standards and UX practices applied in each sector are also completely distinct.</p><p>If we analyze the <a href=""https://elizabethbacon.com/the-ux-sundial-model-iterated-now-including-a-0/"">UX competencies</a> proposed by Elizabeth Bacon (2009), we notice a generalization that does not always reflect the reality of the designer. What the professional should know to move beyond tool proficiency and build true intellectual and creative depth.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the field of User Experience (UX)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*pUzMClic7_e2daTC.png"" /><figcaption>Field of User Experience. Source: Elizabeth Bacon (2009)</figcaption></figure><p>In the model, disciplines such as information architecture, service design, and interaction design are treated collectively, as if they shared the same set of knowledge. In practice, each of these areas has distinct philosophies, principles, and methods. Evaluating a designer’s knowledge based on such a generalized model can be problematic.</p><p>This reflection reinforces the need for each designer to build their own repertoire and develop critical judgment, adapting their knowledge to the real demands of the context in which they work, rather than relying solely on theoretical models. What will differentiate you from the majority is not following generic standards, but the unique knowledge that only you possess.</p><p>To explore this topic further, I recommend reading my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/becoming-good-at-something-619c1a61e924""><strong><em>“Becoming Good at Something”</em>.</strong></a></p><h3>The knowledge development model</h3><p>Considering the complexity involved in defining the types of knowledge a designer should possess, I propose that knowledge development in design should be structured into three levels: <strong>declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and reflective knowledge.</strong></p><p>This approach applies regardless of whether the professional works as an interaction designer, service designer, or industrial designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the knowledge model proposed by Filipe Nzongo."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AkNv8j4DyEYLAmw5Yyz9Sg.png"" /><figcaption>Knowledge model. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Declarative knowledge (knowing what)</strong></h3><p>Declarative knowledge refers to the factual information an individual possesses, including both general and specific knowledge about their environment. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00402-3"">Ahmet Demir <em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> explain that declarative knowledge relates to an individual’s understanding and intentions, which are crucial for problem-solving and decision-making.</p><blockquote>In other words, declarative knowledge is connected to the process of learning and recalling information that one already knows.</blockquote><p>Wikipedia provides a broader definition:</p><blockquote><strong>“Declarative knowledge is the awareness of facts that can be expressed through declarative sentences. It is also called theoretical knowledge, descriptive knowledge, propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. It is not restricted to a specific use or purpose and can be stored in books or computers.”</strong></blockquote><p>In my model, I start with declarative knowledge because it establishes the foundation upon which all other learning in design is built. If you want to work as an interaction designer, service designer, or information designer, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles of the discipline, such as typography, visual hierarchy, information architecture, usability heuristics, user-centered design, and so on.</p><p>This type of knowledge is crucial because it enables designers to understand the foundations of their discipline before advancing to specific skills, such as prototyping techniques or the use of generative AI tools. Without this foundation, any practice or decision risks being superficial or disconnected from the critical reasoning necessary to solve complex design problems.</p><p>In declarative knowledge, the focus is on understanding theory. For example, knowing that Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich created the 10 usability heuristics in 1990 for evaluating interactive products, or understanding what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">gulfs of execution and evaluation</a> are and their purpose in interface evaluation.</p><p>Furthermore, declarative knowledge serves as a reference for procedural knowledge (knowing how to perform tasks) and reflective knowledge (understanding why a design decision works or fails). It is the starting point for building repertoire and autonomy: knowing what allows the designer to understand the rules of the game before playing it creatively and strategically.</p><h3><strong>Procedural knowledge (Knowing how)</strong></h3><p>Procedural refers to knowledge that depends on a process, rules, or steps. According to <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/The_First_person_Point_of_View.html?id=-s7eoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Wolfgang Carl (2014)</a>, procedural knowledge, also called know-how or practical knowledge, is the type of knowledge that manifests in the ability to perform actions effectively, sometimes referred to as imperative or performative knowledge.</p><blockquote><strong>This is the second level of knowledge a designer needs to develop. The model is flexible and can be adapted to any design discipline, serving as a guide to structure learning, practice, and professional development.</strong></blockquote><p>In interaction design or digital product design, this knowledge is reflected in a designer’s ability to carry out concrete tasks, such as conducting a heuristic evaluation, designing user interfaces, prototyping, or organizing navigation flows. In other words, it is not enough to know the theory; one must know how to apply it in practice and demonstrate tangible results.</p><p>There is a fusion between knowing what (declarative knowledge) and knowing how (procedural knowledge), and it is precisely this combination that makes all the difference in a designer’s career. A professional who only masters the theory may understand concepts but will not be able to transform that knowledge into concrete solutions.</p><p>Let’s observe the sketch below, which I created as a simple concept to illustrate the importance of having both declarative and procedural knowledge. When a designer receives a sketch like this from a product manager or design director, they must be able to translate the conceptual idea into a real, functional design.</p><p>However, this transformation requires the designer to have strong declarative knowledge, in other words, a solid grasp of the theory that guides the design process. Being able to translate this sketch into a coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing interface is what separates a professional from an amateur.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept sketch for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iov5AtXIeY6CeXz8u0KeWQ.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, procedural knowledge complements this process by enabling the designer to execute the translation effectively, choosing the right <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples"">visual hierarchy, layout structure</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design_pattern"">interaction patterns</a>, and <a href=""https://improvement.stanford.edu/resources/usability-principles"">usability principles</a> to bring the concept to life. It’s not only about knowing what should be done, but also how to do it in a way that preserves both functionality and aesthetic integrity.</p><p>In practice, this means understanding how each design decision affects user perception and behavior, for instance, where to place primary actions or how to balance visual weight. These are not random choices; they emerge from a deep understanding of <a href=""https://dovetail.com/product-development/human-computer-interaction/"">HCI principles</a> and accumulated experience through continuous reflection and iteration.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to move from concept to execution, grounded in both theoretical and practical knowledge, is what defines true design mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_o7AlwYIRI_V0cgklhWvxw.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The concept above encapsulates several design principles, such as <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/"">chunking</a>, where information is divided into clear, logical sections; <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOoqWJmStmoUZ-85rWbwVkVpfVIiBBSNFcbYNlrIr0FqiSThc9iOV"">Gestalt principles</a>, where related elements are positioned close to one another; and contrast, achieved through the use of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/"">visual hierarchy</a> to guide the user’s eye. I also applied alignment to create order and readability, and <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?srsltid=AfmBOophvmeT4OhmzUA4AXQ7OPiDZioAFQb3h6bbLcgHlm8YZ7vdEiCI"">white space to reduce visual clutter, improve legibility</a>, and allow the eyes to rest during scanning.</p><p>Additionally, the design adheres to good practices from Nielsen’s usability heuristics, such as prioritizing <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/"">recognition over<em> recall</em></a>. For instance, using logos (“FedEx,” “UPS,” “Sedex” etc.) instead of plain text makes it easier for users to recognize and select an option quickly.</p><blockquote>An interface is never just a simple arrangement of elements; it embodies a series of reflections and intentional decisions made by the designer to make it what it is.</blockquote><p>Through this example, I aim to demonstrate that being a designer extends far beyond knowing how to operate tools; it’s about understanding the rationale behind every design decision and the purpose of the proposed solution.</p><h3><strong>Reflective knowledge (Knowing why)</strong></h3><p>Reflective knowledge is the ability to understand why we are approaching a design problem in a certain way. It goes beyond knowing what (declarative) and knowing how (procedural); it involves understanding the reasons behind choices, anticipating consequences, and adjusting decisions based on context and experience.</p><p>Donald Schön calls this <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">reflection-in-action</a>, which is real-time thinking during the execution of a task, when the designer observes, adjusts, and decides while acting on the problem. He also describes reflection-on-action, which is the retrospective analysis of what happened after the action, allowing one to learn from experience and improve future design decisions.</p><p>In the design context, professionals are constantly alternating between these two modes of reflection. When testing an interface, for example, a designer immediately evaluates the impact of a change (reflection-in-action) and later revisits the process to understand what worked or didn’t, and why (reflection-on-action).</p><p>This continuous cycle builds repertoire, strengthens critical judgment, and enables designers to make informed decisions without relying exclusively on external tools, such as AI.</p><h3><strong>AI is an ally, not a substitute</strong></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a widely discussed topic among designers. Yet, the question that arises most often is: <strong>Will we be replaced?</strong> It’s still too early to give a definitive answer.</p><p>Although the exponential growth of generative AI worries many designers, it’s important to emphasize that it is an ally, not a replacement for human competence. We still master our craft. This isn’t the first time designers have faced new technologies, and adaptation has always been part of the discipline’s natural evolution.</p><p>When I say AI is an ally, I mean it can be great for accelerating repetitive tasks, organizing information, or generating initial design alternatives — but it doesn’t guarantee creativity or critical judgment.</p><blockquote>A designer’s judgment is grounded in declarative, procedural, and reflective knowledge — the foundation of their professional repertoire.</blockquote><p>This repertoire enables designers to perceive nuances, prioritize problems, and propose appropriate interventions. AI, no matter how advanced, lacks this repertoire: it doesn’t <em>see</em> the interface the way you do, nor does it understand the intention behind your design choices.</p><p>In my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-can-humans-and-intelligent-computers-work-together-d349328ce270""><strong>How can humans and computers work together</strong></a>, I discuss how our relationship with intelligent machines should be one of mutual support, not dependence.</p><p>What new-generation designers must be careful about is becoming overly dependent on AI. My appeal to designers is this: let’s not outsource our cognitive capacity. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">Research shows that excessive reliance on AI can lead to dependency and a reduction in cognitive ability.</a> Moderation is always essential.</p><p>In the past, when I worked as a graphic designer, even though there were plenty of websites offering graphic bundles and mockups, I made a point of creating my own. For a simple reason: knowing how to make something is better than just using something ready-made. Moreover, creating your own assets helps you stand out; it’s what builds repertoire, practical skills, and professional identity.</p><p>For digital product designers, for example, AI can generate a list of applicable heuristics, but it’s up to you, the designer, to actually evaluate the interface: to identify which heuristics have been violated, which have not been met, and from there, propose solutions to address the interface’s problems.</p><p>Without the kinds of knowledge I described earlier, you won’t be able to spot flaws, let alone suggest improvements, much like trying to judge a case without knowing the laws that govern it.</p><p>Learn to evaluate an interface like a specialist. That’s what allows you to grow as a professional and develop practical, <a href=""https://design-instability.com/tacit-knowledge-and-skills"">tacit knowledge</a>. A designer must be capable of tackling the problem in front of them, not through external tools, but through the knowledge developed over years of study and practice.</p><p>Your intellectual repertoire grows through practice, study, and reflection. Every interface you evaluate, every prototype you test, every design decision you discuss with peers, all of it contributes to building your judgment. This accumulation of experience is what turns information into applicable knowledge, not just data that can be fed into a machine.</p><p>A designer cannot expect AI to do everything for them. They must build their knowledge through study and hands-on experience — collaborating with other professionals, both more and less experienced. Use AI as your creative ally, not your crutch.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>To conclude, the message I want to leave for designers is that, in the age of AI, what will truly set you apart in an increasingly competitive market is your intellectual capacity. Building knowledge is more important than mastering tools. New technologies come and go, but knowledge remains. Knowing how to create, thinking critically, and reflecting on your own work are values no one can take away from you.</p><p>What distinguishes an excellent designer from an amateur is not the speed of delivery, but the ability to create projects aligned with both user and business goals, combined with solid technical mastery.</p><p>That’s why you should prioritize building knowledge in design: study, practice, and talk to people who know more than you. Mastering a tool doesn’t make you a designer. Next, learn to identify what you don’t know yet, map your knowledge gaps, and work to fill them with new skills that will drive your professional growth.</p><p>Finally, understand that AI is an ally, not a substitute for human competence. Use it as support, but maintain your ability to think, create, and decide for yourself. Developing creative autonomy is what will ensure you remain relevant, with or without the tools of the moment.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=aaec674d5532"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hey-designer-do-you-know-what-you-are-doing-aaec674d5532"">Hey designer, do you know what you are doing?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s as if I’m sitting at the bedside of a dying loved one, dreading the moment they’ll no longer be with us.</p><p>Design isn’t a person, per se, but for many of us it is — or was — a meaningful part of our lives. And the notion that design, as we know it, may wither feels almost certain.</p><p>My main prediction has been that AI will become so ubiquitous and efficient it will absorb nearly every experience that once required traditional design as a mediator.</p><p>This isn’t a doom-and-gloom prediction — it’s a <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">rational conclusion</a> drawn from the current trajectory of the industry and what highly respected professionals have also expressed.</p><blockquote>I am becoming more convinced that this [the shift toward users interacting with their agents rather than websites] will mark the end of user interface design as we know it.</blockquote><blockquote>—<a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group</a></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this does not bode well for those just entering the design field. Especially for designers with hopes of creating and building in the same way many of us were once fortunate to be part of.</p><p>However, despite all the negative commentary and predictions surrounding AI, I often witness a naïve optimism among students and junior designers — a kind of defense mechanism that shields them from the harsher realities of the field.</p><p>And maybe that’s exactly why new designers are so vital right now. Their hope is born of ignorance — and I don’t mean that negatively. I mean ignorance in the way that fosters curiosity and openness to possibility. And that’s precisely what the industry needs.</p><p>Maybe people like me are too cynical, too rational, too caught up in how the world works today to see a different path. But if there’s one truth about humans it’s that we’re anything but rational creatures.</p><p>In fact, a disregard for conventional wisdom — especially in young minds — can open a doorway to new ideas.</p><p>They say <a href=""https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/nickskillicorn/2023/06/evidence-that-children-are-more-creative-than-adults-and-the-opposite/"">children are more creative than adults</a> because they are not tethered by rules and restraints. Even in <a href=""https://updevelopment.org/3-metamorphoses-nietzsches-map-human-growth/"">Nietzsche’s metamorphosis</a>, the final stage of transformation is to a child—representing the ability to experience the world with fresh eyes — unchained by the cultural “thou shalt” directives we’re fed.</p><p>So perhaps there is hope for design, and by extension, designers.</p><p>Perhaps I’m too jaded, too overconfident in believing that if someone like me cannot see the path, then no path exists.</p><p>Maybe instead of thinking it is the end of design, we have faith that those who still dream will pave the way for something new — design that transcends anything we can imagine now.</p><p>It’s time we — I — stop pretending to predict and instead encourage those who will shape a future we want to live in, in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>And it begins with humility — with accepting our limitations. And continues with freeing design from the confines of the digital or physical canvas, giving future generations something greater — a cultural canvas, a medium free from the technical restrictions of their forebears.</p><p>Because neither big tech, industry, nor professionals like myself should define the boundaries of creativity and the future of humanity.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9c41a4a51c14"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-rests-on-childlike-ignorance-9c41a4a51c14"">The future of design rests on childlike ignorance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

It’s the craft of shaping written language into a visual experience , how words look, breathe, and interact on a page or screen. Good typography quietly guides the reader, while poor typography shouts for attention in all the wrong ways. Every detail , from letter spacing to line height , affects how users read, feel, and engage. Let’s unpack the essentials.</p><p>Every letter has a structure, and understanding it helps you design with precision. Terms like <em>ascender</em>, <em>descender</em>, <em>baseline</em>, and <em>x-height</em> describe the invisible skeleton that keeps type coherent. The x-height, for instance, determines how big a typeface feels even at the same point size.</p><p>Serif and sans-serif typefaces differ in tone partly because of these structures: serifs guide the eye along lines of text, while sans-serifs often feel cleaner and more modern. Knowing anatomy allows you to mix typefaces consciously rather than by vibe alone.</p><h3>Typographic Anatomy</h3><figure><img alt=""A large black uppercase ‘X’ is shown with orange dashed lines illustrating its body width and x-height.

In UI design, type must perform at small sizes and varying screens. In print, it must hold character at high resolutions and long durations.</p><p>Display type can afford drama; body text should feel invisible. Understanding how context shapes your typographic decisions is what separates art from noise.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Lining numbers’ with subtitle ‘some fonts have numbers that are all the same height’ appears above two rows of numerals from 1 to 0.

Once you see how subtle its impact is, you start noticing type everywhere: on screens, in streets, on receipts. Every font choice tells a story. The more fluently you speak the language of type, the more precisely you can design experiences that speak back.</p><p>Typography has a strange power: it’s both invisible and unforgettable. The best type never demands your attention, yet it defines how every word feels. A letter’s curve can suggest warmth or precision, while spacing can create calm or urgency. This is why typography sits at the heart of design, connecting language with emotion.</p><p>So when we adjust a line height or choose between Helvetica and Garamond, we’re not just picking styles; we’re shaping how people interpret meaning. Typography is the quiet storyteller behind every interface, poster, and page.

<h4>Apps SDK, design principles, and the future of contextual UX.</h4><figure><img alt=""Visual showing app integrations inside ChatGPT — icons for Zillow, Booking.com, and Canva appear as selectable buttons next to the text “in ChatGPT,” representing how external apps can now be accessed directly within conversations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d8jKD1pjcy5Y2aHhxAL70w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Current ChatGPT app integrations like Zillow, Booking.com, and Canva, illustrating seamless in-chat access.<br /> <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Do you remember how Tony Stark talked to JARVIS in <em>Iron Man</em>?</p><p>He simply said what he wanted to do, and JARVIS got it done. There was no need to open menus, switch applications, or decide which interface to use next. Every option that could have slowed him down was already resolved for him, so his attention stayed on the task itself.</p><figure><img alt=""A still from Iron Man 2 showing J.A.R.V.I.S.

In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I"">Brad Lightcap’s recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, he shared a vision where third-party apps could work together seamlessly inside ChatGPT. Users would never have to leave a conversation to get something done.</p><blockquote>“It’s the contextual aspect of ‘I’m doing X’ or ‘I need Y’ — I’m on a road trip and I want to know what playlist would go well with this… — that allows you to use ChatGPT to solve higher-level tasks and integrate apps contextually,” <em>said </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I""><em>Brad Lightcap in a Bloomberg interview.</em></a></blockquote><p>For designers, the real challenge lies in understanding what this shift implies. When conversations become the new interface and tools can appear contextually, how should we design the flow, timing, and handoff between chat and visual elements?</p><h3>Evolution from plugins, MCP, to SDK</h3><p>To understand what this shift truly means for design, we first need to look at how the system evolved.</p><p>In the early days of plugins, tools lived in separate spaces. Users had to switch between apps, browser extensions, or new tabs to complete even the simplest task.</p><p>Then came the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. It created a standard way for ChatGPT to talk with external tools and data sources. MCP allowed the model to call a tool and pass structured information through a single, consistent channel. It was an invisible bridge between the model and the outside world.</p><p>Building on that foundation, OpenAI introduced the <strong>Apps Software Development Kit (SDK),</strong> a toolkit that makes this bridge visible and interactive. It determines <em>when</em> a tool appears, <em>how</em> it looks, and <em>how</em> people can interact with it directly inside the chat. With the SDK, users can engage directly with apps through buttons, cards, or widgets without leaving the conversation.</p><figure><img alt=""A preview of multiple mobile screens showing third-party apps like Tunedrop, Brick &amp; Basil, and BeatBot running inside ChatGPT’s interface, where users can browse maps, playlists, and restaurant cards directly within the chat window."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hej5hziRSjflrud8yVOxhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how integrated apps visually coexist within ChatGPT’s conversation interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>How the apps SDK boosts efficiency and product growth</h3><p>At this point, designers can probably already imagine how the Apps SDK begins to reshape the user experience. In essence, the SDK embodies the logic behind <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>: it reduces the visual noise that slows decision-making and shortens the physical distance between intention and completion.</p><p>Take Coursera for example. Previously, a learner exploring UX courses might spend minutes choosing which platform to open, typing “UX design” into a search bar, scrolling through long lists, and clicking in and out of pages to check ratings or instructors. Every choice added a moment of hesitation, fragmenting attention and stretching the time it took to act.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Coursera’s University of Michigan portal showing search results for “UX design,” with multiple course cards, filters for subjects and skills, and sorting options that make the interface visually dense and choice-heavy."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vl6K_9wrgCzci7iXZ_LfcA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from Coursera’s page illustrating how users face a complex, multi-step interface when searching for UX design courses. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/programs/university-of-michigan-mrofm/browse?authProvider=umich&amp;query=ux+design&amp;source=search""><em>Coursera — University of Michigan UX Design Search</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>However, Coursera’s integration with ChatGPT illustrates a successful application of Hick’s Law principles, significantly reducing decision complexity. A learner can simply ask a question with natural language inside ChatGPT’s text field. A video preview of relevant courses then appears directly within the chat, reducing the number of immediate choices presented to the learner. Learners no longer needs to spend time filtering or comparing endless options in a long, scrolling list, thereby simplifying the selection process and dramatically decreasing the reaction time required to commit to a course.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a Coursera video playing directly inside ChatGPT, where a user naturally asks follow-up questions about UX design concepts through text conversation, demonstrating seamless course discovery and learning."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tqh-N6IQS_bT0pK2BbtbLw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image illustrating how users can search for and explore UX design courses on Coursera directly within ChatGPT using natural language prompts. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Some in-house designers might wonder what is the impact on their products. If users can complete tasks entirely inside ChatGPT, would they still visit the original app?</p><p>This concern is reasonable because the SDK might reduce users’ page-level engagement within the native environment. Yet the same decreased friction of opening the app can also widen the app’s reach. By allowing users to call the app directly within ChatGPT, the SDK raises visit frequency among existing members and opens the door for non-members to try it for the first time.</p><p>The experience no longer depends on downloading, logging in, or navigating to a separate website. Each interaction inside ChatGPT becomes an entry point that can lead to higher engagement and new conversions, expanding the app’s reach without adding extra steps.</p><h3>Designing experiences that belong in a conversation</h3><p>After understanding the broader impact of the Apps SDK, designers can start thinking about how to shape these experiences in practice.</p><p>Designing for the SDK means clearly defining who the users are, what their goals look like in context, and which parts of their workflow feel most natural to complete through conversation. The task must be specific enough for ChatGPT to assist, yet simple enough to avoid overwhelming the interaction.</p><p>OpenAI offers several guiding questions to help designers identify good use cases, each of which can also be viewed through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a>, showing how the SDK minimizes the number of decisions users need to make. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><em>How do your user task fit naturally into a conversation? (for example, booking, ordering, scheduling, quick lookups)</em></li><li><em>Is it time-bound or action-oriented? (short or medium duration tasks with a clear start and end)</em></li><li><em>Is the information valuable in the moment? (users can act on it right away or get a concise preview before diving deeper)</em></li><li><em>Can it be summarized visually and simply? (one card, a few key details, a clear CTA)</em></li><li><em>Does it extend ChatGPT in a way that feels additive or differentiated?</em></li></ul><p>Designers should also avoid designing interfaces that:</p><ul><li><em>Display long-form or static content better suited for a website or app.</em></li><li><em>Require complex multi-step workflows that exceed the inline or fullscreen display modes.</em></li><li><em>Use the space for ads, upsells, or irrelevant messaging.</em></li><li><em>Surface sensitive or private information directly in a card where others might see it.</em></li><li><em>Duplicate ChatGPT’s system functions (for example, recreating the input composer).</em></li></ul><p>From most of these principles, we can notice that OpenAI encourages designers to <strong>avoid tasks that involve too many steps</strong>, or think about what <strong>information is valuable</strong> to show on the interface.</p><p>Take Figma SDK for example. The workflows like converting a short piece of text into a user flow represents a much stronger use case. It is easier for users to describe with natural language, and this information can immediate be summarized into visual feedback that users can act on right away.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a user asking ChatGPT to convert a hand-drawn user-flow sketch into a digital diagram using the Figma app, with the finished flowchart displayed directly within the chat interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2LIxFdzjGAmW0XgFWsv2ew.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image demonstrating how users can generate a complete user-flow diagram in Figma through a simple natural-language request and sketches inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, designing a complex design system with ChatGPT may not be a good user case. Because it require both users and computers to access complicate information on multiple design pages, and users have to constantly make fragmented decisions and repeatedly step in to guide the AI, which interrupts the flow of interaction and increases the overall time to complete a task.</p><p>For designers, building for the Apps SDK starts with defining a clear, focused task. ChatGPT favors apps that serve a single, well-scoped purpose, something users can complete in one short interaction. <strong>Try to describe your user’s key goal in plain language, outline its input and output, and make sure it fits naturally into a conversation.</strong></p><h3>Designing Interfaces that belong in a conversation</h3><p>OpenAI also provides a set of UI guidelines that can be examined through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>.</p><p>For example, designers should display <strong>only the most relevant information</strong> and present it in a simple visual form, such as a clean card with a short list of three key items.</p><p>The guidelines also suggest limiting each card to a maximum of two primary actions: one main call to action and one optional secondary choice. These approach helps users <strong>find what they need without navigating through layers of menus or dense tables</strong>, allowing them to act more quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration showing four examples of poor interface patterns for ChatGPT Apps SDK — multiple views, deep navigation, redundant features, and vertical scrolling — each marked with a red “X” to highlight unnecessary complexity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*di-MpBfsMeBYsiC1lUbCeA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines emphasizing that ChatGPT app interfaces should avoid complex navigation and redundant elements. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Primary actions are usually placed at the bottom of the card, effectively <strong>reducing the distance the thumb-pointer must travel</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing labeled interface elements within ChatGPT Apps SDK cards, including titles, edit controls, expandable maps, item lists, and primary action buttons like “Directions,” demonstrating structured layout design."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XzRY1Kz1PJX62MTAYGBbuA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how different UI components are organized consistently within ChatGPT’s in-chat interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>When a card contains richer media such as images, maps, or interactive diagrams, the expand option can open a fullscreen view. This action significantly increases the <strong>effective target width</strong>, allowing users to work within a larger, more precise area and improves control when interacting with detailed visual content.</p><figure><img alt=""Two smartphone screens showing full-screen interactions within ChatGPT Apps SDK: one displaying restaurant details for “Little Nona’s” with an image, description, and action buttons, and another showing a map with nearby pizza locations."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*b_Wc5aMX-3LT_ChElOc49Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines demonstrating how full-screen views allow immersive map-interactions directly inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>If you’re interested in the details of how to design user experiences and interfaces, please check out the <a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines"">Apps SDK Design Guidelines</a> and the <a href=""https://www.figma.com/community/file/1560064615791108827"">Figma component library</a>.</blockquote><h3>The future of agents and UX designer’s role</h3><p>As Brad Lightcap mentioned in his Bloomberg interview, the future of ChatGPT will begin to behave more like an <strong>operating system</strong> (or Jarvis, your personal agent).</p><p>It will not only execute commands but also integrate information across multiple apps, anticipate user needs, and determine when to act and when to ask for confirmation.</p><p>Similar directions are already being explored or developed in products like Gemini and Google Suite products, signaling a shift toward more unified, context-aware environments.</p><p>For UX designers, this evolution expands the scope of design beyond screens and buttons. The focus moves <strong>toward designing flows, contexts, and systems</strong> that help users think clearly and act confidently. Designers must learn to define how an AI communicates, makes decisions, and aligns with human goals.</p><p>Yet no matter how advanced the system becomes, there will always be a need to clarify what people truly need, and bringing that clarity to complexity to just simple interactions.</p><h3>References:</h3><p>Bloomberg Originals.
