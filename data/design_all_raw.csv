<h4><em>How removing friction from creative tools removes the meaning from creative work</em></h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TbMmpNxAhRk0ywBhw_Xo7w.png"" /><figcaption>illustration by author</figcaption></figure><p>Twenty-five or so years ago, one day after school I went to visit my dad at his office. We didn’t have a computer at home at the time so whenever I was around his, I would beg him to let me use it to play with MS Paint.</p><p>I was probably around 7 or 8, and my go-to artwork was a portrait of my him made with the spray tool — perfect to recreate his short, spiky hair and stubble — and I’d make his head ridiculously big and tease him about it. He still has one of these masterpiece in his desktop wallpapers rotation, I’m pretty sure.</p><p>I couldn’t draw much else with the mouse, nothing more complicated than a lopsided house and a tree, so I would ask him, knowing full well he wasn’t the artist in the family, to draw something for me; that day I asked for a dog. He tried his best, but what came up on the canvas was a misshapen thing — a kind of pig-dog hybrid that was so bad it had us laughing for a good while.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bAbEBu0_nMOmt2viK_-_2w.png"" /><figcaption>MS paint GUI circa 1999 (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t always sure why that random ugly dog had stayed with me for so long, but I see now it was a symbol of the connection my dad and I shared that day. This memory has resurfaced a few times now that there’s so much emphasis on AI image generators — these tools that can (sometimes, for now) create breathtaking art effortlessly yet leave me, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz0oQ0v0W10"">and many others</a>, wondering about their real purpose.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about what it would have been like if instead of just our best intention and some basic tools we would have had at our disposal Midjourney or something else that day, how my request to my dad would have been the same but the result much more different. The quality of the artwork itself is beside the point — the whole interaction and the unexpected moment between us it’s what would have been lost.</p><p>There’s been <a href=""https://philosophynow.org/issues/169/What_Makes_A_Work_Of_Art_Great"">countless debates</a> on what makes art <em>art</em>, why or why not AI outputs can or should be considered the <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/08/is-art-generated-by-artificial-intelligence-real-art/"">same as human ones</a>. Now every month we have a new tool we can use, one of the latest being <a href=""https://openai.com/index/sora-2/"">Sora 2</a>, adding no value to the human experience while claiming to ‘democratise’ creativity — an overused phrase that does nothing, if not mistaking access for meaning.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zz1vLggJm8LYsGkNulSnAA.png"" /><figcaption>Google Gemini UI (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>From a UX perspective, the process of AI image generation is as frictionless as it can be: type, click, wait and receive what you’ve asked for, perhaps refine it. As ever, the promise is accessibility by letting anyone create regardless of skill, but I would argue there’s a difference between democratising outcomes and democratising the creative process itself.</p><p>With these tools it’s like we’re giving everyone a printer instead of a paint brush, and by doing that, what we’re losing is the struggle and the lessons that come with it, so much so that creation doesn’t even feel like creating anymore.</p><p>When the outputs are automated we’re stripping away the messy, truly generative, experience where actual creativity lives.</p><p>I can’t deny that, in some cases, these programs can spit out objectively beautiful outputs. But as much as those AI images might look right, there’s always something missing: whether it’s the person behind it trying to communicate something they can’t quite articulate, or the surprise and frustration of actually getting your hands dirty with a tool.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tyxcDKSGvU2XD8QihHyCVA.png"" /><figcaption>Gemini’s image created form the prompt “draw me a dog”.

You’re left to watch dozens of other people’s prompts and outputs stream by, and few will truly experiment since it’s much easier to copy successful formulas when wanting a certain result.</p><p>Or the variation buttons — why struggle with your vision when you can just generate alternatives until one feels “good enough”? I can’t get over how these “creative” tools take away the mess and uncertainty where creativity actually happens, and offload what’s arguably the best part of the process to a randomising algorithm.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nx1xERWbQHABlj3iNGXx4Q.png"" /><figcaption>Midjourney running on Discord (screenshot <a href=""https://aituts.com/adding-midjourney-bot-discord-server/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the bigger picture, it’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made hundreds, even thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with something so fundamentally different.</p><p>The point of art, no matter the category — I believe — is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can see the quirks and struggle in every piece, sometimes a message, or at the very least, the personality of the artist. What draws us to art isn’t only its beauty — it’s the artist’s way of seeing that gets captured by all the tiny decisions made while creating it. And that’s what makes art unique and human.</p><p>I am <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-design-of-shallow-thinking-4627e254a7b3?sk=d121456de089061f1293e7063524e1b4"">by my own admission</a> a bit of romantic when it comes to oldschool software, but if creativity becomes automated we risk losing the very thing that makes art meaningful — the experience of creating something.

Scrolling through options until you find a good one doesn’t really scream creative process.</p><p>Recently I had a conversation with someone comparing AI art to electronic music (along the lines of <em>“new technology disrupts an art form, skeptics resist but creativity adapts”</em>). I’m not a musician myself but I think that when you dig deeper, the two situations are quite different in terms of what technology is doing to the creative process: electronic music gave artists new ways to create, while AI art gives <em>machines</em> new ways to imitate creation.</p><p>We should recognise this distinction especially because we spend our careers thinking about how interfaces guide decisions. We know that removing steps from a process doesn’t just make it faster, but it can change what that process <em>is</em>.</p><p>So I keep thinking about this ugly digital dog from 1999, how it might be the most valuable piece of art in my memory, even though — or especially because — it was not perfect and looked almost nothing like a dog.</p><h4>Further reads/watch</h4><p><a href=""https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-is-not-democratizing-creativity"">AI is not “democratizing creativity.” It’s doing the opposite</a> — Brian Merchant<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Z4cg5Fyu4"">Sora proves the AI bubble is going to burst so hard</a> — Adam Conover<br />Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice — J.

<h4>Design doesn’t start with pixels or shapes, but with how the brain perceives color and emotion.</h4><figure><img alt=""A yellow LEGO head with a colorful brain sticking out, against a vertical rainbow-striped background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MTkEF1AH8tRpG1IR5iNxSA.png"" /><figcaption>Some elements were created using AI.

We listen to our users and aim to make their interaction with our products as effortless and intuitive as possible.</p><p>My goal with this article isn’t just to share theories, but to start a dialogue within the design community, to exchange perspectives, challenge assumptions, and uncover new ways of thinking about how design truly interacts with the human mind.</p><p>Before we move on to specific practices and theories, I’d like to set the stage for how we’ll be talking about psychology in design.</p><h3>Psychology is a science</h3><p>In short, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology""><em>psychology</em></a><em>,</em> according to Britanica, is the science of human behavior, emotions, and perception. For us as designers, it provides a lens that helps us build hypotheses and create meaningful concepts. But I believe it’s crucial to remember that <em>design</em><strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>neither a result nor a goal only but a process of solving problems, as Design Council mentions it in <a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/fileadmin/uploads/dc/Documents/DesignCouncil_Design%2520methods%2520for%2520developing%2520services.pdf"">their paper</a>. And this process can integrate methods and theories from many different disciplines.</p><figure><img alt=""A red double diamond diagram representing the design process, with two connected diamonds labeled sequentially: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*UBFR6q7A4iVOekRE.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/the-double-diamond/"">The Design Council’s</a> visual representation of their Double Diamond design and innovation process.</figcaption></figure><p>No matter how appealing our hypotheses may seem, whether they’re based on cutting-edge research or well-established principles, real value for users emerges only when we listen to them, understand what they actually need, and iterate our solutions accordingly.</p><p>So what we’re discussing here is perfect for building design hypotheses but it should never be mistaken for their final proof. Now, let’s examine these concepts of Color Psychology more closely.</p><h3>How our brain perceives color</h3><p>I think we sometimes underestimate the meaning and importance of color in interfaces and design. Yet I would argue that color is one of the most crucial aspects of design itself. I would like support this interpretation with the findings from two scientific paper <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6673893/""><em>Estimation of the Timing of Human Visual Perception from Magnetoencephalography</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00674/full""><em>Early recurrent feedback facilitates visual object recognition under challenging conditions</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our perception of color begins the moment light hits the retina and activates the cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths. The signal is then sent directly to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotional responses.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating the visual pathways in the human brain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*WS_-cGEcUotrnrQ2"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/human-eye/The-nervous-messages"">Britanica</a></figcaption></figure><p>This structure evolved long before the neocortex, which handles rational thought. In other words, our emotional brain reacts to color before our logical brain even gets involved. The limbic system also connects emotions with memory, motivation, and instincts, which explains why color can instantly trigger feelings, associations, and even behavioral responses.</p><p>In other words, our brains have evolved to process color before form or content and, importantly, to do so while bypassing the neocortex, which handles rational thinking.</p><p>This means that before your user even begins to consciously recognize shapes or read text, they’ve already experienced an emotional response to the colors on the screen.</p><p>Of course, in research we’re talking about milliseconds but to me, even a reaction that happens up to four times fasteris a huge difference. It reminds us that color doesn’t just decorate a design; it sets the emotional stage for how users will interpret everything that follows.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. I’ll be showing you a series of illustrative images that serve as analogies for how our brain perceives visual information.</p><h4>Sensory perception of color</h4><p>In the first <strong>0–50 milliseconds</strong> after light hits the retina, the cone cells react to the wavelength — it’s <strong>pure physics</strong>. At this stage, your brain doesn’t yet “know” what happened: <em>the signal has just begun its journey through the visual pathway.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Dark background without content on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*566ikSMtMS3wXR8SPB7yQA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Primary color processing</strong></h4><p>Around <strong>80–120 milliseconds</strong> after the stimulus, your brain isolates color as a distinct signal. A pure sensation of color forms, along with an <strong>emotional reaction</strong> — because the information is already being processed in the limbic system. <em>You see red. It’s a strong visual stimulus, which is why my element has already captured your attention.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A blurred circular composition with a dark center, a soft gray halo, and a small red area on the left side"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zWPpuLH8_NWA1lF5n5so6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Analysis of shape, contours, and motion</strong></h4><p>At around <strong>150–200 milliseconds</strong>, the brain begins to <strong>calculate geometry, boundaries, texture, and depth</strong>. At this stage, the information is still fragmented. <em>The brain has simply detected a rectangle and a collection of other visual elements,</em> but hasn’t yet formed a complete picture.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred rectangular shape with a red circle on the left and several black rectangles arranged in two rows on a light gray background, centered against a dark backdrop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cygio0MxO1iY0-g_bcZl6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Object and context recognition</strong></h4><p>After about <strong>200–300 milliseconds</strong>, the information is integrated in the associative cortex — this is the moment when <strong>we recognize what we’re seeing. </strong><em>This is probably a notification.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A light gray rectangular box centered on a black background, featuring scattered black letters of varying sizes and a red exclamation mark symbol inside a circle on the left side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Msmw53t4mBaJQw1hGEIdQg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4>Cognitive evaluation</h4><p>Only after about <strong>300–450 milliseconds</strong> from the moment you look at the button does the rational process begin. The neocortex interprets the meaning. <em>A red banner with the word ‘error’ and a warning icon — that means something went wrong in the system.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A centered rectangular notification box with rounded corners on a black background. Inside, a red exclamation mark icon appears to the left of the bold black text “ERROR,” followed by the smaller phrase “Oops! Something went wrong.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZETQsgl4h4a5pKm9rU_ThA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>So I’d like you to notice something: by the time you already felt a slight sense of alert from seeing the red color, your brain still needed another 200–300 milliseconds to fully decode what was actually happening.</p><p>And now, my dear designers, I invite you to try a little experiment. Take any interface design and increase the duration of all animations by 250 milliseconds. You’ll instantly feel how even such seemingly tiny time differences can dramatically change your perception of what you see.</p><h3>The reality of color</h3><p>The second aspect of color that absolutely fascinates me is its duality, especially when it comes to how we perceive it. On one hand, color is a subjective experience but on the other, it’s something we can measure with extraordinary precision.</p><h4>The immeasurable side of color</h4><p>We know that every person is unique, and we still can’t definitively prove or disprove whether we all see colors in the same way as Prof. Semir Zeki states in his Lecture on Color Perception. What we do know is that perception depends on the cone cells in our eyes and their quantity and ratio can vary from person to person.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href"">https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href</a><p>And another mystery remains, how exactly our brain interprets colors, and whether it does so in the same way for everyone. Some people can see more or fewer shades, while others might not distinguish basic colors at all. In very rare cases, some individuals may even experience monochromatic vision, not only due to missing cones, but also as a result of brain damage.</p><h4>The true nature of color</h4><p>Color doesn’t actually exist in nature. Yes, that’s right: leaves aren’t really green, the sky isn’t truly blue, and even an emerald isn’t <em>actually</em> green. All of this is an illusion. Our brain’s interpretation of light according to an article <a href=""https://www.spectroscopyonline.com/view/where-perception-meets-reality-the-science-of-measuring-color""><em>Where Perception Meets Reality: The Science of Measuring Color</em></a>.</p><p>In reality, what we see is not color but light. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the cone receptors in our retina are activated in different ways. The wavelength changes because light reflects off objects and that reflection shifts the wave. What’s fascinating is that this shift is influenced not just by the objects themselves but by their atoms.</p><figure><img alt=""Horizontal gradient from dark purple through green to bright red."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1QxEAuRmQORL5qkn.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4639774"">Gringer</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5207327/"">This principle is used by astrophysicists to determine which elements dominate on distant exoplanets</a>: by calculating how specific atoms interact with light. With ultra-sensitive sensors, we can detect even the slightest variations in wavelength reflected from those planets.</p><p>And here’s the key point the atom, the fundamental building block of all matter, has no color of its own. It merely interacts with photons. So, the matter and objects around us are colorless without light.</p><p>So we’ve now touched on the second side of what makes color so fascinating: it’s a sensory stimulus that can be described quantitatively: wavelength, intensity, saturation.</p><p>Unlike many other aspects of psychology, color is something we can measure with extreme precision, minimizing any margin of error in experimental data and making it one of the most reliable subjects for psychological research. Yet it remains a complex phenomenon because, we still can’t fully measure the brain that perceives it.</p><h4><em>The color model I trust most</em></h4><p>At the end of the 19th century, long before Johannes Itten’s theories, Wilhelm Wundt laid the foundation for the psychological classification of color in his work <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Physio/intro.htm""><em>Principles of Physiological Psychology</em></a>.</p><p>In my opinion, every designer should be familiar with and understand this framework. Wundt was the first to describe color not merely as a physical property of light, but as a set of psychological parameters of perception forming so called “psychological space of color”, defined by three independent dimensions:</p><ol><li><strong>Hue</strong> — the actual type of color (red, green, blue, etc.)</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> — the degree of color purity, or how much “gray” is mixed into it</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong> — the perceived lightness or luminance of the color</li></ol><p>This concept became the foundation for the later development of these ideas and the creation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV""><strong>HSV color model</strong></a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison of HSL and HSV color models showing hue, saturation, and lightness/value relationships in 3D diagrams and gradient slices."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*U-kK5AmTp2noWFGJ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9445469"">Jacob Rus</a></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I tend to use this model most often in design, as it gives far greater control over the visual outcome compared to the more rigid machine-encoded HEX or the physically-based RGB formats. HSV allows you to work with color in a way that feels more natural and intuitive, while still providing precise control for subtle adjustments in the final result.</p><h3>The influence of color on humans</h3><p>Let’s now move from how we perceive color to how it affects us — and how we interpret it from a scientific point of view.</p><h4>Emotional response to color</h4><p>We’ve already touched on the emotional component earlier, so let’s start there. <strong>Warm colors are known to speed up reactions and increase physiological arousal</strong>. According to the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory""><em>Color-in-Context Theory</em></a>, warm colors stimulate the nervous system and enhance motor responses. That’s exactly why shades of red, orange, and yellow are so often used for CTA buttons, alerts, and error messages, anywhere we need to grab attention instantly or create a sense of urgency.</p><p>At the same time, the same study notes that <strong>cool colors help reduce stress and create a sense of stability</strong>. Blue and green hues are shown to lower anxiety levels, slow down breathing, and evoke feelings of trust and safety.<br />That’s why these colors are so commonly used in banking, healthcare, and other sensitive interfaces — wherever calmness, reliability, and reassurance are essential.</p><h4>Cognitive response to color</h4><p>We also know that color influences cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and creativity. In a 2009 study <a href=""https://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy5300/Documents/Mehta%26Zhu2009.pdf""><em>Blue or Red? Exploring the Effect of Color on Cognitive Task Performances</em></a>, researchers found that <strong>blue enhances creative thinking</strong> and promotes exploration of new ideas, while <strong>red improves focus and attention</strong> to detail. This means that through color, we can influence not only the emotional state of our users but also guide their cognitive processes, subtly steering their minds toward the state most aligned with the task at hand.</p><h4>Cultural perception of color</h4><p>It’s important to note that the <strong>psychological response to color is largely universal</strong> among humans, according to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/002202217300400201""><em>A Cross-Cultural Study of the Affective Meanings of Color</em></a>, emotional reactions to a color’s brightness and warmth are not dependent on cultural or social context.</p><p>However, <strong>color can also acquire symbolic meaning</strong> such as associations with mourning, happiness, or pain, which are shaped by socio-cultural factors. For instance:</p><ul><li>White represents purity in Western cultures but mourning in China.</li><li>Red is often seen as danger in the West, yet as a symbol of luck and prosperity in Asia.</li><li>Green generally feels positive and natural to most of us, but in Indonesia, it signifies “forbidden.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Traffic light with red, yellow, and blue signals above a Japanese sign against a blue sky and green trees."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*9CILeKbx0ZEaBqIj.jpg"" /><figcaption>Image Source - <a href=""http://www.japantravelplanning.com"">www.japantravelplanning.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>So as designers, we can confidently use color to communicate directly with the limbic system, influencing emotion and attention on a biological level but we must also remain aware of cultural context when using color as a symbol, such as the familiar “traffic light logic” so often applied in interface design. For example, until the 20th century, the Japanese language had no separate word for “green.” All hues between blue and green were described by the same word 青い (aoi), meaning both “blue” and “green”, which has led some lights to be a bluer shade of green.</p><h3>Why every designer should start with color psychology</h3><p>I’m sure these theories form the essential foundation every designer should enter the profession with and keep exploring throughout their career. Because in the end, we are learning to speak emotions with our users, and color is what speaks directly to their emotions.</p><p>In my opinion, many of these principles shouldn’t be treated merely as hypotheses that demand constant validation, but as axioms we can confidently build upon. No matter what you test or how you test it, red will always attract more attention than blue, as I wrote earlier, some things are universal.</p><p>It’s important to remember that unless you plan to conduct research on hundreds, maybe thousands, of participants using brain-scanning equipment, you’re unlikely to reinvent the wheel or to prove, through ordinary user testing, a new universal psychological truth about color that hasn’t already been explored by scientists.</p><p>And yet, that’s exactly where I find beauty in being a designer. Because we work with people, not with algorithms. Our role is to ask, to listen, and to adapt, to consider the socio-cultural context, the personal story, and the environments that shape how your user group perceives both color and design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5e6556919da"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-color-reflex-psychology-that-fires-before-you-think-e5e6556919da"">The color reflex: Psychology that fires before you think</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Ever tried scoping a real project with AI to simulate developers expertise? I did. Here are the results.</h4><figure><img alt=""A woman sits behind her desk, discussing with an AI named Tim on her computer.

Not that my developers colleagues weren’t helpful. But in a fast paced environment, where delivery is key and discovery is secondary, developers aren’t always available.</p><p>During my thesis research about AIs’ impact on dev/designer collaboration, I interviewed designers that had the same experience. That, or they worked in an environment where developers and designers never interacted: everything went through the Product manager.</p><figure><img alt=""A schema simplifying collaboration dynamics between dev, design and a third party, from no communication to continuous communication."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/773/1*N9Skk1lFu6dDoX_De5zdhQ.png"" /><figcaption>These are examples of the collaboration dynamics between the development and design teams that I encountered during my thesis research. Credit: Anna Lefour</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I decided to test an idea that wandered in my head for some time: <strong>the synthetic developer</strong>.</p><h3>From synthetic user to synthetic dev</h3><p>The first time I heard about a synthetic user was through <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">a classmate’s article</a>. The idea was simple: instead of interviewing real people, you generate a user with AI and run research on them.</p><p>This simple presentation got me to think: <strong>If we can fake users feedbacks, could we fake colleagues expertise too? </strong>After some research,<strong> </strong>I’ve stumbled across very interesting perspectives on synthetic colleagues, going as far as creating <a href=""https://medium.com/%40popov.anatolii.it/the-synthetic-department-working-with-ai-colleagues-24e77cd2fd1d"">a “synthetic department”</a>.</p><p>Fast forward a few months. I was thrown into a project mid-flight. No kickoff, no discovery, no user research. Only an oral briefing, a vague description of the client’s expectations, and the pressure to deliver.</p><p>Normally, this is when I would turn to developers, to help me clarify what’s feasible, what’s risky, what needs prioritizing. But I used this opportunity to test the value of AI as a substitute: I tried working with a synthetic expert, and created Tim.</p><p>And that’s when you may be wondering: <strong>Is this designer suggesting we replace developers with AI? </strong>The answer is no.<strong> </strong>What I wanted to understand was whether a LLM could<strong> replicate the kind of reasoning developers use</strong> when making trade-offs and spotting risks. Not to take their place, but to help designers explore technical constraints when no human counterpart is immediately available.</p><h3>The experiment: building a synthetic developer</h3><p>Tim was a developer persona powered by ChatGPT, my “synthetic dev”. I chose ChatGPT because:</p><ul><li>It has unlimited use (unlike Claude) which was important at the time for my thesis research.</li><li>It’s the designers most used LLM, according to Designlab’s <a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/the-state-of-ai-in-ux-and-product-design-insights-expertise"">State of AI in UX and Product Design</a>.</li></ul><p>Tim’s job was to act as if he were my colleague, ready to discuss scenarios, constraints, and the structure of the interface.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen capture of the details of the persona called Tim."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption>I built a persona for Tim, my synthetic dev. Credit; Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>I gave Tim a detailed persona (experience level, tech stack expertise, communication style) blending the experience of my two colleagues: one senior engineer, one junior developer. I fed him the project brief, including tech stack, user roles, core CRUD features, and industry-specific constraints. Then I ran a structured design discussion, asking him to help me on:</p><ul><li>Generation of typical use scenarios for the 3 main screens detailed in the briefing</li><li>Specific technical constraints depending on the sector the product will be used</li><li>Hypothetical zoning of screens</li></ul><p>Later, I ran the exact same exercise with the two actual developers from my team. Same questions, same format, same project brief.</p><p>The contrast was striking.</p><h3>What the synthetic dev got right (and wrong)</h3><p>Tim excelled at certain tasks. He helped me structure three Jobs To Be Done when I was struggling to articulate user needs clearly. He proposed a data model that anticipated change logs requirements I hadn’t considered (<em>example 1, see image below</em>). He explained complex technical concepts in designer-friendly language. And he was instantly available. But his limitations became clear when context mattered most.</p><figure><img alt=""A set of three examples that have been made confidential and are drawn from the conversation the writer had with the synthetic developer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UD3EPe2iiIGS5aBq3oDGsg.png"" /><figcaption>Due to confidentiality, I can’t share the exact details of my conversation with Tim. However, I share here some examples. Credit : Anna Lefour</figcaption></figure><p>He also sounded too generic, too polished, too “ChatGPT” (<em>example 2</em>). At times, the responses felt more like “helpful AI assistant” than “Tim the developer”… Especially when offering solutions rather than asking clarifying questions. The persona worked best when I explicitly framed questions as developer-to-designer exchanges, but would drift toward generic helpfulness otherwise.</p><p>More critically, Tim occasionally hallucinated, most notably when he invented industry-specific project experience to justify his choices about the workflows (<em>example 3</em>). But the real issue wasn’t frequent fabrication; it was premature consensus. Tim would propose technically sound solutions without first questioning whether the underlying problem existed.</p><p>He was working from general developer knowledge, not our team’s knowledge.</p><h3>What real developers brought to the table</h3><p>The real developers brought something Tim couldn’t: <strong>skeptical curiosity</strong>. Where Tim would propose solutions, they’d ask “But have you checked with the client if they actually work this way?” Where Tim suggested optimization patterns, they’d question “Do we even have that problem yet?”</p><p>Users with multiple roles, need of in-app authentication for some features, further development of the product… They pointed out infrastructure context, security concerns, feasibility trade-offs, things Tim simply couldn’t know. They also brought institutional knowledge.</p><p>At times, they went too deep, drifting into implementation details that weren’t immediately relevant, but that richness was what anchored the project in reality.</p><p>The conversation didn’t end with answers. It led to relationship-building. We created a dedicated Slack channel for ongoing design-dev exchanges. The collaboration deepened beyond that single project.</p><h3>The real insight: synthetic as scaffolding, not structure</h3><p>What this test taught me about the nature of collaboration itself: AI can help us simulate collaboration, but not replace it.</p><p>Working with Tim showed me the potential of synthetic colleagues as preparation tools. They can:</p><ul><li>Help structure thinking before human discussions</li><li>Generate first-draft solutions to stress-test</li><li>Provide on-demand expertise when humans aren’t immediately available</li><li>Act as a rehearsal tool for complex conversations</li><li>Help us cover any angles we may have missed</li></ul><p>But they also:</p><ul><li>Miss context-specific constraints</li><li>Hallucinate with confidence</li><li>Can’t build relationships</li><li>Don’t challenge assumptions the way humans do</li><li>Lack the messiness that leads to breakthrough insights</li></ul><p>The real developers gave me more than expertise. They gave me relationship, institutional knowledge, and collaborative momentum that extended far beyond our initial conversation.</p><h3>How to use synthetic developers effectively</h3><p>It’s important to take into consideration that my observations are based on this one test, as I couldn’t replicate it with another LLM or for another project (yet).</p><p>Nonetheless, based on my experiment and broader research, here’s my recommendation: adopt a hybrid approach that leverages AI preparation while protecting human collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""A schema with three blocks connected with arrows, showing a simplified version of the framework to use AI in briefs collaboration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*14f33NCwtlixaaJYzEhftw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted scoping requires expert validation. The hybrid approach gradually improves both AI outputs and team relationships. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>This framework has three interconnected phases:</h3><h4>Phase 1: preparation with AI</h4><p>Use synthetic developers as thinking partners to structure your approach before human discussions. The biggest limitation? They don’t know what they don’t know. Tim’s hallucinations mostly came from lack of context.</p><p>To make this phase effective:</p><ul><li>Document your project context exhaustively (industry, tech stack, existing architecture)</li><li>Ask a real developer to help you craft that context, they’ll know what details matter</li><li>Use AI to generate edge case scenarios, identify potential constraints, draft initial taxonomies</li><li>Formalize concepts you haven’t articulated clearly (in my experiment, Tim helped me structure Jobs To Be Done that became foundation for richer conversations later)</li></ul><p>Making AI useful requires human collaboration upfront. Treat AI outputs as conversation starters that help you ask better questions.</p><h4>Phase 2: e<strong>xpert validation</strong></h4><p>Always validate and enrich AI outputs with real humans. My test showed that Tim could provide useful initial framing, but the real developers brought context, nuance, and ideas no LLM could generate.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing 30 minutes of developer time. It’s about making those 30 minutes exponentially more valuable by arriving prepared with structured questions and preliminary solutions to stress-test.</p><p>Expert validation teaches you how to improve your synthetic colleague. What did the AI miss? What context mattered most? Use these insights to refine your prompts and evolve your persona. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s a framework that improves and adapts with each project.</p><h4>Phase 3: collaborative momentum</h4><p>Here’s the critical part: the ease of AI creates a dangerous temptation. When you can get “good enough” answers instantly, it’s easy to skip the messier, slower human conversation. Especially under deadline pressure.</p><p>That shortcut erodes exactly what makes collaboration valuable: relationship-building, institutional knowledge transfer, creative friction that leads to breakthrough insights.</p><p>Set a rule for yourself: If you use AI for preliminary exploration, commit to following up with humans. Even if AI “worked”.</p><p>The Slack channel that emerged from my real developer conversations became infrastructure for future collaboration and documentation of our progress and choices. No amount of synthetic dev efficiency could create that.</p><h3>Final thought</h3><p>Back to my main question: is a synthetic dev the solo designer’s best friend?</p><p>Well, not really. The designer’s best friends are still <strong>the colleagues who bring the expertise she or he lacks</strong>. But the synthetic dev can help bridge the gap: a facilitator to learn the developers’ language, a thinking partner to explore ideas. This experiment proved to me that synthetic actors (devs, users, PMs) aren’t about replacing, but about filling the gaps where communication or collaboration become harder.</p><p>Still,<strong> scaffolding isn’t a house</strong>. A synthetic dev isn’t a colleague.</p><p><strong>The goal was never to replace developers, but to explore how much of their reasoning AI can truly emulate.</strong> The future of design won’t be about choosing between humans and AI. It will be about weaving them together, making the most of what’s fast and scalable without losing what’s human and irreplaceable.</p><p>What about you? <strong>Do you use LLMs to extend your team’s skills or simulate an unavailable colleague?</strong></p><p><em>This article is part of my thesis research on AI’s impact on product team collaboration.

<h4><strong>The shift in product design with the advent of AI and a potential generative experiential future</strong></h4><blockquote>This short essay explores how core concepts in AI can reframe how product designers think about feedback, intent, and the future of our role.</blockquote><p>A lot has been written about the evolution of user experience since before I ever sat in a Barnes &amp; Noble for hours, trying to understand what the letters “H, C, and I” even meant. In the twelve years since that moment, the tools we use have matured, the rules for interaction have solidified, and the role of design has expanded. We have become a bridge connecting users, businesses, and the technologies that serve them.</p><p>Now, with artificial intelligence entering the public mainstream, a new question emerges: <em>where do we go from here?</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/767/1*l9X1bG4711j9SH6efndG5g.png"" /></figure><p>I am not here to push anyone toward <a href=""https://medium.com/@jacquelynyakira/thoughts-on-the-future-of-product-design-in-an-ai-first-world-621be208bfa5"">vibe coding</a>, <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/figma-make-the-biggest-shift-in-ux-ui-since-sketch-5483e18f76d7"">Figma Mak</a>e, or any particular path. Instead, I want to share an idea that came to me while learning the basics of how large language models work. It is a way to start connecting core concepts across domains and help product designers bridge toward the next era of technology. As we move beyond conversational interfaces, we will need new ways of thinking about how to interact with this emerging intelligence.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/451/1*4Psy0Mc7Nh5fyPS89nz9HA.png"" /></figure><p>At the top, I want to recognize that, for the purposes of this article, the term <em>product design</em> can mean many things. Even <a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-product-design/"">Figma’s own definition</a> lists responsibilities that extend far beyond “pushing pixels.” Product designers excel when they have a deep understanding of how technology works and how the business measures success. Whether supporting key metrics or shaping strategy, our work brings together different domains.</p><p>To do that well, we already think in systems, frameworks, research, and telemetry to influence metrics and drive better outcomes. If we take that same mindset and apply it to concepts from AI such as <strong>training corpus, loss, gradients, and intent</strong>, we can start to see a future where design is not just about arranging interfaces but about understanding <em>how systems learn</em>. That is the bridge I want to explore.</p><h3><strong>What AI teaches us about feedback and learning</strong></h3><p>In almost every conversation about technology today, one word keeps surfacing: <em>data.</em> It shapes the experiences we design, the decisions businesses make, and the intelligence that powers modern systems. For this section, I want to focus on how data in AI can teach us something about our own design process, specifically how we learn and iterate.</p><figure><img alt=""Generic graph showing points as if plotted on an x- and y-axis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*5IW-t0Tmhfn0pJTGytGu4w.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s pretend we have a bunch of data at our disposal.</figcaption></figure><p>In user experience, we often work with two types of data: qualitative, which describes what people say, and quantitative, which describes what they do or how often they do it. Let’s focus on the quantitative side for a moment. Imagine plotting the results of a usability study on a simple x and y axis, showing effort versus success rate. Now imagine doing something similar with the data an AI model learns from, what’s called its <strong><em>training corpus</em></strong><em> </em>(<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90916291/what-is-a-corpus-ai-corpora-chatgpt"">FastCompany’s article “What is a ‘corpus’”</a>)<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Sample graphs, showing hypothetical data points along an x- and y-axis, one depicting sample usability data and the other training data for an LLM."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*YWP-fStx1-W9Jfr1rHGFWQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s imagine plotting our data, once for a usability study and another for our training data.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, an LLM’s data isn’t really this simple, but as a metaphor it helps. Once both sets of data are visualized, we can imagine drawing a line that represents our average user response on one chart and the AI’s predicted understanding on the other. The distance between those lines represents something that exists in both worlds: the gap between what we <em>expect</em> and what we <em>observe.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Hypothetical graphs with data points and an overlayed line on each showing average user response and the other illustrating an LLM’s prediction understanding from training data."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*NKc49UaujgiY5KKwqm2xOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Now let’s visualize what, as a green line, the average user response or an LLM’s prediction might look like.</figcaption></figure><p>In design, we call that <em>friction.</em> In AI, it’s called <strong><em>loss</em></strong><em>.</em> Both terms describe the cost of being wrong. When we iterate on a flow or redesign a feature to remove friction, we are, in a sense, minimizing loss. Each round of testing gives us more data to adjust our model of the user’s mental model, just as machine learning systems adjust their internal weights to better predict outcomes (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function"">IBM: What is Loss Function</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Two graphs showing difference between average lines and data points, illustrating the connected concept(s) of user friction and loss."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/1*W-btC1pdHsjJgBsaIvK-nA.png"" /><figcaption>Difference between our predictions and reality impact our work exponentially irregardless if it is for an experience or an LLM we are creating.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider an onboarding flow where users repeatedly abandon a form at the “Company Name” field. Once identified, we might re-label the field or make it optional, reducing friction and improving completion rates. That adjustment mirrors how an AI system corrects its parameters after identifying an error.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating data points towards desired average path to highlight how iteration and optimization are key for usability and LLM performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*XD_oG9iPScZzYRwO7Vjy7w.png"" /><figcaption>Tweaking an LLM’s parameters, or iterating on an experience, helps us optimize both.</figcaption></figure><p>This is where the concept of <strong><em>gradients</em></strong> comes in. In machine learning, a gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed to reduce loss. Think of it like rolling a ball down a landscape toward the lowest point (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent"">IBM: What is Gradient Descent?</a>). The slope tells the model how to adjust its parameters to improve performance. In product design, we do something similar every time we interpret usability data or customer feedback to decide what to change next. Our gradient is directional insight, the sense of where to move to make the experience smoother.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating a curved line representing a downward slope, a gradient descent, with a data point at the bottom showing zero loss or friction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*qHoM1I0rStyKAZN37XXCng.png"" /><figcaption>By tweaking parameters, of an LLM or an experience, we should see a reduction of friction and loss until they, ideally, disappear.</figcaption></figure><p>The iterative process that defines good design is, in many ways, a form of gradient descent. We identify where users struggle, adjust our assumptions, and measure again. Over time, our understanding converges toward what users need. It is not perfect, but neither are machine learning models; both are approximations refined through feedback.</p><p>If there’s one takeaway from this parallel, it’s that feedback, whether from people or from data, is not an afterthought. It’s the learning mechanism that keeps systems aligned with reality. And just as models can overfit to their training data, teams can overfit to internal assumptions or stakeholder preferences. In both cases, the cure is the same: structured, ongoing feedback loops that balance exploration with correction.</p><h3>Design as a system of optimization</h3><p>Now that we understand the shared language of feedback and learning between design and AI, it helps to zoom out and look at how these loops exist across every layer of our work. Most senior product designers already know that the interfaces we craft are only one piece of a much larger system. As noted in <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/"">Nielsen Norman’s levels of UX maturity</a>, mature groups and practitioners move beyond pixels to build frameworks, strategic models, and alignment structures. Even at these higher levels, tight loops of feedback and iteration guide what we do.</p><p>If learning and iteration exist at every level, our role is to understand how those levels connect. Each one has its own kind of <em>loss</em> to minimize and its own signals to optimize. We can roughly think of three layers at play:</p><ul><li><strong>Designers optimizing interfaces</strong>: reducing friction and improving micro-interactions (<em>micro Jobs to Be Done</em>).</li><li><strong>Interfaces optimizing user journeys</strong>: helping people complete the key <em>Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)</em> that deliver product value.</li><li><strong>Organizations optimizing outcomes</strong>: aligning those journeys to business metrics such as adoption, retention, and revenue.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating three key levels in enterprise product design design and various focuses and example intents."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/1*u_7UvtufIi01PV66ZQC8RA.png"" /><figcaption>Product designers working strategically naturally optimize across three key layers in their work. Leveraging key signals across each level, alongside the goals (or intents), lets us understand the loss and how we can iterate to eliminate loss.</figcaption></figure><p>At the first level, designers focus on immediate signals like click rates or error events to reduce friction and guide users toward small but meaningful completions. At the next level, we expand our view to higher-order goals, such as “users complete their profile within thirty days.” These are composite outcomes that indicate whether our product fulfills its promises. Finally, at the organizational level, we zoom out again to see how entire journeys and feature sets contribute to larger KPIs and OKRs. Each level informs the others, forming a continuous loop of optimization from micro-interaction to business strategy.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating simplified click-path and sample metrics across three optimization levels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*sjffZcAXhKJXXoqAhS5v7g.png"" /><figcaption>Mapping optimization cycles in traditional experiential design, with accompanying signals, might look something like this.</figcaption></figure><p>As product designers, our work is shifting away from static interfaces and toward orchestrating these systems of <strong><em>intent</em></strong> which I mentally still hold in the same place as a JTBD. With the looming advent of more generative experiences, our influence lies less in deciding where each pixel goes and more in defining the <em>direction</em> a system should learn toward. Our task becomes identifying the goals for each layer, ensuring the feedback flowing through them is meaningful, and guiding the system to reduce its loss at every scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Simple graphic illustrating how a simple set of activities could change with inclusion of generative UI elements and their potential new signals for measurement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*8sMLLbyQ0JBSwfxSUin98g.png"" /><figcaption>Signals become more about accuracy of identifying user needs (intent) and correlating actions an LLM takes towards supporting desired outcomes (such as delivering most impactful copy to encourage someone to purchase a product).</figcaption></figure><p>Doing that requires data and this is where many organizations struggle. In my experience at both small and large enterprise companies, few have mature instrumentation strategies that connect in-product signals to their KPIs or OKRs. The result is a blind spot: teams can’t see how user intent translates to business outcomes, especially in environments increasingly shaped by AI. When instrumentation is thoughtfully designed, those signals become the gradients we follow. They allow us to see where experiences fall short, measure how far off the mark they are, and iteratively align the product, the user, and the business.</p><p>Directionally similar to other schools of thought, such as from Claudia Canales’ <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/beyond-the-model-a-systems-approach-to-ai-product-design-fd9917750993"">Beyond the Model: a systems approach to AI product design</a>, positioning design as a system, I see it as one of optimization and not creating perfect screens. It’s about cultivating feedback systems that learn alongside users. When product designers learn to interpret intent, orchestrate signals, and balance the goals of each layer, we build the foundation for truly adaptive, AI-infused experiences.</p><h3>From control to guidance</h3><p>As product designers, many of us are used to controlling every element of the experience. But as generative systems begin composing parts of the interface for us, our value shifts from crafting the final form to defining the conditions that shape it. We move from being <em>the maker</em> to being <em>the guide</em> — designing how intent, data, and feedback interact to keep the system aligned with human goals.</p><p>Imagine opening your design tool and seeing a generative prototype already built around inferred intent. You don’t redraw components; you evaluate signals: <em>Did the model understand the job correctly? Did the feedback loop close?</em> That shift, from crafting to curating, is one direction our craft might be headed. Our influence doesn’t disappear; it evolves.</p><p>When we see design as a system of optimization, we stop treating AI as a separate discipline, or the latest tool to use, and start seeing it as a mirror. It reflects how we already work: learning, adjusting, and seeking balance between human intent and technical possibility. The next evolution of design isn’t about replacing what we do, but about scaling how we learn.</p><p>In the next article of this series, I’ll explore how instrumentation and <em>Jobs to Be Done</em> can serve as the connective tissue between intent and measurement — the practical levers we can use to steer generative systems toward meaningful outcomes.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1d372707472d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

The final arrow labelled rebuild points up to the original screen."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zYZTPyhARpMMjBuUMMKo7A.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This article focuses on individuals who use products in English, despite their native language being different — those who reconstruct the context when perceiving information in English.</p><p>About 1.19 billion people use English as an additional language, <a href=""https://www.icls.edu/blog/most-spoken-languages-in-the-world"">compared with</a> 390 million native speakers — leaving 810 million non-native English users worldwide.</p><p>Since English content accounts for roughly <a href=""https://www.isocfoundation.org/2023/05/what-are-the-most-used-languages-on-the-internet/"">55% of all websites</a>, while only about 16 % of the world’s population speak English — including both native and non-native speakers — a large share of those users navigate the web in a language they learned later in life.</p><h3>What is context reconstruction and why it matters</h3><h4>How non-native English speakers perceive information</h4><p>When users interact with content in a non-native language, they don’t just read — they reconstruct. Context reconstruction is a three-step, non-linear loop where users decode unfamiliar words or syntax, translate them inwardly, then rebuild the intended meaning before deciding how to act. It’s not a passive process but an active, effortful one.</p><p><a href=""https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1214282.pdf"">Studies on second-language comprehension</a> show that readers use strategies like translation, paraphrasing, and contextual inference to reconstruct meaning. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/8/1/86"">Research on bilingual reading</a> confirms this process — users draw on background knowledge and context to bridge linguistic gaps.</p><p>In digital interfaces, <a href=""https://www.digitalstudies.org/article/id/9608"">this reconstruction extends beyond reading</a>: multilingual users interpret layout, structure, and tone through the same active meaning-making loop, as UX research on multilingual personas highlights.</p><p>When users process content in a second language, the reconstructive loop <a href=""https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/15502/1/A.E.Schweitzer%20PhD%20Thesis%20November%202016.pdf"">increases cognitive load</a>. Native speakers usually integrate syntax and meaning almost automatically. For non-native speakers, this integration slows down — the brain weighs <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022537179903554"">multiple interpretations before resolving the right one</a> — even when the surrounding context favours only one.</p><p>This pause — invisible but measurable — is where comprehension friction begins.</p><h4>How reconstruction principles apply to native speakers</h4><p>The cognitive load described in multilingual users isn’t unique to them. Similar friction appears for people with <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10036960/?utm"">lower literacy levels or certain cognitive disabilities</a>. Comprehension challenges like decoding, restructuring, and inferring meaning are shared <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Guides/Cognitive_accessibility?utm"">across many cognitive differences</a>. Design patterns that reduce this gap benefit everyone, not only international users — accessibility and language clarity go hand in hand.</p><p>The term ‘native speaker’ itself <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8517917/"">oversimplifies</a> how people use and learn languages. It combines factors like identity, exposure, and cultural background into a binary label that hides real proficiency differences and often reinforces bias. Instead of defining audiences by birth language, teams can describe them through language exposure and functional fluency.</p><p>Setting writing targets around those needs is more practical — for example, aiming for B1–B2 readability levels on the <a href=""https://readable.com/readability/readability-formulas/"">Flesch-Kincaid scale</a> supports broad comprehension across audiences.</p><p>Looking ahead, the line between native and non-native is already blurring. Trans-languaging — the natural mixing of languages — is common in global teams. UX copy isn’t just read by non-native speakers, it’s often <a href=""https://spotify.design/article/were-spilling-the-tea-spotify-ux-writing-questions-answered"">written by them</a>. Inclusive language isn’t just good UX — it’s sound <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/content-design-practices-for-sustainable-communication-in-tech-cbfc679be0cc"">workplace practice</a>.</p><h4>Business perspective on the topic</h4><p>For global products, English source copy should work like a blueprint — clear, structured, and easy to adapt. When it’s written in plain language, localisation teams can translate the meaning without losing intent. That clarity travels: it reduces rework, speeds up releases, and makes products easier to use in any language.</p><p>Plain content also saves money. Teams that act on clear copy often see fewer support requests and faster resolutions — <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.02737"">in some studies</a>, ticket volume dropped by up to 25 % after improving language clarity.</p><p>The same practices that make content easier to translate also make it <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-023-00986-z"">more accessible</a>. Structured, readable text reduces cognitive load for people with learning or attention differences — and helps non-native speakers too. Poor localisation <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1155/2022/6942735"">does the opposite</a>: it confuses users, adds cost, and quietly blocks conversions.</p><p>Language clarity isn’t just a UX win — it’s a business one. Aligned copy, culture, and layout turn communication into scale, making products more inclusive and more efficient at the same time — whether users are solving a problem, completing a task, or looking for quick answers inside a product.</p><h3>Designing for reconstruction</h3><h4>Quality benchmarks</h4><p>Making content reconstruction-ready takes small but deliberate shifts — across language, structure, process, and testing. The checklist below helps teams spot risks early and build toward equity at scale.</p><p><strong>Plain language: </strong><a href=""https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language"">Use plain verbs and avoid idiomatic phrasing</a>: ‘Create account’ or ‘Register’ instead of ‘Sign up’, ‘Start trial period’ rather than ‘Get started’. This reduces parsing complexity and helps meaning travel better across languages.</p><p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Collect key terms in a <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/product-glossary-simple-tool-for-consistent-content-960f8ea1b94f"">product glossary</a> and use them consistently. Avoid synonyms that fragment meaning — if you use ‘plan’ in one screen, don’t switch to ‘package’ or ‘bundle’ elsewhere. Consistency keeps terms stable across journeys and translations.</p><p><strong>Structure: </strong>Clear structure — one of content design’s core principles — <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1305134/full"">improves comprehension</a> for non-native readers and supports accessibility for all.</p><p>Start with information architecture: make navigation transparent and logical. Let users move back, pause, or finish a task midway. Use bullet lists to clarify choices and keep headings, buttons, and labels predictable. This saves time and makes content easy to scan and act on.</p><p>Good structure also supports fast problem-solving — users should find answers where they expect them, without scanning or guessing.</p><p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Plain, well-structured content also boosts accessibility. Around <a href=""https://www.allaccessible.org/blog/web-accessibility-statistics-the-impact-of-disabilities-on-web-use"">16 % of the world’s population</a> live with some form of disability, and small design choices determine whether they can use products effectively.</p><p>Avoid embedding text in images, and always provide alt-text that adds missing context rather than repeating labels.</p><p>Clear hierarchy and scannable sections also make self-help content and automated responses easier to use for people under cognitive load.</p><p><strong>Localisation: </strong>Consider localisation from the wireframe stage. Write source copy that can stand on its own, so meaning stays clear when removed from layout for translation. Even a short phrase like ‘Info updated’ can be misinterpreted — reflexive in one context, passive in another. For example, translators may not know if it means ‘The system updated the info’ or ‘The user updated the info’.</p><figure><img alt=""A split illustration compares two versions of a screen with the text Info updated. On the left, a blue background shows a paper-like character pressing its own button labelled Updated. On the right, a purple background shows a hand pressing the same button. The image shows how the phrase Info updated can mean either the system updated the information or the user did."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AxBc9ygNg7C1OaiZL2e6Pg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Integrate continuous-localisation tools early to prevent late copy freezes and rework.</p><p><strong>Test and research:</strong> Include non-native speakers in every usability round. Ask them to pause and explain what they think a piece of copy means — you’ll quickly see where reconstruction fails.</p><p>Testing this way exposes issues that standard metrics often miss and helps build empathy across teams. Include tasks that mirror real support interactions — finding help, clarifying messages, or following troubleshooting steps — to reveal hidden friction.</p><h4>Reconstruction blocks</h4><p>When users reconstruct meaning, language and layout can either support or block that process. Even small mismatches can escalate into task failure. Beyond well-known localisation issues like <a href=""https://m2.material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-layout"">directionality</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/@finnclark/designing-for-localisation-what-you-could-be-thinking-about-320184be10a9"">text expansion</a> there are recurring but less obvious tensions.</p><p>These patterns create friction in comprehension and task completion — addressing them early reduces errors, rework, and user frustration.</p><p><strong>Phrasal verbs: </strong>Phrases like ‘Sign up’ or ‘Sign in’ <a href=""https://riyajawandhiya.medium.com/figuring-out-when-to-use-sign-up-vs-register-vs-join-while-looking-at-principles-of-ux-writing-26d299f514dc"">often confuse users</a> — even native speakers. The difference feels small but delays action, especially when both appear on the same screen.</p><p>Use clear, literal verbs that describe the action. These forms translate more reliably and reduce hesitation. Test them with users to confirm comprehension.</p><p><strong>Idioms: </strong>Colloquial phrases like ‘Heads up’ or ‘Kick things off’ rely on cultural metaphors that don’t carry across languages. Replace them with phrasing that makes action explicit. Literal phrasing keeps intent clear and prevents cultural distortion.</p><p><strong>Cultural assumptions: </strong>Error messages like ‘Oops, something went wrong’ may sound casual in English but dismissive elsewhere. In languages with layered politeness, such as Korean or Japanese, <a href=""https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=5350&amp;context=lkcsb_research#:~:text=Abstract%20A%20very%20prominent%20feature,and%20directions%20for%20future%20research"">tone directly shapes trust</a>.</p><p>Write clear, neutral guidance instead — ‘We couldn’t load your details. Please refresh or try again’. Matching tone to user expectations builds reliability and respect.</p><p><strong>Gendered grammar: </strong>English verbs are neutral, but many languages inflect for gender. In Spanish or French, mismatched gender agreement <a href=""https://linguistics.washington.edu/sites/linguistics/files/documents/research/language_learning.pdf"">slows reading</a> and can sound awkward. Translators often have to choose gendered forms even when the English source is neutral.</p><p>Avoid phrasing that forces this choice — use ‘Confirm’ instead of ‘I agreed’ or ‘I’m ready’. Check how target languages express gender early in localisation to keep translations inclusive.</p><p><strong>Auto-generated alt-text and captions: </strong>Machine-generated captions and alt-text <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9395872/"">often miss nuance or context</a>. When captions run faster than about <a href=""https://dcmp.org/learn/601-captioning-key---presentation-rate"">160 words per minute</a>, comprehension drops sharply.</p><p>Review all accessibility copy manually for clarity, neutrality, and pacing. Treat it as part of the user experience, not metadata.</p><p><strong>Split attention: </strong>When instructions appear far from the fields they describe — for example, password rules above an input box — users must hold information in working memory. That extra effort <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12366468/"">increases cognitive load</a>.</p><p>Keep related information close together in both layout and flow. Memory should not have to carry UX.</p><p><strong>Choice overload: </strong>Too many visible options overwhelm users, especially non-native speakers. Studies show that greater menu complexity increases <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357695637_An_Analysis_on_the_Impact_of_Choice_Overload_to_Consumer_Decision_Paralysis"">decision paralysis</a>, while simplified layouts improve task speed by about <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01292"">25 percent</a>.</p><p>Apply <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/progressive-disclosure?srsltid=AfmBOooR-h3xZ1WJIY52UypnK4QcAYctQ_n6DXzch7p3qOg1Ya6RZB-Q"">progressive disclosure</a> and group related items logically. Fewer, clearer decisions reduce drop-offs and support comprehension.</p><p>Reconstruction fails when copy or layout forces users to infer too much. To avoid this, designers must go beyond surface fixes and invest in understanding how language and culture shape perception.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-does-knowledge-of-other-languages-impact-your-perspective-as-a-ux-designer-1ecb6bf99690"">Language and design are inseparable</a>: learning how different languages structure thought and communication broadens a designer’s perspective and leads to more inclusive solutions. Awareness of cultural and linguistic diversity helps anticipate preferences, avoid stereotypes, and create source copy that is clearer, more adaptable, and easier to localise.</p><h3>Final thought &amp; first step</h3><p>Design is what people get, not what we write.</p><p>To get information, hundreds of millions of people who use English as a second or additional language reconstruct what they read — decoding, reordering, and rebuilding intent before action.</p><p>Awareness of this effort changes how we design. It makes us notice the friction that usually stays invisible — where meaning slips or clarity fades. Non-native content designers and UX writers experience this every day, and their insight helps reveal those hidden gaps.</p><p>When we design with that awareness, content starts to speak across languages — clearer for non-natives, smoother for everyone.</p><p>The first step is noticing how people get meaning — and designing from there.</p><h4>Checklist for designing with reconstruction in mind</h4><ul><li>Use verbs that make it clear what users can do next</li><li>Skip idioms and culture-bound phrasing that don’t translate well</li><li>Use hierarchy, lists, and consistent patterns so users can see how information connects</li><li>Ensure copy stays clear when removed from its visual context or translated</li><li>Test with multilingual users to uncover hidden friction</li><li>Bring in non-native content designers—they experience reconstruction first-hand</li><li>Focus on how users build meaning, not how design presents it</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=deae09b93a93"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-invisible-gap-designing-for-users-who-reconstruct-not-just-read-deae09b93a93"">The invisible gap: Designing for users who reconstruct, not just read</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

But UX should never be reduced to just trendy visuals, and it would be a mistake to see M3E as simply a refresh to MD’s aesthetic sensibilities.</p><p>M3E is at its core speaking to the problems that a large plurality of users, particularly older age groups, have experienced to varying degrees with the dominant UI design paradigm of the last decade or so — ‘flat’ UI design. These overly-simplified designs showed a lack of <strong>clear interaction signifiers</strong>, leading to <strong>click uncertainty</strong>, and <strong>barriers to quick scanning</strong>.</p><p>Digging into the guidelines, the research, and the changes Google has pushed thus far, it’s clear that M3E represents the MD team’s attempt to address these limitations of flat UI design, applying the conclusions of UX researchers over the years, now supported by Google’s own usability studies.</p><figure><img alt=""A collection of 10 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QzkU3a_Pelfur_EvQnjNrQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Some promo material for Google’s M3E update.

(<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><h3>Flat vs. skeuomorphic design</h3><p>Coincidentally as I write this very paragraph, we can (but you probably won’t!) celebrate fifteen years since the worldwide release of Windows Phone 7 — October 21st, 2010.</p><p>Although I think it’s safe to say that Windows Phone is nowadays remembered more for its failure than anything else, Windows Phone 7 is today perhaps most important for its influence on the realm of interface design. From perhaps the earliest days of consumer computing, UIs relied on a set of principles known as <strong>skeuomorphism</strong> — taking physical cues from the real-world, like shadows, depth, and imagery, to communicate the functionality of an interface.</p><p>This methodology is today most fondly remembered from Apple’s early iOS apps, especially the ones which took skeuomorphism to an almost pantomime degree by imitating the functionality and look of real, traditional objects or devices. A notebook became a notes app with a yellow paper background and ruled margins; a newsagents’ cabinet carried over into the newsstand app, with digitally articulated oak wood-texture shelves.</p><p>Skeuomorphism was essentially a very complex set of <strong>signifiers</strong> — <a href=""https://jnd.org/signifiers-not-affordances/"">cues that an object uses to communicate how to use it</a> — which communicated functionality to the user by relying on our real-world knowledge. Eventually, once interaction paradigms became <a href=""https://jnd.org/affordances-and-design/"">cultural convention</a>, skeuomorphic flourishes became visual flair and noise, distracting as it was no longer necessary to teach functionality by relating the real to the digital.</p><h4>Flat design</h4><p>By 2014, digital interfaces no longer seemed constrained by the users’ presumed greater familiarity with the physical world. Cue <strong>flat design</strong>. Windows 8 went full brutalist minimalism; iOS 7 stripped away all the Steve Jobs gloss; and Android Lollipop brought Material Design to the party. Material was always a little different, basing itself off a series of stacked-paper metaphors which included a healthy dose of drop shadows (<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design/"">NN/g called it ‘Flat 2.0’</a>), but it was still, at its core, a flat approach.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two versions of the iPhone calendar app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xHNivWuKzFhnGfhAzU_5VQ.png"" /><figcaption>When Apple adopted flat design: the calendar app’s skeuomorphic look in iOS 6 (left) vs. iOS 7 (right). (Moss, 2013)</figcaption></figure><p>Flat design’s philosophy, in the great modernist tradition, was exceedingly simple: <strong>remove everything that’s not needed</strong>.</p><p>Retreating from the overtly heavy visual ornamentation that skeuomorphism had become infamous for was a step in the right direction. But along with the trend toward simplification, researchers found that many flat design implementations also harboured a worrying tendency to go to far, to <strong>oversimplify</strong>, leaning too hard on assumptions of user familiarity with common layouts. In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces that produced hesitation rather than harmony.</p><p>In the name of minimalism, these flat UIs stripped away too many visual cues, leaving interactable elements without signifiers and creating interfaces which produced hesitation rather than harmony</p><p>Ever since flat design emerged researchers, particularly those at the Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g), have been hard at work studying these usability challenges. In the interests of time and space, mine and yours, a short guide to some of the best research is presented below, although I recommend you take the time to read each article for yourself.</p><h3>Flat design &amp; click uncertainty: The 22 percent problem</h3><p>In 2017, Kate Moran and the NN/g team ran an extensive eyetracking study into the then-emerging flat design. They presented 71 users with 9 different pairs of website designs: one with strong visual signifiers (colour, shading, and/or depth); and one with weak or non-existent signifiers (utilising reduced contrast and/or containment). Participants were presented with simple real-world tasks, such as “<em>You will see a page from a hotel website. Reserve this hotel room.</em>”</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side closeup of two different text treatments"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CP4f35b11kmr2tzYZWr0Dg.png"" /><figcaption>A closeup of a jewellery website target link tested by NN/g, strong-signifier (left) and weak-signifier (right) versions. (Moran, 2017a)</figcaption></figure><p>The results were revealed in one <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-criticisms-flat-design/"">much-discussed</a> article, ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-ui-less-attention-cause-uncertainty/"">Flat UI Elements Attract Less Attention and Cause Uncertainty</a>’, from which two damning statistics emerge:</p><ul><li>Users spent<strong> 22 percent more time completing tasks</strong> on pages with weak signifiers.</li><li>They also had <strong>25 percent more page fixations</strong> on the weak-signifier pages, i.e. their eyes spent more time scanning the page before they found what they needed.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of heatmaps"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RcCFcwUXVrnLjXhkPCGpNA.png"" /><figcaption>The heatmap of the jewellery website pair shows stronger fixations on the strong-signifier interface (left) versus the weak-signifier version (right). The user task was to find the pearl jewellery. (Moran, 2017a)</figcaption></figure><p>I should note here that the NN/g study was not embarking on a tirade against the whole of flat design. However, the core tenet of flat design is <strong>simplification</strong> of an interface, and the point of the study was to discover how the extent to which this principle is applied affects usability. Many flattened interfaces suffer from these exact pitfalls, and the stimuli pairs that Moran et al. tested were in fact sourced from real website pages.</p><p>(Just the other day I actually ran into an e-commerce website which shared the same button styling, or lack thereof, as in the weak-signifier version of the jewellery website above — evidently the study’s lessons remain relevant to this very day)</p><h4>Click certainty vs. uncertainty</h4><p>NN/g’s heatmaps revealed what Moran labelled “click uncertainty.” On the strong-signifier pages, user attention was more often than not far more focused and confident on than on the flat pages. Because the flat versions of each page had stripped away certain cues that users rely on to differentiate what’s clickable and what’s not, they had to spend more time scanning the page, expending more cognitive load to locate the UI element which would complete the task given to them.</p><p>It’s the opposite of what good UX aims for. To quote Moran:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We want our users to have experiences that are easy, seamless, and enjoyable. Users need to be able to look at a page, and understand their options immediately. They need to be able to glance at what they’re looking for and know instantly, ‘Yep, that’s it.’<em>”</em></blockquote><p>But although it was a significant, extensive piece of research, Moran’s study was not the first — and would not be the last — to sound the alarm on the potential pitfalls of flat design.</p><h3>Further UX research</h3><p>One of the earliest studies addressing the usability drawbacks of flat UI designs focused on an early progenitor of the trend: Windows 8. NN/g’s ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/windows-8-disappointing-usability/"">Windows 8 — Disappointing Usability for Both Novice and Power Users</a>’ (2012) strongly rejected the overtly flat changes Windows 8 had touted: poorly signposted buttons, hardly distinguishable from text labels or info cards, and icons that were “<em>flat, monochromatic, and coarsely simplified,</em>” falling into the background of the overall information architecture.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark-blue settings menu with a 3x3 grid of white menu link buttons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/344/1*vmQRRzsnFVoXEXYOb37ylQ.png"" /><figcaption>A disturbingly flat settings menu in Windows 8. (Nielsen, 2012)</figcaption></figure><p>And similar conclusions to the Windows 8 article were noted in two other studies in 2015:</p><p><strong>Lücken et al.</strong> published ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110443929-039"">Evaluation of buttons in the context of the Flat Design style</a>,’ which found that stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>In <strong>Burmistrov et al.</strong>’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-22668-2_10"">Flat Design vs Traditional Design</a>,’ the task of identifying clickable objects created a higher cognitive load and rate of error in flat website designs than in ‘traditional’ site designs. Scanning in a grid of flat icons also took twice as long as scanning in a grid of skeuomorphic ones.</p><p>Stripping away strong visual affordances from a button exponentially raises user hesitation time, and decreases the chance it actually gets clicked.</p><p>An NN/g study from 2015, ‘<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">Long-Term Exposure to Flat Design: How the Trend Slowly Decreases User Efficiency</a>,’ was one of the earliest to note that young adult users were more effective at identifying clickable elements in flat interfaces, while also pointing out that flat design had trained users to spend more time hesitating before clicking. But despite younger users’ superior performance with flat UIs, the study noted that “<strong><em>young adult users don’t enjoy click uncertainty </em></strong><em>any more than other user groups</em>.”</p><p>More recently, in 2022’s ‘<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1814867"">From skeuomorphism to flat design</a>,’ <strong>Urbano et al.</strong> delineated and tested three interface design styles: flat, skeuomorphic, and ‘skeuominimalist’. The researchers created mockups reflecting the differences between the three styles, incorporating their approaches to colour and shading, adding varying degrees of visual signifiers for interactable elements. Their findings revealed that purely flat designs significantly increase click error rates across <em>all</em> age groups, and <strong>for older users, task completion time was notably sabotaged</strong>.</p><p>One common thread runs through the research: flat design’s tendency to strip away visual signifiers from interfaces inevitably impairs usability. It made interfaces harder to use, especially for older users. Rather than focusing user attention on what matters, making UIs <strong>too clean</strong>, <strong>too white</strong>, <strong>too flat</strong> has the opposite effect: users can lose the ability to discern what they should be paying attention to at all, generating click hesitation and increasing scanning time.</p><p>While our humble UX researchers have been studying these issues for many years, not many companies have actually noticed and followed suit — but with M3E, Google has bucked the trend.</p><h3>From flat design to Material 3 Expressive</h3><p>The example below is a screenshot from <a href=""https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive"">one of Google’s new M3E guideline articles</a>, and it perfectly demonstrates how Google has brought the weight of UX research to bear on their design philosophy:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of a financial app home screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JfALVeLBXkvIRgLVss7BOw.png"" /><figcaption>Do’s and don’t’s from Google’s new guidelines. (<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>The flat design (left) uses implicit whitespace and section labels to enable users to understand the structure, requiring extra cognitive effort and potentially introducing click hesitancy.</p><p>The expressive design (right), by contrast, has instant visual structure:</p><ul><li><strong>Containment</strong> using contrasted shades is used to signify important interactive elements.</li><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/common-region/""><strong>Common region</strong></a> boundaries — stronger than proximity or similarity alone — separate distinct groups of elements in a rounded container. The subtle corner shape between each element in the container, background colour dividers between the contained buttons, makes each a distinct element.</li><li><strong>Stronger colours</strong> make buttons more obvious against the light background.</li></ul><p>Colour and shade are used not for visual flair, but to <strong>efficiently</strong> <strong>signal key interactive elements</strong> and <strong>instantly communicate visual structure</strong>, ensuring the user doesn’t get lost in whitespace.</p><h4>The changes so far</h4><p>We haven’t seen full overhauls of apps that resemble the bold and experimental mockups shown in M3E’s initial load of promo material. But since June of this year, Google has begun rolling out design refreshes to their roster of apps, implementing changes that take cues from the new Expressive guidelines:</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of the Gmail email app inbox screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8snae9amX10NThLf8tBn3A.png"" /><figcaption>The Gmail inbox, before (left) and after (right) M3E.

(Li, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Again, <strong>containment </strong>(each settings link and each email get their own containers), <strong>common region </strong>(related settings and emails list explicitly grouped) and <strong>stronger colours </strong>(see the M3E Gmail’s compose button) are all strategically implemented, adding important signifiers to critical interactions, and creating immediately clear structure.</p><p>We were lucky enough to get a large amount of the research behind these changes published by Google. And it’s clear from their findings that these changes were aimed at solving the problems with flat design that we’ve seen in the research so far — lack of clear signifiers leading to click uncertainty and barriers to scanning.</p><h3>Google’s research findings</h3><p>In the snappy article which explained the research behind the update, ‘<a href=""https://design.google/library/expressive-material-design-google-research"">Better, Easier, Emotional UX</a>,’ the MD design team waxed lyrical about the origins of M3E:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>Back in 2022, our research intern was studying user sentiment toward Material Design in Google apps. After mentioning her initial findings to colleagues in a Munich beer hall, she sparked a team-wide design debate: Why did all these apps look so similar? So boring? Wasn’t there room to dial up the <em>feeling</em>?<em>”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""A collection of 9 phone screen mockups on a pastel purple background, showing various concept designs that showcase the standout aesthetic features of Material 3 Expressive: experimentation with varied button sizes, lots of colour, and bohemian font choices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyMRWpPABImhPv35gGbyuQ.png"" /><figcaption>Dial up the FEELING! (<em>Start building</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>The results of this debate speak for themselves. Instead of just redesigning based on designerly intuition, Google embarked on a massive three-year-long, 18,000 participant-strong research study, testing hundreds of design variations across 46 different research studies and conducting surveys and focus groups to gather emotional responses.</p><p>Material 3 Expressive was the result, and Google’s findings validate everything that UX researchers have been pointing out about flat design for years: click uncertainty, barriers to scanning, and age gaps.</p><h4>4x faster discovery</h4><p>Using the latest eye-tracking equipment to analyse where users attention was focused, Google had participants interact with 10 different apps pairs: one in current M3 style, and a new M3E version.</p><p>One example was that of an email app: where the current M3 Gmail design relied on whitespace alone to contain the key action (sending the email), hiding it in the top app bar next to other secondary buttons, the M3 Expressive design heightened the visual signifiers, making the primary interaction a large, explicitly contained and contrasted button, placed just above the keyboard.</p><p>Users discovered the send button <strong>four times faster</strong> in the Expressive redesign.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison showing two versions of an email drafting screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dVScxiHpXmmBY9qok8LKTA.png"" /><figcaption>Two versions of a concept email app Google used in its testing. (<em>Better, Easier</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>That’s a significant improvement, and it demonstrates just how much more of an additional cognitive load was added by the flatter information architecture and reduced visual signifiers that flat design boasted. The benefits also extended beyond fixation time: across all the Expressive design apps tested, the time users took to tap on the key action actually <strong>decreased by seconds</strong>.</p><p>The key takeaway isn’t only that Google’s M3E designs are better, but that the research was right: flattening an interface too much results in decreased ease of scanning, and hesitancy about where to click.</p><h4>Age gaps flattened</h4><p>As we’ve seen, digital products usually exhibit a measurable performance difference between younger and older users. Older age groups take longer to identify key UI elements, while <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/flat-design-long-exposure/"">younger users can often pick up on subtle design cues</a> which allow them to identify key actions much faster.</p><p>So perhaps the most important finding from Google’s research is that their Expressive design tactics have resulted in a dramatic <strong>erasure of this gap in performance</strong>:</p><figure><img alt=""Line graph showing that UI elements were spotted faster (in seconds) in expressive designs across all age groups"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BIhWwgmrSZaIy_RXziyExA.png"" /><figcaption>Chart of M3 vs M3E fixation times per age group. (<em>Better, Easier</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Yet M3E not just about trying to help older users become digital natives. With this update, the Google Design team has acknowledged that visual signifiers do cognitive work that benefits all users. Strategically applied shading, borders and containment are hallmarks of good design, not just visual flair for the sake of visual flair.</p><p>Strategically applied shading, borders and containment are hallmarks of good design, not just visual flair for the sake of visual flair.</p><h3>Conclusion: The return of colour</h3><p>The MD team obviously aren’t high on nostalgia for skeuomorphism. They aren’t bringing back wood panelling, glass sheen or yellow note paper textures — they’re bringing back <strong>functional signifiers</strong>, the visual cues that help users identify interactive elements and allow them to understand the information architecture at a glance. M3E is a data-driven correction to the problems of flat design that researchers have noted for more than a decade.</p><p>Mind you, the update isn’t perfect. The two new wavy progress indicators, while a lovely idea, do look a bit like a shuffling worm and a wobbly intestinal tract. You be the judge:</p><figure><img alt=""Animation of linear and circular purple progress indicators showing determinate progress and indeterminate progress"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZiKNgUuDmjx51fRYhCkxLw.gif"" /><figcaption>M3E’s new earthworm &amp; human intestine indicators. (<em>Progress indicators</em>, 2025)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s probably not a coincidence that M3 Expressive comes at a time when it seems like the whole world is retreating from minimalism: style, buildings, design everywhere, just look around! Vogue Australia’s <a href=""https://www.vogue.com.au/vogue-living/design/decor-trends-2025/image-gallery/8a0c4e8a1db9042a17cd6a8eec7e9112"">guide to 2025’s interior design trends</a> even reads like it could be a pitch for M3E — ‘<em>express yourself</em>,’ ‘<em>bolder is better</em>,’ ‘<em>the return of colour</em>.’</p><p>This is the line us UX designers must tread. Trends, to a certain extent, allow us to identify what users are familiar with, what they might find the most ‘modern’ or appealing.</p><p>But an app isn’t a house. It’s a 2D tool, projected on a crystalline display, that solves a problem for a user, and I would argue the aesthetic choices of our 2D tools may have far more of a knock-on effect on usability scores than aesthetic interior design choices do. Perhaps it’s because we interact with our apps with the minutia of fingers and eyes alone, rather than the full-body experience of a house. Or perhaps it’s just discipline tunnel vision.</p><p>The research — from NN/g’s heatmaps to Google’s 18,000-person studies — has definitively shown that blindly following popular trends (i.e. flat design) without studying the utility impact can do far more harm than good.</p><p>As designers, we should never have let ourselves be satisfied with the assumption that, since many users have become familiar with general interface patterns, we can afford to go totally minimalist in our approach to content, layout and signifiers. Conventions are a powerful and necessary tool, and designers should always aim to leverage a users’ existing knowledge. But there are limits to every law. UI design, particularly for products used by a broad range of ages like Android, should be able to articulate itself for every user, offering <strong>clarity of function</strong> as well as simple form.</p><p>Rather than let their design guidelines enter a phase of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/"">rampant design cacophony</a>, Google have chosen to build on the years of usability research accumulated since flat design’s inception. It’s an incredibly encouraging development.</p><p>On one last point — although this article is primarily about the research trail from the earliest flat design studies to M3E — it would be remiss of me not to note M3E’s exciting new aesthetic possibilities. In a culture when users are becoming increasingly bored with minimalist trends, interfaces injected with additional artistic intent and emotional appeal have the potential to stand out from the bland, unexciting competition.</p><p>The keywords of M3 Expressive — delight, joy, playfulness, modernity — are exciting for designers and users alike, but these touches must be applied with intent, skill and strategy, always testing with that age-old question, so often lost in translation: ‘<em>does this improve the end user experience?</em>’</p><h3>Sources</h3><p><em>Better, Easier, Emotional UX</em>.

<h4>The illusion of intelligence is the new frontier of deception.</h4><figure><img alt=""Animated character with pale skin, scraggly black hair, and an eerie expression. Wears a distorted Superman logo on a purple suit. Dark, vibrant background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UD88HUJXrf-IcJHasqUqNg.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro"">dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro</a></figcaption></figure><p>I was a huge Superman fan as a kid. In fact, my first tattoo was of the Superman symbol — I know, cheesy. But there was something about that idea of strength guided by purpose that stuck with me. However, one character that truly captured my imagination was Superman’s failed copy — <a href=""https://dcau.fandom.com/wiki/Bizarro"">Bizarro</a>.</p><p>Bizarro is a botched experiment by the genius villain <a href=""https://superman.fandom.com/wiki/Lex_Luthor"">Lex Luthor</a> to replicate Superman. He sort of looks like the hero we know, has his powers, and even tries to do good — but everything he does comes out wrong. He saves people by endangering them, speaks in twisted opposites, and mistakes harm for help. He isn’t evil — just reversed. That inversion — an imitation of greatness that misunderstands its essence — is a fitting metaphor for modern AI.</p><p>But this metaphor isn’t just poetic—Apple’s 2025 paper <a href=""https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking""><em>The Illusion of Thinking</em></a> backs it up. In the study, Apple researchers tested a class of models they called “Large Reasoning Models,” essentially Large Language Models (LLMs) retuned for reasoning, using puzzles like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi"">Tower of Hanoi</a>. At first the models performed well, but as the puzzles grew more complex, their reasoning began to fail.</p><p>Instead of increasing their effort, the models produced shorter and less coherent thought chains, often stopping even when more computation time was available. The researchers observed that their reasoning degraded, revealing that the systems were matching patterns that appeared like reasoning rather than genuinely reasoning.</p><p>As complexity increased, their logic collapsed into pure prediction. The models recognized the shape of thought without ever truly thinking. The result sounded intelligent but felt hollow.</p><p>At the end of the day, these “intelligent” machines are little more than glorified autocorrect systems — predicting, not thinking. That’s dangerous, because it blurs the line between intelligence and imitation.</p><p>It’s a false illusion sold by powerful tech companies as they rake in billions. If I didn’t know better, I’d call the entire <a href=""https://www.library.hbs.edu/working-knowledge/ai-schemes-could-make-bernie-madoffs-fraud-look-trivial-eugene-soltes"">AI movement a modern Ponzi scheme</a> — but that’s a discussion for another day.</p><p>Anyone who’s used tools like ChatGPT knows the frustration of arguing with a machine that doesn’t know it’s wrong. And yes, I say “arguing” because I often catch myself yelling (with colorful language) at these conversational AI tools — a fact I’m not proud of.</p><p>I know it’s foolish to yell at a machine, but in my defense, maybe it should act more like a machine instead of a compulsive liar.</p><p>Just the other day, I asked it to debug a JavaScript snippet it had written. When I said it wasn’t working, it replied, “You’re absolutely correct! The code appears to be flaky.” Code it had just given me. I was actually more surprised by the use of the word flakey than the fact that it gave me broken code.</p><p>That moment perfectly captured the essence of modern AI — confident errors, fluent nonsense, and zero accountability. This is where we’ve landed as a society. We’ve traded honesty for efficiency.</p><p>To understand why a model would confidently call its own code “flaky,” we need to look at how we have historically defined intelligence in machines, and how that definition has shifted.</p><p>The earliest approach in AI, <a href=""https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/11/18/what-is-symbolic-artificial-intelligence/"">symbolic intelligence</a>, encoded human-knowledge in explicit rules and logic. It relied on structured reasoning — if-then statements, symbol hierarchies, and clear inference paths. The advantage—every conclusion is transparent and traceable.</p><p>But the disadvantage—when faced with messy, real-world inputs (such as image recognition or natural language), the rule-based system struggles to scale or cope with ambiguity.</p><p>Following the limitations of rule-based symbolic methods, the field shifted to <a href=""https://www.aaas.org/taxonomy/term/9/heuristic-and-statistical-artificial-intelligence"">statistical artificial intelligence</a>. Instead of encoding explicit logic, this approach relies on probability, large datasets and pattern recognition.</p><p>The system doesn’t “reason” in human terms — it correlates. It learns statistical relationships between inputs and outcomes, then uses those to predict. The trade-off—high scalability and flexibility, but weak transparency and little genuine “understanding.”</p><p>And then there’s today’s g<a href=""https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI"">enerative artificial intelligence</a> — the kind behind text, images, and music. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are trained on massive datasets scraped from the internet, learning statistical patterns across billions of examples.</p><p>LLMs use <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/transformer-model"">transformer networks</a> to learn contextual relationships by predicting the next word across billions of parameters, creating language that feels coherent but remains purely probabilistic.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/diffusion-models"">diffusion models</a> generate images by gradually denoising random noise into structured visuals, guided by patterns learned from vast datasets.</p><p>Both systems learn correlations, not concepts — they model likelihoods, not meaning.</p><p>The trajectory is clear — the further we’ve moved from the transparency of logic (symbolic AI) toward the fluency of prediction (generative AI), the more convincingly human the output appears — and the more fundamentally alien the process behind it becomes.</p><p>This is the paradox of modern AI. In our quest to build reliable intelligence, we created its flawed reflection — a brilliant mimic whose fluency guarantees imitation, but whose lack of reasoning prevents the very understanding and accountability we need to trust it.</p><p>But maybe it’s not entirely bad. Generative AI feeds on what already exists, which means originality still belongs to us. That gives creators a chance to stand apart — to make what the machine can only imitate.</p><p>The more I learn about AI, the less I fear it taking our jobs — and the more I fear its power to distort truth. These systems don’t think—they replicate. They strip away context until meaning becomes optional.</p><p>In that sense, Big Tech has become our Lex Luthor — brilliant, self-assured, and convinced it’s saving humanity while quietly trying to own it. Its creations mirror its ambition—powerful, profitable, and fundamentally indifferent to the truth.</p><p>That’s the real danger — not that AI will outthink us, but that it will outproduce us, flooding the world with fluent illusions that sound right but aren’t. It’s our own version of Bizarro — except this time, there’s no Superman coming to save us.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce6d4ba04f64"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/we-wanted-superman-level-ai-instead-we-got-bizarro-ce6d4ba04f64"">We wanted Superman-level AI.
