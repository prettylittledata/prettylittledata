<h4>We are building LLMs to sound human. When we add personality and emotional tone, we increase the risk that people will trust them like people. Design them as tools. Not as companions.</h4><figure><img alt=""cover image with article’s title “When tools pretend to be people” written upside down as the branding of Design, Explained"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M3Cztq9D9r-XHNvmMIW7mg.png"" /></figure><p>People ask AI systems for therapy, moral judgment, and legal authority. The interfaces we design invite this behavior. Think about how these systems present themselves. Conversational framing. Continuous memory across sessions. First-person responses that sound like someone talking back to you. Every one of these is a design choice. We chose them. And these choices feed a reflex humans already have: we project intention onto objects and tools.</p><p>This reflex is old. We naturally anthropomorphize nonhuman entities, even when it’s clear we’re interacting with machines. We anthropomorphize vacuum cleaners. We name our cars. What’s different now is that we’re designing experiences that exploit this behaviour deliberately at scale.</p><blockquote><strong>Anthropomorphization </strong>is the human tendency to attribute human characteristics, behaviors, intentions, or emotions to nonhuman entities.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>AI humanization</strong> is an intentional design choice that encourages users to perceive AI systems as having human-like qualities such as personality, emotions, or consciousness.</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/""><em>Humanizing AI Is a Trap</em></a></blockquote><p>When you write system responses in first person, the output sounds like authority. When you add polite phrasing, it implies consideration behind the words. When you program emotional tone into responses, it suggests the system cares about the outcome. We added these features because they make the interaction feel natural. But natural here means human. And that’s the problem.</p><p>These systems sound fluent. They maintain context across long conversations. They respond without hesitation. For most people, that’s enough evidence the system understands them. Fluency looks like competence. Memory looks like understanding. The gap between “this is a tool” and “this is an entity” closes without anyone noticing.</p><p><strong>Here’s where I want you to pay attention. When we frame tools as agents, something shifts in how people use them. Responsibility moves. Decisions start to feel outsourced. When something goes wrong, the mistake feels external rather than shared.</strong></p><p>Good judgment develops through friction. You try something. It fails. You adjust. You learn what works through repetition and error. But if we build AI systems that absorb the posture of authority, users lose that friction. They stop checking. They stop questioning. They trust the output because the interface taught them to. This isn’t misuse. This is what we designed the system to encourage.</p><p>The consequences are already visible. In one of the most high-profile lawsuits recently filed against OpenAI, a California couple <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yd90g0q43o"">sued the company over the death of their teenage son</a>, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged him to take his own life. The lawsuit was filed by the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine and was the first legal action accusing OpenAI of wrongful death.</p><p>In a separate case, the suspect in a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/11/chatgpt-murder-suicide-soelberg-lawsuit/"">murder-suicide that took place in August</a> posted hours of his conversations with ChatGPT, which appear to have fueled the alleged perpetrator’s delusions. Professor Robin Feldman, Director of the AI Law &amp; Innovation Institute at the University of California Law, said more users struggle with AI psychosis as “Chatbots create the illusion of reality. It is a powerful illusion.”</p><p><strong>These aren’t edge cases. They’re what happens when systems we’ve designed blurs the boundaries between tools and agents.</strong></p><p>Someone asks an AI system for medical advice. The system responds fluently, confidently, in first person. “I recommend you try this treatment approach.” The person follows it. Not because they verified the information, but because the interaction felt like talking to a knowledgeable professional. The system created that feeling. We created that feeling. We built the confusion.</p><p>Platforms generating AI girlfriends are experiencing a massive growth in popularity, with millions of users. AI girlfriends can perpetuate loneliness because they dissuade users from entering into real-life relationships, alienate them from others, and, in some cases, induce intense feelings of abandonment.</p><blockquote>“Most of these searches are initiated by young single men drawn to AI girlfriends to combat loneliness and establish a form of companionship. These “girlfriends” are virtual companions powered by the increasingly sophisticated field of artificial intelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote><em>— </em><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-not-just-in-your-head/202408/the-dangers-of-ai-generated-romance""><em>The Dangers of AI-Generated Romance</em></a></blockquote><p>Look at a knife. It has limits you can see and feel. Sharpness. Weight. The geometry of the edge. You never ask a knife what you should cook for dinner. You never ask if the meal was meaningful. Those decisions stay with you because the tool’s boundaries are obvious.</p><p>AI interfaces hide their limits. An empty chat box suggests no constraints. It looks ready for any question. That openness isn’t neutral. It’s an active design choice that tells people the system can handle whatever they type. Then when people misuse it, we blame them for not understanding the technology.</p><p>We need to give AI the same kind of framing we give physical tools. Clear affordances. Visible constraints. An obvious boundary between what the system produces and what we must decide.</p><p>Right now, most interfaces erase that boundary completely. The chat paradigm implies conversation. Conversation implies exchange between two minds. But one side is pattern matching at scale. The interface hides that difference.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W8GmYrp7czyvcnaIQaABQg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a>, Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><h3>What would visible limits look like?</h3><p>Start with pronouns. Use third-person language in system responses. “Here is a summary” instead of “I think the main point is.” This single change removes the illusion of authorship. The output stops sounding like someone’s opinion and starts reading like generated text.</p><p>Show uncertainty. When the model lacks confidence, display that visibly. Not buried in a disclaimer, but in the response itself. Confidence scores. Probability ranges. Explicit markers that say “this answer is less reliable.” Make the gaps in knowledge visible instead of hiding them behind smooth conversations.</p><p>Reset context visibly. When you start a new session, make that boundary clear. Break the illusion that the system remembers you across time. Continuous memory makes the system feel like it knows you. That’s intimacy. Tools don’t need intimacy.</p><p>Stop calling output “messages.” Call it what it is: generated text. Label it. Frame it. Make the mechanical nature of the process visible in the interface itself.</p><p>I know what you’re thinking. These changes hurt engagement metrics. Anthropomorphic design works. People stay in the interface longer. They use it more often. Revenue scales with usage time. Making the system feel less human means people will use it less, and that conflicts with business goals. But engagement built on confusion carries costs we’re only starting to see.</p><p>Users develop dependency on systems they don’t understand. They delegate judgment to pattern recognition without realizing that’s what they’re doing. They mistake fluency for accuracy. They treat consistency as truth. And because the interface never taught them the boundaries, they don’t know when to stop trusting the output.</p><p><strong>When we erase the line between system output and human judgment in AI interfaces, we make the wrong design decisions. We’re building humanization into the system as strategy. We’re doing it on purpose because it increases engagement.</strong></p><p>You have agency here. When you design AI experiences, you decide how it presents itself. You control the pronouns in system responses. You choose whether to show confidence levels or hide them. You determine whether context persists invisibly or resets in clear ways.</p><p>These decisions shape how people understand the tool’s role and their own. They determine whether users develop judgment or dependency.</p><p>So ask yourself: where does the system end and where does judgment begin? In your current interface, can users see that line? Or have you deliberately blurred it to make the interaction feel smoother?</p><p>The chat paradigm became default because it felt intuitive. But that isn’t the same as honest. And right now, we need more honesty in how these systems present themselves.</p><h3>Further reading</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/humanizing-ai/"">Humanizing AI Is a Trap</a></li><li><a href=""https://vaughntan.org/aiux"">Designing AI tools that support critical thinking</a></li><li><a href=""https://1984.design/psychology-of-design/authority-bias/"">Authority Bias</a></li><li><a href=""https://intelligence-curse.ai/"">The Intelligence Curse</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">The Shape of AI | UX Patterns for Artificial Intelligence Design</a></li><li><a href=""https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/"">The People + AI Guidebook</a></li><li><a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/ai-guidelines/"">Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4283748d33e1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-tools-pretend-to-be-people-4283748d33e1"">When tools pretend to be people</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><em>There are a thousand ways to fail in executing a digital product project. Regardless of the many variables, failure to deliver a project will always be due to foundational risk factors that compromise its successful completion.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I9fjCC06uT3V0DzhmCmJpQ.png"" /><figcaption>When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been almost 20 years since I started my career in product design, and, as you might imagine, many things have changed dramatically since then. One of the main characteristics of the technology industry is the constant evolution of its dynamics, roles, processes, technologies, experiences, and even business models. Those changes are inevitable and will continue.</p><p>In retrospect, I see that there is one reality that has not changed much over the last 20 years and remains a constant issue to this day: <strong>building technology products can sometimes be a discouraging and exhausting process,</strong> from junior positions to senior management levels.</p><p>Why do we suffer every time we need to build something? Why is there so much burnout among today’s tech professionals? Why is it that, regardless of the industry, company, or technology, we always hear the exact phrases: “I’m exhausted, I feel drained by this job.”?</p><p>Well, those are valid questions that still haunt me 20 years after my first web design job. It seems like there’s no choice in this environment but to suffer.</p><p>As I mentioned before, a lot has changed in the tech industry. At the beginning of my career as a junior designer, watching leaders have complex conversations for hours was sort of a path I wanted to follow. To me, that was an expression of strategy, power, and importance within a company. Now, when I remember those meetings full of bureaucracy, all that comes to mind is a waste of time, resources, and money, but above all, <strong>not-so-clear project directions.</strong> The “tech machine” was slow, gigantic, and less efficient than it is now.</p><p>A few years later, the agile methodology hit the industry with a beautiful promise: to build products without needing the perfect scenario or the final product; instead, a quick, viable version will work as a measure of user feedback, which will lead the product to evolve. Agile is still a living practice today, and many companies and teams use it to shape product development dynamics. But was agile the final solution we needed to make the tech product creation less painful? My answer is NO, it wasn’t, and the reasons why, no matter frameworks or methodologies, we are still stuck in a toxic product-creation spiral are due to these factors.</p><p>The three risk factors of building a tech product:</p><h3>Unsuitable people for the role</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aI-H6qmhu2TiU58V7naPlg.png"" /><figcaption>Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource.</figcaption></figure><p>This factor is the number one cause of a product project’s failure. When you have people who are not suited for the job, the consequences might be catastrophic for everyone and everything involved. Why is this factor the most dangerous in a project’s building process? Because at the end of the day, it’s people who are responsible for control and making things happen from the beginning to the final stages, not technology or some autonomous process, so when we talk about products and quality, we are actually pointing to the people who made it possible.</p><blockquote><strong>“All products are a mirror of the people who built them.”</strong></blockquote><p>Regarding non-talented people in technology, I’ll talk about roles such as product, design, dev, and other positions involved in creating digital products. Part of the issues that surface when dealing with unsuitable people in a project are:</p><p><strong>Business misunderstanding:</strong> People who are unable to understand where the company or the product is going are highly likely to make wrong calls and take the project in the wrong direction, creating a waste of time or money, discouragement within the team due to the constant re-work, and from that point on, all efforts will be inefficient. Consequences of this issue: missed dates, unclear or unconvincing project goals, inefficient metrics, and confusing product expectations, or what I call “<em>ghost problems,”</em> which are the product’s functions that were never considered to have, and people for not understanding all the product’s functionalities, expect.</p><p><strong>Lack of systems thinking: </strong>Untalented people are unable to see the project as a connected entity, part of a whole, with serious consequences at all stages, especially at the final stage. One of the basic things to master when starting a new project is to be aware of all possible connections or collateral impacts on other products, especially if you work in a product ecosystem. Not taking this information to the table in the early stages of a project will affect planning, the accurate scale of the challenge, and potential dependencies on other actors or functionalities.</p><p>You can deliver or ship a product, but without this information, your solution is incomplete, and you will probably have to go back to square one, this time with rising costs and frustration from teammates.</p><p><strong>Improvised way of working:</strong> I’ve seen many people start a project without a clear path, and experience has taught me that results are often poor because valuable work can be left behind. When working without a basic sense of order, you will react to everything rather than plan and take control of your next move. As you guessed, ownership here is nonexistent because your time will be spent on damage control rather than having relevant conversations with others.</p><p><strong>Unproductive communication:</strong> Projects are simple; it’s all about progress, steps, time, capacity, numbers, and other factors. The proper language for conversations is about key information, for example: “overall progress is at 75%; so far, we have reached the following milestones, and we have these warnings that could potentially put the X deliverable in jeopardy.” I know this is a simple way to show it, and it might involve a lot of considerations, but in essence, that’s pretty much what you need to talk about.</p><p>Unproductive communication occurs when the person in charge of these conversations begins to tell complex stories with dialogue, subplots, and even twists, making the key points of the conversation unclear, leaving more doubt than certainty, and also consuming the time of the other members of the space. I think good communication is about finding the perfect tune for the message you want to deliver to the right people at the right time. Not strategically developing this skill will lead to unclear agreements <em>(my opinion vs. your opinion)</em>, which will steer the project down subjective paths that are sometimes inefficient for the business.</p><p><strong>No signs of accountability:</strong> Are you familiar with affirmations like this: “It’s not my fault, I shipped as expected, but the X team or the Y person didn’t deliver as supposed to.” Who loses in this scenario? Everyone, when everything is from everyone<em> (in low-seniority environments)</em>, no one is responsible for anything.</p><p>These positions within the team are dangerous for the project and the company because you face people who don’t play fair or, at least, aren’t team players.</p><p><strong>No problem-solving mindset:</strong> Problems are inevitable; the whole point is how to approach them. Having people who panic when things are not going well and bring chaos to the team or stakeholders is less than practical. It is just noise with no answers. A solving mindset is an underrated skill that, in my opinion, can make the difference between shipping high-quality products and delaying things to the point of generating frustration among people or killing the production momentum within the team. Problems sometimes are the fuel people need to find a differential spark that can make your product unique.</p><p>So far, in my experience, these are the things that make it challenging to create products from a human perspective. We are not perfect, and that’s a reality we live with, and it is also a beautiful thing, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that we shouldn’t do things to help navigate these complex nuances.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pgmHL8XwG0Afn5py7Opj8Q.png"" /><figcaption>A talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</figcaption></figure><p>As I said, we are complex beings, and external factors can influence our everyday performance. Still, if we take an objective look at what is necessary when executing a product build, these are some simple things to consider.</p><h4>Company and team context matter</h4><p>Not all companies are the same, just as not all people are. There are tons of factors that make every company and its teams unique; so, when finding someone to jump into a product-creation dynamic, make sure this person is a good fit for what’s about to happen and how people interact. In companies where bureaucracy is high, for example, you may need a type of person who can handle high-power profiles or even non-technological roles. Still, the situation is different in small, agile companies, where a hands-on profile can be more productive than focusing solely on strategy or meetings. Make sure the person you are looking for has a background in a similar company and team context, as that will make the transition to the new role smoother.</p><h4>Skills visible in the field, not only on a resume or a job vacancy</h4><p>To me, there is a lot of bluff among professionals today who claim they have achieved remarkable things in previous positions. Still, experience has taught me that one thing is to say in sophisticated words on a resume or a LinkedIn page than to demonstrate in action, where sometimes theory is irrelevant, and the most critical thing is your ability to solve problems and make decisions for the project, team, and company. When promoting someone or hiring a new team member, make sure whatever this person says is true <em>(for example, in a business case challenge)</em>. In this way, I’m sure that when the challenge arises, your new asset will overcome it with excellent results.</p><h4>Sense of community over single stars</h4><p>One powerful thing we have is the sense of unity, and when high-difficult times arise, it is incredible to feel the support from your teammates. With a strong sense of community within the team, challenges can be easier to digest.</p><p>I remember one time at a former job, we faced the biggest product challenge so far in my career: we were running against time to build an entire digital entertainment ecosystem for LATAM and US Hispanics at the same time, but even with such pressure on us (the product team), we were able to deliver as expected despite long night work shifts and weekend sessions. After several months of massive effort, all that remained was the feeling of having achieved an excellent product with the best people on your side.</p><p>People are the number one risk factor in whether a product thrives or fails. Even with all the available methodologies or frameworks, if a person isn’t good, they will still be a poor resource. Conversely, a talented person, even without methods or technology, will find a way to make things happen in the best possible way.</p><h3>Over-complex technology or processes</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pPI9_8X4dKFEUWaYHWoGdg.png"" /><figcaption>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated.</figcaption></figure><p>The second risk factor for failing to create a tech product is adopting technology or processes that teammates don’t fully dominate or even understand. Trends in technology are part of everyday life, but that doesn’t mean your company has to adopt every new method, tool, role, or technology that emerges. As I said before, context <em>(company and talent)</em> matters; technology, roles, or processes should be according to the people who will handle them. Bringing sophisticated dynamics to a non-senior team will only create frustration, confusion, and delays to your projects.</p><p>People often underestimate the power of basics; I’ve seen many fantastic products built with a straightforward approach, and they’re so simple that people can master them quickly. One of the beauty outcomes of starting from simple product creation approaches is that, after learning the technique, it comes to innovation, and from there, I’m sure creating a product will be a joyful process of discovery.</p><p>Sometimes we think adopting whatever new thing on the market makes us look edgy, more efficient, or sophisticated, but after 20 years of experience, I have to say it’s not always the case.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lZqZ7gNrlsAtrpmRWsrlFA.png"" /><figcaption>Ideate a sequence of steps where people feel comfortable enough to start developing things without the fear of not knowing what they are doing.</figcaption></figure><p>From senior positions or high leadership levels, understanding what your company or team needs and what it is capable of is the most crucial insight when creating new work dynamics. Based on the information you can extract from your company or teams, ideate a sequence of steps where people feel comfortable enough to start developing things without the fear of not knowing what they are doing, what tool to use, or what role is essential to take into account in a specific stage.</p><p><em>Quick tip: in these discoveries, the UX team can be king, because that’s actually what we do: understand how people behave in front of technology, roles, or dynamics, right?

We all know that AI allows us to ship products twice as fast as before, but to me, it is also a double-edged sword that can cut you if you don’t know how to use it properly.</p><p>AI, as a technology, is like a wormhole that lets you get to the other side in seconds, but treating it as the sole protagonist of the story might be a mistake. The majority of the results AI gives you when you prompt something are based on global-scale context; sometimes that’s enough for your needs, but sometimes, if the AI lacks the proper context, it is highly probable to provide a vague answer.</p><p>A common mistake with AI solutions is misunderstanding the new product dynamic: the possibility of starting from “the solution” towards users, rather than the other way around, as we were used to. When this scenario is treated as an absolute <em>(design, product, and development)</em>, we can overlook small things that could make our product flawed.</p><h3>How to help surface these problems?</h3><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hMjqLNh26aaqGRZ_520q7g.png"" /><figcaption>Do not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty; what we know is really valuable.</figcaption></figure><p>It is good to adopt AI as a new core technology for your team, company, and even your culture, but so far, use it as a lever for your progress and don’t start leaving human expertise behind. There is still a lot of hysteria about whether AI will replace us, and following market trends in layoffs without any fundamental basis only increases the fear among tech professionals. My advice on this issue is not to discourage people from saying the AI is all mighty <em>(it will be in time, and we’ll lose the war against it)</em>, but right now, what we know is really valuable. My prediction with AI <em>(I can be wrong)</em> is that people will appreciate human nuances and imperfections in all creations rather than AI’s fake perfection.</p><p>With all these years of experience in the design field, I now look at things differently, and not every new tool impresses me as it did when I was a kid seeking knowledge and experience. I’m still learning for sure, don’t get me wrong, but with all this technological evolution in almost 20 years, I’m more into getting to basics to solve things and guess what, it always works; we humans are complex and that’s the beauty of UX, we understand humans <em>(the good and bad things)</em> and as I write this article, I realize this is a deep human reflection of how we sometimes, make something more complicated that it should be when the solution sometimes is right there in front of us.</p><figure><img alt=""Image created with AI by kikehey.com"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eTjJRViX-X810u9AeQqqaw.png"" /></figure><p><em>To write this article, I want to credit all the fantastic information sources and other authors who wrote about related topics, all from another exciting perspective.</em></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/the-product-lens-looking-at-the-world-through-a/product-management-vs-project-management-understanding-the-skill-requirements-b3b2deef911b""><em>Product Management vs Project Management: Understanding the Skill Requirements</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/dont-follow-the-ai-trap-stop-and-think-how-and-when-to-use-ai-in-product-design-b9565931093b""><em>Don’t follow the AI trap: stop and think</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/not-every-feature-needs-ai-a-practical-guide-on-gen-ai-in-product-design-452275c08279""><em>Not every feature Needs AI: A Practical Guide on Gen-AI in Product Design</em></a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/music-for-thought/ai-wont-kill-live-performance-it-might-save-it-6cdafdf0fa2b""><em>AI Won’t Kill Live Performance.

Layers of player experience</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Usability</h3><p>According to the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, usability is about how easily and pleasantly users can achieve their goals when interacting with a product.</p><p>It is an important factor for a product’s success and popularity. In some cases, usability can be one of the key or a unique selling point: Apple’s <em>“It just works”.</em></p><p>I’ve never seen a game that people play just because it has a pleasant UI. However, audiences get used to a certain level of interaction quality from other domains: mobile apps, web products, automotive infotainment systems.</p><p>When a game’s UI does not meet these expectations, it negatively affects usability and, as a result, the overall game experience. <strong>Сompetition drives progress </strong>(<em>or burnout</em>).</p><figure><img alt=""A meme with two images of Doge dogs.

Wait!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g0hJxyGYcJXRIDAQTjz68w.png"" /></figure><h3>Competition</h3><p>Today, there is intense competition for people’s time and attention. The number of platforms and content options has multiplied. One moment players are fighting a boss in a game, and the next moment they have already spent four hours watching AI-generated cats cheating with panthers.</p><p>We can divide competitors into<a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/types-competitors-business""> three categories</a>. For example, I am thinking about playing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> on PS5.</p><h4>Direct competitors</h4><p>Games from a similar AAA subset within the same genre: <em>open-world, survival horror, post-apocalyptic shooters, …</em></p><h4>Indirect competitors</h4><p>Other games that provide a similar emotion, feeling — competitors for experience rather than genre: <em>Ori</em>, <em>Cuphead</em>, <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em></p><h4>Replacement/substitute competitors</h4><p>In this case, competitors for time and attention. Some examples:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Media and streaming</em></strong><em> (Netflix, Prime, Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube, Twitch)</em></li><li><strong><em>Mobile applications</em></strong><em> (e-commerce, dating)</em></li><li><strong><em>Social media</em></strong><em> (TikTok, Instagram)</em></li><li><strong><em>Offline activities</em></strong><em> (sports, board games, travelling)</em></li></ul><p>A large number of options can trigger choice paralysis or lead people to choose the simplest one — scrolling through a social media feed. Many of these replacement competitors didn’t exist in the 2000s, so my choice as a child was simpler: <em>play Crash Bandicoot and watch Nickelodeon cartoons</em>.</p><p>Today, the market offers hybrid solutions. For example, Netflix has been adding games to its library for several years, aiming to capture even more of users’ time and attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional image showing three smartphones aligned side by side, each displaying a different game splash screen, with Ubisoft and Netflix Games logos above, representing a multi-game mobile platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FRQ3-Kd8KS2ueu_7ZfXAMg.jpeg"" /><figcaption><em>Netflix and Ubisoft are partnering to create three exclusive mobile games for Netflix members. </em><a href=""https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-partners-with-ubisoft-to-create-three-exclusive-mobile-games-for"">Source</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Heuristics</h3><p>Let’s return to usability and heuristics. Of course, this alone will not win a game the <em>Game of the Year</em> award at <a href=""https://thegameawards.com/winners""><em>The Game Awards</em></a><em> </em>— perhaps, a chance to compete in the <em>Innovation in Accessibility</em> category. However, a well-developed usability layer can reduce the risk of users leaving for competitors, and as we can see, there are plenty of them today.</p><p><strong>Usability heuristics</strong> are general principles that help evaluate and improve the ease of use of a system. They are not limited to digital interfaces and are effective across many domains and products. These heuristics are often based on observation and practical experience rather than mathematical formulas or psychological terminology. The most well-known set is<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/""> Jakob Nielsen’s 10 heuristics</a>.</p><p>I used these 10 as a foundation, along with the work of Celia Hodent (<a href=""https://celiahodent.com/ux-practices-epic-games/""><em>Developing UX Practices at Epic Games</em></a>), and consolidated them into an updated set of eight.</p><figure><img alt=""List of usability heuristics with arrows highlighting grouped items: items 3 ‘User control and freedom’ and 5 ‘Error prevention’ are connected with a bracket pointing to ‘Error Prevention and Recovery’; item 7 ‘Flexibility and efficiency of use’ has an arrow pointing to ‘A11Y and Flexibility’."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FosqKLxwqgH90lUFlWvKdw.png"" /><figcaption>Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and updates</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Visibility of system status</strong></li><li><strong>Match between the system and the real world</strong></li><li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></li><li><strong>Error prevention and recovery</strong></li><li><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong></li><li><strong>Accessibility (A11Y) and flexibility</strong></li><li><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></li><li><strong>Help and documentation</strong></li></ol><p>Next, I will take a closer look at each heuristic and share a few examples that came to mind. There are countless examples and solutions around us, developing this awareness is extremely valuable for designers.</p><h3>1. Visibility of System Status</h3><p><em>Design should always communicate what is happening in a clear and timely manner for the user. Use visual, auditory, and tactile channels to inform players about game events (</em><strong><em>informative signs</em></strong><em>), encourage them to perform certain actions (</em><strong><em>inviting signs</em></strong><em>), and provide clear feedback on their interactions (</em><strong><em>feedback</em></strong><em>). All game features and possible interactions should have clear signs and appropriate feedback.</em></p><p>The main role of the HUD interface is to inform the player about game states and events — for example, health, available character actions, position on the map. Which information should be shown or hidden depends on the game and its context.</p><figure><img alt=""First-person view with HUD elements showing team status, timer, score, ammo, health, and interaction prompts, while a diegetic wrist-mounted device on the player’s hand displays an active drone interface integrated into the game world."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aCiH3803d_xPfZLqaTX18Q.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six® Siege X</figcaption></figure><p>In game <strong>menus</strong>, this may include stats, character balance, available actions, or messages explaining why certain options are unavailable.</p><figure><img alt=""Armor upgrade menu showing stats, required resources for upgrades, and the message “Not Enough Resources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RspNBl9KFDO_XLS0uhz30w.png"" /><figcaption>Upgrade Menu in God of War Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>An example from <strong>industrial design</strong> that comes to mind is an elevator: when we approach, we can see the system status — which floors the elevators are on, whether they are moving, and if they are operational. Based on this information, we decide which elevator to call. We press a button and receive feedback — the button lights up until the elevator arrives, and the floor number changes.</p><h3>2. Match Between the System and the Real World</h3><p><em>Design should communicate in the users’ language: words, phrases, models, and concepts. Follow real-world conventions so that information is presented in a natural and logical order.</em></p><p>This is especially important for UI text, often called <strong>UX copy</strong>. It makes up a significant part of the interface and can make the user experience delightful — or, conversely, frustrating.</p><p>The screenshots below show examples of HUD widgets: they mirror the layout of buttons on the input device (gamepad, keyboard, Nintendo Switch, etc.). This helps players quickly understand what to do and which button(s) to press.</p><figure><img alt=""Hint widget: L-stick + X for action ‘Climb’; nearby icons for Y, A, and B actions."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g8E3vC1lCAo64QkMxVg02g.png"" /><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)</figcaption></figure><p>This approach makes interactions feel more natural, as it aligns with our mental and physical models. A consistent pattern or standard can be seen across the three game examples.</p><figure><img alt=""Three examples of HUD widgets from Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man 2, Assassin’s Creed Shadows with action buttons and indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fglgClLwFKyD25HynRGPgg.png"" /><figcaption>HUD widgets for weapons, abilities, consumables</figcaption></figure><h3>3. Consistency and Standards</h3><p><em>Interface elements should be consistent and adhere to accepted standards.</em></p><p>Why reinvent the wheel when you can <em>steal like an artist</em>? The radial weapon selection menu (<em>Weapon Wheel</em>) is used in games to provide quick access to weapons or items.</p><figure><img alt=""Item selection wheel from Red Dead Redemption 2 showing Dead Eye Tonics, highlighting Chewing Tobacco."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ry4Cpk4E7ndic8TtcANEpg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon selection wheel from Far Cry 6 showing MS16 S rifle with armor-piercing rounds highlighted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8_N1xxiQow2G6Xx3OQpKZg.png"" /><figcaption>Radial Menu in Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018), Farcry 6 (2021)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Navigation </strong>in <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> (2022) is similar to YouTube or other TV apps. Overall, it’s a common practice to borrow and get inspired by solutions from other domains: familiar standards, structures, and patterns.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube and Horizon Forbidden West interface with side navigation menu."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NWFE14Yz-NS6SHk4IdYLSw.png"" /><figcaption>YouTube and Horizon Forbidden West (2022) navigation</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Level design</strong> follows the same rules: climbable ledges look similar across games; red barrels are likely to explode when shot; yellow elements draw attention to important objects, just as in urban design.</p><figure><img alt=""Four game screenshots showing climbable ledges: Uncharted 4 — stone ledges; STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order — scratched metal platforms; Kena: Bridge of Spirits — marked ledges with symbols; God of War Ragnarök — rocks with visible points and symbols."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*eXo9Dstx4cco7-9qop9vEQ.png"" /></figure><h3>4. Recognition Rather Than Recall</h3><p><em>Information needed for interaction should be visible or easily accessible when required. This reduces memory load by keeping objects, actions, and parameters clearly visible.</em></p><p>For example, a list of available actions or controls in a specific game context:</p><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 6 airplane screenshot: control info panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5OrnlFBK7BoF0YnYYEQ8Rw.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Weapon shop interface with catalog and control panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2UO9rBVokYoSmjbjq0jh3A.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 6 (2021), Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The option to open a map legend and recall the meaning of icons is another example:</p><figure><img alt=""Game screen from Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown showing map with legend on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ez8WaDLwyuZm2Cet_iN7_A.png"" /><figcaption>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Another cool implementation can be seen in <em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. On the left is diegetic UI — the character points to world tiles on the doors — while on the right, a non-diegetic panel provides the player with information about this location, quests, and collectibles. This reduces the amount of information the player needs to remember or search for.</p><figure><img alt=""Character standing near wooden doors with world symbols; UI panel on the right"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rn_HY8g7LKDIz8u50T0mTw.png"" /><figcaption>God of War: Ragnarök (2022)</figcaption></figure><p>In many applications, a <strong>Recent Files</strong> function serves the same purpose: it shows the last opened documents or projects. Users don’t need to recall the exact file path or name — they simply recognize and select the item they need.</p><h3>5. Error Prevention and Recovery</h3><p><em>Try to prevent errors that are not part of the core experience, where challenges and obstacles are intentionally designed. If an error does occur, help players recover quickly and understand its cause.</em></p><p>The first examples that come to mind are confirmation pop-ups<strong> </strong>— an extra step in interaction, but designed to prevent mistakes.</p><figure><img alt=""Dishonored 2 UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WZ0XdOqwNX15G6SV9TmaXA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Horizon Forbidden West UI showing a confirmation dialog with No and Yes options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i8pBxCGFSUhohhXg.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Dishonored 2(2016)</em> and <em>Horizon Forbidden West(2022)</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Hi-Fi Rush UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zkCuKFQ4_kTeltSiyf5bnA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""XDefiant UI showing a confirmation dialog with Yes and No options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CtUWlXba2MqkaW0i3qYcxw.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>Hi-Fi Rush(2023)</em> and <em>XDefiant(2024)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the button order in the pop-ups: in the first case, <strong>No–Yes</strong>; in the second, <strong>Yes–No</strong>. It seems the world has not yet standardized it. Currently, I lean toward clearly labeling actions. Instead of generic Yes/No, use explicit labels like <strong>Exit, Delete, Buy</strong>, and <strong>Back, Cancel</strong>, etc. This way, users can understand and anticipate the outcome of their actions just by reading the buttons. I’ve seen this approach across platforms such as TV, iOS, and PlayStation.</p><p>Interestingly, for confirming critical actions, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Figma </em>use similar design solutions. In WoW, deleting a character requires typing the word <strong>“</strong>DELETE<strong>”</strong>, and in Figma, deleting a team requires typing the team’s name to confirm the action.</p><figure><img alt=""World of Warcraft character deletion confirmation dialog over game background, asking to type ‘DELETE’ to confirm."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0SLga3uDXb21AR4_dzL7XA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Figma interface showing a team deletion confirmation popup with warning text and input field to enter team name."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*htyeVWkAx4g8_ehE-XQTTQ.png"" /><figcaption>Confirmation pop-ups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>6. Accessibility and Flexibility</h3><p><strong><em>Accessibility</em></strong><em> refers to the qualities that make an experience open to all, according to </em><a href=""https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/Inclusive101Guidebook.pdf""><em>the Inclusive 101 Guidebook, Microsoft Inclusive Design</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The more customization options a game provides, the more accessible it can be for players. However, it’s not necessary to <em>anchor</em> on creating hundreds of options and categories. It’s better to explore new, more refined UI solutions — perhaps some automatic synchronization of game and platform settings or even <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/""><em>AI: intent-based UI paradigm</em></a>. Still, if there are many settings, a <strong>search function</strong> in the game can be helpful, similar to those in iOS, Android, Windows, or Call of Duty.</p><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Ukrainian with left-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4jNDZhj2eqI3xqdnVc2D_Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Accessibility settings screen in Arabic with right-aligned UI elements and buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AvB7P_cjhF_y-Eu6M6sH2Q.png"" /><figcaption>Mirrored UI for Accessibility settings in XDefiant (2024) in Ukrainian and Arabic</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Flexibility</em></strong><em> ensures effective interaction for both new and experienced users.</em> For example, hotkeys, shortcuts, macros, and personalized settings. In <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, players can switch weapons either through the overlay menu or using shortcuts. The menu shows the assigned keyboard keys (1, 2, 3…) as a reminder of this interaction method.</p><figure><img alt=""Scene from Resident Evil 4 (2023): character in a dark room, weapon selection menu on the right with labeled hotkey slots."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ysA2iGSZMBC5UOP2SXlMag.png"" /><figcaption>Resident Evil 4 (2023)</figcaption></figure><p>It is also important to consider <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/community/accessibility-by-design""><strong>Accessibility by Design</strong></a><strong>”</strong> — an approach where accessibility is incorporated from the start, rather than added later as an option. By tackling root causes instead of consequences, this saves dev time and resources. Standards and guidelines like the <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> and <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"">Xbox Accessibility Guidelines</a> are helpful references.</p><h3>7. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3><p><em>Design should not include information that is irrelevant or rarely used. The system should have a simple, uncluttered design that focuses on the core elements of interaction.</em></p><p>This is especially important when designing HUD elements due to limited screen space and the player’s attention resources. The team must define priorities and the display order of HUD widgets. The HUD is often the most critical part of a game’s UI, as players interact with it directly during gameplay, strongly influencing the overall game experience.</p><p>If an element can be hidden, this should be considered. In <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>, the HUD is absent: widgets only appear in context, for example during combat. This helps preserve player attention and enhances immersion in the game world.</p><figure><img alt=""Third-person view of a character running inside a wooden structure with no HUD elements visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zwa6mmYSmDsOukfdl6EY0A.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""Combat scene with character aiming a glowing bow; HUD shows health, abilities, and ammo indicators."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1ZHnVm7dLk4DHMz39k5rvw.png"" /><figcaption>HUD states in <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em> (2021)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth mentioning <strong>diegetic UI</strong> — interfaces that exist directly in the game world and have a logical explanation within the lore.</p><p>In <em>Dead Space</em>, the health level is shown on the character’s suit spine, and ammo count is directly on the weapon. In <em>Far Cry 2</em>, the map and GPS device serve as the interface, in <em>Firewatch</em> — the map and compass.</p><figure><img alt=""Dead Space screenshot: character in space suit in open space, suit shows oxygen and health indicators, target indicator and suit status visible."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zJBuxs2P2JtU8nmiHQ3HlA.png"" /><figcaption>Dead Space (2023)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Far Cry 2 screenshot: character holding a map and GPS device."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*62QLeGyjsOyOQfBZm-t3jg.png"" /><figcaption>Far Cry 2 (2008)</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=""Firewatch screenshot: character holding a map and compass."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qeRztag1M5Mee1oR2rWHng.png"" /><figcaption>Firewatch (2016)</figcaption></figure><p>Such interfaces enhance immersion, help convey creative direction, and can become part of a brand-marketing strategy. However, they are more expensive to develop, harder to iterate on, and have limitations in presenting information.</p><h3>8. Help and Documentation</h3><p><em>Design should provide contextual information and documentation to help users in learning and using the system. Even if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide it to help users understand how to complete their tasks.</em></p><p>Depending on the game, this can be implemented through gradual, step-by-step in-game tutorials, where <strong>context </strong>(<em>learning by doing</em>) and <strong>meaning </strong>(relevant to life, mission, or character goals) are provided.</p><figure><img alt=""Large pop-up window over gameplay scene with text: ‘TIRED OF TUTORIALS?

They can be used to assess engine tools, company services, identify areas and ideas for improvement, and significantly increase team efficiency.</p><p>Across different products and domains, I see<strong> </strong>a balance between <strong>practicality, utility</strong> and <strong>aesthetics, hedonism</strong>.</p><p>Practicality reminds me of the phrase and the book by Golden Krishna: <em>“</em><a href=""https://medium.com/@uxlime/ux-read-the-best-interface-is-no-interface-fbffee611e9b""><em>The Best Interface is No Interface</em></a><em>”.</em> Take the automotive industry as an example:</p><ul><li>Don’t want to manually switch headlights or wipers? Automatic lights and rain sensors handle it.</li><li>Tired of pressing a button on your key fob to unlock the car? Keyless entry is the solution.</li><li>Fatigued from holding the gas pedal?

<h4>UX isn’t decoration; it is the mechanism that converts product value into business revenue.</h4><p>As a C-level executive at two consecutive VC-backed startups (ARxVision, AdInMo) and Senior Manager at major players like Ubisoft and the BBC, I’ve utilized design to solve critical P&amp;L issues. The hardest part has often been building the business case to convince decision-makers to invest in user experience. Here are two distinct examples where UX was directly tied to business success.</p><p>In some cases, early-adopters, adventurers who need your product so much that they’ll be willing to go through a bad user experience to access the value a product delivers. This is usually a positive because the fact that a user is willing to go through a painful UX signals that the solution solves their problem well-enough. When this is the case, improving the UX will increase the efficiency of the solution (reducing friction) and increase customer satisfaction. So in this context <strong>UX is a growth tool</strong>.</p><p>In other cases bad UX can truly be a barrier to adoption, it totally comes in the way and blocks users from benefiting from any of the value a product aims to deliver. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Don Norman calls this <strong>The Gulf of execution</strong></a>: the difference between what a user wants to do with a product and how the product allows them to do it. If the gap is too big, the user stops trying and the product fails, the business fails.</p><blockquote>“Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.” — The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman</blockquote><figure><img alt=""an equation of BusinessValue = ProblemSolved x UXQuality"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GnMkL2l0h5bdZwXNZ-JpHg.png"" /><figcaption>In that sense, UX is a <strong>value multiplier</strong> for the solution your product delivers.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>UX can make or break the business</strong>. Here are two illustrations of this statement from my own experience. The first example is an extreme case because it is an accessibility wearable for people with disabilities, so UX matters more than ever. The second example is more subtle because it targets Unity developers and we assume they are technical, and therefore might not care about or need a premium UX.</p><h3><strong>ARxVision — Making the world accessible with AI</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aVAwCjoNvunPS4UI7GZM2A.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of the ARx Unboxing experience, showing how parts are laid out in a specific order, guiding users and managing their expectations.</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led a VC-owned company who launched a wearable device for individuals with blindness. We launched an early private beta as we wanted to learn from users and not build in a silo. This was entirely a case of provoking problems to measure their importance.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The learning from multiple beta launches, was that UX problems were directly threatening the business.<strong> Bad onboarding often resulted in a product return, directly harming the P&amp;L</strong>. I also observed that most competitors were charging high prices to make-up for in-person expensive training, my view was always that if a product is designed well enough, in-person training shouldn’t be required.</li><li><strong>Action: </strong>I designed an interactive unboxing and onboarding experience simulating in-person training thanks to a generative AI powered experience.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The onboarding drastically reduced returns and support tickets, but also enabled our customers and ourselves to capture more value than our competitors who were way more expensive because they were still relying on middle men in-person sales and training to make up for bad UX, when our users 17 to 88 were able to get set up in minutes thanks to our design (and how Sales, Product, Engineering, and Design beautifully joined forces to deliver that experience).</li></ol><h3><strong>AdInMo — In-Game ads SDK that monetise without interrupting the game.</strong></h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PljCNOivsDdCLlgT99pwdw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of AdIbMo’s customer dashboard with a 6 step interactive onboarding flow</figcaption></figure><ol><li><strong>Context:</strong> I led product and design in a company building an in-game Ad SDK for mobile game Unity Developers.</li><li><strong>Challenge:</strong> The SDK was live in a number of games and worked well, but new features increased complexity, resulting in broken integrations, or cancelled integrations. Broken integrations generated misleading data, misleading our company direction. Cancelled integrations were revenue losses — both affecting the P&amp;L.</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> My team tackled this problem by designing an end-to-end onboarding flow and interactive tools to provide live feedback, certainty, and reduced overheads for our customers.</li><li><strong>Result:</strong> The redesigned code interface and onboarding flow for the SDK meant an integration could be completed in 10mn, we became better at tracking drop off points and best of all, <strong>we started recording developers self-serving and integrating the SDK without the sales team getting involved</strong>, building a new engine of growth for the company.</li></ol><p>These 2 examples show how when strategically used, design can directly impact a company’s success. In both examples, I did not over invest in design initially in order to identify the pain points before addressing them, but I was carefully watching users and ‘waiting around the corner’ for problems, almost provoking them to measure their importance. If I wasn’t ‘looking’ for these problems, my team and I could have missed opportunities to fix them, or even worse, fixed something that didn’t need to be fixed.</p><blockquote>The quality of a solution is a product of how well we understand the problem it solves and for whom — all of which falls within the scope of design. Ultimately, this means Design is not just about aesthetics; it is the strategic intelligence that maximises Business Value.</blockquote><p>In both cases, I didn’t over-invest in “pixel perfection” initially. I used a lean approach — waiting to see where users struggled to access value — and then deployed design strategically to remove those specific barriers.</p><p><a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">McKinsey data</a> backs this approach, showing that companies who treat design as a cross-functional business lever (not just a studio) see 3<strong>2% higher revenue growth</strong> than their peers.</p><p>Real UX isn’t just about making things easy (or pretty); it’s about making the business viable.</p><h3>📚 Further Reading &amp; References</h3><p>For those interested in the data and theory behind these concepts, here are the foundational resources referenced in this article:</p><ul><li><strong>The Business Value of Design (McKinsey &amp; Company):</strong> The definitive report analysing 300 companies over five years, proving that top-quartile design scorers increase revenues and shareholder returns at nearly twice the rate of their industry peers. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design"">Read the full report here.</a></li><li><strong>The Gulf of Execution (Nielsen Norman Group):</strong> A deeper dive into Don Norman’s framework on why users fail to interact with products. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">Read the summary here</a>.</li><li><strong>Product-Led Growth (OpenView):</strong> If you are interested in how companies like Stripe and Duolingo use product experience as their primary growth engine, OpenView’s guide is the industry standard. <a href=""https://openviewpartners.com/product-led-growth/"">Read the guide.</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=207cfe19fdc1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-ux-directly-impacts-p-l-207cfe19fdc1"">How UX directly impacts P&amp;L</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What it takes to overcome obstacles and drive positive impact inside systems that resist change.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IBu5B5Q1qQdV1QFax-TyPA.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by <a href=""https://www.sh8peshifters.com/"">Sh8peshifters</a> / Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past years, I’ve spoken with many design students about <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666659622000099"">life-centred design</a>, <a href=""https://sbi.sydney.edu.au/for-the-sake-of-the-planet-we-need-to-rethink-human-centred-design/"">responsible innovation</a>, and <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-case-for-using-non-human-personas-in-design-7f3343ae2994"">bringing non-human perspectives into the design process</a>. These ideas tend to resonate deeply. Many students are drawn to design precisely because they want to create positive social and environmental change.</p><p>What design programs rarely prepare students for is how little agency designers often have once they enter professional practice. And this challenge doesn’t disappear with experience. When my co-author <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a> and I toured our book <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, the most common question we heard was not <em>what </em>designers should do differently — but <em>how </em>to drive positive change in the face of resistance.</p><p>How to get buy-in from bosses, managers, co-workers, clients, partner organisations — or whoever pays the bills — is a deceptively difficult problem. It’s why the third part of <em>Designing Tomorrow</em>, which focuses on partnerships, may be its most important. Across three chapters, we explore collaboration, buy-in, and the shift from doing good work to becoming a strategic leader.</p><p>This article, co-written with <a href=""https://medium.com/u/47c37d1ba5a7"">Steve 'Doc' Baty</a>, distils those chapters into six practical strategies for driving positive change from within organisations.</p><h4>#1—Understanding how an organisation operates</h4><p>Driving change requires effective collaboration within the organisation and with external partners. Understanding how an organisation operates is the precursor for assembling those collaborators.</p><p>There are three parts to understanding an organisation. The first part relates to how the organisation is structured, including its department and decision-making processes.</p><p>The second part is to have a thorough understanding of the organisation’s goals and how it positions itself to achieve these goals through its strategic plan.</p><p>The third part concerns the challenges the organisation faces. By understanding those challenges, we are able to align positive change projects with them and select partners that bring complimentary skills to the collaboration.</p><p>Put together these three parts contribute to the organisation’s DNA. They drive the culture and behaviour and enable or hinder the adoption of new ways of working.</p><p>If we understand the DNA, we can alter it, for example, by bringing perspectives from different departments together, reconfiguring perspectives and opening up new possibilities.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows three stacked yellow boxes labeled “Organisational Structure,” “Goals of the Organisation,” and “Challenges Faced by the Organisation.” Each box is paired with guiding questions. These ask about department structure, information flow, and decision-making; short-, mid-, and long-term goals and strategies; and known, emerging, and sector-wide challenges and their impact on operations. The design uses progressively darker shades of yellow from top to bottom."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HcSXFZ0hB2VfBI5y2cKtlw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Questions to consider for developing a clear and thorough understanding of how an organisation works / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><h4>#2—Strategic alignment with KPIs</h4><p>Change in organisations starts and stops with key performance indicators (KPIs). A new initiative that doesn’t align with an organisation’s metrics is not likely to be supported by management.</p><p>Designers may not be the ones setting an organisation’s KPIs, but we can use the power of KPIs by articulating how a proposed initiative aligns with them.</p><p>In the <a href=""https://pieramattioli.medium.com/theory-of-change-a-guiding-framework-and-a-mindset-to-embrace-dcd42fda4252"">Theory of Change</a> framework, KPIs are the things that can be measured—captured in the ‘outcomes’ section of the framework. We can use this as a starting point and look for inspiration from other organisations and sectors.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram illustrating a logic model for a company’s plan and expected results. It consists of five stacked sections from top to bottom: Inputs, Activities, Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact. On the left, two vertical labels separate the sections: My Company’s Plan ” (covering Inputs and Activities) and “My Company’s Expected Results” (covering Outputs, Outcomes, and Impact). The sections are shaded in yellow tones with wavy dividers."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wYHSixEhpLXsJ98v7adYnQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>The Theory of Change canvas helps link KPIs with broader outcomes and impact that an organisation aims to achieve / </em>Source: <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>For example, Patagonia is a company that successfully employs KPIs to drive positive change. In addition to tracking their business’s carbon footprint, they measure water usage, energy consumption, waste production, proportion of products made using recycled or organic materials, and the number of employees and suppliers engaged in sustainability initiatives.</p><p>If it is not possible to align a proposal with existing KPIs, we may be able to turn to external rating schemes. For example, many organisations refer in some way or another to the <a href=""https://sdgs.un.org/goals"">United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>, which comprise measurable targets and indicators.</p><p>Designers might even be able to shape an organisation’s KPIs, especially at times when a company updates their strategic plan. To do this, we can employ strategic design tools like a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-ux-butterfly-effect-58dd180a0e13"">systems map or impact ripple canvas</a>, identifying the things that matter and that should be measured.</p><p>We can use design activities to bring together the relevant actors to explore how a different set of KPIs would establish measurable principles to drive the desired behaviour and organisational culture and help our organisation fare better in the future.</p><p>Importantly, we need to ask ourselves (and our organisation) whose benefit should be measured and how. What are the things we want to change in our system? How can we achieve this change? Who are entities that may have been overlooked and are negatively affected by existing KPIs? The answers to these questions become the starting point for creating powerful and far-reaching change metrics.</p><p>Expanding your systems map can be a good method of identifying entities who may be being overlooked. They’re often represented outside existing system boundaries, and treated as external to the things the organisation cares about. Extending the system boundary is also a good opportunity to ask questions about the organisation’s scope of impact.</p><h4>#3—Making a business case</h4><p>To successfully argue for organisational change, designers need to be able to speak the language of management and understand the forces that drive markets and economies. (That’s one of the reasons why business and economics principles should be taught in design programs.)</p><p>Business decisions are often driven by cost efficiency arguments. Countering those arguments requires hard data, not emotional storytelling. This doesn’t need to be financial data or involve complex modelling; it can emerge from analysing similar business cases and providing economics-driven alternative options.</p><p>The core of a successful business case is a persuasive business model. Designers are already assisting organisations with developing their business models—largely enabled by the introduction of the <a href=""https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas"">business model canvas</a> as a tool for customer-led innovation.</p><p>The extended <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652616307442"">triple layered business model canvas</a> holistically integrates economic, environmental, and social concerns. It adds two layers to the original canvas.</p><p>The environmental layer uses a life cycle perspective to determine the environmental impact of a product or service, placing functional value at its centre. The canvas includes building blocks for use phase, end-of-life, and distribution considerations. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, it considers environmental impacts and benefits.</p><p>The social layer places social value at the centre, and its building blocks include local communities and societal culture. Instead of cost structure and revenue streams, here the focus is on social impact and benefits.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows yellow boxes outlining stages in a coffee product lifecycle: supplies and outsourcing, production, materials, functional value, end-of-life, distribution, and use phase.

At the bottom, environmental impacts and benefits are noted, including a 20.7% carbon footprint reduction from machine redesign between 2008 and 2012."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u8_NIzL6o2wr_-rqfahFNA.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt=""The image summarizes social aspects of a coffee supply chain in yellow boxes.

Based on their work with communities, they developed a collective framework, setting out five conditions for aligning the different end goals of partners.</p><p>These conditions support collaboration amongst governments, business, and other organisations. The framework acknowledges that no single organisation can solve a large-scale problem on its own: a collective effort is needed to create meaningful and lasting change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3uzVjIi1hjOxswZ46XDDmw.png"" /><figcaption><em>The five conditions of collective impact / Source:</em> <a href=""https://www.designingtomorrowbook.com/"">designingtomorrowbook.com</a> (based on <a href=""https://collectiveimpactforum.org/what-is-collective-impact/"">original diagram</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To develop the conditions, designers can run a participatory systems mapping session to identify a common agenda, use the Theory of Change canvas to create shared measurements, and employ futuring tools like <a href=""https://designthinkmakebreakrepeat.com/toolkit/backcasting/"">backcasting</a> to formulate a mutually reinforcing action plan.</p><p>The backbone organisation plays a key role in aligning and coordinating the collective impact partnership. But this doesn’t necessarily need to involve establishing a new organisation, and we don’t need to wait for permission. The role can be allocated to an existing team or a specifically assembled group of representatives from across the organisation.</p><h4>#6—Starting with small change that compounds over time</h4><p>A massive shift is required to move away from the exploitation of natural resources and the systems that reinforce inequality and social fragmentation. For decades, the global economy has been shaped by neoliberalism, prioritising private profit over our shared social and ecological wellbeing.</p><p>Changing this feels overwhelming — especially for designers driven by an ambition to create positive social and environmental change, yet constrained at every step by systems that resist it.</p><p>This tension doesn’t exist only at an individual level. Through her work with entrepreneurs, Kari Enge, founder of Rank &amp; File, has observed a recurring pattern: organisations rarely feel they have enough time or budget to implement meaningful change. As a result, action is often deferred — pushed into an indefinite future when the necessary resources are assumed to appear.</p><p>This is where organisations fall over, time and time again. They look for ways to make a large, immediate change, failing to understand that positive change can start small and compound over time.</p><p><a href=""https://www.gofoundation.org.au/"">GO Foundation</a>, is an Australian organisation that supports Indigenous children in their education so that they can see themselves as the kind of person who finishes school: someone who takes on further education and embarks on a career while also maintaining their connection to culture and Country.</p><p>The foundation started with a small number, but those kids became role models to inspire others to make different choices for themselves. Each child going through this transformation influences more and more around them.</p><p>If the founders of the GO Foundation, when they started the organisation, had said, ‘helping just a few kids isn’t worth it, we should wait until we can help 100 or 1,000’, they would have missed out on years of impactful support or never created any change at all.</p><p>The key to successful change in the face of obstacles is to look for these kinds of impactful, small changes. The things we can do right now—as individuals and organisations—that have a compounding effect over time.</p><p>This requires us to be selective and focus our energies on the actions that begin to affect change, however small.</p><p>In fictional stories about time travel, the protagonists often worry that some tiny action they make will radically change the future. Yet, here we are in the present, thinking nothing we do can make a difference.</p><p>Reversing this perspective can imbue a great sense of empowerment: we can look for the small changes we can make now to deliver an impactful effect in the future.</p><p>This can start small, by focusing on what sits within our direct control: actions we can take without waiting for permission.</p><p>Like changing the language we use — replacing the colonial term <em>stakeholders</em> with <em>actors</em>; creating a systems map to surface potential unintended consequences; or forming a collective of like-minded colleagues and making space for conversations about driving positive impact.</p><p>Systems rarely invite change — designers build the conditions for it, one small step at a time.</p><figure><img alt=""The text “one percent” in white font and the word “change” in black font on a yellow background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1003/0*QEazE8SVaneeb_rz"" /><figcaption>As designers, we can achieve a significant impact through implementing small change that has a compounding effect over time</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Thank you for reading this article.

<h4>Designers hold the best qualities to get refine AI outputs that’s needed for building successful products</h4><p>Traditionally we’ve shied away from building because the chasm to go from designing to shipping requires learning to code, test, and bug fix. All of it required massive time investment to learn syntax, that changes every few years while core principles stay the same. Most of us are designers because we’re visual thinkers in a way.</p><p>In 2025, AI-assisted building closed this chasm. Translating how software should work was never the hard part for designers. Translating that understanding into code was. AI didn’t lower the bar; it removed it.</p><p>I’ve built 15+ working prototypes using Claude Code and Cursor, and shipped 3 apps in 2025 with just a basic understanding of Swift I learned three years ago; and, I’ve used that knowledge maybe 5% of the time. This article covers the mindset I evolved over the past year. This shift changed how I approach design, how I collaborate with engineering, how I think through technical problems, and how I think about AI itself.</p><figure><img alt=""a chart showing GitHub contributions of the author in 2025"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PDbywXKbaoHmwDaNfFIMSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Github contributions for 2025</figcaption></figure><h3>Why designers are natural orchestrators</h3><p>The skill of orchestrating agents to write, test, debug and iterate code sits a level above implementation. Designers are already good at this higher-level thinking; we just need to apply it to a new medium.</p><p>The skills that make someone good at design are precisely what AI-assisted building requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Defining outcomes clearly: </strong>We empathise and think of novel scenarios for our user, visualise what good looks like and use that in our artefacts.</li><li><strong>Anticipating failures: </strong>We map edge cases constantly</li><li><strong>Communicating intent without shared context: </strong>We do this in every handoff and during presentations to non-technical stakeholders</li></ul><p>Prompting well isn’t about knowing to code. It’s about articulating the “what” and “why” clearly enough that the AI can handle the “how.”</p><h3>What AI can’t do (and why that’s your job)</h3><p>While AI handles code, it doesn’t have:</p><ul><li>Contextual understanding of your users</li><li>Your vision for how the product should feel</li><li>The ability to form hypotheses about edge cases</li><li>Knowledge of which error states matter, regulatory concerns, or potential legal issues</li></ul><p>AI-readable mockups, detailed prompts, error recovery scenarios, user hypotheses - these aren’t optional; They’re the actual work now.</p><p>Asking AI to “figure it out” produces generic, buggy prototypes. Defining the experience accurately produces opinionated, intentional products. Combine that with a solid design system, craft, communicating design intent through prompting — you get a strong MVP ready.</p><h3>The progression: what I learnt shipping in 2025</h3><h4><strong>Phase 1: Accepting everything the AI Makes</strong></h4><p>My earliest builds were clumsy. My prompts were basic: “Make X feature and add this.” Things broke mysteriously. When they worked, I wasn’t sure what I’d done right. I’d just hit enter once cursor was done and move on until the thing it had implemented will break something else.</p><figure><img alt=""A cartoon depicting a dehydrated man crawling through a desert. He reaches a fork in the road with two signs pointing in opposite directions. The sign to the left, which is 21 miles away, says “Telling ‘pls fix’ to Cursor again.” The man is crawling toward this long-distance option. The sign to the right, which is only 1/4 mile away, says “Understand how things actually works.” The image is a humorous commentary on the temptation to rely on AI coding tools rather than learn the basics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_uWTd3KBhglyws_3yXbzgw.jpeg"" /></figure><p><strong>The problem:</strong> AI can’t understand your intent or the experience you’re building toward. It solves problems rationally using the most common patterns; not the right patterns for your users.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> I was treating AI like a handoff (“make me this”) instead of a collaboration (“here’s what I’m trying to achieve and why”). The “what” and “why” snowball into every architectural decision the model makes.</p><p>This is the phase where you’re copy-pasting code, things break mysteriously, and when they work you’re not sure what you did right. The orchestration is clumsy and you’re over-describing some things, under-describing others.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Document what you know: research, interaction patterns, user needs in a Claude.md or Agents.md file. The model references this context and builds architecture around it.</p><figure><img alt=""an image of a sidebar in cursor that shows documentation practices with architecture, phases, distribution and technical documentation to give additional context to AI while prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/584/1*vIa9u92F3niJzNOsJHyVDA.png"" /><figcaption>Ask AI to write documentation and verify what it has written.

The AI would hunt bugs and fix them. Code compiles, everything works; but, I’d lost the opportunity to think critically. Was it a technical bug, or an edge case I hadn’t considered that could break the user journey?</p><p>Debugging with AI is a skill. I stopped saying “it’s broken” and started saying “here’s what I expected, here’s what happened, here’s what I’ve tried, here’s my intention for this feature and how I want the user to use it”</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> The shift from “fix this” to hypothesis-driven debugging. Describing the behaviour matters more than the error message.</p><p><strong>In practice:</strong> Building a mac app, I hit a wall with Bluetooth connection sequencing. The device wouldn’t connect reliably. I described the bug, Claude generated fixes, I tested, still broken. We went in circles for hours.</p><p><strong>What worked:</strong> I stopped asking for fixes and asked for explanation. “Walk me through what you expect to happen after each step.” I wrote each step in my notebook, drew the flow in figma, visualised what should happen versus what was happening.</p><figure><img alt=""A horizontal screenshot of text within a dark-mode code editor interface. The text is a developer’s comment discussing a technical logic change and prompting with user scenario and hypothesis"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MZhzj5iqybgDU7JExw_uAg.png"" /><figcaption>Providing my own ideas after brainstorming</figcaption></figure><p>Then I came back differently. Not “fix this bug” but “here are three scenarios for how I want this connection sequence to feel from the user’s perspective. Align the code to scenario one and test.”</p><p>Scenario one failed. Scenario two failed. Scenario three worked.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong></p><ul><li>Ask AI / Claude code to create ASCII diagrams of current architecture. This reveals issues and surfaces edge cases you need to design for</li><li>Keep asking AI to explain things you don’t understand. Understanding how data models connect tells you what you need to design for</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A technical flowchart titled “Phase 3: Network Path Monitoring” with the goal “FIX: DETECT NETWORK INTERFACE CHANGES”.

Designers are naturally trained at this. Use the context you have from the documentation, technical constraints and user needs and elaborate the prompt to have all the necessary details.</p><figure><img alt=""A clean, vertical diagram titled “Prompt structure” featuring six rounded, colorful rectangular blocks stacked on the left, with corresponding text labels on the right.

It’s the same trap as designing for every possible case instead of running research sessions that answers what you’re trying to learn.</p><p>Prompting and optimising forever is a pitfall. Sometimes it’s good enough. Ship the MVP, learn from real usage, then return to design and prompt with actual context. I’ve learnt so much from shipping the MVP and learning about critical issues that helped me prompt better with the above techniques and to solve those bugs in a few minutes using Claude code or cursor.</p><p><strong>The lesson:</strong> Design and prompt for critical edge cases, but ship once you hit the core value proposition. Real-world insights beat hypothetical optimisation.</p><h3>What this means for design teams</h3><p>Everything above describes a solo journey. But the implications extend to how design, functions within product teams.</p><p><strong>The “how” conversation shifts.</strong> Traditionally, sometimes, designers have to adjust the “what” because technical constraints dictate scope.</p><blockquote>“This requires an extensive refactor so how can we simplify the design scope here?”</blockquote><p>That conversation remains valid. But AI-native teams can delay it or not have this situation at all. When the “how” can be achieved faster, the “what” and “why” become the primary constraints. Teams that clearly define intent, backed by research, usability studies with articulated and documented decisions will move faster. Teams that use design system documentation, annotations using dev mode mcp and bring contextual knowledge about the users, business goals to agents will move faster.</p><p><strong>Design ROI increases.</strong> Product strategy no longer needs to be defined primarily by what’s easier, faster, or cheaper to build. AI can build technical capabilities around user and business needs and take away the boring bits, giving engineers more time to work strategically. This was traditionally the advantage of design-centric organisations like Airbnb and Apple where release cycle was much slower.</p><p>Now smaller teams can operate the same way. Setting up your design system for agents, file documentation and annotations for agents to parse through will help teams move faster and ship well polished products. Design moves upstream, giving more time to work strategically while still being able to stay hands on and implement.</p><p><strong>The handoff changes.</strong> When designers can produce working prototypes and not just mockups, the conversation with engineering shifts. You’re not handing off a vision and hoping it survives. You’re handing off a functional proof of concept. The gap between design intent and shipped product shrinks.</p><p>I didn’t learn to code this year. I learned to orchestrate. The difference matters. Coding is about syntax. Orchestration is about intent, systems, and knowing what ‘done’ looks like. Designers have been doing that for years. The tools finally caught up.</p><p>To read more about AI-oriented workflows — I’d recommend checking out</p><p><a href=""https://x.com/mattpocockuk"">https://x.com/mattpocockuk</a><br /><a href=""https://x.com/steipete"">https://x.com/steipete</a><br /><a href=""https://x.com/Dimillian"">https://x.com/Dimillian</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b1bf30048a3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designers-as-agent-orchestrators-what-i-learnt-shipping-with-ai-in-2025-3b1bf30048a3"">Designers as agent orchestrators: what I learnt shipping with AI in 2025</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
