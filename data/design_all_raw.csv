<h4><strong><em>Designing how models behave.</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a ux team working together building AI products using data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K1TUKUFPN-K327z9HhexYg.png"" /><figcaption>UX team using their new toolkit (Ilustration from Nothing Fancy)</figcaption></figure><p>We have entered a world where the experience is generated in the moment, and users react to it. The days when products rendered code that produced exactly what we designed are numbered. When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event.

This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop.

<h4>The one with React, Tailwind and the separation of concerns</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZN4DxRu31nQssMHRuFCTg.png"" /></figure><p>When I started learning about web development I learned clean HTML, vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, which are three different ways of saying: “No Frameworks”.</p><p>That’s the way most developers learned to code, at least in my age group, since we didn’t have any framework other than jQuery back then, and AI coding assistants weren’t a thing yet.</p><p>Years later I did learn React (a JavaScript framework) and I did had to get to know Tailwind (a CSS framework) for work projects so everyone in the development team would be on the same page.</p><p>For years I didn’t understand why React or Tailwind worked in the way they did, I felt frustrated because every little thing seemed to require more work then in plain JavaScript or CSS.</p><p>I didn’t think those frameworks save me much time or work in the long run and I was annoyed that I had to use them every day.</p><p>When I asked other developers about that, they often cited the concept of “separation of concerns” as a reason that makes React simpler to use or more suitable for team projects.</p><p>At the time I didn’t get it. But now — after years of working with React and Tailwind I think I’m finally getting it. If you’re anything like I was, confused or frustrated about it, please keep reading.</p><h3>What is separation of concerns</h3><p>Separation of concerns is a programming term that means that any “problem” can be separated into smaller and easier to deal with “concerns”.</p><p>In our example the “concerns” are just long code that is hard to grasp all at once. HTML has a few ways of dealing with code that is too complex already built-in to the technology.</p><p>One way we can handle code that’s too long is to separate it into different files — HTML for the content, CSS for the styles and JavaScript (js files) for functions.</p><p>This way you can more easily separate the different areas you’re dealing with: HTML for the structure, CSS when you handle the design and JavaScript when you handle the hardcore programming stuff.</p><figure><img alt=""The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0KoD-Ccdg_1Qg2R3p4b1qA.png"" /><figcaption>The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course in real projects every file will be in multiples, multiple HTML files for different pages (or parts of pages), multiple CSS files for different aspects of the design and multiple JavaScript files for different kinds of functions.</p><p>As the project goes up in complexity the pile of files gets bigger and it is murky at best where is the line to split the files.</p><p>If we’ll take for example CSS files, as it is closest to the design aspect and so easier to explain, we have multiple options how to slice it:</p><ol><li>Maybe just to work with one huge file</li><li>Slicing it to smaller files by platform: Desktop.css, Mobile.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by components: Header.css, Footer.css, Button.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by pages: Index.css, About.css, Contact.css … General.css</li><li>Slicing it by function: Common.css, Breakpoints.css, Vars.css etc.</li></ol><p>It isn’t clear at all where to draw the line of separation and I’ve seen many teams do it in very different ways, sometimes even combining more than one option unintentionally.</p><p>So how can React and Tailwind help us to decide?</p><h3>The component based approach</h3><p>Let me preface what I’m about to say with that, like HTML, there’s lots of ways of making a React app.</p><p>The most common way is to separate each component into its own file, so we’ll end up with files named Button.jsx, Checkbox.jsx, Avatar.jsx, Card.jsx etc.</p><p>These components get imported into different screens with different configurations (via props) so the code inside the components will potentially get replicated an infinite amount of times.</p><p>Unlike HTML, we don’t need to manually copy the code to different places and different files, we just import the component and React will swap its code into every place we’ve called it from.</p><p>If we’re thinking about the separation of concerns, what React does is very different from HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript .</p><figure><img alt=""React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*7qEbNSNibMNpTJg7SqU1PA.png"" /><figcaption>React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file</figcaption></figure><p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript separate our concerns into multiple areas of responsibility, while React takes a different approach.</p><p>React separates our concerns based on component structure, so different developers can work on different components without bumping into one another.</p><p>But they’re all React developers, no longer a CSS specialist or an HTML architect, everyone is doing the same kind of work but on different building blocks.</p><p>The distinction here is major since it slices the work for optimization rather than for specialization, which is almost the opposite approach.</p><h3>Entering Tailwind CSS</h3><p>Tailwind is a very popular CSS framework that works as a utility framework meaning all styles are done with inline classes instead of a big giant stylesheet.</p><p>This way you can copy and paste components from different layouts and ensure they will look exactly the same, of course when working with React components, the component gets imported into many layouts, pages or screens so consistency is key — and Tailwind enables just that.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*huR5zgz0VL57FIMgfHXKlA.png"" /><figcaption>The same button 3 times (left to right): Pure HTML/CSS, Tailwind, rendered result.</figcaption></figure><p>If this is your first time seeing Tailwind code, I implore you to go and try it out, it’s not as strange to work with as it might seem at first glance and it is much better than making inline styles.</p><p>Now that every codebase is in some degree written with AI I can’t stress this enough — Tailwind is much better than regular inline styles, if you’re a CSS purist working with a stylesheet file or files that’s great, even a simple inline style here and there is mostly fine.</p><p>But never let the AI just make lots and lots of inline styles for everything, always ask to convert them to another file or just to work with Tailwind, inline styles are unmaintainable in the long run.</p><p>I know what you must be thinking when encountering Tailwind, and it’s the title of the next section.</p><figure><img alt=""Now we don’t have any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx, jsx or js file)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*ps_lonYDcBT14XsvgL6TVw.png"" /><figcaption>When working with Tailwind we don’t need any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx or jsx file)</figcaption></figure><h3>What happened to separation of concerns?</h3><p>I know that at first it looks like our separation of concerns is gone, React already implements all the HTML (via JSX) and the JavaScript in the same files.</p><p>Tailwind CSS takes it even further and it pulls the CSS utility classes into the JSX as well, instead of leaving them on separate files.</p><p>That way we don’t get any separation by areas anymore, the functions, design and structure all live together.</p><p>What we DO get, however, is separation by component, which can be more useful for big teams who work on the same system or same project together.</p><p>Separation by component means that even though a developer might be working on all the different areas of an Avatar component, the same developer doesn’t need to be concerned about the Button component while doing it.</p><p>Tailwind CSS ensures that all components will be designed as planned, even if they were designed in isolation, outside the system itself, since its utility classes are all deterministic by design and no style should ever leak outside its intended scope.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Separation of concerns is subjective and it is done differently in different systems, React and Tailwind do it component-based while pure HTML and CSS are more area-based.</p><p>There is no right answer to how you should do it, but consistency is key, especially when working in a team.</p><p>Guidelines and best practices are great, but a separation that is inherit to the technology itself will always be better since everyone in the team can agree on it.</p><p>When we consider a separation of concerns based on areas of expertise we can also consider to hire a CSS specialist, for example, but a Button specialist is not currently a job title, and maybe it should be as React and Tailwind becomes more popular.</p><p>I didn’t touch on all the ways to separate CSS into multiple files and achieve something similar to component-based separation of concerns in pure HTML and CSS because I don’t believe it’s the right way to go when working in large teams.</p><p>There are a million technologies out there and a million ways to solve this issue, but I picked React and Tailwind as an example since it’s a very popular solution.</p><p>This article only scratched the surface.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed it, thanks

<h4>What we can learn from Linear about trusting judgement without ignoring evidence</h4><figure><img alt=""Migrating flock of birds, silhoutte on a sunset sky."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nUcS3dsfo9Mw2Xgu"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@the_ova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Otinov</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Data feels objective, defensible, and safe. In many product teams, it has quietly become the most powerful decision-maker in the room — not because it consistently leads to better outcomes, but because it removes personal accountability. When a decision can be justified with numbers, no one has to truly own it.</p><blockquote>“Although you may think that people instinctively want to make the best possible decision, there is a stronger force that animates business decision-making: the desire not to get blamed or fired.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><p>‘Data-driven design’ is often framed as maturity. In practice, it can become a way to defer judgement, smooth over disagreement, and default to the option that will attract the least resistance. The result isn’t better products — it’s safer ones. Incremental improvements which optimise what already exists, while bolder ideas are quietly filtered out because they can’t yet be proven.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that data doesn’t make decisions, people do. Data can inform, challenge, and validate — but it can’t decide what <em>should</em> exist, only describe what <em>has</em> happened before. When teams hide behind metrics, they’re not being rigorous; they’re avoiding the risk that comes with choosing a direction and standing behind it.</p><blockquote>“It’s important to remember that big data all comes from the same place — the past.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><h3>How Linear balances judgement and evidence</h3><p>In an interview reflecting on Linear’s design philosophy, co-founder and designer Karri Saarinen speaks directly about the limits of “<a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=wTvMaV6-txFSlIa4"">hiding behind data</a>” and the harder work of judgement. <a href=""https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1706745692965027994"">He describes how teams often lean on quantitative signals because they’re afraid of making the wrong choice — and how data becomes a comforting shield.</a> But that safety is an illusion. Data doesn’t make choices for you; it only reports what has already happened.</p><p>Too much deference to metrics doesn’t just slow teams down — it actively pushes them toward incrementalism. When evidence is treated as a prerequisite for action rather than an input into judgement, bold ideas struggle to survive long enough to be tested.</p><p>What’s striking in Saarinen’s thinking is his insistence that product teams should feel empowered to decide based on a deep understanding of the problem, and rich context gained from direct engagement with users and the product — not just dashboards or scoreboard metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Linear product management platform, showing the sleek, clean interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*acTrxuSLfk04FWlNXWH6Jg.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Linear is a product development tool built with an unusually strong emphasis on craft, clarity, and focus — designed by people who believe good software should feel deliberate.</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://linear.app/now/why-is-quality-so-rare"">At Linear, design isn’t something you outsource to analytics — it’s a product philosophy.</a> They pursue quality not as a growth tactic or a differentiator, but because they believe good software should be well made. Craft isn’t justified by metrics; it’s a responsibility the team chooses to take seriously.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-linear-builds-product"">Rather than waiting for perfect metrics before acting, Linear routinely builds features and ships them to internal users or small opt-in groups early — even when the experience is rough.</a> This accelerates learning, sharpens judgement, and creates real feedback long before broad exposure. Engineers and designers are encouraged to own problems end-to-end, including small inefficiencies that may not yet register in analytics, but materially affect the lived experience of users.</p><h4>Data is a tool, not a crutch</h4><p>Saarinen points out that teams often invoke data when they’re afraid to own a decision. At Linear, they don’t rely on exhaustive ranking exercises or metric-driven roadmaps to determine direction. Instead, decisions emerge from a blend of:</p><ul><li>Direct customer conversations and qualitative feedback</li><li>Founders’ and team intuition, shaped by deep product familiarity</li><li>Contextual signals from real usage</li></ul><p>Data is still present, but it becomes one signal in a broader conversation, not the authority that ends it.</p><blockquote>“Data isn’t bad — it’s just not the decision-maker.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Build with confidence, fail fast, and fix things</h4><p>Linear treats mistakes as an expected part of building good products. This flips the narrative from fear to responsibility. Designers and product leads aren’t protected by metrics; they’re accountable for choices — and expected to correct them quickly when they’re wrong.</p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes we make the wrong choice, and then we just fix it — but at least </em>we<em> made the choice, and the data didn’t make the choice for us.”</em></blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Safe decisions are rarely transformative</h4><p>Safe decisions are rarely transformative — and transformative decisions are rarely safe. Direction at Linear is chosen through judgement informed by deep engagement with users, even when the metrics haven’t caught up yet.</p><p>By combining context, craft, judgement, and fast feedback loops, teams can avoid both extremes: blind intuition on one side, and the paralysis of waiting for perfect data on the other.</p><h3>What we can learn from Linear</h3><h4><strong>Ship early and often</strong></h4><p>Don’t wait for perfect analytics before releasing. Internal launches and small cohorts create faster, richer learning than prolonged analysis ever will.</p><h4>Build shared product understanding</h4><p>Distribute customer stories, recordings, and qualitative insights. When context is shared, judgement becomes defensible without needing a dashboard to prove every choice.</p><h4>Treat data as input, not authority</h4><p>Use metrics to inform and challenge intuition, not replace it. Data should contribute to decisions — not make them by default.</p><h4>Give designers space to pursue craft</h4><p>Quality isn’t always measurable upfront, but it’s immediately felt. When teams prioritise craft, they make better decisions because they’re deeply attuned to user experience.</p><h4>Close the accountability loop</h4><p>Make decisions based on expertise and judgement — then measure the outcome. Celebrate learning, not just success. That’s how intuition becomes a skill, not a superstition.</p><h3>References and resources</h3><h4><a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=nIj236gra4EU8b7c"">Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus</a></h4><p>The main inspiration for this article was an interview with Karri Saarinen on design judgement, data, and decision-making — particularly from around 49m, where he critiques hiding behind data and emphasises ownership of decisions.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/if-youre-not-using-ux-data-it-s-not-ux-design-9e02c388d196"">If you're not using UX data, it's not UX design</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-onboarding-linear-built-without-any-ab-testing-b035572ced72"">The onboarding Linear built without any AB Testing</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-b-testing-done-wrong-87beee4a5328"">A/B testing done wrong</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a07360337dd8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-safest-decision-is-rarely-the-right-one-a07360337dd8"">The safest decision is rarely the right one</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI can conjure photorealistic faces and dreamy landscapes in seconds, but ask it to write “Happy Birthday” on a cake and things get weird fast. The culprit is how these models learn to read, and the solution is trickier than it seems.</h4><p>Imagine you’ve just prompted your chosen AI image generator to create a stunning fashion advertisement for a major platform. The colours are gorgeous, the composition is beautifully balanced, and the lighting would make any photographer jealous. There’s just one small problem: the text reads “SHOP NUG.” Close, but not quite.</p><figure><img alt=""Four identical fashion ads with increasingly garbled AI-generated text, showing errors like ‘SHUP NOY,’ ‘DISGVER YUR SFYLE,’ and ‘SUMMILER COLLECION’ instead of proper words."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JpH8f3y4pOZpYh5Mlbg1iQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>If this sounds familiar, you’re certainly not alone. Despite remarkable leaps in AI-generated imagery over the past few years, text rendering remains the Achilles’ heel of even the most sophisticated models. And here’s the kicker: whilst generation has been steadily improving, <em>editing</em> that garbled text after the fact is proving to be an even thornier challenge.</p><p>So, what gives?</p><h3><strong>The fundamental mismatch</strong></h3><p>The truth is, AI image generators don’t actually “read” text. At all. When you ask <a href=""https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/"">DALL-E</a> or <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com/"">Midjourney</a> to include words in an image, the model isn’t processing language. It’s simply pattern-matching shapes it has seen before in training data.</p><p>Traditional text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion perceive text as a collection of pixels and visual elements to composite into the scene, not as meaning-conveying strings of characters. The model has seen millions of images containing billboards, book covers, and street signs, but it was never explicitly taught what those squiggles <em>mean</em> or how they follow strict rules of spelling and grammar.</p><p>This creates a fundamental mismatch. Text is precise and unforgiving: one wrong letter changes everything (“STOP” versus “ST0P”, anyone?). Images, by contrast, are fluid and interpretive. A face can be slightly asymmetrical and still look human. A landscape can have unusual lighting and still feel real. But misspell a single word? The illusion shatters.</p><h3><strong>How diffusion actually works (in broad strokes)</strong></h3><p>To understand why text is such a headache, it helps to peek behind the curtain at how these models generate images in the first place.</p><p>Most modern AI image generators use something called <a href=""https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/"">diffusion models</a>. The basic idea is surprisingly elegant. During training, the model learns to gradually add noise to images until they become pure static, then reverses this process by removing noise step-by-step to recover coherent pictures.</p><p>When you type a prompt, it gets processed through a text encoder (typically <a href=""https://openai.com/index/clip/"">CLIP</a>) that converts your words into numerical representations. These embeddings then guide the denoising process, steering the random noise towards something resembling your description.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI image generation workflow in five steps: 1) Prompt (text input), 2) Encode (AI processes text), 3) Denoise (removes visual noise shown as dots), 4) Refine (improves image composition), 5) Output (final image). Illustrated with simple icons connected by arrows flowing left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q2BzL8FhuLaDKns0UbFJ5g.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>The problem? Fine details like individual letters are treated as low-priority during the early denoising steps. Errors get “baked in” early and become <a href=""https://dev.to/tracywhodoesnot/why-ai-struggles-with-text-in-image-generation-n69"">incredibly difficult to correct later in the process</a>. The model is essentially guessing letter shapes with no feedback loop to verify whether its guess makes any linguistic sense.</p><p>There’s also the tokenisation issue. When CLIP processes text, it splits words into tokens, and sometimes those splits break apart the very concepts it’s trying to understand. “Deep focus,” for instance, gets tokenised into separate pieces, losing the photographic meaning entirely. The same fragmentation happens with the text <em>in</em> your images, making coherent words harder to reconstruct.</p><h3><strong>Generation is getting better — editing, not so much</strong></h3><p>Now for some good news: text generation in AI images has improved dramatically. Newer models are making genuine strides, and the gap between “absolutely wrong” and “actually usable” has narrowed considerably over the past year or so.</p><p>The improvement isn’t accidental. Companies have specifically invested in solving this problem, recognising that text accuracy is a dealbreaker for commercial applications. After all, nobody wants to hand a client an otherwise perfect AI-generated mockup with “BSET PRCIES” plastered across it.</p><p><a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a>, a platform built specifically with typography in mind, is said to be achieving now roughly <a href=""https://pxz.ai/blog/ideogram-vs-midjourney-2026"">95% accuracy on text prompts</a>, a remarkable leap compared to Midjourney’s approximately 40%. The company claims its latest model reduces text error rates by <a href=""https://the-decoder.com/ideogram-1-0-outshines-midjourney-and-dall-e-3-with-impressive-text-rendering/"">nearly half compared to DALL-E 3</a>. For designers who need readable words on posters, logos, and social media graphics, this could be genuinely transformative.</p><p>But does it really stand up to scrutiny? In the first example below, I asked it to generate a bookshelf with popular titles on product design, with the text clearly visible. The results showed significant errors (“Don’t Make Me Think” became “DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK,”) and other titles were similarly garbled. Next, I provided a specific list of books and authors. The outcome? Still riddled with text errors, suggesting that Ideogram’s touted 95% accuracy claim falls short in actual use cases that require heavy text generation. It may fare better with simpler, single-text prompts, but complex scenarios remain problematic.</p><figure><img alt=""Two AI-generated images of design book bookshelves side by side.

It can place text wherever it likes, choose fonts that play nicely with its capabilities, and build the entire composition around what it knows it can render well.</p><p>Editing is a different beast entirely. When you ask an AI to fix garbled text on an existing image (through inpainting or other techniques) the model must preserve everything <em>around</em> the text whilst only modifying the specific region you’ve highlighted. This is where things get complicated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1614608/full"">Research on latent diffusion models for inpainting</a> shows that when applied to large or irregular regions, these models “tend to generate blurry or contextually ambiguous reconstructions.” The model fills in details based on surrounding context and learned patterns, which simply isn’t precise enough for the exact letter shapes that text requires.</p><p>In practical terms? The AI might successfully remove your gibberish text, but when it tries to paint new letters into that space, it struggles to match the exact style, lighting, and perspective of the original image. The result often looks patched rather than seamless.</p><h3><strong>Why you’re not imagining things</strong></h3><p>If editing feels harder than generating, the data backs you up. A <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">2025 benchmark study published in MDPI</a> evaluated multiple AI models across text accuracy metrics and found that all major platforms (including DALL-E 3, Ideogram, and Stable Diffusion) face “significant challenges with text accuracy” across domains like code, chemical diagrams, and multi-line text.</p><p>The scores are telling. For code-related text, Stable Diffusion scored just 1.25 out of 5 for text accuracy. Even Ideogram, the supposed text champion, managed only 1.75 in the same category. When it comes to complex, structured text requiring precise formatting, all models struggle.</p><p>Platform comparisons in 2025 reflect this reality. <a href=""https://apatero.com/blog/image-to-image-ai-transformation-comparison-2025"">Image-to-image tools vary significantly</a>, with Midjourney notably lacking “true inpainting and transformation controls.” For users who do heavy editing work, local Stable Diffusion with ControlNet remains the go-to option. However, that requires technical expertise most casual users might simply not have.</p><h3><strong>The workarounds (for now)</strong></h3><p>Until AI cracks this particular nut, what’s a designer to do? A few strategies have emerged, each with their own trade-offs.</p><p><strong>Use text-first generators.</strong> If you know you’ll need accurate typography, start with <a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a> or similar text-focused tools rather than trying to force words into Midjourney’s artistic outputs. It’s a case of picking the right tool for the job; you wouldn’t edit a feature film in PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Dual monitor setup showing AI workflow: left screen displays AI-generated coffee shop interior without text, right screen shows the same image in Photoshop with ‘Daily Brew Co.’ text overlay being added. Design tool logos (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, Affinity Designer) surround the monitors on the right side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_KEoHpKYJ9mBavQCGm33XA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Generate first, add text later.</strong> Many professionals now create their AI imagery text-free, then overlay typography using traditional design tools like Photoshop, Canva, or Figma. It’s an extra step, but the results are far more reliable. This approach also gives you complete control over font selection, kerning, and placement; things AI still handles clumsily at best.</p><p><strong>Try dedicated fix-it tools.</strong> Platforms like <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-gibberish-text-in-ai-generated-images/"">Storia Lab’s Textify</a> or Canva’s Grab Text tool can identify gibberish text and attempt to replace it. Results vary (patience is required) but for simple corrections, they can save considerable headaches. Just don’t expect miracles with complex multi-line text or heavily stylised typography.</p><p><strong>Embrace the hybrid workflow.</strong> As one industry comparison put it, “many professionals use both platforms,” generating artistic foundations in Midjourney, then handling typography in Ideogram. It’s not elegant, and it requires subscriptions to multiple services, but it works. Think of it as assembling a toolkit rather than searching for a single magic wand.</p><p><strong>Keep expectations realistic.</strong> Perhaps the most important strategy is simply managing client and stakeholder expectations. AI-generated imagery is powerful, but it has clear limitations. Flagging potential text issues upfront saves awkward conversations down the line.</p><h3><strong>What this means for designers and UX professionals</strong></h3><p>Beyond the technical challenges, there’s a broader conversation here about workflow and expectations. As AI tools become more embedded in creative processes, understanding their limitations isn’t just nice-to-have knowledge; it’s essential professional competence.</p><p>For UX writers and content designers, this has particular relevance. If you’re working with teams that use AI-generated imagery, you need to factor text limitations into your content strategy. That punchy headline might look great in a mockup, but will it survive the AI rendering process intact? Sometimes the answer is simply: maybe not.</p><p>And let’s be honest, there’s something almost poetic about AI mastering the creation of human faces whilst fumbling with human writing. It’s a reminder that these tools, however impressive, aren’t magic. They’re sophisticated pattern-matching systems with specific strengths and equally specific blind spots.</p><h3><strong>What’s on the horizon?</strong></h3><p>The research community hasn’t given up. Several promising approaches are in development:</p><ul><li><strong>Hybrid AI systems</strong> that generate a base image through one model, then overlay text using a separate, specialist module designed specifically for accurate placement. Think of it as mimicking how human designers work: creating the visual first, then adding captions as a final step.</li><li><strong>Better training data.</strong> Most current datasets lack properly labelled, structured text within images. Training on annotated text data could help models understand not just where text appears, but what it actually says and how words are properly formed.</li><li><strong>Vector-based rendering.</strong> Some teams are exploring ways to separate text from raster imagery entirely, treating typography as a discrete, editable layer rather than baking it into pixels. This would fundamentally change how text is handled, moving from pattern-matching to something closer to actual typesetting.</li><li><strong>OCR feedback loops.</strong> Imagine a model that generates text, runs optical character recognition to check its own work, and iterates until the spelling is correct. This kind of self-correction mechanism could dramatically reduce errors, though it would add computational overhead.</li></ul><h3><strong>Spelling it out</strong></h3><p>AI image generation has come a long way in a remarkably short time. Photorealistic faces, impossible architecture, dreamlike landscapes — all conjured from a few words typed into a prompt box. But text, that most human of visual elements, remains stubbornly resistant.</p><p>The core issue isn’t laziness or neglect. It’s architectural. Diffusion models were designed to see images holistically, not to parse the precise, rule-bound structures that make written language work. Generation is improving because researchers are training dedicated models for the task. Editing lags behind because preserving context whilst fixing details is a fundamentally harder problem.</p><p>For now, the practical advice is straightforward: plan for text limitations, use the right tool for the job, and don’t be afraid to bring in traditional design software for the finishing touches. AI is brilliant at many things. Fixing spelling errors in images just isn’t one of them… yet.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3><strong>References &amp; Credits:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">(2025).

<h4><em>Why data tables are an accessibility blind-spot (and how WCAG helps)</em></h4><p>Data tables are used in many different products and contexts. They are used in dashboards, product comparisons, or even internal finance reports. They help users make decisions, spot data patterns, and take action where needed.</p><p><strong>But when it comes to accessibility, data tables are often skipped.</strong> They’re assumed to be handled by default HTML or put off until the development stage.</p><p>Visually, the tables look easy to read with clear columns and rows, as well as distinct headers. But for many users (like those using screen readers or keyboard navigation), these tables can become confusing or even unusable.</p><figure><img alt=""Example data tables from IBM Carbon and Salesforce Lightning design systems"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V2pdiWu3IGVeuqcTJI_yRw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Many open-source data tables are available via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-datatable-basic--overview""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--base""><em>Salesforce Lightning</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Just to be clear; WCAG doesn’t prohibit data tables, it just requires that the table’s information, relationships, and functionality are available to all users.</strong> Not only that, you don’t need complex solutions to have both data tables and WCAG-compliant designs.</p><p>Let’s break down why data tables are frequently overlooked, what WCAG requires of them, and how designers and product teams can create accessible data tables.</p><h3>Why are tables an accessibility blind-spot?</h3><p>To be fair, data tables sit in an awkward spot between design and development. They feel too technical to be a pure design problem, but also feel too visual to be treated as just code. As a result, accessibility issues slip through the cracks.</p><p>But what specific issues come from neither design or dev taking full ownership of tables?</p><h4>Tables lack semantic structure</h4><p>Visually, most tables appear easy to scan with aligned column headers and distinguished rows. But when this same structure isn’t communicated properly in the code, assistive technologies lose the context that sighted users get visually.</p><p><strong>Without proper header associations, a screen reader (like Voiceover or NVDA) may announce a value without indicating which column or row it belongs to.</strong></p><p>For instance, let’s say there is a data table depicting the concerts you attended last year. A sighted user can easily understand when and where each concert was, but a screen reader announces “12 February” without the associated concert it corresponds to.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table example with header cells named Date, Event, Venue in the top row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m6eIsbk0X6ngwuwkpiQeAQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table example with header cells in the top row via </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/#table-with-header-cells-in-the-top-row-only""><em>W3 WAI tutorials</em></a></figcaption></figure><pre>&lt;table&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Venue&lt;/th&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;12 February&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Waltz with Strauss&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Main Hall&lt;/td&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  […]<br />&lt;/table&gt;</pre><h4>Design Systems with information gaps</h4><p><strong>Many Design Systems include a table component, but sometimes they don’t clarify how the component should be used in the wild.</strong> The guidance leaves open questions about accessibility, like:</p><ul><li>When should a table be used instead of a list?</li><li>How should sorting behave?</li><li>What happens when data is empty, truncated, or loading?</li></ul><p>Without explicit standards, tables used by different teams behave differently, and accessibility becomes inconsistent.</p><h4>Added interactions without accessibility</h4><p>Modern tables are typically dynamic with sortable columns, selectable rows, and inline actions. But these interaction patterns are layered on top of the table without clear guidance on keyboard behavior, focus order, or screen reader announcements.</p><p><strong>When accessibility is addressed late in development, teams might add impromptu ARIA attributes instead of designing inclusively from the start.</strong> This results in a table that “functions,” but feels unpredictable or exhausting to navigate with only a keyboard.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table with batch actions as an example from IBM Carbon Storybook"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gxIqfbG4PyAO04wG_Sk3WA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table with batch actions via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable-batch-actions--default""><em>IBM Carbon Storybook</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>Anatomy of an accessible data table</h3><h4>Overall structure</h4><ul><li>Rows and columns reflect the data’s relationships (not just visual alignment)</li><li>Headers clearly describe the content they correspond to</li><li>Reading order matches how the data is meant to be understood</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Okr49IcRO2jl9hwhoNUSdA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row; via </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/""><em>Google Sheets</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Data relationships</h4><ul><li>Individual values connect to both their column and their row headers (even in multi-dimensional tables)</li><li>Context is communicated through programmatic associations (not only by visual means like spacing or alignment)</li><li>Users navigate cell by cell and understand the data as a whole</li></ul><h4>Predictable navigation</h4><ul><li>Filters, column headers, and actions have clear labels</li><li>Keyboard focus is always visible on the data table</li><li>Focus (tab) order aligns with the visual and logical layout of the table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Dell’s Design System includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CEFgqCp5UFOJYITDRfLxJg.gif"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://react.delldesignsystem.com/2.21.0/index.html?path=/story/components-table--bulk-actions""><em>Dell’s Design System</em></a><em> includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Proper interactions</h4><ul><li>Interactive tables have clear affordances, accessible labels, and visible states</li><li>Users know when a column is sortable and which direction it’s sorted in</li><li>Users know what happens when they activate a control with a keyboard or mouse</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: This anatomy allows assistive technologies to answer basic questions like: What column am I in?

There’s no guideline that says “make tables accessible.” Instead, WCAG is more concerned with whether users can perceive relationships, operate functionality, and understand content within the table.</p><p><strong>WCAG provides a framework, but it’s up to designers and teams to meet the expectations.</strong></p><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html#brief"">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</a></h4><p>This criteria asks that all users can understand how headers relate to data cells, regardless of how the table looks visually. When header relationships are missing, assistive technologies can’t provide meaningful context.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Use table markup to present tabular information (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51"">Technique H51</a>)</li><li>Use caption elements to associate the data table’s title or heading with the table (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39"">Technique H39</a>)</li><li>Use the scope attribute to associate header cells with cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H63"">Technique H63</a>)</li><li>Use id and headers attributes to associate cells with header cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H43"">Technique H43</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href"">https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard"">SC 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</a></h4><p>Any interaction included in a table must be operable using only a keyboard. This includes not only navigating the table itself, but also using features like filtering, pagination, and row-level actions.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure keyboard control for all functionality (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202"">Technique G202</a>)</li><li>Provide keyboard-triggered event handlers (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G90"">Technique G90</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order#brief"">SC 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)</a></h4><p>Users navigating with a keyboard need to know where they are at all times. WCAG requires visible focus indicators and clear communication of state changes.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Place the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G59"">Technique G59</a>)</li><li>Make the DOM order match the visual order (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27"">Technique C27</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels"">SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that controls and content have clear, descriptive labels. In data tables, this applies to the table’s title, column headers, and its interactive controls.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide descriptive headings (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130"">Technique G130</a>)</li><li>Provide descriptive labels (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131"">Technique G131</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href"">https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value#brief"">SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that content work reliably with assistive technologies now and in the future. For data tables, this means relying on semantic structure and predictable behavior rather than visually driven solutions.</p><p>Example techniques to pass:</p><ul><li>Use aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA14"">Technique ARIA14</a>)</li><li>Use aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA16"">Technique ARIA16</a>)</li></ul><h3>What designers should do before dev touches code</h3><p>Accessible data tables start with design decisions. Designers are responsible for preventing accessibility issues long before a developer ever starts coding. This includes defining design decisions like table structure, interactions, and data complexity.</p><h4>Use real structure, not just layout</h4><p>Before thinking about visual styling, designers should answer the following:</p><ul><li>What are the rows?</li><li>What are the columns?</li><li>What relationships matter most?</li></ul><p>If these answers aren’t obvious in the design, they won’t be obvious to assistive technologies. You need clear column headers, meaningful row labels, and consistent data structure.</p><h4>Have intentional interactions</h4><p>Not every table needs sorting, filtering, or inline actions. Each interaction adds cognitive load and accessibility complexity. When interactions are necessary, designers should define:</p><ul><li>Which columns are sortable</li><li>What happens when sorting is applied</li><li>How users move between table content and controls</li><li>If actions apply to a row, a cell, or the entire table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Atlassian’s Design System includes interactions when it makes sense with the data relationships"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pplXXuqgTPxTXbCCSO0EqA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atlassian.design/components/dynamic-table/examples#uncontrolled""><em>Atlassian’s Design System</em></a><em> includes interactions, like sorting, when it makes sense with the data relationships</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Design for keyboard users</h4><p>Using a keyboard is a primary input method for many users. Designers need to ensure that tables can be navigated in a logical, predictable order by asking:</p><ul><li>Can every interactive element be reached without a mouse/ trackpad?</li><li>Does keyboard focus move in a way that matches the table’s structure?</li><li>Are hover-only actions also doable via keyboard?</li></ul><h4>Consider various screen sizes</h4><p>Designers need to explicitly define how table structure and relationships are preserved across breakpoints. As the screen size shrinks, it’s simple to collapse and hide content, but designers should document:</p><ul><li>How labels remain associated with their values</li><li>How users can navigate between the data</li><li>How accessible interactions are maintained</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Lightning Design System’s data table responding to mobile screen size"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8s-b_ImlOvrMbOwmyYkvvg.png"" /><figcaption>Data tables need to respond when presented on mobile devices; via <a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--with-sorting"">Lightning Design System</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Document table expectations in Design Systems</h4><p>Data tables scale and remain consistent when they’re a shared standard. Documenting how tables behave is just as important as documenting how they look.</p><p>Helpful documentation includes:</p><ul><li>When to use a table (and when to other components like a list)</li><li>Required semantics with structure, headers, and labels</li><li>Keyboard and interaction behavior (like focus and pagination)</li><li>Interaction states and edge cases (like empty, loading, or error states)</li><li>Any known accessibility considerations or constraints</li></ul><p>Data tables are treated as containers for information, but they’re some of the most complex elements users interact with. Without incorporating accessibility into tables, users lose context, navigation becomes frustrating, and critical data becomes hard to understand.</p><p><strong>Complying with WCAG criteria helps all users no matter their ability.</strong> Accessible tables are easier to scan, more predictable to navigate, and clearly communicate meaning. They benefit screen reader users, keyboard users, and anyone working with dense data. When tables are designed with the same care as any other interface, accessibility follows naturally.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6a13533a6fde"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/data-tables-need-to-be-accessible-too-6a13533a6fde"">Data tables need to be accessible, too</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
