<h4>How designers create true alignment with visual thinking</h4><p>I want to tell you about my favorite apple. It’s incredible. It’s hands down the most delicious apple of all time! When you see it hanging on a tree, its color invites you to come closer and take a bite. When it’s ripe, the flavor is amazing, complemented with a delightfully pleasing texture. It’s a fantastic fruit that fills you with delight.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw picture of an apple shape with questions around it"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dfRMi0iyg9vrfJYA.jpg"" /><figcaption>What kind of apple are you imagining?</figcaption></figure><p>Now, what kind of apple did you imagine? Was it red, green, or yellow? Was the taste tart, sweet, or mild? Where did you imagine that tree…in a field, backyard, or in an orchard? Every person reading this description has a different kind of apple in mind. Yet, we’re all speaking the same language, using the same terms to talk about the same apple. The language is the same, but the ideas in our heads are different.</p><p>This is what I call the “illusion of alignment,” and it doesn’t just happen with apples. It happens all the time in meetings, design reviews, planning sessions, emails, strategy documents and more.</p><h3>The Illusion in Action</h3><p>Imagine a product team spends weeks planning a major feature redesign. Everyone attends the kickoff meeting. The product manager presents the strategy doc. It’s thorough. It’s well-written. It covers all the bases. Heads nod around the room. Engineering gives a thumbs up. Architecture gives green lights. UX flashes a smile. The scope is clear. The goals are documented. Everyone agrees this is the right direction.</p><p>You take notes, ask a few clarifying questions, and get to work. Over the next several weeks, you explore concepts, refine the direction, and build out the solution. It feels good. It feels aligned. The check-ins go smoothly. Then comes the first design review…</p><p>The designer presents their work…the culmination of weeks of thinking, exploring, and refining. And the room… erupts. Not with excitement. With confusion. With concern. With frustration.</p><blockquote>“Wait, I thought we agreed on something simpler?”</blockquote><blockquote>“This isn’t what I had in mind at all.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Why did you go in this direction?”</blockquote><p>Everyone feels blindsided. The designer is confused because they followed the strategy, they asked questions, they thought everyone was aligned. The product manager is frustrated at the designer…clearly they didn’t read the brief. The leaders are worried…we’ve lost weeks, and now we have to start over. Engineers are annoyed since they’ve been planning their work around a completely different approach.</p><p>What happened? Everyone was using the same words the whole time. Everyone read the same document. Everyone nodded in the same meetings. But nobody was actually imagining the same thing.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Dyx0umta-Pm9z48R.jpg"" /><figcaption>Words are not the same as meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Words Are Squishier Than We Think</h3><p>Words are not concrete. As much as we want words to have specific, concrete, absolute meaning…they don’t. They’re abstractions that our brains automatically fill in based on our backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Two people can use identical terms and mean completely different things. Two people can use wildly different terms and mean the <em>exact </em>same thing.</p><p>This shows up in a few different ways. Here are three examples:</p><p>The problem gets worse with documentation. We write things down and feel confident. Look, it’s right there on the page. It’s clear. It’s specific. But even detailed specifications get interpreted through different mental models. Your brain reads those words and instantly constructs an image based on what you know, what you’ve seen before, and what makes sense to you. Our brains make assumptions about the words and between the words to make sense of what we’re reading.</p><p>This isn’t because people are stupid or careless. This is human nature. It’s just how our minds work. It’s how we engage with and understand the world. We can’t help but fill in gaps with our own understanding.</p><h3>The Division It Breeds</h3><p>Before that design review, everything feels fine. There’s harmony in meetings. People are nodding. Documents are approved. Progress is being made. High fives all around. But underneath, an invisible gap is slowly widening. Everyone is building on different assumptions, creating different mental models, imagining different end states, and digging a deeper gulf between each other.</p><p>Then the designer shows their work and suddenly the gap becomes visible. What felt like alignment evaporates like a vapor. That alignment was simply an illusion.</p><p>Trust erodes. The designer feels like the goal posts just moved. The product manager feels ignored. Developers feel annoyed. Everyone questions everyone else’s competence. What was a collaborative team suddenly feels like a war zone.</p><p>We don’t just have a project setback, we have a relationship problem. People start documenting everything defensively. Politics emerge. Finger-pointing begins. The project screeches to a halt as everyone grasps for control of the situation.</p><p>This is what survival looks like. Everyone is genuinely trying to do the right thing. The division wasn’t intentional, it was invisible…until the pictures showed up.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vYbB6DOAo9yKRECo.jpg"" /><figcaption>Pictures get closer to meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Designers as Bridge Builders</h3><p>The pictures. That’s where clarity started to emerge. This is where designers have a unique opportunity. We think visually (or at least we should). We externalize ideas in renderings to make sense of them. We don’t just imagine solutions in our heads, we sketch them, analyze them, erase them, trash them, and sketch some more. We refine them, prototype them, and make them feel more real. We make the invisible visible.</p><p>This puts us in a very opportunistic position. We can expose misalignment before division deepens. We can build bridges between abstract language and concrete forms. We have a chance to drive direction and clarity. We don’t need special authority or permission. We don’t need a “seat at the table”. We just need to do what comes naturally to us: draw.</p><p>A designer with a marker and a napkin can create more alignment in 1 minute than weeks of documented strategy. Not because the strategy is bad, but because the drawing makes everyone’s different mental pictures visible. It forces the misalignment to the surface early, when it’s still easy to correct. It grounds us in what could be, to drive the question of what should be.</p><p>This isn’t about gatekeeping or controlling the conversation. It’s about getting people to talk. It’s about helping everyone see the different pictures in each other’s heads so we can get really get aligned before we waste time, money, and relationships building the wrong things.</p><h3>Tactics for Creating Real Alignment</h3><p>This should be second nature for designers. But, it’s easy to get sucked into the practices and thinking of non-designers around us.</p><p>If this is new to you, or you’re looking for some helpful approaches, here are practical ways designers can use visual thinking to build bridges across different scenarios:</p><p>The goal of these isn’t to finalize decisions. It’s to avoid hidden assumptions and misalignment that will paint you into a corner later and undermine the value you’re delivering to users.</p><h3>Just Draw a Picture</h3><p>Remember our favorite apple from the beginning? The one we imagined differently even though we used the same language? It looks like we’re aligned because we’re talking about an apple. Even if we start talking about details, we still appear to be aligned. It’s not until concrete renderings are introduced that the true state of alignment is shown. This is where the practice of design shines. Every strategy session. Every kickoff. Everyone’s got a different apple in their head. We can help draw it out.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw illustration of a marker"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TYuQ0iT4r6EzcFQP.jpg"" /><figcaption>Grab a marker and just draw a picture for clarity.</figcaption></figure><p>This doesn’t require process overhaul, you can do it any time. It doesn’t need expensive tools, you just need a pencil. It doesn’t require anyone’s permission, just some courage on your part. We need to do what comes naturally to designers: think visually. Make ideas concrete. Turn words into form. Show, don’t just tell.</p><p>There’s been a lot of talk over the years about designers needing a seat at the table. I don’t believe you need to be at the table to influence the people at the table. You need to create artifacts that create shared understanding, and show the path forward. You need to be the one who makes what’s invisible visible before the division breeds and relationships fracture. If everyone at the table is aligned going in, you don’t have to be there to try and align them.</p><p>We’re surrounded by a world addicted to speed and productivity. Some may think drawing is a waste of time, or inappropriate for “serious business discussions,” or something you do later in the “design phase.” They won’t naturally reach for a marker. But we will. Because we’re the ones who instinctively know that pictures are worth 1,000 strategy documents, and pictures create the concrete to help us understand the wicked problems we’re asked to solve.</p><p>Next meeting, bring a sketch. Even a crude one. Spend 5–10 minutes thinking with your pencil and be ready to share. Be the bridge builder. Be the one who weeds out hidden assumptions by creating alignment.</p><p>Pickup your pencil, and get after it!</p><h3>One More Thing…</h3><p>You may get really frustrated when you spend time and energy understanding the problem and proposing a solution only to have it ripped apart over and over again. Or you may work hard on identifying and rendering the best solution and people tell you all the reasons why it’s wrong. You may get frustrated after months into a project and things suddenly go sideways and your project partners decide that it’s the “wrong” direction.</p><p>It’s a horrible feeling and one of incredible frustration. It might feel like you can never get anything right. But I want you to know: as a designer that’s your job. It’s our job to propose and work through solutions and constantly be searching and rendering our thinking. We make the intangible tangible so people can understand it. You make the intangible tangible so we can build it if that’s the agreed path. If you propose a solution, or many solutions, and people disagree, you’ve done your job. Consider it a success if you draw a picture or prototype and people disagree with it. That’s your opportunity to find alignment and find the path forward.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4d8f661e63f0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-illusion-of-alignment-4d8f661e63f0"">The illusion of alignment</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Reasons to be optimistic</h4><p>Advancements in AI continue to generate excitement for those in tech and product-focused fields. Coming along for the ride with that excitement is proportionate <a href=""https://www.reach3insights.com/blog/ai-anxiety"">anxiety for many</a>, especially those in UX. New AI advancements and employer expectations raise various concerns that tend to fall under the larger banner of something like “will AI reduce the need for UX designers and researchers?”. <a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-162155396"">Thomas Stokes at Drill Bit Labs reports</a> a year-over-year increase of almost 7% in UX job postings mentioning AI. Are User Experience and related fields like Human Factors and Human-Computer Interaction in the early phases of being relegated to the sidelines? While I understand and empathize with this concern, I also believe it is often misplaced. Fundamental economic principles and recent historical patterns suggest something more nuanced and optimistic. The UX workforce is more likely to see its daily job responsibilities and overall market positioning transform and evolve than become outdated and marginalized.</p><p>My goal for this post is simply to offer a few thoughts on the future of UX based on proven economic principles and historical examples I hope will inspire optimism.</p><h3>Foundational economic principles</h3><p>Taking a look at recent economic history, technological advancements have consistently transformed rather than eliminated human work. I will briefly highlight two relevant economic principles to this transformation: Ricardo’s Comparative Advantage and Kremer’s O-ring Theory.</p><p>Comparative Advantage: In 1817 renowned economist David Ricardo demonstrated that even when one side of an economic trade has an <em>absolute</em> advantage in everything they produce, both sides will benefit when each specializes in what they do <em>comparatively</em> better. In other words, even in the extreme hypothetical that an AI agent was better at every UX task than its human counterpart, it would still be more efficient to utilize the AI for <em>only</em> the tasks it has the largest <em>comparative</em> advantage in (and likewise for the human UXer). This principle helps us see how, even as AI capabilities increase, economic forces will create a division of labor between AI and humans rooted in their respective strengths (even in the unlikely, doom-and-gloom scenario in which AI has become absolutely better at <em>everything</em>). Common examples of tasks which AI (particularly GenAI) holds comparative advantage in are structured, repetitive, routine tasks (think spreadsheet math, responding to emails, and the like).</p><figure><img alt=""Picture: Illustrative diagram of Ricardo’s theory of Comparative Advantage"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W6KRmtzQjk-wr1szDbtmnw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated with Gemini 2.5 (Nano Banana)</figcaption></figure><p>O-ring Theory: Nobel Memorial Prize winning economist Michael Kremer proposed the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/551/1881767"">O-ring theory of economic development in 1993</a>. Using the Challenger space shuttle disaster of 1986 as a prime example, O-ring theory shows how a single point of inefficiency in a product team can dramatically impact the success of the end product. For example, even if 9 out of 10 team members do their job with incredible efficiency, a single team member working inefficiently can cause the otherwise high performing team to produce a mediocre product. Applied to our AI and UX context, Kremer’s theory demonstrates that even <em>if</em> we were to efficiently outsource 90% of UX tasks to AI, the relative impact of the human UX designer or researcher would not decrease, but actually increase!</p><p>Takeaway: Comparative Advantage and O-ring theory provide two economic rationales to believe there will always be considerable value to be gained from human UXers, even in the event humanity reaches sci-fi levels of AI capabilities.</p><h3>Historical examples of role transformation</h3><p>Theories and principles are helpful, but let’s turn for a quick look at some historical examples showing what happens when technology automates human tasks.</p><ol><li>Automation and mechanization in manufacturing is a familiar example. When mechanized task automation became the standard manufacturing it did not simply eliminate jobs, but instead bifurcated the market. Yes, mass production was automated and job roles were lost as a result. However, this simultaneously created new demand for artisanal and specialty manufacturing roles. <a href=""https://teamstage.io/jobs-lost-to-automation-statistics/"">It is estimated</a> that in the past 25 years roughly 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost due to automation. However, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">it is also estimated</a> that 133 million new jobs (some, not all, in manufacturing) will be created, many of which will shift from low-skills and low-pay to higher-skilled and higher-paid manufacturing positions.</li><li>The banking industry gives us one of my favorite examples of transformation over elimination. When ATMs became widespread in the 90’s many spoke of the impending doom of the bank teller. The number of ATMs sharply rose from zero to over 400,000 in the course of just a few years, bolstering fears of job loss. Instead, <a href=""https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/813/"">as documented by economist James Bessen</a>, the number of bank tellers in the United States <em>increased</em> at a rate higher than that of the average workforce. ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch, allowing banks to open more branches. Teller responsibilities transformed from handling cash to relationship management and more complex financial services. These were high-value responsibilities that ATMs could not perform at the level of a human or in which humans held the <em>comparative advantage</em>.</li></ol><p>Bessen concludes</p><p><em>“Many people suppose that if technology automates tasks . . . then widespread computer automation must be associated with major job losses. But this view fundamentally misunderstands what has been happening. The evidence shows that computer automation of an occupation is associated with increased demand for that occupation . . . The net result is that computer use is associated with a small increase in employment on average, not major job losses.” (pp.29–30)</em></p><figure><img alt=""A black and white image of an early ATM prototype"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/910/0*EZyolmi_Bz-aWFBP.png"" /></figure><p>3. When thinking of large-scale automation in North America, the agricultural revolution is one of the most dramatic historical examples. Agricultural employment fell from roughly 41% of the U.S. workforce in 1900 to less than 2% today, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">due in large part to technological advances in automation</a>. The end of humans working in agriculture, right? Not quite, as both <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/beyond-bls/changes-in-the-us-occupational-mix-from-1860-to-2015.htm"">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and economist <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">David Autor</a> note that while traditional agricultural jobs did experience decline, new jobs and responsibilities were created focusing less on physical labor and more on higher-order thinking[8,7]. This is not to mention the significant rise of new jobs and skill sets in other sectors as a result of this market shift.</p><p>4. Lastly, a historical example more directly applicable to what we see happening is UX is the transformation of accounting. As standard bookkeeping has become increasingly automated, <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">accountants have evolved </a>into new and sometimes different, or more highly skilled, roles such as strategists, analytics, and advisors. The <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics reports</a> employment among accountants has grown and is expected to continue to grow at an above average rate despite automation of many daily tasks. Traditionally trained accountants are increasingly focused on higher-order responsibilities like interpretation, strategy, and personalized financial advice. It is not difficult to see how a similar strategic shift could happen in UX.</p><p>These historical patterns suggest UX may begin to bifurcate into AI-driven standard solutions (e.g., AI generated reports, automated design reviews) and value-add, human-crafted experiences (e.g., strategic research, deep problem solving exercises). This would follow the economic principle of comparative advantage that has a proven track record through many technological revolutions.</p><h3>The current state of AI in UX</h3><p>Today’s AI tools are capable of performing, at varying degrees of effectiveness, different core UX tasks like generating wireframes and prototypes, sketching design concepts, creating synthetic users, moderating 1-on-1 interview sessions, mapping user journeys from qualitative data inputs, drafting moderator guides, analyzing quantitative data, creating research reports, ideating new design directions, and the list goes on.</p><p>However, as we stand today, AI struggles with many other aspects of UX like unique design challenges, cultural and contextual nuance, novel user behaviors, and ethical considerations. <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/ai-can-cannot-do-ux"">Jakob Nielsen comments</a> on some of the current limitations in AI in UX Research,</p><blockquote>“The reason we conduct user research instead of relying solely on the 10 heuristics and other usability guidelines is that humans always have unexpected behaviors. How do we know what people want, need, or prefer? This cannot be predicted, any more than we can predict the future.”</blockquote><p>Perhaps these limitations reflect Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage at work. AI handles routine tasks along with some creative tasks while humans retain the advantage in other areas of higher-order thinking. I try to avoid making specific predictions about the future, but this seems like a reasonable possibility given what we have seen happen in other technological revolutions.</p><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>I will end by offering a few parting considerations for looking at AI transformation in UX moving forward. UX professionals navigating current advances in AI should consider adopting the lens of tried and true economic principles for guidance. Focus on developing skills where humans maintain <em>comparative</em> advantage. Do not become fixated on the absolute advantages of AI. Focus on core UX skills that make you part of the O-ring of production to multiply your impact on the end product. Focus your energy not solely on displacement, but also on newly created opportunities.</p><p>As bank tellers and accountants embraced evolution in their roles through a changing technological environment, we UX professionals should too — with optimism.</p><p><em>Originally posted on the </em><a href=""https://triuxpa.org/blog/13502155""><em>Triangle UXPA blog</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5f9d334aad05"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-economics-of-ai-in-ux-5f9d334aad05"">The economics of AI in UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

See below an image of the cover of the <em>New York Times</em> on armistice day 1918:</p><figure><img alt=""An photograph of the front page of the New York Times, featuring no images, only text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zXtVyVNl99j8jZisckx5uw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>And a screenshot from CNN from today, October 11 2025:*1</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage, featuring a large number of very colorful images."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTMClsXCpIhaAvYz9uHSnQ.png"" /></figure><p>It wasn’t always like this, and we apparently managed to get information before. It wasn’t perfect, but we managed.</p><h3>What are accessory images?</h3><p>You might be thinking, “But I, or someone I know, sometimes finds these images useful.” Indeed: my disagreement is primarily with images whose nature is not to give you information in themselves, but which act as bait or filler.</p><p>So what are accessory images? Here’s a test: let’s say that an article you have written is being recognized in some way — such as receiving an award, being used for training, etc. Under what circumstances would you include the accompanying image?</p><p>For instance, if your article was about hacking and your editor had added a stock photograph of an unidentified man in a hoodie on a computer, would you submit that image along with the article for recognition by a prize? Or as a materially important part of the article for training purposes?</p><p>Such images — often stock or AI slop (all of which I shall discuss below) — are an insult to the visual crafts like photography and painting. These images don’t matter in themselves; rather they are just there to fill space or draw people to something actually important (or profitable). They are an accessory to the crime of clickbait.</p><p>They thus distort our networks and our information environment:</p><ol><li>The article most read should be the most interesting one, not the one with the most distracting image.</li><li>Conversely, our social networks are today brain-addling filler images whose only characteristic is existing.</li></ol><p>Any medium can be an accessory: images are special to me because they are the normal accessory to my primary medium, text. But so can text be an accessory, as can music: see “stock music” or (trade name) Musak.</p><h3>Careless taste</h3><p>Where are all these images coming from? Apparently, at least one person asked the question: “Now we can easily deliver images over the Internet, where can we put them? Why not have an image with every article on our website, and every preview in our article listing page, and every preview on our social network feed.”</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t long before you need your thing to have a preview/featured image for it to go anywhere online: anything without a featured image will be at disadvantage. Now, images are for the most part <em>compulsory.</em></p><p>This has led to two overlapping phenomena:</p><h4>Slock</h4><p>Slock images are created to fill the gap, they’re usually either stock photography (iStock, Getty, etc.) or AI-generated (slop) — hence “slock.” These images are most popular among stressed-out content managers, writers, and people trying to get somewhere on LinkedIn.</p><p>These people are told — explicitly by managers, or implicitly by the networks, that every piece of writing needs an image. Then begins the panicked process of finding one: note that for any writer paid by the article (not the hour) this wasted time is quite painful.</p><p>This brings forth a rogue’s gallery of trash:</p><p>We have of course the corporate-looking stock, like this mysterious person who pops up everywhere:</p><figure><img alt=""A stock photograph, featuring a person dressed in a suit reading a newspaper, whose title is “Business.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUf5404HX_-DzQfwHjnTuw.png"" /></figure><p>Then the figures:</p><figure><img alt=""An uncanny-valley figure, a misshapen humanoid with an oversized expressionless head and overly-defined hands, seemingly made from grey plastic."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/621/1*WJB97hrG3RK8OX280z-o1A.png"" /></figure><p>And of course the recent AI slop:</p><figure><img alt=""An AI slop cartoon, featuring animals dressed in suits apparently performing business, and saying nonsensical things."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MurCiXczBjpVcHcZqGMY4g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Please note that images of the grade shown above are common on LinkedIn, despite the gibberish.</figcaption></figure><p>Slop is more insidious than stock. Now that people can create images quickly with AI, the problem of finding something relevant is solved, superficially.</p><p>For example, a colleague of mine wrote a good article on “Excel Hell” — Copilot dutifully made him an image of a man standing in a burning room surrounded by floating tables in Excel-brand green.</p><p>Relevant? From the perspective of someone with no concept of a spreadsheet (and therefore of Excel Hell), yes.</p><p>Useful, clarifying, aesthetically pleasing? No, and so lacking in these qualities that it threatens to tear the mind to shreds.</p><p>This comes with uncountable problems, including:</p><ol><li>The disturbing nature of the pictures, and their universally crass and/or cheesy persona</li><li>The environmental impact immense power required to create them (remember that the vast majority of these images are pointless)</li><li>The overproduction of real-enough looking images such that it’s becoming hard to know what’s real</li></ol><h4>Bait</h4><p>As I suggested above, the overabundance of images has turned our media from places where we read and explore and decide what we wish to learn more about, to places where we scroll — barely consciously — browsing until something jolts us enough to pause or click.</p><p>We used to explore, now we doomscroll. In this environment, people obviously use images as a tool to snap people out of it — or deeper into it, depending on your perspective.</p><p>This of course gives us the shock face:</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a YouTube preview, with the host exhibiting the common “shock” face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e6dXlY3vQGRSKHjZVckNPw.png"" /></figure><p>And, with the medium curling back on itself, the fake quote, usually shop sign or imagined book:</p><figure><img alt=""A fabricated quote, made to look as though it were written in a book then highlighted: “Everything in your life is a reflection of a choice you have made. If you want a different result, make a different choice.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*ijva-XnO3OWqzkKEenjB_w.jpeg"" /></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of overlap between slock and bait.</p><p>We must demand to know, in all these cases, what we the readers/listeners/watchers gain from this. Were the images and hence gasping faces absent — leaving just the title, account ID and a description — would we all say, “all this needs is someone faking surprise”?</p><h3>Proposals</h3><p>So, what do we do about it? Here are some ideas:</p><h4><strong>Text-only mode (perhaps by default in some cases)</strong></h4><ol><li>All hypertext systems that have a text mode, and should provide a facility for the user to use that mode only, i.e. show text only.</li><li>Users should be able to suppress images <em>ad hoc</em>, or everywhere, at particular times, on particular Internet domains, etc. Ideally, online media would be made to look good without the images.</li><li>One might build, for instance, a text-only social media platform, where images are never shown unless one accesses the particular post where they’re found.</li><li>These settings would be organized as a fractal, with any entity at any level of abstraction capable of setting this parameter.</li><li>For instance, the moderators of a given community on a given social network could set the default setting for the visibility of images, but individual users always have final control.</li></ol><h4><strong>One, the other, or both</strong></h4><ol><li>To dam the production of slock images, publications or we could create a rule something like the following: a post can be previewed either as text (showing the title, author and a snippet) or as image (showing a the title, author, and a thumbnail).</li><li>This way any writer, photographer and publication must make the hard choice: does this image stand alone, or is it merely bait or wallpaper for the accompanying text?</li></ol><p>There is of course the question of what to do with media that has both a legitimate text and image component. I say we create the category, e.g. multimedia feature/comic-book and in such cases preview with an image. This type might have to be prohibited or creatively governed in many freely accessible social media, because it presents the opportunity for skullduggery.</p><p>Accessory media (and particularly images) are a disease of luxury. It’s only because our computers are this powerful and our networks fast that it is even possible. It was different not so long ago, and it changed without, apparently, giving us enough time to built norms to deal with it.</p><p>You might be saying, “But accessory images are a result of human nature/the market, it’s out of our hands.”</p><p>True about human nature and the market, but this fact means we know how to change things. A market is a system — one might say — which determines outcomes via profit and loss. We need to make it pay to build networks that encourage people to be honest with their images.</p><p>We should, therefore:</p><ol><li>Seek out, patronize and build social networks with more sensible policies around images.</li><li>Remind people that images of the sort above are <em>in poor taste.</em></li><li>Never click on a link with an accessory image.</li><li>Never voluntarily use an accessory image.</li></ol><p>Let’s shake off the ennui of learned helplessness and take back our media. Slock-bait is deranging, depressing and distracting: let’s get rid of it. Contrary to popular (usually subconscious) belief, the nature of technological culture is not <em>just the way it is </em>but a function of our decisions, norms and tastes. Let’s quit, therefore, while we still have some control left.</p><p>1 I’m not claiming that this is an exact comparison, only that CNN is widely used and representative of our obsession with images.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=92f43b0d45e9"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-images-as-accessories-92f43b0d45e9"">Against images as accessories</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h3>Hidden patterns of system behavior</h3><h4>Understanding the feedback loops and recurring designs that govern our lives</h4><figure><img alt=""The Triptych Window from the Coonley Playhouse, Riverside, Illinois. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/843/0*rbp72C1nJgvzYySI.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A Frank Lloyd Wright Stained Glass Window | source: <a href=""https://www.artic.edu/"">https://www.artic.edu/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Systems don’t behave randomly. They behave based on their design. As a result, many systems, even those found in nature, exhibit frequent, common behaviors. Moreover, these behaviors will typically manifest the same problems and issues, so much so that we may even name and categorize them. These are <a href=""https://ctl.mit.edu/sites/ctl.mit.edu/files/attachments/tab%204c%20Pacheco%20-%20system%20archetypes.pdf"">sometimes called archetypes</a>, but I prefer to call them familiar system mechanisms. For designers they are important to know, recognize, and avoid.</p><p><strong>Why Feedback Matters</strong></p><p><a href=""https://deming.org/systems-thinking-feedback-loops/"">Feedback</a> refers to the way systems communicate with individuals. By providing information about the system state and its performance, feedback enables the individual to make decisions (or evaluate system recommendations). It is perhaps one of the most important aspects of systems design.</p><p>Feedback is critical for building system resilience; when errors occur, a system should give feedback about the error and allow for an immediate response to correct the error.</p><p>Think about the simple act of adjusting your shower water temperature. You turn the handle, stick your hand in the water stream, and receive immediate feedback about whether you need to adjust further. This feedback loop — action, measurement, adjustment — is fundamental to how we interact with systems.</p><figure><img alt=""A feedback diagram representing how feedback influences decisions for shower water temperature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HR27BtltXVpGjhVn"" /><figcaption>A feedback diagram for adjusting water temperature Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>But not all feedback is immediate. And that’s where things get interesting.</p><p><strong>The Power of Recognizing Familiar System Mechanisms</strong></p><p>Recognizing familiar system mechanisms (FSMs) is important for several reasons:</p><p>First, by recognizing them, you can quickly and accurately predict how the system will act. This knowledge enables you to situate yourself in the position of <a href=""https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/"">highest leverage</a> to alter or improve the output of the system, or to use it to your greatest advantage.</p><p>Second, when FSMs fail, they typically fail in a common and familiar way. This particular way is called <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea?srsltid=AfmBOopzD-3sRK4wAdAfwmwwOXuUiXJp_-2VaxrLpbR-RkCUBgF2PEEA"">a failure mode</a>. Correctly recognizing and categorizing an FSM will enable you to prevent and guard against the most common failure modes quickly and with little effort.</p><p>Third, FSMs provide clarity and agency in the face of complexity. Many problems found in life and business are different manifestations of similar system mechanisms. To recognize this is to empower yourself. As Peter Senge writes in “<a href=""https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwiGlPWI0JSQAxUzU38AHRSkLCAYACICCAEQABoCb2E&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyNSZA9FSkzRSfU8oAEkhgyHIC3oYPpCLned0Lsgkmns-hk7TN0RO0aApuIEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASN-Ro7p02t7zrIE99lr3KKPQTsiEMmszea3aV6W-dh_yCGmIKxIuUYCampmvLlX_PqknYuAXUK9E&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_33&amp;sig=AOD64_3gk13R_6gaoEyz9g4bDPS0YncTxg&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjypu-I0JSQAxX34ckDHXLUOU4Q0Qx6BAgVEAE""><em>The Fifth Discipline</em></a>:”</p><blockquote><em>“Systems archetypes [FSMs] reveal an elegant simplicity underlying the complexity of management issues. As we learn to recognize more and more of these archetypes, it becomes possible to see more and more places where there is leverage in facing difficult challenges and to explain these opportunities to others.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/658/0*GV5iSBO-7EflsGwM.jpg"" /><figcaption>Cover to the Fifth Discipline by Peter Senge | Source: Amazon.com/</figcaption></figure><p>While Senge’s focus was explicitly on management and business, it’s clear that the same principles apply to other areas of life, even in our personal daily enterprises.</p><p><strong>Three Familiar System Mechanisms You Need to Know</strong></p><p><em>Mechanism #1: Balancing Process with Delay</em></p><p>In this mechanism, an actor adjusts the system controls in response to delayed feedback. If they are not aware that the system has a feedback delay, or misjudges the delay, they will over or under adjust the controls, or become discouraged from lack of change in the controls.</p><p>A shower provides a great example for this. We all know that the controls of the shower are not instantaneous and that the shower has a startup time associated with getting hot water to the showerhead. Because of experience we allow some time for the system (shower controls, plumbing, hand) to register a change before making further adjustments. And yet despite ample experience, we’ve all been surprised by an icy or excessively hot stream of water as we’ve mistakenly adjusted the controls.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of a man adjusting the shower with a feedback diagram superimposed on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CHgxWUHBUzeN2W44"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson to be learned from this type of scenario is that aggressiveness increases risk and volatility. Stock market bubbles are a macro-level phenomenon of the same mechanism at play. Investors see delayed feedback from their actions, panic, and over-correct, creating wild swings in valuation.</p><p>This mechanism shows up everywhere:</p><ul><li>Dieting and weight loss (results take weeks to show)</li><li>Learning new skills (improvement feels slow initially)</li><li>Economic policy (effects take months or years to materialize)</li><li>Exercise routines (strength gains and muscle growth have delayed feedback)</li></ul><p><em>Mechanism #2: Limits to Growth</em></p><p>In this system mechanism, (of which a famous, <a href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/"">1972 paper was written</a>) the system grows organically, but eventually encounters a limit to continued growth. Actors within the system may be tempted to ignore early signs of the limit to growth or discount it as trivial because of the current success. As the limit goes unaddressed, growth continues to slow. The way for the system to continue to grow is to remove the limit.</p><p>In the NBC sitcom, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"">The Office</a>, Michael Scott starts his own paper company to compete against his former employer, Dunder Mifflin. By undercutting prices, he steals away Dunder Mifflin’s customers, but as he looks to expand his business, he’s confronted by a startling reality: the prices that are making him successful are also putting him out of business.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture from the NBC sitcom the office, featuring Michael Scott, Pam, and Ryan"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*OzCQzbnur4hIZLrP"" /><figcaption>The Michael Scott Paper Company, in it’s heyday. Source: Reddit.com/</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson of this mechanism is to address limitations early to avoid roadblocks later.</p><p><em>Mechanism #3: Tragedy of the Commons</em></p><p>In the <a href=""https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues"">tragedy of the commons</a>, actors within a system all have access to shared but limited resources. They use this resource for their individual needs, and since the resource is free to them, they benefit from its use. As more people become aware of the free, beneficial resource, more people start using it, and the advantage diminishes until it is obliterated.</p><p>Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling explains in “<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Micromotives-Macrobehavior-Thomas-C-Schelling/dp/0393329461""><em>Macromotives and Microbehavior</em></a>”:</p><blockquote><em>“‘The commons’ has come to serve as a paradigm for situations in which people so impinge on each other in pursuing their own interests that collectively they might be better off if they could be restrained, but no one gains individually by self-restraint.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""A diagram which explains the tragedy of the commons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*5W7BOhTsKTJpgHvJ.png"" /><figcaption>The Tragedy of the Commons Source: sustainable-environment.org/</figcaption></figure><p>Colleagues sharing a drive at work to backup your computer is one manifestation of the familiar mechanism, as is what happens when too many devices are playing at once on the home Wi-Fi.

Second, that power can be harnessed.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>“The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices.”</em></blockquote><p>Their main point is critically important: behavior is impacted by systems.</p><p><strong>Why This Matters for Your Life</strong></p><p>We do not make our decisions in a vacuum. This is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. Our interaction with the environments and systems around us constrain and limit our decisions and behaviors. With this awareness, we give ourselves greater personal and individual agency.</p><p>Recognizing the patterns that make up FSMs helps simplify complexity, predict outcomes, and identify leverage points for meaningful change. Rather than reacting blindly to problems, understanding FSMs enables smarter, more strategic responses.</p><p>Whether it’s designing better personal habits, improving workplace processes, or simply understanding why certain patterns keep repeating in your life, recognizing these familiar mechanisms gives you the power to work with the system rather than against it.</p><p>The feedback loops are always there. The patterns are always present.

But I think once again we’ve rushed out of our way to promote <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-broken-rhetoric-of-ai-f3a24165899d"">exactly the wrong word</a> to convey what we really mean.</p><h3>Where do I start?</h3><p>When I hear the word <em>taste</em>, I often think about fashion.</p><p>Somebody who dresses well is often considered to have great taste, but what does that really mean? Is it something born within us, or is it developed over time?</p><p>Despite deep respect for people with good fashion sense, there’s a truth that often floats above the mystique of someone’s innate ability to look sharp:</p><blockquote>To dress well is to dress appropriately.</blockquote><p>In other words, forethought to context (e.g. an incoming rainstorm) often plays a part in the senses people see in us.</p><p>When we talk about having taste during our collective AI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development"">storming and norming</a> phase <em>(to borrow from Tuckman’s group development model)</em>, I know we’re talking about something similar.</p><p>But it also takes time, which leads to experience, which leads to judgment and arbitration — the real words we mean when we talk about taste in this context.</p><h3>Fade to gray</h3><p>When I was in art school, we used to have some bang-out critiques — some real barn burners, if you want to know. Unlike my business-credit-taking dorm buddies, fine art studio sessions were often three-hour jams that culminated in everyone hanging up their work for stark and uncomfortable examination.</p><p>We learned techniques from <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/standing-in-the-shadow-of-giotto-43d0133cfea2"">the old masters</a> to create wonderful studies of light and shadow on objects, scenes, and eventually the human figure, culminating with ourselves in portrait.</p><p>We used sandpaper to sprinkle charcoal dust on heavy paper, creating a mid-tone canvas for adding light with a chamois and a series of erasers. Then darkening with more charcoal, finding and building our tolerance for shape, mood, and eventually meaning.</p><p><em>Pro tip: The secret to finding shadows is simply squinting your eyes.</em></p><p>Regardless of the subject, there was always a time requirement. We were expected to put an hour into our first take-home assignments. Then two. Then three. Then eventually six.</p><p>Six!? Everyone outside of the art program scoffed at this labor-intensive task.</p><p>Once the work was ready to present, my professor — a perky and passionate painter with a Texas drawl — would start at the far left of the wall and make her way across, pointing and smiling at each piece before a word was even spoken.</p><p>She always, without fail, asked the same question starting each student’s critique.</p><h3><em>How many hours?</em></h3><p><em>How many hours? How many hours? How many hours, y’all?</em></p><p>We’d all wait until a fellow student chimed in, giving a rough estimate based on the work in front of us.</p><p><em>Looks more like one to me.</em></p><p>Invariably, the artist would cave — admit to an all-nighter at Blue House or some downtown bar, then finding only a spare 20 minutes over a hungover weekend to throw together a passable representation.</p><p>This admission was necessary because it was always obvious in contrast to the other work. The output always told the story.</p><p>Time is evident in craft. What we put into it is usually what we get out of it.</p><p>What I learned in those classes informs me to this day.</p><p>Quality isn’t automatic. It’s nurtured through time, technique, and feedback from others who are willing to tell us what they see in our own work.</p><p>It’s a process of discovering and defining <a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/driving-product-teams-to-become-more-design-mature/"">what <em>good</em> looks like</a>. And it comes over time, which is necessary for knowing how our work is received relative to the unforgiving forum of mass perception.</p><p>Compare this with today’s AI slop and the absurd notion of “Look what I did with X number of prompts” — it starts to feel like an oxymoron.</p><p>The idea that <em>taste</em> is the antidote to bad AI decisions simplifies a much more <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/design-is-a-conversation-2af15b555c80"">nuanced conversation</a>.</p><p>And that’s why I think <em>taste</em> isn’t the right word. It’s too foofy.</p><p>Not to mention that in 25 years of doing UX and product design, I’ve never heard a user express any appreciation for the <em>taste</em> of a particular design— let alone the designer. Seldom are products elevated at the surface level that word immediately conjures.</p><h3>In other words</h3><p>What we’re really reaching for isn’t taste. It’s a strong <a href=""https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/taste-is-a-dead-end"">point of view</a>, shaped by memory, practice, and a willingness to stay in the work long enough to know what matters.</p><p>That’s our goal. And it hasn’t really changed.</p><p>Businesses will always want output that’s better, faster, and cheaper.</p><p>But generative AI? I see it more like the charcoal and the eraser — not the finished piece.</p><p>It can help us block in the basics. It might even suggest a direction or tease out a shape we hadn’t seen before. But <em>we</em> should be the ones squinting to see what’s there. AI can’t choose what to leave out, or where to press harder. It doesn’t know when to stop, when to share, or when to start over.</p><p>That’s not subjective taste. That’s practiced judgment.</p><p>And judgment only comes from showing up again and again — building tolerance for ambiguity, seeking critique, and developing the context to make decisions with intent.</p><p>So maybe the next time we reach for “taste” as the thing that separates us from the machine, we take a beat.</p><p>What we really mean is more nuanced.</p><p>What we’re trying to say is: <em>I’ve been here before. I know what good looks like. And I know what to do next — because I’ve put in the hours.</em></p><p>It’s not taste that makes the difference.</p><p>It’s time well spent.</p><h3>Keep in touch</h3><p>If this resonated with you, <a href=""https://medium.com/@mschindler"">follow me</a> on <strong>Medium</strong> for more stories about staying grounded in today’s design culture.</p><p>Find me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschindler"">LinkedIn</a> or my personal website, <a href=""http://mschindler.com/"">mschindler.com</a>.</p><p>Related reading:</p><p><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/taste"">Taste</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b5caacddbec4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">The importance of taste, and other lies we tell ourselves</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How I demoted my tree diagrams.</h4><figure><img alt=""Loose ink illustration of a middle aged man with glasses in front of a tree diagram."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lhi6kFWm4PDPGPwlrEjIlA.png"" /><figcaption>Image AI Generated (Midjourney)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s 9:03 a.m. I join a Zoom meeting titled “Team Structure Alignment — Attendance Required,” the type of meeting title commonly reserved for nightmares. As soon as I join HR appears in one tile, smiling like this is <em>definitely</em> covered in their onboarding. It isn’t. We’re here today to demote a sentient diagram.</p><p>Long story short: afew years ago a lightning bolt totally hit a Texas data center while someone had Lucidchart open, and a Information Architecture Tree Diagram (our old reliable sitemap buddy) woke up, and has been with us ever since.</p><figure><img alt=""Lightning striking a modern style warehouse building on a decilate landscape."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVW-6kKKIBa5rfZOpzHlpA.png"" /><figcaption>Image AI Generated (Midjourney)</figcaption></figure><p>The I.A.Tree drops into the meeting late– connection lines crinkled and nodes misaligned.</p><p>“I’ve been up all night reorganizing the course pages. The client added three new ‘top-level categories’ that are actually just filters. The homepage has eight parents now. And someone renamed one of my root nodes ‘Global Navigation 2.’ Wait… why is HR here?”</p><p>I take a breath. “This is going to be a hard conversation.”</p><p>A couple of I.A. diagrams’ boxes squeeze into near triangles — making a kind of squint. “If this is about course registration prerequisites again, that’s not my job. I’m an architecture diagram, not an interactivity diagram. Or a… relationship diagram. Or whatever new kind of diagram you design kids are using to cosplay as engineers now.”</p><p>I glance at HR’s tiny Zoom window. I’m sure the HR lady is doing the same to me.</p><p>“Exactly,” I say. “You’re great at hierarchy, I.A. Diagram. But we keep asking you to model things that aren’t just parents and children. We need our go to diagram to show shared data, reusable components, relationships that shift when users interact or when the system changes over time — and you keep telling us doing those things aren’t your job.”</p><p>The Tree folds a few of his far off branches in what I think is supposed to be a sort of cross armed pout. “Because it’s not my job! You want to show relationships that move? That’s a <em>state diagram.</em> You want to show dependencies? That’s a <em>system map.</em> I’m an <strong>architecture</strong> diagram, I only should have to show where content lives.”</p><p>“Right,” I say. “But we need to show <em>cardinality</em> now — how many relationships exist, how things multiply or overlap as systems evolve.”</p><p>The Tree bristles. “Cardinality? Who the hell do you think you are — the Pope?”</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch of a laptop screen with a man speaking to a woman in another panel in the video conference interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CG7FmSg9mAHZBTLPDJRbyA.png"" /><figcaption>Image AI Generated (Midjourney)</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, the Tree isn’t malicious — just absolutely certain about where its job ends.</p><p>“Okay,” I say, “let’s walk through this again. A course can have multiple instructors across different semesters — how do we show that with you?”</p><p>“I don’t,” the Tree says flatly. “That’s not my job.”</p><p>“What about courses that fulfill multiple degree requirements?”</p><p>“Still not my job.”</p><p>“Okay… and prerequisites that reference other courses?”</p><p>“Definitely not my job.”</p><p>“Students registered across multiple sections — sometimes cross-listed — how would you handle that?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t. Sounds like somebody else’s problem.”</p><p>“Whose problem?”</p><p>“Maybe a flowchart. Maybe, I don’t know, ask an engineer.</p><p>Every time relationships appear, the Tree punts: put it in a flowchart, an entity relationship diagram, or “engineering will figure it out.” But in 2025 UX, structure <strong>is</strong> part of the designer’s job: we’re expected to map persistent objects, cardinality, reuse, role-based access, and system constraints — well before anyone writes code.</p><p>We need a diagram that can carry that weight.</p><p>A horrible realization crosses the Tree Diagram’s root node where it’s face would have been, “am I Being… Fired?”</p><p>HR unmutes, voice gentle and corporate: “I.A. Tree Diagram, you’ve been a huge part of this team’s documentation. Your impact on navigation and hierarchy has been — ”</p><p>I.A. Tree freezes. “You’re firing me.”</p><p>“No,” I say quickly. “Not firing. <em>Demoting</em>. You’re no longer our primary structural diagram. You’ll still be critical to how we design navigation and be used every time we create content hierarchy. But the product design team is promoting class diagrams to our go to diagram.”</p><p>He stares. A few nodes detach.</p><p>“Class diagrams? That’s full-on UML. Why not sell your guitar, buy Magic cards, and rock a fanny pack while you’re at it?”</p><p>“Look,” I say. “We’re not role-playing engineers. We’re trying to plan out and communicate how the product actually fits together — that’s like the definition of design work. Class diagrams show objects, attributes, and relationships — cleanly. That’s what we need.”</p><h3>Why class diagrams need a promotion in design teams</h3><p>As design literacy spreads beyond traditional “Product Designer” titles — <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2024/06/06/new-essential-92-of-leaders-expect-employees-to-have-design-skills/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Forbes notes that 92% of leaders now expect employees to have some level of design skill</a> <strong>— </strong>Those of us who pay the mortgage with our design skills need to bring value that goes well beyond making and explaining interface-level decisions. The old approach — classifying information monolithically and statically — no longer fits the realities of today’s complex, high-stakes digital products.</p><p>The Nielsen Norman Group recently published a great piece called <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/future-proof-designer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>The Future-Proof Designer</em></a>, arguing that today’s best product designers aren’t just defining how a product looks from state to state at launch — they’re also creating the kinds of diagrams and doing the type of work that helps cross-functional teams solve complex problems together.</p><p>An information architecture tree diagram, for example, is like trying to survey a river by taking a single snapshot. It’s useful for orientation, but no longer the tool we need to deliver what’s expected of us now — showing how systems connect, and evolve.</p><p>Class diagrams are different from I.A. trees because they let us:</p><ul><li>Define <strong>what</strong> exists (objects/classes),</li><li>Specify <strong>what they contain</strong> (attributes),</li><li>Show <strong>how they relate</strong> (associations with cardinality),</li><li>Capture <strong>inheritance/extension</strong> (when needed),</li></ul><p>If you want a “how to make class diagram” resource go watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XrL5jXmTwM"">Lucidchart’s excellent, short intro to class diagrams on YouTube</a>.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>A tree diagram can show hierarchy beautifully — parent, child, sibling. It can even make an unruly architecture look organized (if only at a glance). A tree diagram <em>does</em> have its place — especially early in the design cycle. As the Nielsen Norman Group points out in their article “<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>Tree Testing: Fast, Iterative Evaluation of Menu Labels and Categories</em></a><em>”</em>, tree testing is ideal <strong>before</strong> you build page layouts or visual design: it lets you “test multiple IA options … without any design, coding, or content development” to see which structure works best. But a tree assumes that every object has one clear parent and that relationships flow neatly downward. That’s a comforting fiction, but fiction isn't’ what’s needed when making critical decisions about the design of a system.</p><p>For an example let’s think of a course registration product for a university. If the design team was required to wireframe out this system we’d need to diagram at a minimum to represent :</p><ul><li>A <strong>Student</strong> can register for many <strong>Courses</strong> (and vice versa).</li><li>Each <strong>Course</strong> may be taught by multiple <strong>Instructors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> can have <strong>Prerequisites</strong> (other Courses).</li><li>Some <strong>Courses</strong> fulfill <strong>Degree Requirements</strong>.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> are offered in specific <strong>Semesters</strong>.</li></ul><h4>What’s the Problem Starting With a Tree Diagram?</h4><p>If I took this problem and made a tree diagram out of it — well it would look like this, and how the hell could I go back to my desk and start sketching a wire frame from this spaghetti? But more importantly it can’t identify design flaws early, something class diagrams are <em>explicitly designed to do</em>, as noted in <a href=""https://www.archimetric.com/the-importance-of-class-diagrams-in-software-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Archimetric’s “<em>The Importance of Class Diagrams in Software Development</em>.</a>”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dou5K2TnwLV0RT3yiOlfYw.png"" /><figcaption>Tree Diagram Generated using <a href=""https://www.mermaidchart.com"">Mermaid Chart</a></figcaption></figure><p>There’s no clear canonical “object.” Are these <em>course instances</em> or just <em>labels</em>? What on this diagram represents an actual, screen-level piece of information — and what’s simply a class definition? Cardinality is either invisible or misleading. Are there many instances of a node, or just one? Tree diagram you drive me crazy!</p><h4>How and Why I’d Use A “Designerly Class Diagram Instead”</h4><p>I’d treat each category as its own “designerly class,” separating the information and interactivity into distinct conceptual objects, then map how they work together to create value for the user. That diagram would look something like this (although honestly most of the time I just sketch it on my iPad)</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O4BpHoKk_fzomhwBmdNviQ.png"" /></figure><p>As a designer, I know which input methods users are most familiar with when interacting with these properties. I know where they’ll likely look for the information needed to complete each task. What I <em>don’t</em> instinctively know is how all these pieces of information work together — as a system, as a product. It’s too complex to hold in my head while I’m working. That’s what the diagram is for: not just to share how the system works with others, but to free up mental space so I can actually solve problems.</p><h3><strong>“I’m Architecture, Not Interactivity”</strong></h3><p>Back on Zoom, the I.A. Tree digs in:“I show where things go. Someone else can say how they connect.”</p><p>“That’s the crux,” I say. “In 2025, <em>structure</em> isn’t just ‘where stuff goes.’ It’s what the stuff <strong>is</strong> and <strong>how it relates</strong>, across roles and contexts. If our documentation can’t carry that, engineering inherits ambiguity — and users inherit weirdness.”</p><p>He grumbles, a grizzled veteran tone. “In my day, we mapped a whole site with a sharpie, a few sticky notes, and a dream. And it worked.”</p><p>“It did — for brochureware and early apps. Today we’re designing systems.”</p><p>He eyes me. “So we’re… opening the relationship?”</p><p>“We’re building an ensemble, not a monarchy,” I reply.</p><p>The HR lady nods, proud of us all while the Tree goes quiet, then mutes. The tile turns gray. I hear what can only be described as a leafy sniffle. When he reappears, he looks smaller. “Okay,” he says. “I’m not the lead anymore. That… stings. But if you need a three-tier menu with mobile fallbacks — ”</p><p>“You’re our first call,” I say.</p><p>He lifts a branch. “And don’t draw those class diagrams like code. Keep them human. We all need to read them — no curly braces, OK?”</p><p>“We will.”</p><p>He sighs — a wind-through-leaves sound. “All right. Just… make sure my pension vests.”</p><p>HR: “We’ll, uh, look into that.”</p><p>We end the call. And for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel compelled to invent a new dashed-gold-double-legend line on a I.A. Tree diagram just to explain the structure underneath our design.</p><h4>Acknowledgments</h4><p><a href=""https://intertwingled.org/the-polar-bear-book/""><em>The Polar Bear Book</em> — <em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</em></a> by Peter Morville and Louis Rosenfeld — has been hugely influential in how I think about structure, systems, and the evolving role of design literacy in product teams.</p><p>Morville, Peter, and Louis Rosenfeld. <em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites</em>. 4th ed., O’Reilly Media, 2015.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=47b44e18e8d4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/its-not-you-it-s-hierarchy-47b44e18e8d4"">It’s not you, it’s hierarchy</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>How design will evolve from solving functional problems to creating depth, connection, and significance in the age of AI.</h4><figure><img alt=""A winding road curves through a vibrant autumn forest, with trees displaying brilliant yellow, orange, and red leaves, evoking a serene and colorful scene."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*w-gjipzCRbySOTRjbtW9ZQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.dreamstime.com/winding-road-curves-autumn-foliage-trees-new-england-scenic-image190256695"">dreamstime.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>I recently stumbled across a <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rafaeltome_if-90-of-the-interfaces-in-2030-will-activity-7380601223575388160-F6ZV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAjeyKgBQCZhfzRiqeFgjIs6IUn4naWnk4E"">LinkedIn post</a> by Rafael T. making a bold prediction—by 2030, 90% of interfaces will be invisible. According to him, voice, chat, and autonomous agents will replace screens and buttons as the primary ways we interact with technology.</p><p>Designers, he argued, will no longer focus on crafting pixels but on choreographing conversations, shaping intent, and defining how AI behaves. His conclusion was stark—visual design, as a distinct profession, will disappear.</p><figure><img alt=""Alt text: A social media post questions the future of visual design with the rise of AI and voice interactions.

In fact, I made a similar prediction nearly two years ago. In December 2023, I published an essay titled <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/design-is-dead-and-we-have-killed-it-ba46cf1dc18b""><em>Design Is Dead. And We Have Killed It.</em></a><em> </em>I explored how AI’s rapid evolution would render design — not just designers — obsolete.</p><p>I argued that visual design’s core purpose is to translate complexity into clarity. And if AI can achieve that same clarity by unifying experiences and anticipating needs across contexts — particularly through non-visual interfaces — it will eventually absorb the function of UI design entirely.</p><p>But since writing that article, my perspective has been shifting. I now believe that visual design may still have a pulse. Understanding that future starts with a simple metaphor— <em>taking the scenic route</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Map with a red route through New Hampshire’s towns and a bright autumn scene of a red covered bridge surrounded by vibrant yellow foliage."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PhVuxIjHSaAi0aL6MOV0vw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/travel/vacation-ideas/road-trips/new-hampshire-road-trip/"">aarp.org</a></figcaption></figure><h4>From utility to choice</h4><p>When traveling, we often face a choice. The fastest route is efficient and predictable, optimized to get us from point A to point B. The scenic route is slower and longer, but richer — winding roads through forests, detours along a coastline. It doesn’t make “sense” in a strictly utilitarian framework, but it does as an expression of human values.</p><p>This metaphor maps directly onto the current debate about design. The rational view assumes that once AI and invisible interfaces handle functional tasks, visual design will become unnecessary. After all, if a <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-agents"">voice agent</a> can complete a transaction instantly, why bother designing a screen?</p><p>The answer is that necessity and value are not the same thing. While the fastest route may be a straight highway, that doesn’t make it the most meaningful or memorable. In the same way, a frictionless voice interface might be the most efficient way to get something done, but it is not always the most satisfying.</p><p>When trying to understand how such value is communicated, <a href=""http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem06.html"">semiotics</a> can help explain this process by describing the dualistic nature of interface communication.</p><p>Every interface communicates on two levels—the denotative (what it does) and the connotative (what it means). Invisible systems excel at the first. Visible, intentional design emphasizes the second — signaling care, identity, values, and intent. Choosing to design something, even when you don’t need to, declares that the interaction is meant to be experienced, not just completed.</p><p>Think of a banking app that still shows you a welcoming dashboard instead of just confirming a deposit by text, or a smart-home system that visualizes energy usage rather than simply optimizing it silently. Both are gestures that transform a transaction into a relationship. They show that interfaces do more than deliver outcomes—they infuse narratives, values, and meaning into those outcomes.</p><h4>The value of inefficiency</h4><p>Once utility is taken care of by automation, effort itself becomes expressive. What optimization once treated as waste — time, ornament, friction, even delay — can instead become thoughtful design materials. They slow people down just enough to notice, reflect, or connect.</p><p>For users, the “scenic route” means richer, more meaningful interactions. A well-crafted interface invites exploration instead of simple completion, shaping how people feel as they move through a system because it makes the care and effort behind it visible.</p><p>We often feel that difference when someone chooses to spend effort on us.</p><p>For example, when I left a company after nearly 13 years, my boss and mentor mailed me a handwritten note congratulating me and thanking me for my work and friendship. He could have sent an email — faster, clearer, and certainly more legible (his handwriting is atrocious) — but I would have read it once and moved on. Instead, I keep that note on my shelf as a reminder of the effort and story it represents.</p><p>This dynamic is well described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"">signaling theory</a>, which helps explain why effort itself can communicate value. A “costly signal” — one that takes time or effort — carries more weight because it tells users that the experience was worth investing in.</p><p>A handwritten note feels meaningful because someone cared enough to write it. And in the same way, a thoughtfully designed product feels intentional because it respects the user’s humanity.</p><h4><strong>Human variability and the future of design</strong></h4><p>Most people will choose frictionless utility for routine tasks. But smaller groups seeking deeper, more intentional experiences often shape markets and brand perception in unexpected ways. Just look at how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/31/the-observer-view-on-the-joys-of-the-vinyl-record-resurgence"">vinyl records made a comeback</a>. Few would have predicted such a revival in an era dominated by streaming music.</p><figure><img alt=""Vinyl album sales chart from 1993 to 2013 shows a rise, peaking in 2013. Inset pie chart: CDs at 165m, digital 118m, LPs 6m. “The LP is Back!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*UZx_04mIZoMXn2z8hLoP3A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.statista.com/chart/1465/vinyl-lp-sales-in-the-us/?srsltid=AfmBOorHuTcApja1yRVf2qctm93NAClOgqNZSRTYyMVxEpl1bd3UZUT1"">statista.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>What was once considered obsolete can return with renewed relevance when it speaks to deeper values, and design is no different. The rise of AI and agent-based interaction won’t erase visual design—it will reframe it. As everyday interactions shift toward voice and conversation, design’s role will move from functional to expressive.</p><p>Designers won’t win by competing with AI on speed and output. Machines will always outperform there. But they cannot replicate human judgment, taste, or the ability to infuse meaning into form. The designer’s work will be knowing when a scenic route is worth taking — when inefficiency signals values or identity.</p><p>Visual design will no longer be the default. But precisely because of that, it will become more powerful — shaping meaning in ways automation cannot, long after screens disappear.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45983f55196e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/visual-designs-future-is-the-scenic-route-45983f55196e"">Visual design’s future is the scenic route</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
