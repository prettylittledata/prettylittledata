<h4>How systems become risky without anyone noticing.</h4><figure><img alt=""A Painting of Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*urJTxEUxB1exhlGRMTz9tg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Alexander Undoing the Gordian | Source: Knot 1st-art-gallery.com</figcaption></figure><p>No one decides to build a fragile system. No executive convenes a meeting to discuss how best to make operations inscrutable, unreliable, brittle. No engineer sets out to create software that no one can maintain or discern later on. No organization deliberately designs processes so convoluted that they guarantee failure.</p><p>Yet fragile, incomprehensible, unmaintainable, and failure-prone systems are everywhere. They are the norm. Systems that excel and are resilient are exceptional. So how come? Fragile systems didn’t arrive through dramatic decisions or catastrophic errors. They evolved. Their fragility and brittleness were accumulated gradually, through a thousand small, locally rational choices that collectively created something unmanageable. Therein lies the importance of Systems Thinking. To understand the aggregate dynamics of individual choices.</p><p><a href=""https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/ask-mit-professor-what-system-thinking-and-why-it-important"">Systems Thinking </a>is the best defense we have against the complexity run amuck. Complexity is an emergent property of systems. It evolves not from reckless decision-making but from responding sensibly to immediate, localized needs. A new feature here, a workaround there, an exception to handle an edge case, a patch to fix an urgent problem. Each addition seems small. Each solves a real problem. Each is approved and implemented with good intentions.</p><p>But complexity isn’t an additive attribute. It multiplies.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram that demonstrates that the complexity of a system (connections) grows exponentially with the number of components in a system"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/0*2MfYpvTLBmGK5aYk.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>Take the image above. In the abstract it does a good job of demonstrating complexity. A system of 3 nodes has just 3 unique connections. A system with 1 more node, doubles the number of connections to 6. Double that system and the number of connections grows exponentially. Somewhere along the way the system crosses a threshold where the system becomes so fraught with complexity that it creates genuine risk. Like the emergence of complexity, the probability also increases exponentially.</p><p><strong>How Complexity Accumulates</strong></p><p>The first step in managing complexity is understanding how it sneaks into systems despite everyone’s best efforts to keep things simple.</p><p>Feature Creep</p><p>Every user wants one more feature. Every stakeholder has a use case that isn’t quite covered. Every competitive analysis reveals something rivals offer that you don’t. The pressure to add is constant and multifaceted.</p><p>Individual feature requests seem reasonable. A customer needs the system to handle a specific edge case. A sales prospect will sign if you just add this one capability. An internal team needs special handling for their workflow.</p><p>Saying yes to each request improves the system for someone. But each addition increases the surface area of the system, manifesting in more code to maintain, more interactions to test, more documentation to write, more training to conduct, as well as an expanded Optimal Design Domain. The complexity grows with the factorial of features.</p><p>Procedural Layering</p><p>Organizations respond to problems <a href=""https://irb.northwestern.edu/compliance-education/corrective-and-preventive-action-capa-plans.html"">by adding procedures</a>. A mistake occurs; a new approval process is implemented. An audit finds gaps; a new compliance check is required. A risk materializes; a new control is instituted.</p><p>Each procedure makes sense in isolation. We should approve major purchases. We should verify compliance. We should control risk. But procedures accumulate faster than they’re removed. Organizations rarely ask, “What procedure can we eliminate now that we’re adding this one?”</p><p>The result is sedimentary layers of process, each representing a response to some past problem, many now obsolete but all still in force because no one has authority or incentive to remove them.</p><p><a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">The Theory of Constraints</a> (ToC) identifies this as policy constraints — rules and procedures that become bottlenecks themselves. <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/eliyahu-goldratt.html"">Goldratt </a>(the creator of ToC) observed that organizations often implement policies to optimize local efficiency but never revisit them when conditions change, creating system-level dysfunction.</p><p>Informal Complexity, Work Arounds</p><p>When formal systems don’t serve user needs well, people create workarounds. They copy data manually between systems. They use spreadsheets to track what the official system should track but doesn’t. They develop informal communication channels because formal ones are too slow.</p><p>In my experience as an engineer, systems designer, and consultant, this is actually the norm of how business gets done. People are very entrepreneurial by nature. There’s never a formalized meeting to figure out how business operations ought to be completed, they just figure out what works, and that becomes the best practice. This is great for getting things done, but it also means that there is usually lots of low-hanging fruit to optimize these systems, usually at low cost.</p><p>Workarounds are innovations at the edges. They represent localized problem-solving that keeps work flowing. But they’re also a key driver of hidden complexity. The formal system looks simple on paper, but the actual operating system includes dozens of undocumented workarounds that only certain people know about.</p><p>When those people leave, their workarounds break. When systems change, workarounds that depended on specific quirks stop working. When new people join, they don’t know the workarounds exist and make errors because the formal system doesn’t match operational reality.</p><p>Technical Debt and The Infrastructure Accumulation</p><p>In software, technical debt is explicit and easy to detect. Shortcuts are taken to complete a project faster, leaving behind code that should be refactored later. Often, “later” never comes, and the debt accumulates.</p><p>But technical debt exists in all systems, not just software. In manufacturing, we regularly see equipment that’s been patched repeatedly, or modules added onto instead of replaced. In organizational design we even see it in the form of reporting lines being added without rethinking the fundamental design. It’s the sales training program that’s been updated piecemeal for every new product instead of redesigned.</p><p>Each piece of debt makes future changes harder. The code becomes harder to modify, because the internal logic is already fractal. The manufacturing equipment becomes more fragile. The organization becomes more difficult to reorganize. The training becomes less effective. The system becomes rigid precisely when it needs to be adaptive.</p><p><strong>Complexity Increases Faster Than Our Ability to Understand It</strong></p><p>A system’s complexity doesn’t scale linearly with system size. A system twice as large isn’t twice as complex. It’s often four times, eight times, or exponentially more complex.</p><p>Interaction Effects</p><p>An interaction is the reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between two components within a system. This is important to understand how systems behave as a whole. Systems are not merely the sum of their parts. It means that as systems grow their complexity is boosted by the mutual and cyclical relationships., highlighting that influences are mutual and cyclical, not linear. A system with 10 components has 45 potential interaction pairs, but a system with 100 components has 4,950.</p><p>Most interactions don’t matter most of the time. But under stress, under unusual conditions, or when specific combinations occur, obscure interactions become critical. And the more interactions exist, the more likely that some will create failure modes no one anticipated. This is the principle of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogens</a>.</p><p>You cannot understand a system by understanding its parts in isolation. The interactions between parts often dominate behavior. As those interactions multiply, understanding the whole becomes exponentially harder.</p><p>Emergent Behaviors</p><p>Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors. Emergent behaviors are system-level properties that don’t exist in any individual component. Traffic jams emerge from individual driver decisions. Market crashes emerge from individual trading behaviors. Organizational dysfunction emerges from individual departmental optimizations. Flocking patterns of birds and Schools of Fish emerge as a result of many constituents which don’t, in and of themselves, possess these emergent properties.</p><figure><img alt=""A flock of birds during a yellow sunset"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wIMNA47WVg3BzCiR.jpg"" /><figcaption>A Flock of birds as emergent behavior found in nature | Source: Arstechnica.com</figcaption></figure><p>Often spawned by localized decision making, these emergent properties are often negative (at least from the system designer’s perspective), namely because they are unintended and unexpected consequences. And they’re nearly impossible to predict because they emerge from the interaction of many factors, not from any single cause.</p><p><em>A side note/rant:</em></p><p><em>This is why I’m bearish when it comes to the future of gene editing technology. Gene editing methods like </em><a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/06/stanford-explainer-crispr-gene-editing-and-beyond""><em>CRISPR </em></a><em>uses correlations and probability to edit genes for some desired effect, eye color. But (1) these may correlate with other factors not accounted for (</em><a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/how-are-earwax-and-body-odor-linked-72476""><em>like the relationship between earwax and body odor</em></a><em>) and (2) the collective editing of multiple genes can have greater unintended [read: emergent] consequences.</em></p><p>Cognitive Limits</p><p>Human working memory can hold roughly seven chunks of information. When a system has hundreds or thousands of interacting components, no individual can hold the complete system in their head. Understanding becomes distributed across many people, each of whom has a partial view.</p><p>This fragmentation of understanding is itself a risk. No one sees the whole. Decisions are made based on local knowledge that doesn’t account for global effects. Changes are implemented without understanding full implications. The system becomes too complex for anyone to fully reason about.</p><p><strong>Real-World Complexity Failures</strong></p><p>Healthcare.gov Launch (2013)</p><p>The Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance exchange launched in October 2013 and immediately collapsed. The website couldn’t handle traffic. Applications failed. Users couldn’t complete enrollment.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bbTMPytERu-EIAQH.png"" /><figcaption>The now famous error screen of HealthCare.gov | Source: Medium.com</figcaption></figure><p>The failure wasn’t a single bug or bad decision. It was systemic complexity. Multiple contractors built different pieces. Systems needed to integrate with existing federal databases. State exchanges needed to interface with the federal system. Security requirements added layers. Compliance rules created conditional logic. <a href=""https://medium.com/dataseries/small-is-beautiful-the-launch-failure-of-healthcare-gov-5e60f20eb967"">Edge cases demanded special handling</a>.</p><p>Each component worked (more or less) in isolation. But integrating them revealed cascade failures, timing issues, and interaction effects no one had anticipated. The system was too complex for anyone to fully understand, and that complexity created fragility.</p><p>Knight Capital Trading Loss (2012)</p><p><a href=""https://www.henricodolfing.ch/en/case-study-4-the-440-million-software-error-at-knight-capital/"">Knight Capital</a> deployed new trading software to seven of eight servers. The eighth still ran old code. When trading began, the old code executed differently than the new code. Orders from the mixed system created erratic behavior that cost $440 million in 45 minutes.</p><p>The complexity wasn’t in the trading logic itself but was in the deployment process, version control, and fail-safes (or lack thereof). Each element seemed manageable. But the interaction of partial deployment, legacy code, and automated trading created a failure mode that destroyed the company.</p><p>Boeing 787 Development Delays</p><p><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/business/boeing-787-dreamliner-halt"">Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was years late </a>and billions over budget, largely due to complexity in managing a global supply chain with unprecedented outsourcing.

It was organizational and logistical. Coordinating work across dozens of companies, ensuring interface compatibility, managing schedule dependencies, and integrating testing added complexity that multiplied with every additional partner and interface.</p><p><strong>Detecting Accumulated Complexity</strong></p><p>Complexity accumulates invisibly until it causes problems. How do you detect it before it becomes critical?</p><p>Warning Signs:</p><ol><li><strong>Lengthening cycle times</strong>: Changes that used to take days now take weeks. This often signals that complexity has increased friction.</li><li><strong>Rising error rates</strong>: More defects, more support tickets, more exceptions. Complexity creates more failure modes.</li><li><strong>Knowledge silos</strong>: Only certain people can work on certain systems because they’re too complex for newcomers to learn quickly.</li><li><strong>Fear of change</strong>: Teams resist modifications because they’re not confident about side effects. “If it’s working, don’t touch it” becomes the mantra.</li><li><strong>Escalating maintenance costs</strong>: More time spent fixing and patching, less time spent building new capability.</li><li><strong>Integration problems</strong>: New features break existing functionality in unexpected ways.</li><li><strong>Documentation drift</strong>: Formal documentation no longer matches actual operation because the system has evolved through undocumented changes.</li></ol><p>These symptoms don’t prove complexity directly, but they correlate strongly with systems that have accumulated too much of it.</p><p>Quantitative Measures:</p><p>For software systems, metrics like <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/cyclomatic-complexity/"">cyclomatic complexity</a>, coupling metrics, and dependency graphs provide numerical complexity measures and diagnostic tools. But even non-software systems can be measured:</p><ul><li><strong>Decision tree depth</strong>: How many conditional branches exist in a process?</li><li><strong>Role count</strong>: How many different roles touch a workflow?</li><li><strong>Approval layers</strong>: How many sign-offs does a decision require?</li><li><strong>Exception frequency</strong>: How often do standard processes require exceptions?</li><li><strong>Handoff count</strong>: How many times does work transfer between people or systems?</li></ul><p>High values don’t automatically mean there’s a problem. Complexity is sometimes necessary. But they indicate where to look for opportunities to simplify and where to triage when something breaks.</p><p><strong>Pruning Unnecessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Once you’ve detected complexity, how do you reduce it without breaking things that work?</p><p>1. Dependency Mapping</p><p>You can’t simplify what you don’t understand. Create visual maps of dependencies:</p><ul><li>What depends on what?</li><li>What components interact?</li><li>What can be changed independently?</li><li>Where are the tight couplings?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of a dependency map"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZidzvGzhvpLFVASu2l9qtQ.png"" /><figcaption>An example of a dependency map | Source: dependency-map.com</figcaption></figure><p>Tools exist for software (dependency analyzers, architecture visualization). For organizational systems, this might be process maps, responsibility matrices (RACI), or workflow diagrams.</p><p>2. The 80/20 Analysis</p><p>Most systems exhibit <a href=""https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pareto-distribution"">Pareto distributions</a>: 20% of features deliver 80% of value, 20% of code contains 80% of bugs, 20% of procedures handle 80% of cases.</p><figure><img alt=""An Example of a Pareto Distribution"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hKMuHOxk7ZxHLk1Z"" /><figcaption>An Example of a Pareto Distribution | Source: scirp.org</figcaption></figure><p>Identify:</p><ul><li>Which features are rarely used?</li><li>Which procedures handle edge cases?</li><li>Which code paths are seldom executed?</li></ul><p>These low-value, high-maintenance components are prime candidates for elimination. Removing them reduces surface area without significantly reducing capability.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lightsondata.com/why-focus-reduce-variation/"">Deming’s focus on variation reduction</a> is relevant here. Simplification reduces sources of variation, making systems more stable and predictable. Eliminating rarely-used features eliminates rare but costly failure modes.</p><p>3. Complexity Budgets</p><p>Treat complexity as a constrained resource, like memory or budget. Every addition must fit within the budget, which means something else might need to be removed.</p><p>This forces explicit trade-offs: “To add this feature, we need to remove three existing ones. Which should go?” The question surfaces costs that are otherwise hidden.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@ankitsingh1583/how-netflix-uber-and-amazon-manage-their-microservices-at-scale-97b028da2134"">Netflix famously has a policy limiting microservices complexity</a>: teams can add new services, but the total count must stay within bounds, forcing consolidation and simplification as a regular practice.</p><p>4. Simplification Audits</p><p>Regularly review systems specifically to identify simplification opportunities:</p><ul><li>Which procedures exist because of problems that no longer occur?</li><li>Which features could be consolidated?</li><li>Which integrations could be eliminated?</li><li>Which exceptions could be standardized?</li></ul><p>The <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">Theory of Constraints</a> teaches to focus improvement efforts on constraints. But TOC also recognizes that non-constraint resources shouldn’t be optimized to full capacity. Similarly, not every part of a system needs maximum capability. Some parts can and should be simplified, even if it means slightly reduced local performance, if it improves overall system manageability.</p><p>5. Modular Decomposition</p><p>Break complex systems into loosely <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2022_rp/52/"">coupled modules </a>with clear interfaces. This doesn’t reduce total complexity, but it contains and partitions it.</p><p>A monolithic system with 1,000 interconnected parts is unmanageable. Ten modules of 100 parts each, with well-defined interfaces between modules, is manageable. You can understand one module deeply without needing to understand all modules.</p><p>This requires discipline in interface design: modules should interact through narrow, well-specified interfaces, not through deep coupling or shared state. When modularity is maintained, complexity within modules stays local and doesn’t ripple system-wide.</p><p>6. Standardization and Platforming</p><p>Reduce variety by standardizing components and building on common platforms. Instead of five different authentication systems, use one. Instead of three different data formats, standardize on one.</p><p>This trades flexibility for simplicity. You can’t optimize each use case perfectly, but you reduce the number of things that need to be understood, maintained, and integrated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.6sigma.us/business-process-management-articles/process-standardization-for-operational-excellence/"">Standardization of processes is foundational for quality</a>. You can’t improve what varies wildly. You can’t maintain what’s different everywhere. Standardization creates the baseline from which to build, measure, and improve.</p><p><strong>Culture and Resisting Complexity</strong></p><p>Technical approaches help, but the deeper challenge is cultural. Organizations must develop a <a href=""https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/dealing-with-complexity-by-creating-a-bias-for-simplicity"">bias toward simplicity</a>, which cuts against many incentives.</p><p>Incentive Misalignments:</p><ul><li>Product managers are rewarded for feature additions, not feature removals</li><li>Engineers are evaluated on what they build, not what they eliminate</li><li>Processes are added in response to visible problems; removing them is invisible work</li><li>Budgets reward spending, not simplification</li></ul><p>To counter these, organizations need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Celebrate simplification</strong>: Publicize cases where removing features improved the product</li><li><strong>Measure complexity explicitly</strong>: Track metrics like code complexity, process steps, and approval layers</li><li><strong>Require simplification alongside addition</strong>: New features must be accompanied by the removal of old features</li><li><strong>Create dedicated simplification initiatives</strong>: Not as ongoing work but as explicit projects with resources</li></ul><p>The Power of “No”</p><p>The most important complexity control is saying no to additions. This is politically difficult — every addition has a constituency. But the cumulative cost of saying yes too often is a system that collapses under its own weight.</p><p>Saying no requires:</p><ul><li>Clear criteria for what’s in scope and what’s not</li><li>Explicit recognition that the capacity for complexity is limited</li><li>Willingness to disappoint stakeholders in the service of system sustainability</li><li>Authority structures that can enforce boundaries</li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/development/awards/deming.html"">W. Edwards Deming</a>’s point about <a href=""https://deming.org/create-constancy-of-purpose/"">constancy of purpose</a> applies here. Without a consistent commitment to simplicity, complexity accumulates as each decision optimizes locally without considering global effects.</p><p><strong>Living with Necessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Some complexity is essential. Real-world problems are complex; solutions must match that complexity to some degree. The eliminate unnecessary complexity while managing necessary complexity effectively.</p><p><strong>Essential Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li>Business rules that reflect genuine domain complexity</li><li>Integration points that correspond to real organizational boundaries</li><li>Features that deliver significant value to significant user populations</li><li>Redundancy that provides resilience</li></ul><p>This complexity should be:</p><ul><li>Explicit: Documented and understood</li><li>Contained: Modularized so it doesn’t leak</li><li>Justified: Regularly validated as still necessary</li></ul><p><strong>Accidental Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://idenhaus.com/why-workarounds-are-iams-silent-killer/"">Workarounds</a> for systems that should be fixed</li><li>Procedures created in response to one-time events</li><li>Features that sounded good but are rarely used</li><li>Integration patterns that evolved organically without design</li></ul><p>This complexity should be systematically hunted and eliminated.</p><p>The distinction isn’t always clear, but the question should be constantly asked: is this complexity necessary, or did it just accumulate?</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Complexity as Systemic Debt</strong></p><p>Complexity is like financial debt: sometimes useful, always carrying a cost, and dangerous when it accumulates beyond your ability to service it.</p><p>Taking on debt to invest in growth can be smart. But debt that accumulates from routine operations without producing value is insidious. It constrains future options, increases risk, and eventually demands painful restructuring.</p><p>The same is true of complexity. Some complexity enables capability. But much of how complexity propagates is just accumulation, the residue of past decisions that no one has cleaned up. It makes the system fragile, expensive to maintain, and difficult to evolve.</p><p>The challenge is that complexity accumulates gradually and locally while its costs manifest globally and suddenly. Each small addition seems manageable. The cumulative effect is system failure that seems to come from nowhere but was actually built up over years of accretion.</p><p>Managing this requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Vigilance</strong>: Constantly watching for complexity creep</li><li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Resisting additions and forcing eliminations</li><li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Mapping and measuring complexity</li><li><strong>Investment</strong>: Dedicating resources to simplification</li><li><strong>Culture</strong>: Valuing simplicity as much as capability</li></ul><p>Systems should be designed for improvement, not just for operation. This means building systems that can be understood, modified, and simplified. Systems that resist simplification, where every change risks breaking something else, have accumulated too much complexity. I also mentioned this as a key principle to designing <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/responsible-tech-principles-for-technological-use-and-development-3de9f6d8f49d"">Responsible and Humane Technology</a>.</p><p>The risk isn’t that your system will fail catastrophically tomorrow. It’s that complexity accumulates silently until one day you discover your system has become so fragile, so opaque, and so expensive to maintain that it’s effectively unmaintainable. By then, you have few options: live with mounting failures or undertake expensive, risky restructuring.</p><p>The solution is prevention: treat complexity as debt, recognize when you’re taking it on, ensure it’s justified, and regularly pay it down. Build systems that can be simplified, not just systems that work. Create cultures that celebrate subtraction as much as addition.</p><blockquote>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1020792.Antoine_de_Saint_Exup_ry"">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a></blockquote><p>Because in the long run, the systems that survive aren’t the ones with the most features, the most procedures, or the most components. They’re the ones that remain understandable, maintainable, and adaptable. They are the ones that resisted the inexorable accumulation of unnecessary complexity.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e222182a67f5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-complexity-accumulates-e222182a67f5"">How complexity accumulates</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Yes, they’re powerful. Yes, they let us do more. But there’s this weird disconnect growing between me and the things I make. When everything is instant, it starts feeling like a slot machine. Except you always win. Which makes it more addictive. And somehow… also boring?</p><p>And you can’t stop. Social media keeps telling us to ship more, faster, be first. But when anyone has the power of a team of 10x engineers (lol), being first isn’t even a moat anymore. It’s just being slightly less late.</p><p>The worst part is what this comic is about. I catch myself using AI for things I used to enjoy doing. Changing a font size. Adjusting the border radius. Pushing pixels until the result made me proud.</p><p>I still do something similar, but now it’s a conversation. I tell the spirit in the terminal to do it for me. “Make the left padding a bit wider. Make the animation snappier. Use our subtle foreground color… don’t use any color, use our color token. Oh, and make it smaller, go from sm to xs.” That’s my new <em>pixel-pushing.</em></p><p>Why? Because I can. And that’s the trap.</p><p>The thing gets done but it doesn’t feel like I did anything. I could’ve written that code myself… but sometimes I don’t even know where the component lives in the files. I’d have to inspect the element in the browser, find the classes, copy them, search them in my IDE, locate the file, then edit it (am I the only one who does this?) So instead… I just talk to the machine. I overexplain so it only changes what I want. I don’t design anymore. I direct.</p><p>But these things could direct themselves too. The “human in the loop” feels less like the guide and more like the thing slowing it all down. Some people call this slowing of the machine… this fine-tuning… “taste.” The ultimate human moat. Guys, stop it with your “taste.” I’ve seen how you dress. You don’t have any. And taste is really just doing things the way the top 10% of creators do instead of the average. That’s a pattern. Patterns are exactly what these things are built to learn… just give it time (a month?).</p><p>But hey… this comic? I tried new angles, more creative shots. All hand-drawn. No model. No worktree. No extra-high reasoning. Just me and the canvas. And that feels good. Like… “look, mom, I made this!”</p><p>Look, I’m in a rut. I really love these tools, I love creating with AI, I’ve never felt so productive. They’re wild and they’re powerful. But I hope we keep the joy. Because if everything is automated and instant but doesn’t feel like ours… what are we even making?</p><p><a href=""https://pablostanley.substack.com/"">Pabs</a></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*t3Wqm7CQ3REno6xf.jpeg"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-jexP73H16tGl-BWnKpc8g.png"" /></figure><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cdbaa06dc1b8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/extended-overthinking-cdbaa06dc1b8"">Extended overthinking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Some think the role will disappear completely. Others say only super-seniors will survive. And yet others say it’s all just a blip in time and there will be no fundamental change.</p><p>I think all are wrong.</p><p>For two reasons:</p><ol><li>Designers are naturally attuned to adapt to technological change. We are trained to identify and acknowledge change, manage adaptation, and find solutions for friction.</li><li>We’re moving towards a totally new definition of digital products. Away from interfaces, and towards fluid use cases that we’re only beginning to imagine now. To make this accessible and valuable to all, we will need designers at all levels. <em>Obviously</em>.</li></ol><p>Why, then, has the design community been in absolute panic since AI has been taking off?</p><p>Seniors are telling juniors to count themselves lucky if they’ll ever find a job.</p><p>Design leaders are jumping from one AI-tool hypetrain to the next in mere weeks.</p><p>Monday, it’s all about prototypes. Thursday, it’s vibe coding. Friday, we’re preaching that output no longer matters (everyone can design now!) and that we should be brilliant strategists instead. By next Monday, we’ll be half-heartedly debating which soft skills are absolutely vital to survive.</p><p><em>Survive.</em> As designers.</p><p>As if our skills have evaporated overnight, and we can only stick around if we somehow show that we’re good for (undefined) other stuff.</p><p>No.</p><p>We should be thriving.</p><p>Where has it all gone wrong? Why aren’t designers winning in the age of AI, which, at its core, is about <em>making</em>?</p><p>The thing we do best.</p><p>Here’s what I think.</p><h4>We’ve been sabotaging ourselves.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogC1IGrkuO2HuDnFDBoKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm1950683648/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Please don’t be enraged. Take a deep breath and think about it.</p><p>Ever since the first AI tools with strong visual output started emerging, we seemingly overnight started screaming from all rooftops about:</p><p><strong><em>taste</em></strong>.</p><h4>What the fck is taste?</h4><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/taste-vs-technical-skills-ai/"">According to NNG</a> it’s “the learned, subjective ability to discern and select the most effective, harmonious, and high-quality elements for a project”.</p><p>Maybe, if you’re really smart, you can picture what that means. But really, if you’re honest, taste is a vague concept. Taste is subjective. Taste is not something that makes a product win (for the most part).</p><p>And vague is not <em>good</em> — especially not in a time of transformation where no one really knows where we’re going yet. Where tech stacks are changing weekly, and user needs are developing at rocket speed.</p><p>You know what else <em>vague</em> is bad for? Convincing an executive to invest in something.</p><p>It generally takes three things to grab an executive's attention.</p><ol><li>Connection (Do you get their problem?).</li><li>Authority (Do you know your stuff?).</li><li>Vision (Do you know where this is going?).</li></ol><p>Taste doesn’t answer any of those. You know what else doesn’t?</p><h4>Shitty prototypes.</h4><p>Yeah, I’ve made my fair share of them, too. But the time when these impressed anyone is over. Even my 0% designer husband can now vibe code stuff and knows how to whip up a design prototype.</p><p>There is a time and place for them. Prototypes and vibe-coded projects are great to show a vision, build excitement, or unblock a team that’s stuck in process. But they’re not what’s gonna convince your engineering stakeholders to give you access to their codebase so you can actually start shipping fixes from your design backlog.</p><p>I’d like to argue that excessive prototyping is the next big issue that’s messing with the status of design in the age of AI.</p><p>Because they undermine our authority. There’s the executive’s next red flag. <em>Do you know your stuff?</em></p><p>Of course, designers recognised this concern quickly. How did we respond?</p><p>By starting never-ending discussions about:</p><p><strong><em>craft</em>.</strong></p><h4>What the heck is craft?</h4><p>I like <a href=""https://www.nsead.org/resources/teaching-inspiration/craft/defining-craft/"">this definition</a>: “Craft can be defined as intelligent making. It is technically, materially and culturally informed. Craft is the designing and making of individual artefacts and objects, encouraging the development of intellectual, creative and practical skills, visual sensitivity and a working knowledge of tools, materials and systems”.</p><p>Welp.</p><p><em>Taste and craft walk into a bar…</em></p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>You get my point. Here is another vague concept that most people associate with activities they liked to do back in kindergarten.</p><p>And listen, I’m not knocking craft. I love writing poetry, painting, throwing pots at the wheel. All that takes craft and skill, just as my designs at work do. But craft should be so obvious to us as designers that we should not make it our <em>main</em> selling point.</p><p>Obviously, we develop incredible craft as our experience builds. Obviously, individual designers have different styles. Obviously, we put thought and care into what we make.</p><p>Craft is the baseline. That’s what we want the executives to know. By debating it and what it even means, we’re again undermining our authority. And I’d argue we’re also not really connecting with them OR showing much vision.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p><strong>How do we get out of this mess?</strong></p><p>We need to remember — and remind others — why design is irreplaceable.</p><h4>We’re the OG makers.</h4><p>We’re “growth mindset”, personified.</p><p>In most classic product companies, there are <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/glossary-discovery-product-trio/"">trios</a>: A product manager, a designer, and an engineer. The point? To ensure that the perspectives of the users and the business are balanced with the technical capabilities throughout the development process.</p><p>While a well-functioning trio feels like a cheat code to achieving product velocity, an unbalanced one can slow things down, ship mediocre stuff, or not at all.</p><p>The best trios I’ve worked in and observed had one very obvious trait in common: we all respected each other's practice, but we also understood enough about each other’s domains to be unafraid to push back.</p><p>Only a designer who understands the business side of things can really translate business goals into conversion flows.</p><p>Only a product manager who understands the fundamentals of good design can push a designer to level up.</p><p>And only an engineer who cares for users and understands how the business works is an equal partner in a trio.</p><p>And while AI is bringing all of our roles closer together, we are still the builders of <em>the experience</em>.</p><p>The thing that is actually being used. The thing executives aim to deliver.</p><ol><li><strong>Connection</strong>: You want to make something. We can tell you if it’s possible. If yes, we can ensure it’s made in the best possible way.</li><li><strong>Authority</strong>: We work at the intersection of what the business wants, the user needs, and what actually works.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong>: We have the skills, tools, and mindset to create something you <em>can’t even/can only</em> imagine.</li></ol><p>Sold.</p><h4>The design mindset is unique.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iI-tGWT87XJnnLmo7XwFKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm725418752/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>And it’s beautiful.</p><p><strong>It’s human-centred. </strong>Deep empathy for the user is the foundation, ensuring solutions address real needs, feelings, and motivations.</p><p><strong>It embraces ambiguity.</strong> Viewing problems as opportunities rather than roadblocks.</p><p><strong>It kills its darlings by default and favours learning.</strong> A willingness to “fail fast,” learn from prototypes, and constantly adapt solutions based on feedback.</p><p><strong>It’s, at its core, optimistic and inclusive.</strong> Bringing diverse perspectives together, believing that better solutions can always be created.</p><p><strong>It’s the most curious of mindsets.</strong> Asking “why” and “what if” to challenge the status quo at every turn.</p><p>You don’t have to read this twice to know: hell yes, we need designers with AI taking over more and more space in our lives.</p><h4>Here’s what we need to do. Now.</h4><p>In most classic design teams, there are different roles: Product designers, content designers, user researchers, sometimes motion designers, and ops people. Their educational background is essentially the same: developing an understanding of users, business, and products. Some focus more on the look and feel, others on going in depth on the “how it works”.</p><p><strong>So, for the love of everything good, can we please stop debating our titles?</strong></p><h4>We are all designers.</h4><p>Designers make stuff. Some use words and taxonomy, others use pixels. Some use language, others use code. The mindset is the same. The mindset is what matters.</p><p><strong>Yes, AI is muddying the lines between design roles. But it doesn’t matter.</strong></p><p>Not because it can replace people, but because it can save time that, in return, can be used to develop the skills traditionally only another role would need. Not so you can replace someone, but:</p><p><strong>So you can become a more holistic, better maker.</strong></p><p>This is not new.</p><p>There’s always been a push for all designers to do their own research. For content designers to develop visual skills. For product designers to get strong at prototyping. Now, finally, we can do so — with far less effort than before.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we should think less. It means we <em>can</em> think more.</p><p>I, personally, love thinking. Nothing gets me as high as solving a problem. It’s the reason I got into design, and specifically design in tech, in the first place. There were actual (cool) problems to solve.</p><p>I originally picked UX content as my toolkit. Now, my toolkit has expanded. I love that.

<h4>The shallowness of the “empathy machine.”</h4><figure><img alt=""a guy using VR headset in a fancy living room"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*5waTlYqbHeJwFdxz"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@silverkblack?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Gariev</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>I once saw a “poverty simulation” designed to help raise funds and “put people in others’ shoes.” I felt… weird. Can you imagine someone going through a 10-minute fancy VR experience and suddenly claiming they understand the struggles?</p><p>VR allows users to step into any experience from a first-person perspective. Some people call it an “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXHil1TPxvA\"">empathy machine</a>” and argue that it could influence decision-makers. I bought into it at first. However, after going through several simulations, I noticed that no matter how moved I was in the moment, none of it led to any real behavioral change.</p><p>Is it just me? Or is this “trigger empathy and cause behavioral change” design goal too impractical and overhyped?</p><h3>Why do people believe that VR can trigger empathy?</h3><p>VR allows users to inhabit avatars, and their brains might start believing that the virtual body is theirs (<a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.814565/full"">researchers</a> call this “sense of embodiment”). Some designers believe this can <strong>encourage perspective-taking, reduce implicit bias, and eventually induce empathy.</strong></p><p>In theory, it makes sense. But in reality, this assumption is too ideal and shallow. First, your brain isn’t that easy to trick. A tiny glitch — a slight delay between movement and render, or weird skin texture — will remind you it’s fake. More importantly, embodiment alone is just a shallow representation of identity. For example, putting users in a Black body doesn’t give them hundreds of years of history or lived experience. It doesn’t make them part of the Black community, and it certainly won’t create sustainable empathy.</p><h3>What is empathy, exactly?</h3><p>This word seems a bit abstract, so let’s define it better here. When <a href=""https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/vr-improves-emotional-empathy-only/release/2"">researchers </a>and designers discuss empathy, they’re usually talking about two different kinds: <strong>emotional </strong>and <strong>cognitive</strong>.</p><p>Emotional empathy is immediate and direct, like seeing someone in pain makes you feel discomfort too. Cognitive empathy goes deeper. It’s when you actively try to understand someone’s mental state and decision-making process, and this kind of empathy is what usually leads to behavioral change.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AiXVB-J8JEHS2BtKZ3n9VA.png"" /></figure><p>VR is pretty good at triggering emotional empathy because it provides users with intense sensory information. But the reaction doesn’t last. For me, it usually starts fading about 10 minutes after removing the headset. I think the problem is that while I’m in the experience, I’m so overwhelmed by everything I’m sensing that I can’t actually think about what the character is going through mentally.<strong> Without that deeper engagement, cognitive empathy never gets triggered.</strong></p><h3><strong>VR’s shallow content</strong></h3><p>Beyond sensory overload, VR simulations lack the depth needed for cognitive empathy.</p><p>The content is often shallow. Let’s compare it with other storytelling media: movies and books are usually built on years of research and interviews, while VR simulations prioritize technical execution, focusing on realistic graphics and interactions over storytelling depth. <strong>Users often end up distracted by the novelty of technology instead of engaging with the issues.</strong></p><p>Time is another constraint. Most VR simulations run under 10 minutes, which isn’t enough to convey background or context. Understanding social issues often requires hours of learning and engagement just to grasp the basics. However, creating longer experiences isn’t practical either because VR headsets are bulky and uncomfortable, and the sensory intensity creates fatigue quickly.</p><h3><strong>When VR simulation might work</strong></h3><p>VR probably isn’t the best tool for creating sustainable empathy or long-term behavioral change. However, it can still be effective when applied with clear, specific design goals instead of vague “triggering empathy” objectives.</p><p>Take healthcare training for example. <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6148621/"">Research </a>shows that medical students better understand conditions like Alzheimer’s through VR, improving their compassionate care. It works because <strong>VR complements their existing education.</strong> These students already study these topics extensively through patient shadowing, workshops, and reflective practice.</p><p>Unlike general audiences with no background, these students approach VR with clear learning objectives. They know they’re not trying to “feel like” elderly patients but learning to recognize specific physical symptoms. They’re less likely to get distracted by the technology and can navigate the experience better. The actual empathy develops later, when they interact with real patients.</p><p>No one can really “walk in others’ shoes.” Empathy is a complex emotion. Social issues are far more complicated than any simulation can capture, and technology only scratches the surface: loud explosions simulate sound, not fear. Disorientation replicates physical sensations, not the psychological toll of experiencing it every day.</p><p>New technology isn’t always the shortcut to the solution. Real perspective-taking requires a more time-consuming traditional approach: engaging with communities, reading, and listening. As a developer, I try to remember these limitations instead of chasing technology hype with vague, overambitious goals.</p><h3>Reference:</h3><ol><li>Milk, C. [TED]. (2015).

<h4>How consumer security products turn physical presence into assumed consent</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a Ring-style doorbell camera watching people in a shared neighbourhood space."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BJZf6ZZrNZDCKe6Iz76Jrw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration of a home security camera extending its gaze into shared neighbourhood space, symbolising the shift from private protection to ambient surveillance. <strong><em>Image generated using Grok Imagine.</em></strong></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=""https://ring.com/eu/en"">Amazon’s Ring</a> aired its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OheUzrXsKrY""><em>Search Party</em> advertisement</a> during the Super Bowl, it presented a reassuring narrative: neighbours’ cameras cooperate, a missing dog is found, and communal order is restored. The unease the advert provoked did not stem from its goal. It arose from its premise, namely that individuals can be enrolled into a neighbourhood-scale, real-time AI <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/tech/876866/ring-search-party-super-bowl-ad-online-backlash"">surveillance network</a> without ever explicitly consenting to participate.</p><p>Within days, Ring terminated its planned partnership with <a href=""https://www.flocksafety.com/"">Flock Safety</a>, a company criticised for operating large-scale <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2026/02/17/nx-s1-5612825/flock-contracts-canceled-immigration-survillance-concerns"">automated licence plate recognition systems</a> used by <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/12/effs-investigations-expose-flock-safetys-surveillance-abuses-2025-review"">US law enforcement</a>. Ring cited <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy8dxz1g7zo"">implementation complexity</a>. The timing suggests a more candid explanation. The partnership made visible a widening gap between what surveillance technologies enable and what the public is prepared to tolerate.</p><p>This episode illustrates a defining feature of contemporary AI deployment. Individuals are no longer incorporated primarily as deliberate users; they are absorbed as ambient data contributors. Consent is not requested. It is inferred from physical presence. And when the implications of that inference become politically salient, withdrawal tends to be tactical rather than principled.</p><h3>When presence becomes participation</h3><p>Ring’s <em>Search Party</em> feature queries nearby cameras when a missing pet is reported. As <a href=""https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-demands-amazon-abandon-plan-to-include-facial-recognition-technology-in-ring-doorbells"">Senator Ed Markey observed</a>, this closely resembles neighbourhood-scale surveillance infrastructure. Crucially, <em>Search Party</em> does not operate in isolation. Ring’s <a href=""https://ring.com/support/articles/z3yhg/familiar-faces""><em>Familiar Faces</em></a> feature applies facial recognition to anyone passing within camera range, continuously scanning and categorising faces without their explicit knowledge or agreement.</p><figure><img alt=""Smartphone screen showing Ring’s Search Party interface asking a user to verify whether their camera footage matches a reported missing dog."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*RkS0GTIqXOE7qOGO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ring’s Search Party interface prompts users to verify footage from their cameras, illustrating how neighbourhood-scale surveillance continues through everyday product features. <strong>Image source: </strong><a href=""https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/ring-search-party-for-dogs-united-states-missing-pets""><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Combined, these capabilities enable tracking across residential space through distributed, privately owned sensors. The system no longer merely secures private property. It facilitates continuous monitoring of public movement.</p><p>The central tension lies in default inclusion. Neighbours are not asked whether their footage should be analysed for AI searches. Passers-by are not consulted before their biometric features are processed. Cameras function as environmental infrastructure, and physical presence alone becomes sufficient grounds for enrolment.</p><p><strong>This is not informed consent. It is participation assumed through exposure.</strong></p><p>Yuval Noah Harari captures this historical inversion precisely in <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/""><em>Nexus</em></a>:</p><p><em>“In a world where humans monitored humans, privacy was the default.”</em></p><p>In sensor-saturated environments, <strong>the opposite is now true</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Cover images of Yuval Noah Harari’s book Nexus, titled “A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iaX961XQIJtbLeHh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Cover of <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari, which examines the historical shift from human-to-human monitoring to large-scale information networks. <strong>Image source:</strong> <a href=""https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/"">Yuval Noah Harari, official website.</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The normalisation of suspicion</h3><p>The problem is not only technical but social. Platforms such as Ring’s <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neighbors-by-ring/id1218902777""><em>Neighbours</em> app</a> have reformatted the neighbourhood watch into what critics describe as participatory mass surveillance. Real-time alerts about “suspicious activity” gamify vigilance, rewarding users who flag anomalies in their surroundings.</p><p>The consequences are not evenly distributed. Research consistently shows that people of colour are disproportionately labelled as suspicious on these platforms. What begins as a private perception becomes a data point: timestamped, geotagged, and <em>potentially</em> routed toward <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/amazon-ring-cameras-surveillance-law-enforcement-crime-police-investigations.html"">police response</a>. The technology does not create implicit bias, but it institutionalises it, converting individual prejudice into operational logic.</p><p>When private cameras become the mechanism by which those biases trigger formal intervention, the question of <strong>who gets watched, and who gets to watch</strong>, becomes a civil rights issue rather than a consumer preference.</p><h3>The Infrastructure of Inevitable Surveillance</h3><p>The abandoned Flock Safety partnership reveals how such systems scale institutionally. The proposed integration could have allowed police departments to <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/home/security/amazons-ring-cameras-push-deeper-into-police-and-government-surveillance/"">request Ring footage</a> through Flock’s platform, following a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/01972243.2015.1107166"">familiar trajectory</a> in which consumer products evolve into mechanisms for data aggregation and institutional access.</p><p>This pipeline matters beyond the cancelled partnership. Where law enforcement lacks the legal grounds for neighbourhood-wide warrants, access to aggregated community camera data can serve a functionally equivalent role. Even when platforms restrict direct police access, data frequently travels through intermediaries whose business models involve selling location and behavioural data to government agencies operating well outside local democratic oversight.</p><p><strong>Cancelling one visible integration does not seal the pipeline. It merely reroutes it.</strong></p><p>Ring’s transformation from consumer hardware to data-centric platform makes this structural rather than accidental. When one person installs a camera, they consent on their own behalf. That camera nonetheless captures neighbours, delivery workers, and passers-by. As camera density increases, opting out becomes practically impossible, since avoidance requires withdrawal from shared space altogether. At that point, consent functions largely as theatre.</p><p>Harari notes that in 2023 more than <strong>one billion CCTV cameras</strong> were operative globally, roughly <strong>one for every eight people</strong>. Surveillance is no longer exceptional. <a href=""https://wifitalents.com/cctv-surveillance-industry-statistics/"">It is infrastructural.</a></p><h3>The security paradox</h3><p>There is also a pragmatic argument against centralised surveillance systems that receives less attention than it deserves: they are extraordinarily attractive targets for attack.</p><p>Aggregating millions of home cameras into a unified platform creates not only a privacy risk but a security one. A successful breach of a centralised AI hub would grant attackers what security researchers call <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/12/10/369740829/forget-creepy-nunbergs-word-of-the-year-is-bigger-and-two-god-view""><em>god-view</em> access</a>: real-time visibility into private residences across entire cities. Footage intended to protect households becomes the means by which those households are exposed.</p><p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/23/amazon-ring-camera-hack-lawsuit-threats"">Ring itself experienced security breaches in its early years</a>, including incidents in which attackers accessed cameras and harassed residents. Those were isolated failures. The risk posed by fully centralised systems, in which aggregation, AI analysis, and institutional access converge, is categorically larger.</p><p><a href=""https://kijero.com/blog/post/cctv-cameras-with-cloud-storage-vs-local-storage#:~:text=Privacy%20is%20one%20of%20the,data%20as%20you%20see%20fit."">Security researchers have long argued</a> that local storage, where footage remains within the home rather than uploaded to corporate servers, is the only architecture that eliminates this class of risk entirely. The dominance of cloud-based models reflects economic incentives tied to data extraction, not technical necessity.</p><h3>Beyond naive data optimism</h3><p>Harari describes the <em>naive view of information</em> as the belief that <a href=""https://medium.com/credtent-on-content/the-naive-view-of-engagement-why-more-isnt-better-c4b3227c7b6d"">more data naturally yields better outcomes</a>, while ignoring how power and incentives shape its use. Ring’s AI features exemplify this assumption. Expanded footage access and continuous biometric analysis are framed as unambiguous improvements to safety, while questions of agency, governance, and asymmetrical control receive minimal attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing information leading to truth, which then branches toward either wisdom or power."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OdHvYopGD6Fr5bADW_sRwg.png"" /><figcaption><strong>Diagram from <em>Nexus</em> by Yuval Noah Harari</strong> illustrating the naive assumption that more information naturally leads to truth and better outcomes, while in practice diverging toward either wisdom or power.</figcaption></figure><p>The proposed Flock integration made this logic explicit. Convenience justified infrastructure. Infrastructure produced data. Data became the substrate for AI analysis and policing. The progression reflects economic alignment rather than malicious intent, but the outcome is the same regardless.</p><h3>Making consent meaningful again</h3><p>The challenge is not whether AI should exist in sensor-rich environments. It is how legitimacy is established in spaces that are collectively experienced.</p><p>Three governance approaches already exist and could be implemented without delay.</p><p>First, <strong>default opt-in rather than opt-out</strong>. AI surveillance features should require active, informed activation. <a href=""https://medium.com/@www.manuelmiles/the-psychology-of-defaults-79d492bc99cc"">Behavioural research shows that most users never alter default settings.</a> Reversing this would not restrict the technology; it would make participation genuinely voluntary.</p><p>Second, <strong>community-level governance</strong>. Municipal oversight bodies can determine which capabilities are permissible within neighbourhoods, under what conditions, and with what limits on data retention. Legally constituted community trusts could require approval and independent auditing for third-party and law-enforcement partnerships.</p><p>Third, <strong>privacy-preserving technical architectures</strong>. Federated learning allows AI models to operate locally on devices without centralising raw data. A neighbourhood system built this way could detect unusual activity without footage ever leaving individual homes. These methods are already deployed in healthcare and finance. Their absence from consumer surveillance products reflects incentive structures, not technical limits.</p><h3>From retreat to redesign</h3><p>Ring’s retreat from the Flock Safety partnership does not resolve the underlying problem. The cameras remain installed. The AI capabilities persist. Partnerships can be quietly reconfigured through different intermediaries. The infrastructure endures.</p><p><a href=""https://arcisai.io/blog/ai-cctv-cameras-for-smart-city"">This pattern extends far beyond Ring</a>. Smart-city CCTV, mobile location tracking, and digital health monitoring follow the same trajectory. Presence becomes participation. Consent becomes assumed. Public concern produces episodic retreats, not structural change. The systems remain intact.</p><p>The question, then, is not whether AI inevitably erodes human agency. It is whether we continue to permit systems to treat mere presence as default input rather than as a condition requiring collective authorisation. In sensor-saturated environments, individual consent loses its protective force. When biometric processing is continuous, public anonymity erodes invisibly. When surveillance infrastructure is centralised, a single breach can undo every promise of safety on which the system was sold.</p><p>Crucially, these systems do not meaningfully self-correct through public discomfort alone. Left unconstrained, data-driven infrastructures expand until legitimacy breaks, at which point withdrawal becomes reputational rather than corrective. Ring’s retreat is best understood not as a resolution, but as a pressure release.</p><p>If AI is to be deployed in the name of safety, it must be governed with mechanisms equal to its reach: transparency that is operational rather than rhetorical, collective decision-making rather than individualised settings, and enforceable limits that bind platforms as tightly as they bind users. What is required are structures that prevent legitimacy crises from accumulating in the first place, rather than relying on backlash to correct them after the fact.</p><p>In environments where visibility has become the default, the task is not to abandon AI. <strong>It is to redesign it so that consent becomes meaningful again: deliberate rather than incidental, collective rather than individual, enforceable rather than assumed.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aflucas26/""><strong>Andrea Filiberto Lucas</strong></a> is a <a href=""https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/andreaflucas"">Research Support Officer</a> and MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Malta.
