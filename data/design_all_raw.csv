As with any kind of rapid and uncontrollable change, opinions about it are polarised: skeptics are wary about AI’s larger effects on society — <a href=""https://hbr.org/2026/01/companies-are-laying-off-workers-because-of-ais-potential-not-its-performance"">unemployment</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support"">mental health</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-direct-risks-does-ai-pose-to-the-climate-and-environment/"">environmental concerns</a>. AI optimists, on the other hand, believe these tools will herald a new age of tools for thought — the next breakthrough in collective intelligence, akin to the emergence of writing systems, printing, or mathematical abstraction.</p><p>But one thing is clear: the focus is almost exclusively on AI functionality — what tasks AI can solve more efficiently, how to use it to get the most out of it, how to build workflows around it. This, perhaps, is not in itself surprising: with the plethora of models, tools, and chatbots available, even those grappling with AI on a daily basis — researchers, software designers, developers — struggle to make sense of them all.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of YouTube videos about which AI tools designers should use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5a85P-IT6jYgkWP9bhXMUQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Deciding which AI tools to use has become a problem in itself. Source: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>But when I asked Claude to tell me about some traditionally human cognitive abilities that AI now has, I was surprised that it appended the expected list (pattern recognition, language understanding, learning from experience) with the following:</p><blockquote><em>What’s interesting is that AI often achieves these abilities through completely different mechanisms than humans — we don’t truly “understand” in the way you do, and we lack consciousness, genuine emotions, and embodied experience. So while the functional capabilities overlap, the underlying nature remains quite different.</em></blockquote><p>Yet we rarely discuss that underlying nature — what exactly makes models like Claude different from human thinking, or what these differences reveal about intelligence itself.</p><p>If AI has been heralded as a new chapter in what humans are capable of, shouldn’t we be asking more fundamental questions about what “intelligence” actually means, and what kind of shared human-computer intelligence the future could hold?</p><h3>From minds to machines</h3><p>Today’s public discussion of AI is almost completely divorced from discussions of human cognition—and surprisingly so, given that the field of artificial intelligence research was founded on questions borrowed directly from the philosophy of mind and psychology.</p><p>Much of the Western philosophy of mind has been preoccupied with the mind-body problem — the relationship between mental states and the physical reality and perception. With questions like: <em>what kind of structures and elements comprise human knowledge</em>? <em>What is thinking</em>? <em>Is having a mind the same as having a brain</em>? These questions echoed through Alan Turing’s seminal work “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” the 1950 paper published in <em>Mind</em> that introduced what we now know as the Turing test.</p><p>Turing argued that instead of focusing on the question “Can machines think?”, more can be learned from their observed behaviour. He proposed an “imitation game” (the original name for the Turing test) — a hypothetical scenario in which a human evaluator has text-based conversations with two hidden participants: one human and one machine. If the evaluator can’t reliably tell which is which based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.</p><figure><img alt=""The setup of the Turing test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*G_VPOC9VEN3vCy0W.png"" /><figcaption>In a Turing test, a human evaluator judges a text transcript of a conversation between a human and a machine. The evaluator tries to identify the machine, and the machine passes if the evaluator cannot reliably tell them apart. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, the discussion around creating a human-like “learning machine” was theoretical. But the advancements in the understanding of the brain’s neural structure throughout the 19th and 20th centuries established the electrical nature of the nerve signal, culminating in neuropsychologist Donald Hebb’s theory on the neural processes that underlie learning. In his 1949 book <em>The Organization of Behavior</em>, Hebb theorised how neural connections form through repeated activation — a principle later summarised as “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” This insight provided the foundation for modern neuroscience, neural network theory, and machine learning.</p><figure><img alt=""Structure of the human neuron compared to the architecture of an artificial neural network"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/726/1*VK0tUU4UHW3HHWA7slJ3eg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The principle “Neurons that fire together, wire together” inspired the architecture of artificial neural networks. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>Early pioneers of AI believed that describing the mind in computational terms — made possible by Hebbian theory and the subsequent development of artificial neural networks — could finally answer those foundational questions about human cognition. If they could build computational systems that closely resembled the brain’s neural structure, they reasoned, those systems might recreate the processes underlying uniquely human abilities: language, visual perception, reasoning, artistic creation.</p><p>As work on understanding the mind unfolded throughout the 20th century, two competing views of intelligence emerged: pattern recognition (also known as “statistical processing”) and world modelling (known as “symbolic manipulation”). The difference becomes clear when we consider how a child might learn what a dog is.</p><p>From the symbolic point of view, every time a child sees a creature that their caregiver tells them is “a dog,” they form and develop the concept of <em>dog — </em>i.e.<em> </em>what properties are characteristic of dogs. When they learn to recognise creatures as another kind of “dog”, they are learning to make the connection between an instance—the dog they’re looking at — and their mental concept of <em>dog</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""How a child might learn the concept of “dog”: through recognising a pattern that’s consistent across all examples of a dog they’ve encountered, or by building a mental model of what a dog is"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BZxyXL5gEBijen6btqv5VQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>How a child might learn the concept “dog” according to pattern recognition vs. world modelling view. Collage created by the author. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>From the point of view of recognising patterns, a child sees many different examples of dogs: all kinds of shapes, breeds, colours, and drooliness levels. Their extremely malleable brain processes all these instances, identifies patterns, and learns to match new examples to this pattern. Very quickly they learn to classify new exemplars as either “dog” or “not dog.”</p><p>If the latter sounds extremely similar to a basic-level explanation of machine learning, it’s not by coincidence: artificial intelligence as a field — and especially the view of intelligence as pattern recognition — has been heavily influenced by child development research. In “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing referred to an artificial intelligence system as a “child-machine”; early pioneers of modern AI research in the 70s explicitly stated the connection between the two fields. For example, in 1972 computer scientist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank"">Roger Schank</a> wrote that:</p><blockquote><em>We hope to be able to build a program that can learn, as a child does, how to do what we have described in this paper instead of being spoon-fed the tremendous information necessary.</em></blockquote><p>A similar sentiment was expressed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky"">Marvin Minsky</a>, one of the “fathers of AI,” in 1974:</p><blockquote><em>I draw no boundary between a theory of human thinking and a scheme for making an intelligent machine; no purpose would be served by separating these today since neither domain has theories good enough to explain or to produce enough mental capacity.</em></blockquote><p>And it’s not surprising why a child’s mind is so fascinating to an AI researcher: after all, we spend our early days being unable to speak or hold our head up, yet we develop object permanence by five months old, can distinguish our native language from a foreign one by six months, and perform cost-reward analysis by ten months old. And all of that without the massive datasets that systems like GPT, Claude, and Llama require: a modern large language model (LLM) trains on trillions of words, while an average five-year-old is exposed to around 300,000. How can we learn so much from so little, and so fast?</p><p>Both cognitive and computer scientists today mostly agree that intelligence comprises both statistical learning and world model building. But, for reasons I won’t detail here, modern AI research from major industry labs has largely abandoned the question of <em>how</em> children learn so efficiently, focusing instead on <em>whether</em> similar behaviour can be achieved through massive computing power and large training datasets. Still, the original question persists in a new field that has been developing alongside traditional psychology and computer science: computational cognitive science, which continues to ask what artificial intelligence can reveal about the nature of human minds.</p><h3>From machines to minds</h3><p>Despite AI’s origins in the study of human cognition, that connection has all but disappeared from public awareness. Yet while mainstream AI research has pivoted toward achieving human-like behaviour without needing to implement a sophisticated human-like cognitive architecture, a a swiftly developing new field—computational cognitive science — has been figuring out ways to use AI models as windows into human cognition.</p><p>The logic is fairly straightforward: if artificial neural networks are modelled (however loosely) on biological ones, then understanding how an AI system solves a problem could offer clues about how humans solve it too. This approach is sometimes called “reverse-engineering” cognition: build a system that can perform a human task, decipher how it accomplishes that task, then ask whether humans might be doing something similar.</p><p>And so far, the results have been impressive. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"">Since at least GPT-4</a>, LLMs have been able to solve<strong> </strong>difficult tasks across mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology, and more.</p><p>But a few concerns remain. First, AI learns from significantly more data than humans (very few of us can brag that we have read all of Wikipedia). Second, while AI can certainly be impressive, it still often falls short at some basic tasks that require symbolic manipulation.</p><p>For example, Yale University professor <a href=""https://rtmccoy.com/"">Tom McCoy</a> and colleagues <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">found</a> that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with seemingly simple tasks like forming acronyms, decoding shift ciphers, and translating into Pig Latin — tasks that require symbolic manipulation following deterministic rules (e.g., “count the number of words in a list”). What’s revealing is that LLMs performed significantly worse when the correct answer was a low-probability string, even though these tasks have objectively correct, deterministic answers, and require no probabilistic reasoning whatsoever (unlike questions such as “How likely am I to get stuck in traffic at 5pm in central London?” — where statistical patterns are genuinely useful).</p><figure><img alt=""Experimental materials from Tom McCoy and Najoung Kim’s studies"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rAPFwOIs_JSgs9sMlmr0mQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Left: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">McCoy and colleagues found</a> that LLMs struggle with low-probability answers to questions that require a deterministic answer. Right: LLMs can make human-like inferences from adjective-noun pairs, but not for unusual combinations, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">Kim and colleagues report</a></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, when <a href=""https://najoung.kim/"">Najoung Kim</a>, a professor of computational linguistics at Boston University, and her colleagues from Harvard University <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">tested</a> LLMs on their ability to make inferences from adjective-noun combinations (for example, the answer to <em>Is a counterfeit watch still a watch?</em> should be <em>Yes, </em>but the answer to <em>Is a fake doctor still a doctor?</em> should be <em>No</em>) they found that these models struggled with low-probability, unusual combinations such as <em>a homemade cat</em>.</p><p>The takeaway appears simple: AI is extremely good at learning and generalising information, but it is limited by the tasks it was trained on. As McCoy and colleagues conclude in their paper:</p><blockquote><em>We should absolutely recognize [LLMs’] advanced properties. Nonetheless, we should also remember a simpler fact: Language models are… language models! That is, they are statistical next-word prediction systems […] In sum, to understand what language models are, we must understand what we have trained them to be.</em></blockquote><p>At this point, it seems appropriate to ask: is it even possible to study AI models as proxies for the human mind, when their performance is so clearly underpinned by amounts of training data that no human would process in a lifetime, and an architecture that relies primarily on statistical processing?</p><p>Recently, researchers have been trying to solve this problem by introducing additional constraints on how AI systems work: limiting and curating the data they are trained on, and tweaking the architecture to approximate the cognitive biases innate to human mind.</p><p>Researchers from Princeton University’s <a href=""https://lake-lab.github.io/"">Human &amp; Machine Intelligence Lab</a>, directed by <a href=""https://psychology.princeton.edu/people/brenden-lake"">Brenden Lake</a>,<strong> </strong>trained a generic neural network on 61 hours of video footage that came from a head-mounted camera worn by a single child over the course of 1.5 years. The simple architecture of the model allowed the researchers to test a simple theory of word learning: that novel words are learned by tracking co-occurrences of visual and linguistic information. The model tracks visual and linguistic inputs, which are in turn passed through the visual and linguistic encoders, and embedded in a shared vector space. In other words, the model tracks what kind of visual information accompanies verbal cues like “cat” or “toy,” just like a child might.</p><p>And while despite being trained on a tiny dataset — by today’s standards — it worked. When the researchers tested the model on a new set of images, it matched the words it learned during training with the correct visual referents, even though it hadn’t “seen” those specific images before. This finding goes beyond just achieving impressive performance: it provides evidence that word learning in humans could be possible through a general-purpose cognitive mechanism that combines representation and associative learning.</p><figure><img alt=""A toddler wearing a head-mounted camera"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*b5jE9hKC_qBS4dZi"" /><figcaption>“We showed, for the first time, that you can train an AI model to learn words through the eyes and ears of a single child” — Brenden Lake, professor of psychology at Princeton University. Source: <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-camera-wearing-baby-taught-an-ai-to-learn-words/"">Scientific American</a></figcaption></figure><p>This research suggests that the path to understanding the mind (and as a consequence, building better AI) lies in training models on less data, but thinking more carefully about the kinds of cognitive biases they should be imbued with.</p><p>And it clearly aligns with the original mission of AI research. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">The New York Times article</a> covering this research concludes:</p><blockquote><em>For Dr. Lake, and for other investigators like him, these interlocking questions — How humanlike can we make A.I.? What makes us human? — present the most exciting research on the horizon.</em></blockquote><p>But is this approach likely to become prevalent in industry labs that lead the development of state-of-the-art models like GPT? Logically, it should: front loading effort and resources into building more interpretable models now would ensure their longevity (even now, a mere year after the introduction of ChatGPT, many young people are <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wx2dz2v44o"">rejecting what they consider to be “AI slop”</a>). But for commercial labs guided by generating profits and appeasing shareholders, this seems unlikely: why bother spending resources on uncomfortably vague research when increasing computing power and training data have done the trick just fine? The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">same New York Times article</a> points out:</p><blockquote><em>But mainstream industry labs behind the most competent A.I. models, and the companies that make them, have long been geared toward efficiently processing more data, not making more sense out of less.</em></blockquote><p>Academic research labs face a different version of the same problem. While not driven by pure profit motives, coveted funding sources often mean that their research is still more biased towards building more human-like agents — not creating technology for AI-assisted, more thoughtful and creative human. If we continue this way, where will it lead?</p><h3>What happens after AI passes the capitalist Turing test?</h3><p>We have found ourselves at a crossroads. On one hand, we seemingly understand more than ever about how humans think, learn, process visual information, and interact socially. On the other, this knowledge is being channeled almost exclusively toward building better AI chatbots that mimic human behaviour.</p><p>Why? First, because the direction is set by for-profit companies whose ultimate goal isn’t ushering in <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">a new Age of Enlightenment</a>, but selling a product — making us more reliant on AI agents to simplify workflows, optimise routines, delegate tasks. Think less, less, less.</p><p>Second, for that purpose, research that focuses narrowly on pattern recognition and statistical processing does just fine. These systems are straightforward to train and improve, and their performance is impressive enough to sustain public interest and turn in profits. They pass the capitalist Turing test.</p><p>But here’s the trouble: reports of depleting critical thinking and shortening attention spans might just not be fear-mongering, but a direct outcome of systems designed solely for performance. If we spend our thinking time communicating with machines optimised for pattern matching, we might internalise those same patterns to make the interaction more efficient.</p><p>The crux of the matter is that interaction with AI is now <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">predominantly designed to imitate a conversation</a>, and we typically expect our conversational partners to have their own intentions, beliefs, and inner lives. In linguistics, it has been <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~clark/1990s/Brennan,%20S.E.%20_%20Clark,%20H.H.%20_Conceptual%20pacts%20and%20lexical%20choice%20in%20conversation_%201996.pdf"">well</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027799000815?casa_token=yzamMMmozkYAAAAA:7mmmqFEEXyIDV6oItH2TykqHs1s6vDWbfPouY5XksQYC7YCYFqeZl6vDNSUL81WcGnfEUZIIuQk"">documented</a> that during a human-to-human conversation, people adapt to each other’s language patterns to align their mental states and ultimately achieve better communication. But AI has no mental states it can align with ours. It cannot restructure its foundation — built on statistics and patterns — to match our symbolic reasoning. And as a result, instead of AI becoming a thinking companion, <a href=""https://youtu.be/RKK7wGAYP6k?si=c1WKCZUiYzqNzozU"">our own thinking risks becoming more machine-like</a>: fine-tuned to recognise statistical regularities while forgetting how to make inferences, form concepts, find deeper connections between things.</p><p>So… what’s next? This is where things fall apart, because a crucial piece of understanding is missing: we’re still far from fully grasping how concepts are formed, or how symbolic reasoning is actually instantiated in the brain. And without that understanding, we can’t build systems that genuinely complement human intelligence rather than flatten it. In order to get there, three things need to happen:</p><ul><li>Industry research labs need to engage seriously with cognitive science and collaborate with academic researchers. If I’ve made my point clear, artificial intelligence research loses much of its substance when it severs ties with the foundational questions that connected it to philosophy of mind and cognitive development. For progress to be truly significant, these ties must be restored and strengthened.</li><li>AI systems need cognitively plausible architectures. In modern cognitive science, biological plausibility plays a crucial role: if a proposed mechanism is impossible to implement biologically, that casts serious doubt on its validity. The same standard should apply to AI. Researchers need to think carefully about what data models are trained on and why certain architectures are chosen — not just whether they work, but whether they reflect anything meaningful about intelligence.</li><li>Most crucially, software designers and cognitive scientists need to collaborate on how these systems can actually serve humanity. No one else can figure this out — and <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">many designers already agree</a> that <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">chat interfaces are a poor solution</a>.</li></ul><p>There’s a brand of AI optimism that says what you get out of AI depends on how you use it: if you’re filling knowledge gaps rather than taking shortcuts, you’ll unlock creativity and thinking rather than rot your brain on slop.</p><p>I subscribe to this optimism to a degree. As a designer, AI has allowed me to move beyond technical constraints and create more freely.</p><p>But this “solution” is rooted in individualism and, frankly, elitism: the idea that AI will make only the smartest and most discerning among us even brighter and more capable. There’s nothing in that promise about elevating humanity as a whole. Yet research shows that real progress is impossible without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition"">collective intelligence</a>. If AI is to fulfil its promise as a tool for thought — a genuine extension of human capability — it must be designed not just for individual optimisation, but for collective progress.</p><h4><strong>References</strong></h4><p>Turing, A.

<h4><strong>Exploration of the essence of what we do and how we do it</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Photo of mosaic tile decoration depicting eyes. One of them fully open, the other one partly squinted."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jTmH4G75uMi1nmp7"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Jon Tyson</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>It might be a sign of changing of the times and of our industry, it might be a marketing push from the companies betting big on AI. I don’t know. But there seems to be a sort of a urgency for something new. For speed. For freedom. For paving a new path. For simplicity. For flexibility. <strong>A push for something else rather than Design Thinking as the standard design process.</strong></p><p>I am talking about the new wave of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-return-of-the-intuitive-designer-in-the-age-of-ai-6f0ea728d1d0"">intuitive design</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM&amp;t=864s"">not trusting the design process</a>, of taste and craft as the only ways to do exceptional design, of <a href=""https://x.com/ryolu_/status/2000557301695226265"">jumping straight into code / material</a>. While some parts of those ideas resonate, not all of us are positioned or experienced to do that. Also, processes exist for a reason — usually to make sure we take our users into account, to avoid blindspots, to be sure we are solving the right problem and to meet high bars of quality.</p><p>Before coming across as a big saviour / defender of Design Thinking, I need to come clean: I think we often fall into the trap of wrapping design in bloated processes, frameworks, and mystical terminology, producing unnecessary artefacts and wasting time along the way. And I think that design doing is equally important as the design thinking part.</p><p>So what is my thesis here?</p><p><strong>We need to go back to what’s <em>essential</em> and what’s <em>natural</em>.</strong></p><h4>In pursuit of the essence</h4><p>In my first attempt to shape my perspective, I wrote a think piece on the <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions and Answers of design</a>. It’s basically a snapshot of design as I know it and practice, outside of methodologies and tools.</p><p>Even though I believe the article still makes sense, I started questioning my thinking. Can it be simpler? Can it be shorter? Can it be more natural and stripped down to the essence?</p><p>If you strip it down, I started to see the design process as two simple steps:</p><p><strong>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Open your eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>— — Squint your eyes.</strong></p><p>We all do these steps already, with or without realising it. With or without Design Thinking.</p><h4>Huh?</h4><p>Maybe I simplified it way too much. Sometimes I can err in the other direction — making things too abstract.</p><p>This is what I mean:</p><p><strong>Open your eyes to get information. Squint your eyes for focus.</strong></p><p><em>When your eyes are open</em>, you observe. You look around. You absorb. You listen. You think. You notice things you’d otherwise miss — the way people use a product, the frustrations in their tone, something beautiful that inspires a new direction, a design pattern that solves your problem. You are in consuming mode and in a pursuit for new information and perspectives. You are in search for inspiration, references, sparks for your ideas. Along the way, you might become an expert in something and you will start to empathise with your users.</p><p><em>When you squint your eyes</em>, you focus. You tune out the noise and work with what you’ve gathered. You sketch, you build, you make decisions. You bring something into being. You roll up your sleeves and produce with this newfound focus, clarity and intention. The background gets blurry and you just create. Time also gets blurry, you are in the flow and designs materialise.</p><p>That’s how the eyes work. That’s how the mind works — expanding and present when immersed into something new, focused on execution and on auto pilot once having all information. <a href=""https://www.nikon.nl/nl_NL/learn-and-explore/magazine/tips-and-tricks/what-is-aperture?srsltid=AfmBOor-FBxrbfqFoy56R6qsVvcZZDv_3AsIXYyZMh7-_j3SNNo49iFd"">Even cameras work this way </a>— wide open to take in light and to focus all the way up to the horizon in the distance, then tightened up to sharpen focus and capture the detail in front of the lens. It’s the natural way of seeing, thinking, and doing.</p><h4>In practice</h4><p>You can open and squint your eyes as many times as you like to or need to. Just don’t do it at the same time. That’s call winking. Or multitasking. Both are quite useless while designing.</p><p>Here’s an example of how this “process” might work:</p><ol><li><strong>Open your eyes</strong> → absorb, get inspired, ask questions, explore.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → focus, design, make, refine.</li><li><strong>Open again</strong> → test, show, share, watch reactions.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → polish, detail, finalise.</li></ol><p>Repeat until something good emerges. Add activities that you need at the moment.</p><p>At the end, or in between: <strong>fully close your eyes</strong> → <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/rest-why-it-is-important-for-designers-66b539a7c5dd"">rest</a>, let ideas simmer, gain distance. Also a natural and essential part of the process.</p><h4>Zoom out</h4><p>Zooming out (or while squinting your eyes) you might see double diamonds in the eye picture above. You might also see the concepts of diverge &amp; converge. Your eyes might be seeing right.</p><p>We might be back to square (or diamond) one. But we are free and back to our nature. We know why we do what we do and do it with confidence. We block out the noise.</p><p>We don’t need to kill the Double Diamond, but we can admit it’s just a dressed-up version of something our brains already know how to do. The danger with process-heavy design thinking is that it can become an end in itself. Design becomes the artefacts <em>about</em> design, rather than the <em>design itself</em>. We need to be careful about that, while respecting and following a <em>natural</em> process, with the necessary steps and activities for our problem and users.</p><p>The next time you’re overthinking your process, just remember: open your eyes, squint your eyes. The rest is abstraction and decoration.</p><p>And don’t forget to fully close your eyes from time to time. The best ideas come after some good rest and distance. Practice it now… closing in 3, 2, 1.</p><p><strong>References and extra resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions, 1000 Answers</a></li><li><a href=""https://arnevanoosterom.medium.com/design-thinking-is-dead-again-e48bb1b17b7c"">Design Thinking is dead... again</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@Tirdad/design-thinking-is-not-dead-but-are-we-extracting-its-full-potential-85342d291bea"">Design thinking is not dead, but are we extracting its full potential?</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@tufred/design-thinking-is-dead-or-not-d151376ab9ce"">Design Thinking Is Dead.

He brought up the news that OpenAI recently announced that it would begin testing ads in the free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the U.S., with the promises that ads will be clearly labeled &amp; won’t influence answers.¹ ² We’ve both fought against needless promotional content before and lamented that frontier AI platforms are falling into the same pattern. As designers and users, we’ve learned that “free” usually means putting up with interruptive, slightly creepy ads that feel more like a tax than a benefit — a frustration tax that now colors how we approach free‑tier services and now AI tools. However, we started chatting through it a bit more and explored whether there might actually be some good that can come out of it.</p><p>While advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risk frustrating users &amp; harming brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to replace the traditional “sponsored” tag with promotional features that genuinely enhance the utility of threads &amp; responses — instead of undermining them. Before exploring how digital ads might actually do this, I want to briefly revisit how ads evolved on TV and YouTube, then look at the unique opportunities frontier AI platforms have, and finally ground it in a simple electrician problem to show how ads could enhance an AI chat thread.</p><h4>New platform, same commercial</h4><p>Billboards, cable TV commercials, and radio ads typically felt like a jarring distraction — pulling me out of driving, the show I was watching, or the song I was listening to. Further, the commercials themselves were usually irrelevant to whatever I was interested in. But since ads were less targeted to specific demographics on TV (aside from channels that entertained a certain subject like Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, or TV Land, etc.), it made sense that you would see a variety of advertisements ranging from uplifting prescription drug commercials to wacky toy ads for kids. And I remember feeling frustrated when I started seeing that same pattern begin on YouTube as though TV commercials were now coming to this new platform.</p><p>YouTube used to feel like a ‘free expression’ platform for anyone &amp; everyone to make videos on the internet. It gave people the means to show off talented, creative, strange, and hilarious content that we used to expect from YouTube. Even though ads came onto the scene just a year later, YouTube’s CEO Chad Hurley put his ad approach this way:</p><blockquote>We think there are better ways for people to engage with brands than forcing them to watch a commercial before seeing content. You could ask anyone on the net if they enjoy that experience and they’d probably say no. <br /> — <em>Chad Hurley ³</em></blockquote><p>But when YouTube was acquired by Google, ads started to function like commercials on TV by the end of 2007, confirming my worry. While they were annoying, they were at least short, skippable, and rarely shown.⁴ Today, however, ads can last over 90 seconds if the user allows it, becoming a <em>de facto</em> commercial break. Free-tier users pay a ‘price’ too, since ad-breaks have a cool-down timer before having the choice to skip.</p><p>But YouTube ads felt more targeted, which was both helpful &amp; creepy at times. If I started watching skateboarding videos, I might see advertisements for things skaters are interested in: skate decks, certain clothing brands, and <em>X-Games</em> announcements. With data sharing more broadly, I’d start seeing ads based on things I searched for online or just after I made an online purchase for a similar item. Still, it was better in a sense and more dialed in to relevant audiences than traditional TV or radio commercials.</p><p>All of this has taught us to expect that “free‑tier” experience means interruptive, slightly creepy, and rarely on our terms. That’s the mental model users will bring to free‑tier plans with ads in AI tools, and it functions like a frustration tax: <em>free </em>feels less like a gift and more like a tax you pay by waiting to actually use the product. The opportunity for frontier AI is to break that pattern by making promotional content feel like a feature that even paid‑tier accounts may want to keep, so paid plans can focus on adding capabilities rather than simply removing frustration taxes.</p><h4>Strengths of the AI pioneer</h4><p>Shifting over to ChatGPT and other frontier AI platforms, the obvious risk is that ads will simply adopt the same look &amp; feel they have on search engines — specifically those “sponsored” results at the top of the page — but these tools are capable of much more than that. While I don’t have the exact data in front of me, I often wonder how frequently people scroll past those sponsored results to reach the first organic link and how often accidental clicks leave them feeling misled instead of helped. One recent roundup of digital ad research found that around 86% of users report banner blindness (effectively ignoring banner‑like advertising) and that average banner engagement rates hover around 0.06%.⁵</p><p>If frontier AI platforms adopt a similar pattern, I imagine the analytics data won’t change much. However, these platforms aren’t doing the same things as search engines are either — they do a lot more, of course. They’re great at synthesizing content from a variety of sources based on the content of the user’s prompt. And they’re quickly doing more.</p><p>Advertisements can also be better with AI platforms. If search engines, YouTube, and other digital platforms can have targeted ads just based on what’s known about the user’s interests, they can do all the more with a conversational AI-chat thread. Even a basic prompt contains far more data than a general search query, and users are far more likely to write in natural language to AI platforms than to traditional search boxes. This can include nuanced details, context, and specificity that wasn’t as easy to do with a search engine — even with advanced search tools. Further, AI removes the need to scan through each individual webpage because of synthesized responses and linking to the sources, allowing us to verify content.</p><h4>Discovering marketed electricity</h4><p>A month or so ago, several outlets in our kitchen stopped working after a GFCI outlet tripped, and a quick do-it-yourself (DIY) attempt led to a small spark behind the outlet. At that point, the problem moved from <em>easy DIY project</em> to <em>I need a reputable professional who won’t overcharge me</em>. So imagine I turn to an AI assistant and type something like:</p><blockquote>I have three outlets that went out in our kitchen. I replaced a GFCI outlet, but when I pulled it back out to check the wiring I saw a small spark behind the outlet. I’m comfortable with basic DIY, but I don’t want to risk an electrical fire or make the problem worse. I’m looking for an electrician near me who is thorough, is transparent about pricing, and won’t pressure me into unnecessary work. Give me a few options and explain which one you’d choose for this situation.</blockquote><p>This is a solid example of the kind of urgent, high‑anxiety scenarios where ads could either quietly undermine trust or actually help. To illustrate this further, I’m treating my electrical experience as a small case study, exploring what happens if we replace the “sponsored” tag on a search result with richer promotional features like coupons, adjacent follow-up answers, and a contextual panel that doesn’t distract from the main thread so much.</p><p>So, how might ads be smartly introduced from a prompt like this? Well, maybe there are a few ways. First, imagine a fairly conventional AI response: a ranked list of three electricians with one of them tagged “Sponsored.”</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot mock of an AI chat response listing three electricians in a vertical comparison, with one option marked by a small ‘Sponsored’ tag, illustrating the default search-style ad pattern."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*XRKhqWoRxsWNgaDi0cu_HA.png"" /><figcaption>Conventional AI response: a comparison list of electricians with a tiny “Sponsored” tag.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the default pattern we’ve inherited from search. It technically discloses the ad, but it also quietly introduces doubt for the whole recommendation: am I getting the best fit for my needs or just the company with the highest advertising budget?</p><p>In my actual experience, my AI thread included a local map view with some content cards for each electrical company in my area. Let’s build on that, using content cards as our starting point, and ask a few ‘what ifs’:</p><ul><li>What if the promoted company showed an accurate cost of the exact service I need, based on what other customers actually paid?</li><li>What if there were coupons, discounts, or perks that directly benefit me for choosing that particular business?</li><li>What if some of the “sponsored” content complimented what I was asking about, like payment plans or DIY tutorials?</li></ul><p>Now compare that conventional AI response to one that uses thoughtfully integrated ads: the same electricians but with richer promotional features with a contextual panel that’s noninvasive to the main chat thread.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock AI response showing three electrician cards side by side, each with price, reviews, a short description, and buttons for actions like ‘Read reviews’ and ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ illustrating a richer sponsored card layout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*Q9WcYea2yv8d2gceOu2M6w.png"" /><figcaption>Smartly integrated ad cards with costs, perks, and follow‑up CTAs.</figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, this card layout is doing a few specific things. First, I kept the familiar basics — company name, review rating, a link to the website, a call-to-action (CTA) to get in touch, and a short description. Second, the information is grouped by kind: company name, description &amp; website link; cost, reviews, and a link to the full verbatims; and, promotional perk with a CTA for the next step in the user journey.</p><figure><img alt=""Close-up of a single electrician card showing company name, star rating, description, price, cost explanation, and action buttons stacked together, demonstrating information grouping within the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4f2VaxhBFG_jZ60QMbJ-cA.png"" /><figcaption>Electrician card layout with grouped details for one company.</figcaption></figure><p>Where it begins to differ is in the cost row: instead of a vague price range, the card shows the specific amount customers reported paying for the service I’m asking about, plus a link to the reviews that mention the prices. That turns the “ad” element into a reasonable expectation, not just a badge.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of the price section on an electrician card, with a bold dollar amount and a line explaining that the cost is based on similar customer reviews, plus a link to detailed reviews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Mi_H53mh0PEXi-WeGfj2g.png"" /><figcaption>Cost row highlighting typical customer‑reported price and linked reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also an emphasized coupon or perk label, providing another incentive that directly benefits the user, much like scouting through <em>RetailMeNot</em> or <em>Groupon</em> for a promo code. The difference is the value is surfaced in context, before you ever hit a checkout page.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of an electrician card showing a ‘Free inspection coupon’ badge next to the action buttons, representing a user-benefiting promotional perk embedded in the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z1ZPnOWDHTT6AuaSTSmwQg.png"" /><figcaption>Sponsored perk: a clearly labeled coupon for a free inspection.</figcaption></figure><p>Last, sponsored content can come from an information scent by labeling actions in the user’s own language (“Reliable DIY tutorials,” “Electricians with payment plans,” etc.), making them feel like relevant next steps rather than distractions. Together, these tweaks improve the overall signal‑to‑noise ratio by making sure every promotional element either clarifies incentives or opens a relevant, optional path you might actually want to take.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock of three pill-shaped buttons beneath the main electrician recommendation labeled ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ ‘Electricians with payment plans,’ and ‘Reliable DIY tutorials,’ showing opt‑in sub‑search routes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-joPf8gZZKPSZrqVr_lEZA.png"" /><figcaption>Optional CTAs launching focused sub‑threads for costs, payment plans, and DIY.</figcaption></figure><p>Each predetermined CTA launches a focused sub‑thread where the AI can surface related, sponsored resources without hijacking the main topic. This is where the thoughtfully-integrated ad pattern really shows up: the promotion lives in a side‑path the user chooses, rather than shoehorned into the main thread.</p><figure><img alt=""AI response displaying a list of DIY electrical resources — video, article, and blog cards — with short descriptions and ‘Add to thread’ or ‘Watch now’ buttons, illustrating a sponsored side-thread of helpful content."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*E2x93DDHTJNlP9iG5Oz00A.png"" /><figcaption>DIY tutorial thread with sponsored videos, articles, and blogs the user can add to the chat.</figcaption></figure><p>For the overall layout, all of this can be contained in a contextual, right‑aligned panel that curbs banner blindness by keeping the promotional content inside a dedicated space rather than cluttering the chat or page margins. It’s still promotional, but will compliment the user’s thread instead of interrupting the train of thought with noise or other frustration taxes.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-page mockup of an AI chat interface with the conversation on the left and a right-aligned ‘Thread insights’ panel on the right containing electrician cards, costs, and action buttons, demonstrating a dedicated ad space that updates with the thread."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*szASXnWFl8Jdcd3XRWak1w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Contextual right‑hand panel showing electrician cards and insights alongside the main thread.</figcaption></figure><p>Cards with all the ad-types are most likely the ‘maximal’ version for a high‑stakes case, but even one or two of these ideas would give users a real sense of reciprocity &amp; incentive to interact with the advertised perks. Companies willing to pay for ad space could compromise by allowing more transparency by showing the specific average amount customers paid, reciprocity by offering concrete perks &amp; coupons, or autonomy by sponsoring alternative solutions like DIY content for their questions.</p><p>Compared to the tiny “sponsored” tag next to <em>BrightSpark Electrical</em> in the conventional AI response, these cards make the advertising work more for the users. The promoted content is still promotional, but it’s packaged utility in the form of transparent costs, valuable perks, and alternative solutions. Consequently, it’s more likely users will actually engage with it, instead of tuning out the noise or being suspicious of it.</p><h4>Mapping out the new frontier</h4><p>Free‑tier AI platforms with ads don’t have to inherit the same frustration tax we’ve learned from YouTube commercials and sponsored search results. The electrician example is small, but it shows how promotional content can be reshaped into something that actually helps in a stressful, high‑stakes situation.</p><p>Structurally, the move is simple: treat ads as enhancing features, not just paid recommendations. Thoughtfully-integrated ads in content cards, sub-threads offering alternative solutions, and dedicated layouts that compliment the main thread give advertised content visibility while simultaneously benefitting the user. At their best, these patterns also line up with the UX virtues I’ve hinted at earlier &amp; argued for elsewhere: <em>transparent </em>content from promoted businesses, <em>reciprocity</em> in the form of perks &amp; discounts, and preserving user <em>autonomy </em>by allowing the user to choose alternative paths — while also removing frustration taxes.⁶</p><p>As more frontier AI platforms roll out free‑tier plans with ads, the real question isn’t whether to show ads at all, but which patterns we normalize. Do we copy the suspicious “sponsored” tag &amp; hope users still engage with it, or invest in thoughtful experiences that users would miss if premium plans removed them? Now is the moment to decide which pattern AI platforms ship.</p><h3>References</h3><p>[1] Simo, Fidji. “Our Approach to Advertising and Expanding Access to ChatGPT.” <em>OpenAI</em>.

<h4>The path to designing for AI is in questioning the fundamentals of what design stands for</h4><figure><img alt=""A designer shedding the past design artifacts and embracing the future of emerging tech"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1020/1*LE0BFPSuq6HxhmN7zt2pAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><p>I admire artists and industrial designers who challenge assumptions. Ross Lovegrove is one of them. If you’ve never heard of him, he is one of the most visionary creators in the world, and designs all sorts of devices, including door handles, computers, fragrance bottles, and concept cars.</p><p><a href=""https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/ross-lovegrove-on-working-with-ai""><strong>In an article in the popular design magazine Wallpaper</strong></a>, he claims that the potential of working with AI is utopian. That says a lot coming from someone considered by many as a futurist.</p><p>Lovegrove admits that most people in his generation, including design leaders, are skeptical of AI’s use in design. He doesn’t belong to that group, as he says that “AI is complementary, like having a conversation with a very intelligent friend.” He even built a Carrara marble sculpture in collaboration with a robot!</p><p>After reading Lovegrove’s take on AI, I asked myself: Are design leaders prepared for this new AI era? Or, more precisely, what do they need to unlearn to stay relevant and lead their teams in a world where AI is reshaping how we create?</p><p>Here’s what I’m unlearning, and what I think other design leaders should consider letting go of too.</p><h4>#1. “AI enablement is (just) a tooling decision”</h4><figure><img alt=""Chart showing AI code-generation success rates for novices and experts. Novices show 79% success, while experts show 90% success. Purple represents success and orange represents failure, displayed over a background of a person viewing multiple computer screens."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_B-jLlsLe5dcH5q-4u4JYg.png"" /></figure><p>This might be a hard pill to swallow for some design leaders and any business leaders in general.</p><p>Before we entered what we now call an AI-first world, AI felt like a frontier that was approaching slowly. Leaders could afford to experiment, pilot a few tools, let teams test them out, see what stuck… It was like a free buffet where everyone could try the new shiny thing without much risk.</p><p>The problem now is how your team uses it, because the consequences of this free-for-all approach can be the opposite of what you expect: AI tools expose the talent gap in your team.</p><p>A 2025 study titled<strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.21890v1""><strong>Not Everyone Wins with LLMs: Behavioral Patterns and Pedagogical Implications in AI-assisted Data Analysis</strong></a>, sheds some light on this. In it, researchers tracked 36 students as they used an LLM to complete programming and data analysis tasks. Everyone had equal access to the same AI tools.</p><p>The study found that students with strong data &amp; coding foundations used AI to extend their thinking, explore alternatives, and debug more quickly. Those with weaker fundamentals often copy pasted outputs, misread results, or got overwhelmed by verbose explanations.</p><p>Now extrapolate this to your design team. If you just democratize the use of AI without paying attention to core fundamentals like systems thinking, experimentation, and evaluating AI output, your best performers will become even better at their craft, but junior designers may fall behind and become too dependent on AI.</p><p>Choosing the right tools is still and will remain relevant for years to come, but it’s equally important to build capability from the ground up so your team can use AI to extend their thinking. Today, AI enablement is a talent strategy decision.</p><h4>#2. “Designers (only) design interfaces, researchers (only) provide insights”</h4><p>There was a time when a designer had a very specific role, and so did researchers. And it was easy to assign them tasks, goals, and projects because everything worked like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>AI has changed the way we box these positions in. Can we already say we are on the verge of seeing more hybrid roles in design teams? J.M. Downey, Director of Design Strategy &amp; Research at AT&amp;T, thinks so.</p><p>Downey is one of the design leadership voices interviewed in the 2025 report<strong> </strong><a href=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b848447e935c9f1f8e6ec5/68357bcd7d7740446815dbba_The%20AI%20Shift.pdf""><strong>The AI Shift: Transforming How We Discover, Imagine, and Design</strong></a>, conducted by the Design Executive Council (DXC). He sees his team as design strategists as much as he sees them as researchers. “That’s the future of this discipline,” he claims.</p><p>Most leaders interviewed for DXC’s report agreed that the old boundaries between design and research no longer work. For example, Dave Brown, who leads design for AI services at Amazon Web Services, says, “Design and research now need to look across the whole stack.” He’s talking about understanding how data flows, how models make decisions, and how those decisions show up in the user experience.</p><p>My perspective aligns with what they all say. Design leaders must adapt to what’s coming and upskill their teams for new challenges. Your designer needs to understand what the AI is optimizing for, why it’s making certain recommendations, and how to design friction when users need transparency or control. Your researcher can’t just deliver insights and walk away. They need to shape how those insights get embedded into product decisions, AI training, and business strategy.</p><p>An AI-first world demands strategic builders. Your team needs them, starting with yourself.</p><h4>#3. “Polish, craft, and aesthetics are what make design good”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistics showing 52% of respondents believe design is more important in AI-powered products than in traditional digital products, displayed over a background of a person sketching an interface on a tablet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cENQNgrjZtPySAfi9nmTKQ.png"" /></figure><p>When you read this headline, it might sound like an oversimplification. I’m not arguing that design leaders have ever cared only about how a product looks, but I do include myself among those who have, at times, over-indexed on polished prototypes, pixel-perfect interfaces, and visual refinement as proxies for quality.</p><p>In AI-powered products, that definition of quality isn’t enough. Designing with AI introduces additional layers of responsibility and complexity. Beyond aesthetics and usability, which remain essential, quality now also includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Trust:</strong> Can users rely on the system’s outputs over time?</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Do users understand why the system made a recommendation or took an action?</li><li><strong>Graceful degradation:</strong> Does the product communicate uncertainty and fail safely when it doesn’t know something, rather than confidently producing wrong results?</li></ul><p>In this context, a visually polished interface can mask deeper issues: unreliable outputs, opaque decision-making, brittle behavior at the edges… Design leaders must therefore stop measuring quality just by surface-level polish and instead treat trust, clarity, and reliability as first-class design outcomes.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/599r6htc/regionalized/d4e0b1140b4d4d32c004e442bdb3e9f136fd3657.pdf""><strong>Figma’s 2025 AI Report</strong></a>, more than half of designers and AI builders believe design has become more important for AI-powered products, precisely because users now depend on design to interpret, evaluate, and trust intelligent systems.</p><p>For the design leaders of the future, great design will be defined by how confidently users can understand a system and rely on it in real-world conditions.</p><h4>#4. “Speed equals progress”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistic showing 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, displayed over a background of a computer screen with AI interface windows and connected data elements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HXZAT1UYCqpYw8qJ-Tq4Rg.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve heard many times in my career things like “moving faster is always the right move” or “if we ship faster, we win.” Well, these assumptions may be wrong today. Although I agree that for certain companies, especially startups, speed is a virtue, for the most part, we should stay vigilant when hearing such claims.</p><p>There’s one thing we all love about AI: it makes us faster. It can accelerate good work, there’s no doubt about it, but it can also accelerate mistakes. I recently read an article in <a href=""https://www.cio.com/article/4076280/why-ai-initiatives-fail-the-costly-mistakes-it-leaders-make-and-how-you-can-avoid-them.html""><strong>CIO magazine</strong></a> on why AI initiatives fail, and one of the reasons mentioned was, indeed, ‘rushed pilots.’</p><p>Often, when pressured by stakeholders, business leaders may feel the need to deploy products without clear goals or proper processes, just to release them as quickly as possible. And design teams fall into the trap, mistaking speed and novelty for progress.</p><p>As per the <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/""><strong>State of AI in Design Report 2025</strong></a>, 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow in some way. Your team may already be benefiting from this. They are more productive, and you get tangible results. Everything works faster, and everyone’s celebrating that. But is the work truly <em>better</em>?</p><p>The best design leaders know when to slow down, validate, and ensure that what they’re building is worth shipping.</p><h4>Closing thoughts</h4><p>One day, not too far away, we won’t talk about an “AI-first world”, just <em>our </em>world, much like we no longer say we’re in an “Internet-driven world”. AI will be embedded in everything, just as the internet is now.</p><p>Until then, design leaders have time to build and, apologies for the redundancy, ‘design’ this new reality. That means unlearning some of the universal truths we all took as sacred, as set in stone.</p><p><strong><em>Want to see how we’re putting these principles into practice?

<h4>AI assistants don’t have to communicate in paragraphs. They can communicate through interfaces.</h4><figure><img alt=""A paper cutout illustration showing an AI assistant chat interface on the left connected to a design system library on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ec6csH34-8uaTEWIkXZ6Gg.png"" /><figcaption>Generated using Google Gemini</figcaption></figure><p>LLMs have made AI assistants a standard feature across SaaS. AI assistants allow users to instantly retrieve information and interact with a system through text-based prompts. Mathias Biilmann, in his article “<a href=""https://biilmann.blog/articles/introducing-ax/"">Introducing AX: Why Agent Experience Matters</a>,” discusses two distinct approaches to building AI assistants. The Closed Approach involves a conversational assistant embedded directly within a single SaaS product. Examples include Zoom’s AI Companion, Salesforce CRM’s Einstein, and Microsoft’s Copilot. The Open Approach involves external conversational assistants, such as Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, which are being supercharged via protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). This protocol allows the AI assistants to connect to and interact with various third-party SaaS products, effectively making a company’s product accessible to external assistants and agents.</p><h3>The risk of commoditization</h3><p>Both approaches are powerful. They offer users flexibility they’ve never had. However, they also reduce the carefully crafted user experience to a purely text-based interface. When the interaction is text-only and detached from your product, the user experience is no longer a differentiator, and your <a href=""https://www.pragmaticcoders.com/blog/saas-is-dead-how-ai-agents-reduced-saas-to-just-an-api"">product is at risk of becoming a commodity</a>.</p><p>Text-only interfaces also limit interactions to simple information retrieval and basic CRUD operations, making complex workflows difficult. This <a href=""https://artium.ai/insights/beyond-chat-how-ai-is-transforming-ui-design-patterns"">creates limitations</a> as users attempt to consume large amounts of information and execute complex operations solely through text prompts. Andrej Karpathy, in his recent piece<a href=""https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/""> 2025 LLM Year in Review</a>, noted that while text is the favored format for computers and LLMs, it is not for humans. We humans prefer information visually. Similarly, Maximillian Piras in 2024, argued that <a href=""https://uxmag.com/articles/when-words-cannot-describe-designing-for-ai-beyond-conversational-interfaces"">chat is often a poor fit for complex interaction patterns</a>.</p><h3>The temptation of generative UI</h3><p>One answer gaining traction is generative UI where the AI autonomously creates interfaces based on the user’s prompts. While this capability is likely to improve significantly, it also presents a risk of delivering generic experiences. Without designer input, AI-generated UX defaults to the generic average of its training data. Every product starts looking the same. There is no differentiation. Dorian Tireli describes how <a href=""https://poplab.io/commoditization-saas-design-ai/"">AI is reinforcing mediocrity</a> due to training data coming from common design platforms that are optimized for visual appeal.</p><h3>The case for design system integration</h3><p>As a result, we need to examine an alternate approach, one where the AI assistants have knowledge of a product’s unique design system — its components, patterns, and guidelines. Any time the user prompts, instead of displaying text blocks and paragraphs, what if the assistant could render rich interfaces supplied by the product’s design system? This transforms the chat from a static text box into a dynamic viewport with rich interactive elements. The <a href=""https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/"">latest developments</a> in the MCP protocol are making this approach possible.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow diagram showing a user prompting the AI assistant which then communicates with the Design System that returns a UI component. The UI component is then rendered to the user as a response."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/714/1*jRw1B92fdpVGV7Tw_D_DLA.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma</figcaption></figure><h3>Three modes for richer AI experiences</h3><p>To create richer and differentiated experiences, I have considered three different design modes that can help us move beyond the text-trap.</p><h4>Mode 1: Rich output</h4><p>In complex business applications, users consume data, not just answers. Large blocks of text create cognitive load. The challenge is to move beyond text and towards a richer UI output. For example, when a user prompts “Merge the two John Smith records flagged yesterday,” the AI doesn’t ask “Which one should be primary?” Instead, it displays two contact cards side-by-side with metadata, enabling the user to make a decision through the UI. This approach maximizes scannability and allows the user to instantly grasp the situation and prioritize follow-up.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying two contact cards for the user to choose between using visual cues."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*M0bgD1X-TCn5hFBfSC4coQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><h4>Mode 2: UI as input</h4><p>The differentiated experience must start at the point of input, not just output. Rather than forcing users to craft precise text prompts and requiring them to know the exact parameters to provide, imagine if the AI assistant could replace the text box with a structured input component. For example, when a user wants to retrieve a record, instead of typing “Show me California leads with high activity” and then requiring the user to re-prompt every time they want to add more parameters, the AI assistant simply displays a query builder.</p><figure><img alt=""AI assistant displaying a filter UI, making it easier for the user to choose parameters as opposed to having to type a detailed query."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*qXe8NrqwVlPjifV34woP3g.png"" /><figcaption>Designed using Figma Make</figcaption></figure><p>This shift from text to high-fidelity input removes ambiguity, reduces back-and-forth, and makes the overall interaction faster and more precise.</p><h4>Mode 3: Co-creation</h4><p>Modes 1 and 2 represent single interactions. But real-world scenarios are rarely this simple. In SaaS applications, high-value tasks are multi-step workflows. Creating a marketing automation campaign. Building a complex report. Configuring an integration. These aren’t things you accomplish in one prompt, rather they unfold over a conversation where the user and AI assistant refine the work together.</p><p>To support this, the AI assistant needs to become more than a responder. <strong>It needs to become a workspace.</strong></p><p>Let’s see how this plays out through a single scenario: a user creating a marketing automation campaign. The user prompts: “Create a campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet.” The AI responds by rendering a flow builder component showing a draft campaign.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a flow generated by the AI assistant based on the user’s prompt. The user asked the AI assistant to create campaign for trial users who haven’t activated yet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pJjd37QJ5eFZNFj_L8ektA.png"" /><figcaption>Made using Figma</figcaption></figure><p>From here, <strong>four capabilities</strong> transform a back-and-forth conversation into a co-creation model.</p><p><strong>Fluid modality switching<br /></strong>When the user wants to update a block, they shouldn’t be forced back to the text prompt. The AI assistant should allow users to move fluidly between text and direct manipulation. For example, rather than prompting “change the wait time to 5 days,” the user simply adjusts the wait component directly in the flow builder. The AI validates the change and updates dependent elements automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the flow components rendered by the AI assistant. The user directly interacts with the UI elements and updates the flow as opposed to asking the AI assistant to make changes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3W3npKqeOz42lXXqZf1JNw.png"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Proactive cross-tool suggestions<br /></strong>Complex workflows often span multiple tools and users need information from various sources to take better decisions. Rather than forcing the user to start a new conversation or open a new tab, the AI assistant can bring data from connected tools directly into the workflow. Better yet, it can surface insights proactively.</p><p>In our example, once the flow has been created, the AI notices that most unactivated users are on mobile, while the email templates are desktop-focused. Without being prompted, it pulls usage data from the connected analytics tool and surfaces a brief insight within the flow builder: “68% of your unactivated trial users are on mobile, but your email templates aren’t mobile-optimized.”</p><figure><img alt=""The GIF shows the AI assistant proactively displaying insights from relevant tools and sources. As the user is updating the flow, the AI assistant pulls data from an analytics tool and informs that user that most of the unactivated users are on mobile whereas all the email templates in the flow are web based."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8GVVr2klWv6iLVqViVYPWg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Created using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>For this to work, the AI assistant needs the right level of access to the data. But access alone isn’t enough. The judgment layer needs to be designed to know when an insight is worth surfacing and when silence is the better choice.</p><p><strong>Delegation of discrete subtasks<br /></strong>At some point in a multi-step workflow, the user may want to hand off a contained piece of work entirely. Based on the mobile optimization insight, the user prompts the AI assistant to update the template. The AI assistant then takes on the content work while the user continues refining the campaign’s structural logic. When ready, the AI surfaces the updated template for review. This is <strong>co-creation as division of labor</strong>, not just turn-taking.</p><figure><img alt=""Once the user accepts the AI assistant’s recommendation, the assistant goes to work on this sub-task while the user can continue to do their work. The assistant keeps the user informed on the progress and the user can take an informed decision."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ggzbqGj4XsiUp5r3gbaJgQ.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Contextually refine with text<br /></strong> The text-based input doesn’t have to live in the prompt box — it can be contextual to the UI elements. For example, the user hovers over a connector in the flow and prompts, “Send a survey asking about their biggest challenge, then route them to different content tracks based on their answer.” In response, the AI inserts a new survey block before the final reminder email block, creates conditional branches based on common responses, and shows the multi-path workflow.</p><p>Because the prompt was anchored to a specific component rather than being in the generic prompt box, the AI understands where in the workflow the user is acting, not just what they’re saying. The library, Shape of AI by Emily Campbell highlights <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/patterns/inline-action"">Inline action</a> as way for user to adjust or respond to a small part of a larger piece of content.</p><figure><img alt=""This image shows the user prompting the AI assistant in context of the UI. The user clicks one of the nodes in the flow and asks the AI assistant to update the flow."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_q961WZJ3qbWUVUl5VF_Sg.gif"" /><figcaption>(Made using Figma and Figma Make)</figcaption></figure><p>In Mode 3, rather than forcing users into turn-by-turn conversations, the AI assistant becomes an added modality for the product’s experience. It holds context across tools so the user doesn’t have to. It creates <strong>a shared workspace for co-creation</strong> so the user and AI assistant can work together.</p><h3>The craft hasn’t changed</h3><p>While designing for AI assistants and AI agents may sound daunting at first, the good news is that the <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-design-skills/"">skills required to succeed aren’t novel</a>. They’re the same fundamentals that have always distinguished exceptional designers.</p><p>You need a deep understanding of users and jobs-to-be-done to identify which tasks actually benefit from conversational AI. Systems thinking is quickly becoming one of the most important skills as highlighted in these articles from <a href=""https://www.salesforce.com/blog/ai-jobs-to-be-done-designers/#h-five-ways-design-work-is-shifting-and-how-to-respond"">Salesforce</a> and <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/six-human-skills-that-will-future-proof-your-design-career"">Adobe</a>. You need systems thinking, because these assistants cross boundaries, within your product’s IA and beyond it into other tools. And you need technical literacy: data models, APIs, backend logic. When users can query any data the system touches, you’d better understand what that data looks like.</p><p>AI assistants and agents are only going to keep increasing. The question isn’t whether your product will have one, it’s whether the experience will be differentiated or commoditized.</p><p>The text-trap is real, but it’s not inevitable.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7035bbc4aaa5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ais-text-trap-moving-towards-a-more-interactive-future-7035bbc4aaa5"">AI’s text-trap: Moving towards a more interactive future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
