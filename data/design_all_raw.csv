<h4>Why clear, strategic writing is more critical than ever.</h4><figure><img alt=""An outline of a pencil surrounded by AI icons that look like stars."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSQy65QWDjIgpqyXRWkEFw.png"" /></figure><p>If you’ve used an AI product recently, you probably know that the technology is incredible. The UX? Not so much.</p><p>Maybe you’ve gotten comfortable writing prompts or using simple one-click tools. But as AI interfaces start to take different forms, many of them are still kinda hard to figure out. Navigating them can be overwhelming. It doesn’t feel like you’re <em>using</em> these products so much as <em>deciphering</em> them. The engineering is powerful, but the flows don’t make sense.</p><p>If you’re lost in an AI user flow, blame the writing.</p><p>Lots of these tools use unclear labeling, make phony promises, or simply cram interfaces with vague, hyphenated phrases like “AI-enabled.”</p><p>The usability issues make sense, because AI is relatively new. We’ve seen this happen before. Think about the first time you tapped on a smartphone. Or the first time you sent an email. Every big shift takes a little getting used to. As new technology arrives, new interaction patterns emerge. And the role of words in the interface needs to be figured out.</p><p>The solution: good UX writing. Smart, strategic, honest language that keeps users clear and makes products simpler. It’s more important than ever.</p><p>So if you’re designing an AI product, here are some things to consider.</p><h3>Define your audience</h3><p>And do it <em>before</em> you write. The first step of writing is understanding your reader. This decision will influence the way you write. It’ll also influence your feature set and product roadmap. Different audiences need different things. An AI fact-checking tool for journalists will look very different than one for biology students.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different CTAs with different phrasing speaking to different audiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*penmi9jhlEEyTg33fxDhYg.png"" /><figcaption>Understand who you’re writing for and how they’ll use your product.</figcaption></figure><h3>Decide where AI sits in the product</h3><p>That means shaping the strategy and architecture of whatever you’re building. Before you add AI language and icons onto every screen, align on your approach to AI. Does AI live across the <em>whole</em> product, or just one feature? Is there a character that sits “on top” of the interface?</p><p>Now is also a good time to ask: is your product using AI at all? Have an honest discussion. If it’s not AI, don’t say it is.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens that introduce an AI product in different ways. The third doesn’t say “AI” at all."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AulYk4ooJpeQNBaDdREBxg.png"" /><figcaption>Consider how you’ll introduce AI, if at all.</figcaption></figure><h3>Guide the user input</h3><p>Millions of people are still learning how AI products work. So when you’re writing, think about the first-time user. Will they know what to search? Which file to upload? Where to go for help? Find ways to share guidance or give examples. The best products make sense from the very first screen.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different ways of showing a search bar. One screen has no suggestions, the other lists topics, and the third shows actual search queries."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ATpX-8vM4wxB0zmq8bdIlQ.png"" /><figcaption>Try different ways to help users get started.</figcaption></figure><h3>Add structure to the writing</h3><p>Formatting matters, especially for readability. As you’re choosing good words, think about form, size, color, and spacing. Find the right approach for your information. Maybe that’s a perfect paragraph. Increasingly, it’s short, scannable pieces of text. Try different ways to show the same idea. You can work with the engineering team to create guidelines around how text gets displayed.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens showing how color, formatting, and lists can add clarity to writing."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bdAajcoy654fJfUlHqCgUg.png"" /><figcaption>Explore different ways of displaying the same information.</figcaption></figure><h3>Choose smart, specific actions</h3><p>This is one of the toughest pieces of language to land for AI tools. What is the product actually <em>doing</em>? Language shapes understanding, so try different ways to approach the same feature. Play around with phrasing to see what works best. A button that says “use AI” isn’t precise enough.</p><figure><img alt=""Three buttons that say different things about how they’ll change an image. Adjust colors, enhance image, or touch up."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RoQwf6my2w-mrqBoX84-Tw.png"" /><figcaption>Be specific about what your AI product is doing. Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@coleito"">Cole Keister</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Give a helpful next step</h3><p>The best AI products are more than intuitive — they’re predictive. They understand user needs and suggest a path forward. The next time you’re designing one screen of your product, consider what might come next. Explore common use cases and try to avoid dead ends.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of next steps after a query. If a user asks about an author, maybe they want to visit a library, buy a book, or show the author’s other books."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZI5NMoe8OPBI80GHyPlLaQ.png"" /><figcaption>Use the interface to help create a path forward.</figcaption></figure><h3>Label your interface honestly</h3><p>Whatever your product, make it clear what came from AI. Users should know if they’re talking a chatbot—or a person. They should know if the song was written by a musician—or generated by an app. The solution is simple: use words and images to tell the truth.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of how content can be labeled depending on if it was created by AI or a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MeUCJ5qaDBU6r4EgoNA4TQ.png"" /><figcaption>Be honest about how AI was involved.</figcaption></figure><h3>Show your sources</h3><p>It’s a way to build trust with the user. It’s also a way to keep people safe. Showing your source doesn’t feel all that urgent if you’re displaying NBA scoring titles. But AI products are now commonly used for things like nutrition, finance, and medicine. Users should know where important information is coming from.</p><figure><img alt=""Three ways an AI-generated response might cite the source material."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZvXH_GCOwVg0vpHNJQIbYw.png"" /></figure><h3>Write for all people</h3><p>Many of today’s AI products were built for early adopters. These products use the language — and acronyms — of engineering. And they presume a deep fluency with technology.</p><p>As AI products move into the mainstream, the writing in the interfaces should evolve, too. The writing should become more readable. Respectful. Inclusive.</p><p>Crafting that language takes talent and experience. It requires deep expertise and a sense of empathy. Sure, AI tools can generate endless amounts text. But to build and ship great products, you need people on the team who can actually <em>write.</em></p><p>If you liked this article, you might enjoy some other things I’ve written about digital product design:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/writing-the-onboarding-experience-c1d9b70925be"">Writing the onboarding experience</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/every-design-team-needs-writers-95ddbd4d8081"">Every design team needs writers</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/advanced-techniques-for-writing-good-interfaces-c030ae60150"">Advanced techniques for writing good interfaces</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/writing-with-respect-fb3d9604a374"">Writing with respect</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-inclusive-accessible-digital-products-2f4b35ec59a2"">How to write inclusive, accessible digital products</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/this-is-good-ux-writing-10c4b956a6c3"">This is good UX writing</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-digital-products-with-personality-2f0bd6197248"">How to write digital products with personality</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=222cef13047f"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/ai-interfaces-and-the-role-of-good-writing-222cef13047f"">AI interfaces and the role of good writing</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>A systematic analysis of the first truly AI-native browser and what it teaches us about designing for intention rather than navigation</h4><p>On day 3 of testing <a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/comet"">Perplexity’s Comet browser</a>, something remarkable happened: I stopped typing URLs entirely. My brain had completely rewired from “where do I go?” to “what do I want?” — and this cognitive shift happened before the AI could reliably deliver on that promise. This gap between mental transformation and technical reality defines the next decade of UX design.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Yl1U41mM7GSCSVme09UvKA.png"" /><figcaption>Traditional navigation requires multiple decision points and manual processing, while intention-based design compresses user goals into direct AI execution.</figcaption></figure><h3>What makes Comet different from every browser you’ve used</h3><p>Comet isn’t just another browser with AI features bolted on — it’s a fundamental rethinking of what browsers do. Unlike Chrome or Safari, where you navigate TO information, Comet brings information to you.</p><p>Here’s how it works: Instead of a traditional address bar, Comet presents a natural language interface. But the real innovation happens behind the scenes — the browser maintains persistent context across your entire session, understanding not just your current query, but your underlying intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*47gAe3dhGpY0bHBdR4gxqg.png"" /><figcaption>Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation.</figcaption></figure><p>Three core capabilities distinguish Comet from traditional browsers:</p><p><strong>Contextual AI assistant</strong>: A sidebar that doesn’t just answer questions — it proactively analyzes what you’re viewing and suggests relevant insights. Looking at flight options? It compares prices across tabs automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3UPryT_FiqFtjfytQbdKGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Persistent intent memory</strong>: Unlike chat interfaces that forget context when you close them, Comet maintains understanding of your goals across your entire browsing session. Start researching hotels in one tab, and it remembers your budget constraints when you switch to restaurant searches.</p><p><strong>Cross-site synthesis</strong>: The system can simultaneously process multiple sources, comparing information and identifying patterns across everything you have open — something that would take humans dozens of manual steps.</p><p>This isn’t just a faster way to browse. It’s a different paradigm for how humans interact with information online.</p><h3>Three breakthrough discoveries</h3><p>After two weeks of systematic testing, three insights emerged that every UX team needs to understand:</p><p><strong>The mental model shift is instant</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based interfaces within <em>days</em>, not weeks — even when AI only delivers 60–70% reliability</p><p><strong>AI excels where we least expected</strong>: 90% success rate for synthesis tasks vs 30% for linear workflows — most teams are building AI features backwards</p><p><strong>The future is distributed, not monolithic</strong>: Specialized AI services collaborating feel more seamless than one system trying to do everything</p><h3>Day 3: The moment my brain rewired itself</h3><p>The difference is immediate and stark. Traditional browsing: Chrome’s blank page asks “where do I go?” AI-native browsing: Comet’s search field invites “what do I want?”</p><p><strong>My first test:</strong> “Find cheap flights to Tokyo for May, maximum budget $800.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*apgdrt0u57htaseGxsZKeQ.png"" /><figcaption>Natural language query replacing traditional navigation: delegating a complex task with multiple constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Open 15+ tabs across multiple flight sites</li><li>Manually compare prices and schedules</li><li>Cross-reference dates and availability</li><li>Time investment: 15–20 minutes of active navigation</li></ul><p><strong>Comet approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Single natural language request</li><li>AI handles research and synthesis automatically</li><li>Time investment: 30 seconds setup + background processing</li></ul><p><strong>The critical insight:</strong> When Comet worked, it was transformative.

Framework for teams: Build AI features around analysis and synthesis <em>first</em>. Save execution automation for later iterations when reliability improves.</p><h3>Day 10: Two AIs started talking to each other — without integration</h3><p>The most surprising discovery wasn’t about Comet itself — it was about how AI systems can work together without explicit integration.</p><p>What happened: I asked Perplexity to analyze my travel spending from Gmail. When I switched to Gmail to verify results, Comet Assistant was immediately contextually aware of my travel expense research.</p><p>No API integration required. Both systems maintained “intention persistence” — understanding my underlying goal across platform transitions.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BGEhBQVOqO5HBCy_KYWH6g.png"" /><figcaption>Distributed AI systems collaborating through shared intention context without technical integration.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Critical validation:</strong> Distributed AI collaboration can feel more seamless than monolithic systems. Users benefit from specialized intelligences working together rather than one system attempting everything.</p><h3>Day 12: When delegation actually works</h3><p>By the end of week two, I decided to test Comet with a real-world, high-stakes scenario: planning my daughters’ 11th birthday party. The constraint? They’re celiac, and I needed to shop at Mercadona, a Spanish supermarket.</p><p>My query: “I need to prepare a birthday party for my 11-year-old daughters who are celiac.

One item suggestion wasn’t available in my postal code, but the AI caught this and offered alternatives before I even clicked checkout.</p><p>This experience crystallized the difference between intention-based and navigation-based interfaces:</p><p><strong>Traditional approach would require:</strong><br />- Manually searching each category<br />- Verifying each product is gluten-free<br />- Cross-referencing availability<br />- Remembering what you already added<br />- 30–45 minutes of active work</p><p><strong>Delegation approach:</strong><br />- Single natural language goal<br />- AI handles research and verification<br />- Stepwise approval of selections<br />- 5 minutes of oversight, 10 minutes of AI work</p><p><strong>Critical insight: Users will tolerate AI reliability issues if they maintain control over outcomes.</strong></p><h3>When the magic broke: Understanding AI failure modes</h3><p>Documenting failures is as important as celebrating successes. But after two weeks of testing, I learned that not all failures are equal — and the distinction matters for design.</p><h4>When AI admits its limits (the good kind of failure)</h4><p>I asked Comet to find hotels in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park, budget under $200/night for October dates.</p><figure><img alt=""Booking.com hotel search interface in Comet browser with natural language query specifying downtown Manhattan location near Central Park with $200 per night maximum budget constraint for October dates"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TFmmb3pyyaTQCEp82wuNXg.png"" /><figcaption>Hotel search in Comet with explicit constraints: downtown Manhattan, walking distance of Central Park, under $200/night.</figcaption></figure><p>After processing multiple sources, it returned results significantly above my budget — but with crucial transparency:</p><figure><img alt=""Comet browser showing Booking.com hotel search results with transparent failure communication, displaying available Manhattan hotels priced at $463-$1,882 while explaining that no properties meet the $200 budget constraint and offering alternative search parameters"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KmKY4a-4WdIhblrVEmPvqw.png"" /><figcaption>Comet displaying search results with transparent communication about constraint limitations, showing available hotels above budget while explaining why and offering alternatives.</figcaption></figure><p>The AI didn’t fail silently. It acknowledged my constraints, searched comprehensively, and honestly communicated the reality: “There are currently no hotels available in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park for under $200/night on Booking.com for your dates. Most available properties in this area range from $400-$2,000/night.”</p><p>Then it offered alternatives: expand search radius, adjust budget, or try different dates.</p><p>This is <strong>transparent failure</strong> — the system attempted to fulfill my intention, couldn’t, and explained why with actionable options. Crucially, user trust remains intact because the AI showed its reasoning.</p><h4>When AI fails silently (the dangerous kind)</h4><p>Real trust destroyers look different. These are failures where AI confidently delivers wrong results without signaling uncertainty:</p><p><strong>Silent execution failures I documented:</strong><br />- Grocery queries returning “cilantro seeds” instead of “fresh cilantro”<br />- Flight bookings with incorrect date interpretations<br />- Multi-constraint searches that quietly ignore specific criteria<br />- Location parameters that get deprioritized without explanation</p><p>The pattern: AI appears confident while being incorrect. No warning signals. No acknowledgment of limitations. Just wrong results presented as right ones.</p><p><strong>The design implication:</strong> AI systems must distinguish between “I can’t fulfill this request” and “I fulfilled this request incorrectly.”</p><p>The first builds trust through honesty and explanation. <br />The second destroys trust through false confidence.</p><p>For UX designers: Design for graceful failure acknowledgment, not just graceful success paths. The quality of your error states determines long-term user trust more than the quality of your success states.</p><h4>Performance and security considerations</h4><p>Beyond functional reliability, Comet faces technical challenges that affect real-world viability:</p><p><strong>Performance: </strong>Noticeably slower than Chrome for basic browsing tasks, particularly on initial page loads and when processing multiple tabs simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> <a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave researchers documented prompt injection vulnerabilities</a> in Comet’s architecture, revealing attack vectors unique to AI-native browsers that traditional security models don’t address. As AI becomes infrastructure rather than feature, new security paradigms become necessary.</p><p>These aren’t dealbreakers — they’re growing pains of a new category. But they’re important context for teams considering similar architectures.</p><h3>The new metrics you need to track</h3><p>Traditional engagement metrics miss the fundamental shift. In AI-native interfaces, success depends on the system, not the user. Track these instead:</p><ul><li><strong>Intention success rate</strong>: Does the user’s goal get accomplished?</li><li><strong>Delegation trust index</strong>: How quickly users trust AI with different tasks</li><li><strong>Intention continuity rate</strong>: How well user intent persists across platform transitions</li></ul><h3>The threshold that will reshape everything</h3><p>Based on systematic analysis: <strong>Traditional navigation interfaces will feel cognitively primitive to users who have experienced genuine delegation — the question isn’t if, but how quickly this threshold is reached.</strong></p><p><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based paradigms within days, but current AI can only reliably deliver on those intentions 60–70% of the time. This creates a unique design challenge — bridging transformed user expectations with current technological limitations.</p><p><strong>Industry implication:</strong> Companies should focus on AI interoperability and intention continuity rather than building comprehensive AI monoliths. The competitive advantage lies in orchestrating collaborative AI ecosystems, not singular super-systems.</p><h4>What changes Monday morning</h4><p><strong>→ Start with synthesis, not automation</strong><br />Build AI features around information processing first</p><p><strong>→ Map intention flows, not user flows </strong><br />Design for delegation, with traditional navigation as fallback</p><p><strong>→ Design trust incrementally</strong><br />Prove reliability in low-stakes scenarios first</p><p><strong>→ Build graceful degradation</strong><br />Clear pathways back when AI fails</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Comet represents the first complete empirical validation of theoretical AI UX principles. More importantly, it revealed that the future lies not in monolithic AI systems, but in specialized services collaborating to create unified user experiences.</p><p><strong>For UX designers:</strong> The shift from navigation to intention is operational, not theoretical. Start designing intention flows that span multiple AI systems.</p><p><strong>For product managers:</strong> “Intention Continuity Rate” may be more predictive of success than traditional engagement metrics.</p><p><strong>For the industry:</strong> Early implementation of ecosystem-level AI collaboration provides competitive advantage over isolated AI features.</p><p>The paradigm shift is happening whether our technology is ready or not. The question isn’t whether to participate — it’s whether you’ll lead the transition or follow it.</p><h4><strong>References and further reading:</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/comet"">Perplexity Comet Browser</a><br /><a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave Security Research: Agentic Browser Security</a><br /><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/"">Mental Models in UX Design — Nielsen Norman Group</a><br /><a href=""https://www.starburst.io/blog/parallel-vs-sequential-processing/"">Parallel vs Sequential Processing in Computing</a><br /><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1"">Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms in AI</a><br /><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266730532300056X"">Distributed AI Systems: Taxonomy and Framework</a><br /><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction"">Human-Computer Interaction Design Principles</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d7a702529a4a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-perplexitys-ai-browser-reveals-about-ux-s-future-d7a702529a4a"">What Perplexity’s AI browser reveals about UX’s future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<p>Journey mapping is one of the most widely used tools in interactive design, helping us create products and campaigns that connect with users on a deeper emotional level. This is key to building long-term loyalty, where users and customers feel an irrational sense of trust and gratitude toward your brand.</p><p>In this article, I’ll explain what an emotional journey is to give you a strategic perspective on how we use emotional design to shape user experiences. Then we’ll explore the 12 major emotional journeys, helping you better understand the different types of transitions that motivate and reinforce user behavior. This will give you — and potentially your colleagues — a shared set of terms for describing emotional journeys, making it easier to discuss and debate design strategies.</p><p>Finally, we’ll look at a new wave of color science that explores the link between color and motivation, so you can use color more strategically to strike the right emotional tone.</p><h3>Cugelman emotion map</h3><p>We’re going to use the Cugelman Emotion Map to explain each of the emotional transitions and look at them strategically, so let’s start with an overview. I developed the Emotion Map in the Behavioral Design Academy as a model based on neuroscience and psychology of emotion, that I simplified to help designers apply science-based emotional design strategies.</p><p>In this article, I’ll give you an overview of the Map, then we’ll step up and use the model to understand the bigger picture in emotional design. If you’d like to explore it in more detail, here’s a deeper explanation: <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/color-psychology/colors-and-emotions"">https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/color-psychology/colors-and-emotions</a></p><p>The Cugelman Emotion Map divides emotional experience into four quadrants — each representing one of the broad emotional states that either motivate or reinforce people’s behavior.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*EkCIV2xWRiLE_SaU.png"" /></figure><h3>Motivators vs. reinforcers</h3><p>People often confuse the terms <em>motivator</em> with <em>reinforcer</em> — and while they’re closely related, they’re actually two distinct psychological principles that we use in different ways.</p><p>You can usually tell when someone doesn’t understand the difference because they use the term <em>“carrot and stick”</em> inconsistently — sometimes as a motivator, other times as a reinforcer — without realizing they’re blending two separate principles. This kind of confusion can seriously harm their design and communication work.</p><p>It’s hard to apply psychology effectively when you mix up the most fundamental principles. So let’s make sure we’re clear on the difference.</p><ul><li>Motivators are design strategies that evoke excitement or fear about a future outcome. We use the term motivator to describe how emotional design can spark a desire to act — either to gain something desirable (which evokes an optimistic emotion) or avoid something unpleasant (that evokes an insecure emotion).</li><li>Reinforcers, on the other hand, are design strategies that deliver an emotionally rewarding or painful experience in the present. These aren’t about driving action, but about reinforcing behavior — shaping user habits by encouraging repetition of something rewarding, and discouraging of things that feel painful or frustrating.</li></ul><p>Let’s contrast these a bit more.</p><p>Motivators are emotions that drive people to take action. Reinforcers, on the other hand, are the emotional rewards or punishments that shape how people behave over time — determining whether they’ll repeat a behavior or avoid it in the future.</p><p>Motivators reflect the energizing emotional response to an anticipated threat someone wants to avoid, or an opportunity they hope to obtain. Reinforcers describe the emotional experience based on what we achieved — whether it’s a positive emotion tied to success, which boosts the odds of repeating the behavior, or a negative emotion tied to failure, which teaches us to try harder or adopt a different approach.</p><p>While motivators inspire us to act, reinforcers teach us how to act.</p><p>Since emotions can be used both to motivate and to reinforce user behavior, understanding how they work gives us a more strategic way to design emotional experiences.</p><p>Let’s look at each quadrant in the Cugelman Emotion Map to better understand how these emotions function, and then we’ll build on this, by exploring the 12 transitions and colors psychology of each quadrant.</p><h3>Motivators (Green quadrants)</h3><p>In the Cugelman Emotion Map, the two motivator quadrants are shown in green, representing go. These are the areas where we people feel motivated to act — either by creating opportunities drive their optimism, or threats that drive their feelings of insecurity. Here’s an explanation of each:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimistic (High energy, positive emotion):</strong> This is where excitement, curiosity, and engagement live. These emotions drive focus, approach and movement towards the goal. Strategically, this is where we showcase incentives, highlight product value, and aim to satisfy our users’ needs. If you don’t offer enough to evoke these emotions, your product will feel unmotivating but if you overdo it, you may come across as selling too hard.</li><li><strong>Insecure (High energy, negative emotion):</strong> These are the stress emotions, with anxiety, worry or a sense of pressure. Strategically, we may use urgency, FOMO, or any of many threat avoidance strategies to drive action. However, this must be used carefully — too much can feel manipulative, overly negative, or stressful. Think of it like a spice: just a dash can be effective, but too much is overwhelming.</li></ul><h3>Reinforcers (Red quadrants)</h3><p>The two reinforcer quadrants are shown in red. These reflect the emotional experiences users feel after taking action — either a rewarding or painful experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Secure (Low energy, positive emotion):</strong> Users feel calm, trusting, and satisfied. Strategically, this is where we want users to land — feeling confident that our product consistently meets their needs. This is the emotional zone where we build long-term loyalty which is often the key to designing a successful product. The downside here, is users can start to feel complacent and start to disengage once they get what they thought they wanted.</li><li><strong>Pessimistic (Low energy, negative emotion):</strong> This is where users feel disappointed, trapped, or helpless. It signals disengagement and the risk of churn. But these emotions are potentially dangerous. If users stay here too long, this is the zone where resentment can form. Resentment is the opposite of loyalty, where people will never trust your company and may go out of their way to harm your reputation and income. Never leave users stuck in this state for long, unless you enjoy responding to nasty comments on social media. The up side is that if your competitors trap users in this quadrant, you can easily poach them.</li></ul><p>This gives us a basic overview of the Cugelman Emotion Map, so let’s move on to the strategic use of these emotions.</p><h3>User journeys are emotional transitions</h3><p>Years ago, I became interested in writing screenplays and read several classic books on the subject — including Aristotle’s Poetics. This 2,000-year-old classic analyzes theater and explains how stories resonate with audiences.</p><p>While reading it, I sketched out a diagram of a play, as a timeline with a curve representing the emotional tone. It rises toward high positivity, then dips into lower negativity over time — similar to how we compose music, shifting between moments of high and low tension.</p><p>Years later, I discovered that Kurt Vonnegut had used a similar framework to analyze the narrative arcs of literature — possibly also inspired by Aristotle. I also came across a scientific paper that used AI to analyze the plot structures of numerous books, using the same emotional diagram.</p><p>I’ve adapted this concept into the Cugelman Emotion Map, which we’ll use to understand the rise and fall of emotional tension as part of our emotional design strategies.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wSX89it6UbKAdh-W.png"" /></figure><p>To show you how it works, let’s walk through a classic love story — between a frustrated user and an online product that steps in as the hero, solves their problem, and ultimately earns their long-term loyalty. In the chart below, you’ll see how each transition (in the Emotion Map) places our user in one emotional state before and another right after.</p><p>In this story, our user begins in a state of contentment but soon realizes they have a problem. They try to solve it, fail, and gradually sink into a sense of despair — feeling hopeless and ready to give up on finding a solution.</p><p>Then they discover your product, which sparks a sense of renewed optimism. They decide to give it a try. Your product delivers on its promises, and as the user starts to experience real benefits, their trust in your product and brand begins to grow.</p><p>If we continue to reinforce their trust by consistently delivering on our promises, the user may eventually feel something even more powerful: gratitude and the greatest prize of all — their loyalty. At this point, they’re not just satisfied; they’re emotionally invested.</p><h3>The 12 emotional journeys</h3><p>Based on the four quadrants, there are 12 primary emotional journeys that represent every possible transition across the motivators and reinforcers.</p><p>These transitions can happen quickly, but they can also unfold over a much longer period — sometimes taking months or even years — as people gradually shift from one emotional state to another. For example, someone might spend years feeling pessimistic about their life before something changes and they find a new way forward.</p><p>To help you better understand these patterns, below is an overview of all twelve emotional journeys, including one in-depth example for each quadrant.</p><h3>Optimism strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*snfgPZ8BVlKRcnKJ.png"" /></figure><p>These are the most positive emotional transitions, where users pursue a goal as we support them. If your only aim is to get users to take a single action, one optimistic motivational strategy may be enough. However, in most cases, we use these strategies to prompt initial action, then we start focusing on the secure quadrant, where we work to build a long-term, repeat relationship.</p><p>That said, optimistic emotions are the primary tool we use to get people started. Below are three common emotional journeys:</p><ul><li><strong>Inspiring: </strong>Our audience is already content with their current situation, but by offering something truly exciting, they feel that things can go from good to great. This is how we fire up their excitement to leave their place of comfort.</li><li><strong>Incentivizing: </strong>Our audience feels pressure to avoid an imminent threat while progressively feeling optimistic that their course of action will help them avoid the threat and gain benefits. At some point, the positives outweigh the negatives, leaving our audience more positive about the experience.</li><li><strong>Liberating: </strong>Our audience feels trapped in a hopeless position, but when we provide the promise of escape or change for the better, pessimistic despair fades in favor of optimistic hope.</li></ul><h4>Credit Karma aims to inspire users</h4><p>Users often settle when their credit score is “good enough” and stop thinking about improving. This is a common challenge in behavioral design. Once people reach a goal, they tend to disengage — and that’s often when we see them regress, too.</p><p>While the ultimate goal of behavior change is usually long-term loyalty in the secure quadrant, once people reach this point, we typically need to shift towards maintenance strategies to keep them regular. Credit Karma uses mainly inspiring tactics, motivating users with positivity and encouraging continued progress through uplifting, goal-oriented messages. Yes, there is a slight dash of implied fear messaging, but overall, this is far more positive than negative, with a nice calming blue.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*18xFzXplwELrcFT_.png"" /></figure><h3>Insecurity strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*VKbAovXJ9cUFVRJM.png"" /></figure><p>This quadrant involves using stress-arousing techniques that motivate our audience to move in the right direction or stop them from heading the wrong way. I recommend including at least a small dose of these techniques consistently. However, it’s important not to overdo them, as they can backfire when misapplied. Here are the three transitions:</p><ul><li><strong>Pressuring</strong> — Our audience is moving toward something positive, but then realizes there’s an emerging threat. Their current path becomes more attractive because it will also help them avoid this imminent danger.</li><li><strong>Agitating</strong> — Our audience feels secure at first, but their contentment turns to stress as an emerging threat slowly takes over, dominating their thoughts and leaving them feeling they must act urgently.</li><li><strong>Scaring</strong> — Our audience feels trapped in an emotionally painful situation and then experiences growing anxiety to act urgently to avoid an imminent threat they may feel powerless to escape. This is an extremely stressful and punishing transition, but a mainstay of political communications.</li></ul><h4>Booking.com pressures customers with threats</h4><p>Booking makes you feel optimistic that you’ll be able to get the room you want, but then they layer-on classic pressure tactics by telling you that others are booking that same room right now, forcing you from the solidarity of your safe bedroom to a public space where you’re now competing to not lose that room.</p><p>They use their friendly colors in combination with some alarming red, warning you that you’d better act or risk losing that sweet deal. You can read more about <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/blog/7-principles-of-social-influence-for-digital-psychology"">booking.com’s social influence strategies here</a>.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/0*Mko_D70CMOWAj3Z_.jpg"" /></figure><p>A common technique is to make users aware that if they don’t act someone else will get it first, forcing them into a competitive, zero-sum game they never intended to play. Booking.com is famous for this, with this example showing how they’re telling me other people are booking this property now. They really turn up the heat later when I reach the booking page, telling me someone else will get the room if I dare close the page.</p><h3>Security strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*Dayib-OvNDWiAkPB.png"" /></figure><p>For most of what we do, this quadrant represents the ultimate goal of emotional design: fostering long-term, loyal relationships with our target audience.</p><p>When I say <em>loyalty</em>, I don’t mean repeat habits. I’m talking about something deeper — when your audience forms an emotional bond with your brand and starts acting in ways that don’t always make logical sense. They’ll resist switching to competitors even when better deals are available, and some may even feel like they’re “cheating” on your brand because their loyalty feels authentic. These are also the people who often become brand advocates and drive referrals.</p><p>However, the downside of bringing people into this secure quadrant is that they can become complacent. This is why we typically shift into <em>maintenance psychology</em> once our audience reaches this stage.</p><p>Below are the three main ways we bring people into the secure quadrant:</p><ul><li><strong>Gratifying</strong> — Our audience is pursuing something truly motivating, which is fulfilling enough that they feel secure in their ability to achieve it or trust those who provide it — ideally our brand. This is the most satisfying and rewarding experience, the place where trust and loyalty are nurtured, as our audience feels compelled to rep</li><li><strong>Relieving</strong> — Our audience is actively working to avoid an imminent threat, and then discovers a solution that may not excite them but solves the problem, leading them to feel relaxed and secure as tension fades into relief.</li><li><strong>Saving</strong> — Our audience feels trapped in a painful situation but then discovers a solution that may not have seemed exciting yet lifts them from their plight, leaving them feeling secure and filled with deep gratitude.</li></ul><h4>Zappos gratifies its customers</h4><p>Zappos has earned one of the top reputations for phenomenal customer support — and they’ve clearly learned a critical lesson: when customers are pursuing a goal, the company must help them achieve it and never leave them feeling trapped with a product they don’t want or a transaction they consider unfair.</p><p>What’s impressive about their site is how easy it is to find the support page. Not only does it offer a straightforward way to return products, but contacting the company is also straightforward. Compare that to many other companies, where contact info is buried in the footer or hidden behind a bizarre maze of frustrating, nonsensical complexity.</p><p>And when you call that number, you discover how Zappos truly gratifies customers and earns loyalty: by offering support staff who weren’t hired just for competence, but equally for their deeply empathetic personalities.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lSj9wqDiBVRC14PS.png"" /></figure><h3>Pessimism strategies</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*R0ph0d6pV6qLVWv6.png"" /></figure><p>The last quadrant is the most negative — and the riskiest to work with — as it deals with our most disheartening emotions. Unlike the secure emotions that build loyalty, this quadrant is where self-hate or long-term resentment toward your brand can take root — the exact opposite of what we want to achieve.</p><p>Users can end up here intentionally, through sadistic design, or more commonly, through simple incompetence. Despite this, there are situations where it’s necessary to take users into this space — for example, when they haven’t paid their bills or we have to close an unprofitable product that people depend on. Whether you’re in damage control mode or trying to turn a bad experience into a positive one, it’s critical to understand these emotions and how they function.</p><p>The upside is that when your competitors have driven their users into this quadrant, they’re ripe for defection. All you need to do is step in as the savior, with a product that makes people feel optimistic that it’s time to try something new.</p><p>Here are the three main ways users end up in pessimistic emotional states:</p><ul><li><strong>Overwhelming: </strong>Our audience tries to avoid a threat, but when escape proves impossible, they experience the consequences directly and find themselves trapped in helplessness.</li><li><strong>Discontenting: </strong>Our audience once felt secure, but as their sense of safety erodes, they begin to feel pessimistic, finding themselves trapped in an emotionally punishing situation.</li><li><strong>Disappointing: </strong>Our audience was pursuing an exciting opportunity, only to end up worse off, where hope turns to disappointment and they feel trapped in an awful situation.</li></ul><h4>Temu’s overwhelming wheel of hell</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/406/0*XuBOZoIycWuOMOou.png"" /></figure><p>Temu earns the award for having one of the most frustrating web interfaces that overwhelms users. Instead of allowing people to use their mobile website freely, they aggressively push users toward their mobile app using a manipulative design pattern.</p><p>When you search for products on their mobile web interface, a spinning gambling-wheel pops up, forcing you to play a fake game, win a misleading prize, and then pressuring you to download their app to not lose it.</p><p>If you don’t download the app, the same popup keeps appearing whenever you return to the search results page — making the site far too frustrating to use. On the other hand, if you download the app, you risk installing potential spyware linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Either way, you lose.</p><p>So to get their low prices, you must pay the real price — stress or privacy risks — and each sucks. So the only real choice is not to use their product and assume there’s a hidden cost to their deals.</p><h3>Colors of emotional journeys</h3><p>When it comes to visual design strategies during transitions, color psychology can be a powerful tool for amplifying emotional tone. But before diving in, let’s clear up a few common misunderstandings.</p><h3>Universal color-emotion claims are usually nonsense</h3><p>First, many of the so-called magical links between color and emotion are largely nonsense — ideas invented, recycled, and repeated over time. The design industry has long had a quiet love affair with color pseudoscience, but that approach is becoming increasingly outdated.</p><p>Today, a new wave of research in color psychology and neuroscience is uncovering real, scientifically supported connections between color and emotion. The problem is that much of this knowledge remains buried in academic papers. That’s why I, along with many others, am working to make this research more accessible.</p><h3>Color-emotion associations are context-specific</h3><p>Second, color–emotion associations are real, but they’re context dependent. This means color must always be evaluated within the situation it’s being used. When color and context align, emotional impact is amplified. When they don’t, your message can be weakened and the user experience disrupted. This principle is called <a href=""https://www.behavioraldesign.academy/blog/color-in-context-theory-extended"">color-in-context theory</a>.</p><p>When any color matches the emotional tone of the context, psychologists call this color congruency. A mismatch creates incongruency, a subtle but jarring feeling that makes it hard for people to understand what’s going on, while also eroding trust.</p><p>For example, if you’re shopping and see a red sticker on jeans you’ve been eyeing, you may feel excited — red signals a sale. But if you’re a crypto trader and see a red candlestick on a chart, your heart might sink — red signals a financial loss. In one case, red feels positive; in the other, negative. The emotional response comes not from the color itself, but from what it means in that specific context.</p><p>This is why blanket statements like “red means danger” or “blue means calm” are misleading. What truly matters is color authenticity — choosing colors that accurately reflect the emotional context, rather than applying assumed meanings arbitrarily.</p><p>When color and context are congruent, design becomes more emotionally resonant and persuasive. When mismatched, it creates friction.</p><p>Congruent colors also enhance cognitive fluency — users process information more quickly, trust the experience more, and are more likely to accept the message. Incongruent colors slow processing, raise skepticism, and prompt users to scrutinize more carefully — not always in a good way.</p><h3>Color-emotion associations are rooted in facial perception</h3><p>Third, if color-emotion associations aren’t magical, where do they come from?</p><p>The common explanation points to culture. While cultural meaning plays a role, growing research suggests a deeper origin: our ability to read emotional cues from facial color changes.</p><p>Babies can identify five basic colors — purple, blue, green, yellow, and red — the same hues our brains use to interpret emotional signals in faces. While cultural learning shapes these associations over time, the foundational training begins in infancy. Across all cultures, humans learn to associate certain facial color patterns with specific emotional states in specific contexts.</p><p>Context matters here, too. If someone apologizes but doesn’t blush, you might doubt their sincerity. What you call “intuition” could be your brain registering the absence of a familiar emotional color pattern. Similarly, we judge health based on skin tone. A greenish hue might suggest illness to you; to a doctor, it could signal a specific condition.</p><p>Here’s how it works: Our faces emit subtle color patterns based on blood oxygenation. Oxygenated blood creates red tones; deoxygenated blood creates blue ones. These combine into distinct facial color signatures for different emotions — and they’re visible across all skin tones. People of all ethnicities are able to detect these shifts within their communities, regardless of melanin levels. This appears to be a universal human trait.</p><p>These signals are so consistent that researchers have developed video algorithms capable of estimating heartbeat and emotional state based on facial color shifts. When people view the color masks generated by these systems, they’re surprisingly accurate at guessing emotional states — further validating the theory that facial color cues underpin emotional perception.</p><p>While cultural influence is real, our lifelong training to read facial color changes is likely the strongest source of our color-emotion associations.</p><h3>We project facial-color emotions to non-human things</h3><p>Fourth, research suggests that we unconsciously project facial color associations onto inanimate objects.</p><p>Humans are pathological anthropomorphizers — we assign human traits to animals, machines, and even lifeless objects. The fact that a “pet rock” can have a personality says it all.</p><p>We don’t just see a color — we interpret it through the lens of human emotion. That’s why a blue couch might feel “calm,” or a red button might feel “urgent.” We’re unconsciously applying the same facial color-emotion patterns we’ve observed in people to everything around us.</p><p>In a 2018 study, Thorstenson and colleagues asked participants to match objects, facial expressions, and emotions with different colors. While the match wasn’t perfect, in the chart below, you’ll see there was a strikingly close fit — supporting the idea that our general color-emotion associations originate from the emotional color patterns we first learned by observing our parents’ emotions, and their facial signals.</p><h3>Color contexts of the emotional quadrants</h3><p>Because color-emotion links rely on authentic, context-specific use of color, I’ve merged findings from a wide range of scientific studies and mapped them to the Cugelman Emotion Map. This framework includes major motivational contexts behind emotional experience — such as physiological wellbeing, safety, social bonding, status, and reproductive instincts (love, sex, parenting).</p><p>We won’t go into the full details here, just the high-level emotional tones used for motivating and reinforcing behavior.</p><p>This framework gives us a basic color palette that congruently amplifies the emotional tone across the “12 Journeys” users take as they transition from one emotional state to another.</p><p>Here’s a high-level overview of the emotional color quadrants:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimistic-to-pessimistic emotions: </strong>These range from vibrant rainbow hues in the optimistic quadrant to desaturated gray tones in the pessimistic quadrant.</li><li><strong>Insecure-to-secure emotions:</strong> These range from red, oxygenated blood tones in the insecure quadrant to calm, blue-appearing blood tones in the secure quadrant.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/0*uaOgRvIC0E8M3pJx.png"" /></figure><h3>Optimistic-to-pessimistic emotions: Desaturated to saturated colors</h3><p>When exploring the motivational context of emotional quadrants, certain key colors do emerge; however, the general rule centers on saturation. A well-known study found that among the range of optimistic and pessimistic emotions, one pattern stood out: optimistic emotions are strongly associated with saturated, vivid colors — the kind seen in children’s programming or rainbow imagery. These colors tend to feel more exciting and energetic.</p><p>By contrast, colors tied to pessimistic emotions become increasingly desaturated, often fading toward gray. These muted tones reflect a loss of vitality and align with feelings of decline, detachment, or emotional fatigue.</p><p>A classic example is the “before and after” narrative often used in marketing. The “before” scene typically features dull, desaturated tones — representing a life that’s uninspired or unfulfilled. The “after” scene bursts into vibrant, saturated color, instantly signaling emotional uplift and positivity.</p><h4>Optimistic colors</h4><p>Optimistic colors span the full spectrum but tend to lean toward warmer tones. As a general rule, a diverse palette of saturated, vibrant hues conveys positivity and emotional energy.</p><p>Research from human facial studies shows that red is associated with competitiveness, athletic performance, dominance, and social status. As red shifts toward yellow-orange, it begins to signal health and even sexual attractiveness — patterns commonly observed in facial color and dating studies.</p><p>That said, red’s emotional meaning shifts radically depending on context. While it can be used for optimistic emotions, I typically avoid it as a strategic designer due to its potential to send mixed signals. In positive contexts, I minimize its use, reserving it primarily for insecure emotions where it carries more weight.</p><p>The general guideline is clear: use a vibrant, colorful palette to represent optimistic positivity, but be selective about how and when red is applied.</p><h4>Pessimistic colors</h4><p>Pessimistic emotions are best expressed through desaturated tones — colors that appear faded, aged, or washed out. As hues lose saturation, they naturally drift toward gray, mirroring emotional states such as sadness, depletion, or disconnection.</p><p>In fact, the link between gray and depression is so strong it runs both ways. People experiencing depression often perceive the world as more gray and tend to apply filters to their Instagram photos that appear bluer, darker, and grayer.</p><p>Some hues carry specific negative connotations. For instance: Green is often linked to illness and has been shown to reduce perceived attractiveness in dating studies. Greenish-yellow can signal disgust — which makes sense, as it’s a visible indicator of serious, potentially life-threatening health conditions. Red can suggest blushing, embarrassment, or shame. Blue is closely associated with sadness.</p><p>I generally avoid red and blue in pessimistic contexts, keeping them for more sharply defined emotional contrasts elsewhere in the palette. But if you do use them, desaturate them in depressive or low-energy contexts to maintain emotional accuracy.</p><h3>Insecure-to-secure emotions: Red-blooded to blue tones</h3><p>Facial coloration offers one of the clearest explanations for our color-emotion associations. Specifically, it’s the interplay between oxygenated red veins and deoxygenated blue arteries that produces the wide range of facial colors linked to different emotional states.</p><p>While specific motivational contexts bring their own colors, the broad trend is a shift from red to blue across the insecure-to-secure spectrum.</p><p>A classic example can be found in warnings, alerts, and system messages, which almost always use red to signal urgency or threat. On the other hand, websites that aim to reassure users — such as those handling transactions or personal data — often use baby blues, soft gradients, and calming skies to convey security and trust.</p><h4>Insecure colors</h4><p>In states of insecurity — when people feel vulnerable, anxious, or threatened — red becomes a dominant color. It’s consistently linked to perceptions of aggression and arousal, though the exact meaning depends heavily on context. A flushed face might indicate hostility in a confrontation, or attraction in a romantic moment.</p><p>Because red is emotionally intense and highly context-sensitive, I reserve it primarily for anxious or threat-based emotions, using it strategically and sparingly in other areas.</p><p>Darker tones can also express the intensity of insecurity — leaning more toward deep black rather than neutral gray. These hues add weight and contrast, especially in high-impact or “reverse” palettes. Greenish-brown also fits into this emotional range, often signaling disgust or contempt and reinforcing the darker, more defensive aspects of insecurity.</p><h4>Secure colors</h4><p>Lower blood oxygenation is associated with relaxed, stable emotional states, which are often reflected in blue-to-purple hues, with some slight extensions into red. These tones evoke calm, trust, contentment, and emotional stability — qualities tied to low arousal and composure.</p><p>As emotional activation increases slightly, emotions like admiration or appreciation begin to shift toward subtly warmer tones within the same spectrum. Still, I usually keep these emotions within the bluish palette, as it best conveys the ease, connection, and quiet assurance of trust.</p><h3>Final words</h3><p>I hope this article offered a fresh perspective on color psychology and sparked some new ideas for how you might apply it to your own projects.</p><p>I’m sharing this as a test of the structure for a book I’m currently publishing on the topic. If you have any feedback on the format — whether you found it helpful or see areas for improvement — I’d genuinely appreciate hearing it.</p><p>Enjoy the journey.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/120/1*n_39MynndCiz3GwGQPKfRg.png"" /><figcaption>Brian Cugelman</figcaption></figure><h3>Meet the author</h3><p>Dr. Brian Cugelman is a specialist in using psychology and data science for digital products.</p><p>Thousands of students from companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Salesforce have completed his digital psychology training.</p><p>He has authored over 25 publications and spoken at MIT, the University of Toronto, Johns Hopkins, and various conferences, including TEDx.</p><p>Dr. Cugelman leads the Behavioral Design Academy, offering training on applying psychology to technology.

<h4>How AI redefines user interfaces, and why the chat box gets it wrong</h4><figure><img alt=""A person typing on a vintage tablet prototype, overlaid with a modern AI search bar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fdhCb8tb0yzs0zFG8Rropg.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://kokonautlabs.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/alan-kay-on-marshal-mcluhan-and-the-personal-computer/"">Kokonaut Labs</a> / Recreated by author</figcaption></figure><p>In 1989, Alan Kay published <a href=""https://worrydream.com/refs/Kay_1989_-_User_Interface,_a_Personal_View.pdf""><em>User Interface: A Personal View</em></a>, building on Marshall McLuhan’s idea that <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf""><strong>“the medium is the message.”</strong></a> A medium doesn’t just carry information, it reshapes how we think. To make sense of it, we first internalize the medium.</p><p><strong>An interface, then, is a cognitive framework.</strong></p><p>Today, AI interfaces are shifting fast: from chat to voice, from canvases to agent-driven cross-tool spaces. As models converge in capability, the real differentiation has moved to the interface layer. The interface is no longer just a channel. It is the key that unlocks technology, translating complexity into affordances and shaping the flow of human attention.</p><h3>The collapse of interaction</h3><p>Before large language models, our typical path to finding answers online looked something like this: break your question down into keywords (like pizza, recipe, tutorial) and feed them to a search engine.</p><p>Then you wade through a long list of results, browsing page by page, clicking on a few promising links to read carefully, and finally mentally stitching those fragments together into your own version of the answer.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram comparing command-based, process-driven, and AI-driven intent-based interfaces through Google and Perplexity examples."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-VaSvfujeqbYtSkUzrczRQ.png"" /></figure><p>In contrast, with conversational AI products, I simply say: “Give me the perfect pizza recipe and instructions,” and the AI immediately serves up a curated answer. If it’s not quite right, I add a couple more sentences, the AI continues to refine or rewrite, and soon I’ve iterated to a final answer.</p><p>So with AI’s intervention, we can see two major shifts in product interaction paradigms:</p><h4><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/"">From command-based to intent-based</a></h4><p>Traditional interfaces relied on a turn-taking loop: <strong>input → output → user judgment → next command.</strong> Now, instead of issuing step-by-step instructions, the user states the goal, and the system handles the process behind the scenes.</p><h4>From process-driven to outcome-driven</h4><p>Interaction used to feel like a visible journey, where users accumulated knowledge and built judgment along the way. Today, much of that process is folded into the backend. Interaction becomes a cycle of prompting and refining around the result itself. The user’s main task is to evaluate the output, while the system dynamically connects the dots based on intent.</p><h3>The unmoored chat box</h3><p>Interestingly, most AI products have converged on the same choice: a chat box. The reason is obvious — chat feels natural, with virtually zero learning curve. Prompts unfold as back-and-forth conversation, offering high interactivity, tolerance for errors, low barriers to entry, and almost unlimited flexibility. It’s the perfect vehicle for mass adoption.</p><figure><img alt=""Grid showing six AI chat interfaces, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Grok, all sharing similar layouts."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Uyp3cUr0RbKUIwfIUOBUoQ.png"" /></figure><p>This is why Sam Altman wants to build ChatGPT into a <a href=""https://youtu.be/ctcMA6chfDY?si=WLb9A244XcdJmTnT"">Personal Life OS</a>. In that value narrative, the experiential intuitiveness and multimodal extensibility of conversational interaction is the solution for vast life scenarios.</p><p>But there’s another, less visible factor: LLMs are inherently <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/squish-structure"">squishy</a>. The same intent, placed in slightly different contexts, can produce different results. Therefore, ensuring that a setting always corresponds to stable, reproducible effects is a thankless task.</p><p>As a result, AI products often bury parameters deep in the system instead of exposing them as explicit controls.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface mockup showing an AI tool presenting maps, videos, product listings, and charts in one unified workspace."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aNaUD3ArHvj-QxGZJuMiOw.png"" /></figure><p>Take ChatGPT as an example. Beyond plain text, it can also produce tables, images, charts, code snippets, videos, and content cards.</p><p>One way to unlock these formats is to be explicit in the prompt — say, asking the AI to present the answer as a flowchart. But this puts the burden back on the user, who now has to master structured prompting and understand how content should align with different formats.</p><p>The second is to let the AI decide, having the system choose the appropriate presentation based on the generated content’s characteristics. This points to a major trend in future interfaces — <a href=""https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/generative-user-interfaces?_sm_vck=J8qN47SpWnMDrN8LSrDW9NkMQHB0Q8RH7DJrRRslW9447Q7sqsRN"">Generative UI</a>.</p><p>In this model, AI doesn’t just generate content, it simultaneously decides and renders the most fitting presentation container, truly merging output with interface for genuine personalization.</p><p>But before Generative UI becomes reality, the chat box stays out of control.</p><h3>Category error</h3><p>Dave Edwards, founder of <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/"">Artificiality</a>, offered a thought-provoking <a href=""https://artificialityinstitute.org/the-design-illusion-of-llms/"">metaphor</a> that most digital products fall into one of two categories:</p><p><strong>Windows</strong>: they connect users to external information and resources — think Tripadvisor, Airbnb, or Spotify.</p><p><strong>Rooms</strong>: they provide spaces for work, collaboration, and creation — tools like Figma, Photoshop, or PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison between Figma and Tripadvisor interfaces illustrating two tool metaphors: “room” for exploration and “window” for creation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nU3L_X_hnCmYOBNsZIHJmA.png"" /></figure><p>If we map AI users along a proficiency spectrum: there are beginners, intermediate users, and power users.</p><p>Conversational interfaces naturally cater to the first two groups. They brand the system as a “no learning required” product. Perfect for newcomers, right? But for power users, the chat box strips away control panels and leaves only an open-ended input field.</p><pre>Analyze this software licensing agreement for legal risks and liabilities.<br /><br />We’re a multinational enterprise considering this agreement for our core data infrastructure.<br /><br />&lt;agreement&gt;<br />{{CONTRACT}}&lt;/agreement&gt;<br /><br />This is our standard contract for reference:<br />&lt;standard_contract&gt;{{STANDARD_CONTRACT}}&lt;/standard_contract&gt;<br /><br />&lt;instructions&gt;<br />1.

I started with attempting to investigate our <strong>willingness</strong>.</p><p>My research began to reveal that humans are generally willing to try AI experiences, and even more broadly — new technology — for a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101925"">combination of reasons</a>, including <strong>perceived usefulness, efficiency, enjoyment</strong>, and a natural human inclination to <strong>experiment with shiny new things</strong>.</p><p>To summarize, here are some of the key reasons and ideas I encountered as to why humans are more likely willing to try newer technologies, especially AI:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty and curiosity: </strong>Humans are often drawn to new technologies and the potential they hold for progress and improvement.</li><li><strong>Social influence: </strong>Observing others adopting and benefiting from AI can encourage further exploration and acceptance.</li><li><strong>Efficiency and automation: </strong>AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, freeing up human time and energy for more complex or enjoyable activities.</li><li><strong>Enhanced capabilities: </strong>AI can perform tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as processing large datasets, identifying complex patterns, and generating new content.</li><li><strong>Improved experiences: </strong>AI can personalize interactions, provide targeted recommendations, and offer convenient, 24/7 support in areas like customer service and digital assistance.</li></ul><p>The concept of <strong>Social influence</strong> makes total sense to me — humans have historically relied on <strong>word-of-mouth</strong> to inform their decision making processes. AI is no different — we’re currently bombarded with personal stories from colleagues, friends and family of how they’re using AI.</p><p>Thinking about additional key concepts, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> are the big promises of AI. And also where some of the fears stem from — <em>imagine seeing your skillsets automated leaving you effectively redundant</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QglxnrKk0V_Kre9fFncncA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>Conceptually, both <strong>Enhanced Capabilities</strong> and <strong>Improved Experiences</strong> are showing up within existing software experiences more and more every day. Things like Google’s AI-enhanced search results or any of the “synthesis” capabilities being folded into nearly every product — <em>“help me write”</em> or <em>“summarize this”</em> types of patterns are quickly becoming commonplace.</p><p>What will be interesting across all of these is <strong>what sticks</strong>. I think many of us would agree we’re currently in a technological bubble. So out of these <strong>enhancements, improvements</strong> and <strong>novelties</strong> — <em>what will become consistently useful?</em></p><p>I believe surviving conversational experiences will continue to fall into either of the following categories. Some of these examples will be more like Latent Needs as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmspool_driving-innovation-from-your-customers-activity-7363238346925481985-SQbB/"">Jared Spool</a> describes — akin to a heated steering wheel. In other words,</p><blockquote>“I didn’t know I needed this — but now that I have it…”</blockquote><p>Other example solutions will aim to solve existing problems facing human users. And the rest will become a casualty of the bubble as the <strong>novelty wears off</strong> and usefulness doesn’t persist.</p><p>At a high-level, it seems like it’s a suite of potential things that lead us to a place of willingness — <strong>the novelty of something new, the influence that both our peers and media have on us</strong> and of course — <strong>the promise of better</strong>.</p><h3>Acceptance</h3><p>I realize following a meandering path like this can be difficult — so I’ll try to keep us tethered. Remembering where I started at the beginning of this rabbit hole, I asked <em>why might we be willing to use an AI-driven conversational interface as compared to the classic Chatbots many of us distaste</em>. As I dug into the concept of willingness, I often encountered <strong>acceptance</strong> as a nearby, if not similar concept.</p><p>The primary distinction between acceptance and the previous one is that <strong>willingness is a short-term, initial mindset</strong>, while <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">acceptance</a> describes the <strong>sustained, actual use of a product over time</strong>, reflecting <strong>deeper integration</strong> and <strong>satisfaction</strong>. So now that I understand the promise of the new a bit better, <em>what about this sustained relationship?</em></p><blockquote><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587""><strong>Acceptance</strong></a> is primarily defined as the behavioral intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service.</blockquote><p>It is a critical factor for the successful adoption and uptake of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence. Low acceptance can lead to the <strong>disuse of resources, a surplus of unused devices</strong>, and a <strong>slowdown in technological innovation</strong>.</p><p>The research continued to portray how acceptance can be a conscious, personal choice, such as <strong>knowingly purchasing a device that contains AI</strong>, or it can also be an involuntary action, like <strong>unknowingly interacting with an AI chatbot</strong> that presents itself as a human customer service agent.</p><figure><img alt=""A swiss army style pocket knife — meant to highlight aspects of acceptance, such as perceived usefulness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OMT3e9UHYHGDpiS0B1v_Jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Photo by<a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vjgalaxy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Alejandro Piñero Amerio</a> on<a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-and-silver-safety-pin-LHFuqK3KywE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>key psychosocial factors </strong>that consistently predict a user’s acceptance of AI across various industries closely resembles willingness but with some variance towards perspective over time:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived Usefulness / Performance Expectancy:</strong> This is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will help them achieve their goals or be useful in their daily life. It is often the strongest positive predictor of the intention to use a new technology.</li><li><strong>Perceived Ease of Use / Effort Expectancy:</strong> This refers to a user’s perception of how effortless a technology would be to use. Its influence can be weaker than perceived usefulness, especially as users become more familiar with technology in general.</li><li><strong>Attitudes: </strong>A person’s attitude towards a technology is a frequently included variable that positively predicts their behavioral intention to use it.</li><li><strong>Trust:</strong> This is the subjective attitude that allows a person to make a vulnerable decision, believing that a technology will achieve a desired goal. You can really start to see some symbiosis here — <em>Trust in both the AI and its provider is a significant driving factor in acceptance</em>.</li><li><strong>Social Influence / Subjective Norms:</strong> This factor involves a person’s perception that significant others would approve or disapprove of their use of the technology. It is particularly relevant in industries with high levels of social contact.</li></ul><h4>Models for Assessing Acceptance</h4><p>To understand and measure acceptance, I came across several <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">research-theoretical models</a>, and how they’ve been adapted specifically for contexts like AI.</p><ul><li><strong>Technology Acceptance Model</strong>: This is the most frequently used and flexible model for assessing technology acceptance. It posits that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are the primary drivers of a user’s intention to use a technology.</li><li><strong>Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology</strong>: This model integrates concepts from eight other theories, including TAM — Technology Acceptance Model. It suggests that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions predict behavioral intentions and usage.</li><li><strong>AI Device Use Acceptance model</strong>: A more recent model developed specifically for AI, the AIDUA model proposes that users appraise AI devices in stages based on factors like social influence, hedonic motivation (perceived pleasure), and anthropomorphism (human-like qualities).</li></ul><p>What I’ve found so far is that these psychological factors all seemingly overlap and interrelate. Willingness correlates to the novelty and promise of something new, while Acceptance speaks to how our expectations are met over time. I can start to see how these pieces fit together in perhaps a larger adoption journey.</p><blockquote>The perceived promise gets folks through the doors and consistent outcomes matching expectations keeps them coming back.</blockquote><p>Whew, here we are in the rabbit hole. I still feel like there’s more to understand about sustained use and what individual facets can help drive acceptance. <em>What is it that makes us hesitant instead of willing as the conversational space in software continues to evolve? What brings us back over and over again?</em></p><figure><img alt=""Modern depiction of Microsoft’s classic virtual assistant — Clippy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pcYGzNmQglINPNRwxVgYBA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Microsoft <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/"">https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/</a></figcaption></figure><p>My curiosity led me in <strong>deeper</strong>. My hypothesis at this point was taking shape around this intersection of <strong>humans and how or why they might trust software</strong>. I’ve personally become distrustful of classic Chatbots. If it even looks like the Chatbot of yesterday — seeing something like a Floating Action Button yielding a Clippy-like offering, promising to answer all my questions — <em>I’m immediately prepared to never touch it</em>.</p><h3>Trust… actually Search first</h3><p>Before I head into why and how trust is earned and eroded, I started by investigating perhaps the precursor of today’s conversational experience — <strong>Search.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A retro screenshot of Google’s homepage from circa 1998"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/502/1*zYMJwuoUOXS0ROQg6-cODw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Google Beta homepage (1998) Source: <a href=""https://www.india.com/buzz/happy-birthday-google-7-things-unheard-about-search-engine-giant-as-it-greets-self-with-doodle-on-16th-anniversary-159143"">India.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Traditional search experiences are of course now being woven together with AI intelligence. Outside of that, you can still see and sense the same disparity in appreciation of search experiences akin to classic Chatbots and modern Conversational Experiences. Some search experiences are highly utilized and accepted and others are not. Putting allegiances aside, I was curious about how existing with Search as a paradigm and evolving with it all these years <strong>could have potentially influenced us</strong> as we are redirected into more conversational interfaces.</p><p>Through observations with some early conversational interfaces I’ve been working on, I noted that <strong>users are still mostly beginning their conversation with succinctly few words, if not only one word</strong> — <em>why?</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.emerald.com/ajim/article-abstract/73/3/436/50198/The-effects-of-cognitive-load-on-query?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">Research</a> revealed that users may start their searches with one word primarily due to the initial cognitive load and the iterative nature of search. I’d include familiarity as well, since search has been taking shape beside us for years now.</p><p>Explanations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Reducing cognitive load: </strong>Starting with a single term requires little effort. Users can quickly generate results and then adapt their query based on what they see.</li><li><strong>Iterative process: </strong>Search is often exploratory. A single keyword acts as a starting point, giving users something to refine as they go.</li><li><strong>System familiarity: </strong>Decades of exposure to search engines have trained users to trust that even minimal input will trigger auto-suggestions or relevant results.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, while iterative searching does happen, only <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-user-behavior#only-15-of-google-users-modify-their-initial-search-term""><strong>15% of Google searches are refined or modified</strong></a>. This suggests to me that modern search engines are highly performant in that users often find satisfactory answers from their first attempt. Over time, this reliability has created a strong expectation that <em>“search just works,”</em> reinforcing user trust and shaping behavior.</p><blockquote>Subsequently, certain search experiences and approaches have evolved with us and adapted to us to become highly effective.</blockquote><p>In contrast — when currently working with an AI experience, users often <strong>feel as though they’re at fault for not achieving the outcome they’d hoped for</strong>. <em>“It’s my fault I can’t get this AI to do what I want!”</em> We should work to eliminate the returning concept of “User Error”.</p><p>This led me to some new questions:</p><ul><li><em>How does the trust that users have with traditional search transfer (or fail to transfer) to conversational AI?</em></li><li><em>What design patterns might we use to help conversational AI feel as reliable and effortless as traditional search?</em></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Human hand shaking a digital looking hand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*nMkfMDMrNPMDzT2akbVo1A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><h3>Back to Trust</h3><p>As seen with the evolution of Search — it took time to reach a point where users rely on the pattern, usually without question. I personally feel very confident currently that I can input very little into a Google Search and then with the predictive suggestions, presentation of results and likely summary-answers — <em>I’ll get what I’m looking for quickly and easily.</em></p><p>Unlike usability, which is <strong>immediately noticeable when something feels difficult or frustrating</strong>, <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">trust operates subtly</a> in the background.</p><blockquote>Trust is built in small moments of reassurance and consistency, and it can be lost in a single misstep.</blockquote><p>My journey across this research continued to affirm some things about trust. For example, in UX it isn’t just about security — it’s about <strong>predictability and transparency</strong>. Users trust products that behave in expected ways, where actions lead to anticipated outcomes. But trust doesn’t just matter at the beginning of an interaction; it needs to be <strong>reinforced throughout the user journey</strong>.</p><p>While the conceptual space surrounding how humans develop a trusting relationship with software experience is vast, here are a few notable concepts I can quickly summarize:</p><ul><li>One of the most powerful factors influencing trust is <a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><strong>familiarity bias</strong></a> — the tendency for people to trust what feels familiar.</li><li>Another key principle is <strong>cognitive fluency</strong>, which refers to how easily information is processed.</li><li><strong>First impressions</strong> also shape <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">long-term perceptions</a> of trustworthiness. Research in psychology shows that <strong>people form lasting opinions within milliseconds of encountering a website or app</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>This is where our willingness is gambled away as our anticipated outcomes aren’t realized and we’re left disappointed.</blockquote><ul><li>Another psychological factor is <strong>ambiguity aversion</strong> — the <a href=""https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/ai-chatbot-fears/#:~:text=5.%20Companies%20Not%20Caring%20Another%20common%20concern,a%20cold%20and%20impersonal%20customer%20service%20experience."">natural discomfort people feel when outcomes are unclear</a>. If users aren’t sure what happens when they click a button, whether their payment went through, or how their data will be used, they experience hesitation. This seems like a facet of why many of us have grown negative towards traditional Chatbots — <em>I know personally I’m never sure how versatile or capable they might be.</em></li><li><a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596""><strong>Emotional reassurance</strong></a><strong> </strong>also influences trust. Users feel more confident when an interface acknowledges their concerns, provides timely feedback, and offers clear pathways forward.</li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-is-trust-and-credibility-designed-in-ux-fc0ed84a1697""><strong>Social proof</strong></a> is a psychological phenomenon where people conform to the actions of others under the assumption that those actions are indicative of the correct behavior. In UX, social proof can be leveraged to enhance trust through elements like reviews, testimonials, or user counts. Antithesis of this is Dark Patterns. Interestingly, this seems to correlate back to Social Influence in how we might adopt and accept software.</li></ul><p>The answer to my initial question feels like its starting to take shape. Trust is clearly a big reason that some of us humans have become weary of traditional Chatbots and poor search experiences. We’ve been left stuck in ambiguity — <em>“are you able to actually answer my question?”</em> and then we’re subsequently and consistently disappointed with the quality of answer or help we sought.</p><figure><img alt=""A toy robot set in a dark background"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y4pTs1cuqsd0hICZlSTH9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@jochenvw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Jochen van Wylick</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/yellow-and-black-robot-toy-Y40Ga3oahAs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Novelty, Risk &amp; Familiarity</h3><p>The research so far has shown how novelty can draw users to AI and new technological experiences. I found myself wondering if the <strong>relationship between novelty and willingness in this context were actually balanced</strong>. I quickly dug into how humans perceive risk around something new and novel to try and answer my new question.</p><p>According to my research, instead of a balance between novelty and willingness, <strong>the opposite is often true</strong>: <em>novelty can increase </em><a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><em>perceived risk and trigger risk-averse behavior</em></a>.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncertainty and lack of information:</strong> Novelty inherently involves uncertainty, as the outcomes and potential risks of something new are not well-known or tested. This lack of information can be perceived as risky, prompting individuals to be cautious or avoid it altogether. This idea tends to be represented by a certain percentage of folks out there — still feeling hesitant or fearful of AI in general.</li><li><strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> Humans tend to be more wary of the unknown. A lack of familiarity with something new can heighten feelings of vulnerability or potential harm, leading to risk aversion.</li><li><strong>Potential for negative consequences:</strong> Without prior experience, the potential for negative consequences with something new is often emphasized. Individuals tend to weigh potential losses more heavily than potential gains, making them more hesitant to engage with the unknown.</li><li><strong>Lack of fluency:</strong> Things that are difficult to process or are again, unfamiliar, can be perceived as less safe.</li></ul><p>All of this starts to feel like a razor’s edge of achieving sustained adoption. Initial novelty can undermine trust if expectations are unmet. Familiarity, through easy interfaces, builds trust, but repeated negative experiences (“familiarity betrayed”) destroy it, leading to disuse.</p><p>To build familiarity and reinforce trust, conversational interfaces must consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty as an Entry Point:</strong> New AI experiences spark curiosity but risk disappointment if expectations aren’t met.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Clarity and Empathy:</strong> Design for <a href=""https://www.gladly.ai/blog/how-to-listen-to-customers-effectively/"">active listening</a>, clear communication, and acknowledgment of user frustration.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example screenshot where a Chatbot enabled human handoff"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*KgY4H3otVIVDM00XjkMp9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff"">https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Continuously Improve and Manage Expectations:</strong> Regularly update AI performance and set realistic expectations for its capabilities. This might be obvious — but if we knew ahead of time that the experience we were about to engage in was limited in certain ways, we might not result in such disappointment.</li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>This research journey has revealed much and of course, left me with even more questions and tangents to continue exploring. <em>(Feel free to check out my collection of resources in this </em><a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/05bf5d9e-964f-4fb8-b419-ac31abfaac4f""><em>Google Notebook LM</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>However, I think the answer to my original question, <em>Why are we willing to try and use new AI experiences while many of us hold disdain for the previous era of less intelligent Chatbots</em> is this =</p><ul><li>Novelty and the promise of new and better has <strong>enthralled many of us to dispel our own aversions and give emerging AI experiences a shot</strong>.</li><li>The social influence and word of mouth surrounding us at work, in the media, amongst friends and family has reassured <strong>more of us that the risk is worth it</strong>.</li><li>The successful examples we experience and hear about help to contrast the earlier iterations of conversational experiences —<strong> these are not Chatbots</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>As we all collectively move beyond novelty and into familiarity - our consistently successful experiences that match our expectations will yield trust, leaving us accepting the few remaining products that deliver on all fronts.</blockquote><h3>Next</h3><p>One thing stood out across all this research — is the idea that effective communication practices can foster trust and acceptance. What a beautiful idea that every-day communication skills like Active Listening, Empathy, Clarity and Transparency all will likely embolden trust and drive adoption.

It’s on </em></strong><a href=""https://www.fadedpage.com/sc/innis.php""><strong><em>Harold Innis</em></strong></a><em> and how his forgotten idea about media bias can help us understand why search has become a negotiation for truth.</em></p><h3>How delivery shapes belief</h3><p>In the mid-1900s, Harold Innis was studying why some forms of knowledge last a long time and others disappear quickly. His answer: <a href=""https://www.newcartographies.com/p/harold-innis-and-our-time"">the way information is delivered carries a bias.</a></p><p>What he called <a href=""https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/innis.htm"">media bias</a> wasn’t what you would think of as being political. Instead, this was structural. Every medium (or delivery method) tilts truth in a particular direction. Innis divided this communication into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-biased media</strong> like stone tablets, clay, and oral tradition: durable, slow to produce, hard to distribute. Designed to preserve memory across generations. <br />They were costly to create, so what made it into stone was meant to last.</li><li><strong>Space-biased media</strong> like paper, newspapers and radio: fast, scalable, and easy to spread. Great for moving information across distance. The tradeoff is that the information is easy to forget.</li></ul><p>Each method has different consequences if you’re wrong. You definitely don’t want to carve a mistake in stone. But you’ll toss an opinion on the radio without much hesitation.</p><p>Innis believed civilizations leans one way or the other. The problem is when they lean too far, things start to crack. For instance, the more a culture chases speed, the more it sacrifices memory.</p><p>That worried him, because when speed becomes the goal, friction disappears. And when friction disappears, belief forms too easily.</p><p>When that happens, people start believing things without remembering why. Information flies everywhere, and everyone believes a little bit of everything, but nothing deeply enough to sustain conviction, trust, or memory.</p><p>Which brings us to the delivery method shaping a lot of decisions today: the <strong>answer engine</strong>.</p><h3>The frictionless answer</h3><p>Innis taught that every medium tilts truth by setting the cost of being wrong (back to the idea that stone carried a level of permanence).</p><p><strong>Answer engines flipped that equation.</strong> They’re fast, free, available and project absolute confidence… while carrying almost zero accountability.</p><p>That’s the bias of the delivery system we live with now: <strong>it produces answers that <em>look </em>like truth but are endlessly changeable.</strong></p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>That mismatch matters. It’s not just a technology problem, and it’s deeply philosophical.</p><h3>Truth as a system</h3><p>Truth has always carried signals about how seriously to take it. I think about how headlines hint at urgency or a broadcast voice carries authority. Even a blog post tells you something about the author behind it.</p><p>Answer engines strip that information away. What’s left is a paragraph that’s floating above information that is constantly shifting around.</p><p>That’s why I think <strong>negotiation</strong> is the right metaphor. We aren’t testing competing claims anymore. We’re reacting to how the system delivers them. If it looks fine, we believe it.</p><p>Innis understood that the way information is delivered is more important than the content. It sets the probability of belief.</p><p>When answers are this easy to generate, its the delivery method that convinces us, not the accuracy of the information. Over time, we stop asking whether something is true and start assuming it must be… because it looked complete when it showed up.</p><h3>The context problem</h3><p>So we arrive at the issue brands are <em>actually</em> facing.</p><p>Brands assume the challenge is volume. Publish more, post more… rank more. But the challenge isn’t content. <strong>It’s context.</strong></p><p>Most brands are still playing an old game… chasing backlinks, tweaking keywords, and pumping out pages to satisfy algorithms that ranked links instead of resolving questions.</p><p>That used to work… when brands controlled the narrative. When it paid to write carefully sanitized copy that sounded official, without saying anything useful. When brands do that now, they don’t look like they’re being careful. They look evasive.</p><p>But now that same content gets torn apart, summarized, and served out of context.</p><p>This is an answer-first world. You can be right and still not be trusted.</p><p>That’s another paradox: <strong>trust now lives even further downstream from your content. It’s perceived by the reader only after they’ve read what the answer engine tore apart.</strong></p><h3>What we build from here</h3><p>If search is now a negotiation, brands can’t keep showing up the old way.</p><p>Publishing more just to publish more doesn’t make brands more believable. (You can look at stats on your content if you don’t believe me.)</p><p>Instead, I think brands need to work on understanding customer friction, offering context, and helping people weigh what to believe… even when the answer isn’t perfect. <strong>That’s how you build trust with your customer.</strong></p><p>Take financial services (where I spend my time).</p><p>Most banks write content to align with their own products and services. But answer engines aren’t asking what helps the brand. They’re asking what helps the reader.</p><p>So if you’re writing a piece called “What should Gen Z do with their tax return?”, and every answer just funnels them toward your checking account, you’ve already lost. Not because your product is bad… but because your answer wasn’t complete.</p><p>I think this will be the difference.
