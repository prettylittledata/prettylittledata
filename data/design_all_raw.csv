<p>Exploring navigation as something bigger than moving through physical and digital spaces — as a fundamental cognitive act</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*X6jNJk6M9uS348ftxZqXGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Shipping the package that’s yourself (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks ago, I read an article — <a href=""https://www.doc.cc/articles/ai-navigation"">A new navigation paradigm</a> — that felt relatable, yet unsettling in a way I couldn’t fully articulate. I eventually stopped thinking about it, but the ideas lingered in the background. They then surfaced in the most mundane and seemingly unrelated places.</p><p>A few weeks later, as I struggled to submit a loan application online, I realized that my frustration stemmed from more than a technical problem. I had lost the ability to <em>navigate </em>the system.</p><p>Shortly after, while taking an Uber ride to a friend’s place, I caught myself in a moment of reflection. I was moving in the physical space with no attention to my surroundings, completely at the mercy of the driver, who was in turn following the instructions from his phone.</p><p>The kind of navigation I was doing in an Uber didn’t seem all that different from my attempts to navigate the banking system. Navigation suddenly felt bigger — like a fundamental cognitive act.</p><p>In this essay, I examine <strong>navigation in four different realms: institutional, physical, digital, and semantic</strong>. By exploring the commonalities, I hope to convey what’s at stake when we eliminate the <em>friction</em> of navigation, and how to deliberately regain some of it.</p><h3>Navigating the system</h3><p>I am currently attempting to fund a home loan through a major Indian bank that is committed to the idea of a “digital-first” India. As a sign of this commitment, they are now “digital-only” — they now process home loan applications online exclusively, or so I’m told. But the portal is a never-ending obstacle course, almost as if designed to test the user’s patience and persistence. It succeeds phenomenally.</p><p>I’m prompted for identification proofs as PDFs under 1MB or JPEGs under 5MB, but when I provide them, I get an error: <em>“Oops! Something went wrong.”</em> Of course, many things could go wrong. Underneath the digital interfaces is the cross-continent network that makes them all tick — the hundreds of hardware devices the data has to traverse, the tens of thousands of miles of wire crossing land and oceans. Distributed systems are built assuming ephemeral failures. But when they happen consistently, it signals something systemic.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*caGp-0y1osvEHv4av2lxqg.png"" /><figcaption>“Oops! Something went wrong.” Error while submitting documents on a banking portal</figcaption></figure><p>You know the problem is prevalent when it becomes material for comedy. Biswas Kalyan Rath, an Indian stand-up comedian, <a href=""https://youtu.be/PK_zuAuI9x0?si=szB908spPScog_k6&amp;t=64"">has a good bit about the state of “digital-first” marriage registration in India</a>.</p><blockquote>“Marriage, no problem. Very simple. Getting marriage registered.. Big problem. It was always a problem, now there is the illusion of Digital India. There is a website. You can go and register. No problem. Fill the entire form. The “Submit” button does not work.”</blockquote><p>I cracked up when I watched it. I’m not laughing now. I’m three weeks into the loan application, and I need it approved.</p><p>The deeper problem isn’t the bad website. It’s what it does to its users. I understand technology, but the bank’s application is a black box to me. The loan agent is an expert in the process but has proven useless. He’s as much a spectator in this as I am. I’m not merely dependent on the website; I’m trapped between technology that’s not done well and a human who doesn’t understand it well. We’ve both lost the ability to <em>navigate</em> the system.</p><h3>Navigating the physical world</h3><p>During my childhood, when I traveled by bus to my maternal hometown — Ichalkaranji, Maharashtra’s textile hub — we could tell we had arrived by the pungent smell and rhythmic din of the cotton mills. We could tell the time remaining by the landmarks we passed — the restaurants, the trees, the market, the temples, the stadium. Knowing a destination meant knowing its spatial signature. We had to read the surroundings to know when we had arrived. Navigation was an act of observation. Even the act of describing a destination meant being deeply aware of its characteristics. We saw a place as a point in space, situated relative to other places.</p><p>Then came paper maps, which provided a way to abstract the physical reality and capture its essence in symbols. It was a leap forward, but still required us to compare the map against the territory — active interpretation. The map acted as external memory. The processing still happened in your brain. In software terms, this was the separation of storage and compute. The maps only told you the layout. You had to orient yourself against it.</p><p>Then Google Maps outsourced “compute” too.</p><p>It wasn’t just paper maps on a screen. It offered a fundamentally different technology: <em>active navigation</em>. Active interpretation on the user’s part gave way to the step-by-step guidance from the software. It not only knew the landscape; it knew your place in it. You just had to trust it. Spatial navigation became a skill you no longer needed. When Google Maps tells me to “take the next exit and stay on the second to the right lane”, I mindlessly execute.</p><p>What navigation demands from me now is not intelligence but compliance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2hg4yjIZHevidm3IrPtAhw.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating by compliance (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>I’m as much a victim as a culprit of this de-skilling that has happened at scale. Due to my overreliance on technology, I don’t remember the street names in my neighborhood anymore, despite having lived in the same place for over two years. It speaks to how little I pay attention to the world around me when the blue arrow and the friendly voice are leading the way.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7156656/"">A 2020 longitudinal study</a> tracked regular drivers over three years and found that people with greater lifetime GPS experience demonstrated reduced spatial memory during self-guided navigation. It found not just correlation, but causality of GPS use leading to decline in spatial memory.</p><h3>Getting carried away</h3><p>Compare this to the Uber model.</p><p>You set the destination, a driver accepts, you accept, and off you go. One of the “benefits” of Uber is that it relieves you of the mundane act of driving. Your attentional resources, the logic goes, can be better spent on “more important” needs — like scrolling social media on your phone instead of greeting the human three feet away. Thanks to self-driving cars, we’ve even eliminated that guilt, if there ever was.</p><p>Somewhere in that scroll, you lose track of time, of the route, of your environment. You’re physically there, but mentally elsewhere. The only active role you’ve played is scheduling the pick-up and the drop-off. You’ve shipped the package that is yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k0y481sV4ABUh7-lWm-1RA.png"" /><figcaption>Uber pickup and drop-off</figcaption></figure><h3>Navigating the digital world</h3><p>Consider a typical day using digital interfaces. You log in to your computer or your phone, you find the application you need, navigate through its menus and screens, do what you want to do, close it, move on to the next app. It’s essentially an endless loop of navigation until you log off and go back to the real world.</p><p>This is akin to navigation in the pre-GPS world. There is a certain map of the world — the software’s user interface — and you have to learn it. You “onboard” yourself, and navigate it by paying attention. You are spatially aware of the world that the software has created for you. You know what capabilities it has, or where and how to find them.</p><p>We are increasingly moving towards an intent-based navigation system, or as I think of it, “Uber-ification” of the digital world. Intent-based software comes in two flavors: search-first, and AI-first.</p><p>In search-first applications, you search for keywords, say, “expense report” and it’ll show you potential actions like “View your expense reports” or “File a new expense report”. You select the one you want without knowing where it lives in the application. The geography doesn’t matter.</p><p>In AI-first applications, it’s even more extreme. You declare the intent — “File my expenses” — and the agent handles the rest. You’ve achieved your goal without ever knowing where the expense module is housed in the software, or even how to even file one yourself.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/727/1*Z3AwXnIZWn1Ceh_Qq9795Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: Search-first</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/743/1*0Z9bFsL-7NjcpvzCWKIg1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Intent-driven: AI-first</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a plethora of intent-based software now, with AI embedded in them, eager to translate your intent into outcomes. Traditional navigation is gradually converging into a ubiquitous conversational interface.</p><p>Notion AI promises to write your docs for you. Cursor and Claude promise to write your code. Glean <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/blog/performance-reviews-llms"">writes your performance reviews</a> — the very document that requires sitting with the uncomfortable and hard work of assessing your own year, your team’s contributions, their strengths and weaknesses in your own words. Gemini writes your emails.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/799/1*aJHyzWcesP9jtTOHoRDX8g.png"" /><figcaption>Performance review agent — Generates self-review with a mere prompt. No reflection required</figcaption></figure><p>Each of these <em>smart</em> apps makes you more productive. No navigation required. No blank page to face. No empty file with a cursor blinking. Information architecture — the design of where things live and how they connect — no longer matters. Not to you, at least. The agent navigates for you.</p><h3>Beyond movement: Navigation as a metacognitive skill</h3><p>Consider what happens when you navigate without GPS in an unfamiliar city. You <strong>assess</strong> your current location, <strong>identify</strong> your destination, <strong>survey</strong> available information — landmarks, street signs, smell, sounds, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about which direction to go, <strong>make decisions</strong> with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you move, <strong>adjust</strong>, when you encounter obstacles, wrong turns, or dead ends, and <strong>learn</strong> from the experience, building a richer understanding of the territory.</p><p>Now consider what you do when you’re trying to understand a topic, say, climate change. You <strong>assess</strong> what you currently know or understand, <strong>identify</strong> what you need to know, <strong>survey</strong> available information — documentation, courses, articles, real world case-studies, papers, mental models, <strong>hypothesize</strong> about how it might work, <strong>make decisions</strong> about which path to explore first with incomplete information, <strong>monitor</strong> feedback as you learn, <strong>adjust</strong> your mental model when you hit obstacles, and <strong>learn</strong>, building a richer, more accurate understanding of the system.</p><p>Problem-solving is navigation. Learning is navigation. Decision-making is navigation. You’re moving through space — either real or conceptual — through uncertainty, towards clarity, understanding, destination, or outcomes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d711JP8zbOaFo9j4j8lQUQ.png"" /><figcaption>Navigating to clarity (Image generated using Procreate and Nanobanana)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t a metaphor. <a href=""https://iiif.library.cmu.edu/file/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001/Simon_box00065_fld05031_bdl0001_doc0001.pdf"">Herbert Simon’s work</a> describes problem-solving as “search through a problem-space.” <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5248972/"">Neuroscience has also shown that the same neural systems(the hippocampus, place, and grid cells)</a> support both physical and conceptual navigation. What makes something navigation isn’t whether it moves through a physical space, but rather that it requires relational mapping, position assessment, route planning, and dynamic reorganization.</p><p>So we are navigating pretty much all the time. And it’s becoming easier with technology. So what?</p><p>Just as GPS use causes a measurable decline in our spatial memory, AI tools that navigate conceptual spaces for us pose the same risk in a different, arguably more critical, domain.</p><h3>The Pharmakon and the problem with frictionless</h3><p>Looking at technological innovations through the lens of <a href=""https://aeon.co/essays/bernard-stieglers-philosophy-on-how-technology-shapes-our-world""><em>pharmakon</em></a> — both remedy and poison — remedies are clearly visible: speed, efficiency, productivity, convenience. Even when they’re not, organizations are happy to sell us on them.</p><p>The poisons are more subtle: dependency, agency, losing the cognitive friction that maintains our capacity to navigate. The agent absorbs the cost of navigation, but it also becomes the locus of agency.</p><p>Two risks that stand out, and are worth thinking about:</p><p><strong>The transfer of agency</strong>: By shifting the agency of navigation to the software, you end up being at the mercy of the navigator. <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/performance-reviews-llms"">If the AI routes you, you stop thinking about alternatives.</a> The convenience is paid for with a little bit of your money and a lot more of your agency. With the erasure of navigation, Information Architecture gives way to Choice Architecture.</p><p>This might be fine for filing tax returns. Humanity would benefit from spending less time doing that. But what happens when the same happens with critical thinking? Comprehension? Reflection? Decision-making?</p><p><strong>The vacuum of attention</strong>: With the time and attention you’ve regained from not navigating, you need something meaningful to do. Few people know what to do with that kind of freedom. They look to technology to fill the void. But the incentives of technology companies, more often than not, don’t align with the well-being of the user, especially when the way to make money and user interests are at odds.</p><p>When you’re not navigating and also not driving, there’s the promise of reflecting, reading, thinking, writing, or building. But first, why not catch up on what your friends are doing? Or the Kardashians? Or millions of strangers?</p><p>It presents a dark irony: We save time by delegating things to technology, only to pour that time back into it, mindlessly scrolling.</p><h3>Solutions: For victims and culprits</h3><p>I want to think about solutions to this problem, both as a victim — a consumer and a <em>navigator</em> — and a culprit — someone who builds technology products, and <em>designs </em>navigation.</p><p>I say culprits not because they have bad intentions, but likely because they either lack any or they are acting on misaligned incentives.</p><h3>Micro-frictions as the antidote for the victim</h3><p>I’m learning to be more intentional about what friction I want to eliminate and what I want to preserve. About what navigation I want to do myself versus delegate.</p><p>I use AI every day. It has largely empowered me. But I’m deliberate in its use.</p><p>I resist the temptation to start with AI-generated drafts because the value of writing lies in the struggle to articulate the original thought. It’s that struggle that clarifies what you want to say, what you want to achieve. Only then do I use AI. My process isn’t simply sequential, so the handoff isn’t a clear line. It’s a feedback loop. But the bulk of my effort goes into the pre-AI phase, ensuring that I build a vision for the artifact that I want to produce — whether it’s an essay or software. I can then direct it rather than being led by it.</p><p>For places I visit regularly, I’ve stopped using maps. I’m rebuilding the habit of paying attention to my surroundings.</p><p>I keep my phone away when I’m with my kids, both to be present with them and implicitly teach them the value of paying attention. I find pockets of time severed from technology — sipping coffee, going on walks — which builds the habit of being comfortable alone with my thoughts.</p><p>How is this all related to navigation, you say? Intentionality brings clarity, which in turn helps you navigate effectively.</p><p>If you want to read more about this idea of introducing friction, this article from The Cut captures it well: <a href=""https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-friction-maxxing-new-years-2026-resolution.html""><em>In 2026, We Are Friction-Maxxing</em></a>.</p><h3>Design principles for technologists as culprits</h3><p>This might sound obvious, but when designing technology products, it helps to keep users’ needs <em>and well-being</em> in mind.</p><p><strong>Build robust fallback mechanisms:</strong> In the banking portal, when the “digital-only” system failed, neither the customer nor the employee could navigate an alternative path. The system had eliminated all other routes.</p><p>Before implementing AI assistance or intent-based shortcuts, think about whether the user can complete the task if the feature breaks or is unavailable. Build fallback mechanisms that allow manual navigation when automated paths fail, surface error states that help users understand what went wrong, provide enough context for users to troubleshoot independently, and maintain alternative paths to the same destination.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tGOrUoGbx8Q4_Dqgx6_wrw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/9356221-deploy-fin-ai-agent-over-email"">Fin agent fallback</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Distinguish between transactional and developmental tasks:</strong> When developing automations, distinguish between <strong>transactional tasks</strong> (filing taxes, scheduling meetings, data entry) and <strong>developmental tasks</strong> (writing, learning, problem-solving, decision-making). This is similar to the idea of distinguishing between <a href=""https://outofdesk.blog/thinking-outside-the-doc"">competitive artifacts and complementary artifacts</a>.</p><p>Transactional tasks should be frictionless. These are tasks where efficiency is the primary goal, and there’s little value in the process itself. But developmental tasks benefit from <a href=""https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate"">good friction</a>. The process of navigating uncertainty is often where the real value lies.</p><p><a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/blog/keep-the-robots-out-of-the-gym"">“Gym skills”</a> is a good metaphor. For developmental tasks, consider AI as a collaborator that augments rather than replaces the user’s cognitive work. <a href=""https://www.mozillafoundation.org/en/blog/the-importance-of-friction-in-ai-systems/"">Speculative and Critical Design (SCD)</a> framework lays out one of the most articulate ways to think about this.</p><p><strong>Adjust assistance based on expertise:</strong> Design systems that adjust assistance levels based on user expertise, because effective delegation requires good judgment on the user’s part.</p><p>Beginners benefit from more guidance, explanations, and visible structure to help them build mental models of the system. Intermediate users can make effective use of shortcuts and intent-based features, but in a way that traditional navigation is visible and accessible. Expert users demand customizability, creating their own navigation paths, or even disabling assistance they don’t need.</p><p>The problem with many AI-first products is that they apply the same level of automation to everyone, preventing users from ever developing expertise. A newly minted manager using AI to completely delegate the work of crafting performance reviews for the team, for example, isn’t going to build the muscle of reflecting on the relationships with people, paying attention to their motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.</p><p><strong>Preserve visible structure:</strong> Even with search-first or AI-first interfaces, users benefit from understanding the underlying structure. Consider <strong>visual sitemaps or navigation breadcrumbs</strong> that show users where they are in the system, <strong>contextual hints</strong> about where information lives, even when delivering it through search, and <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> that reveals structure as users engage more deeply with the product.</p><p><a href=""https://www.aiuxdesign.guide/"">aiuxdesign.guide</a> has a comprehensive set of design patterns that mention some of these and more, with real-world examples.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>There are a few pockets of life that haven’t been taken over by assistive and active technology. Building the muscle to tolerate (and design) good friction and (help) reclaiming the ownership of your attention are good starts to prepare for what’s ahead.

<h4><em>How product teams should evaluate AI-generated UI</em></h4><p>AI app-building tools have made it inconsequential and mundane to turn an idea into a working prototype. You only need a couple prompts, a design file, or even a sketch to quickly generate something that looks (even behaves) like a real product. For product teams, this speed has changed expectations in the design and development process.</p><p>Prototypes are no longer as special as they once were. They’re now the bare minimum.</p><p>But this speed comes with limitations. Many AI-generated prototypes are never meant to survive past the moment they’re validated. They do their job in a meeting or a user test, but then they’re rebuilt by engineering or even trashed. But the prototypes didn’t “fail,” they were just created with a different intention and outcome.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes is that they can’t move forward. And when the underlying output is treated as “disposable” automatically, product teams pay for it later in the product lifecycle through translation work, rewrites, and reduced speed.</p><figure><img alt=""Creating AI-prototypes in Anima and Replit tools"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tQwxealvhwQ05oy5oeR0CQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools have changed the design-dev workflow; can prototypes thrive through product stages?</em></figcaption></figure><p>It’s no question that AI has become part of everyday product development. But it’s no longer just how fast we can generate UI, it’s more about what kind of output we are creating. We need to think past prototypes that can be used for a 30 minute stakeholder review, such as thinking about what happens after the ideation stage ends.</p><p>Some tools are optimized for ideation and to quickly answer questions. But others are beginning to treat AI output as the first draft of real product work. Let’s get into understanding how AI prototypes can survive the product lifecycle, tools that are better for different prototype use cases, and criteria to help product teams choose the right prototype for their needs.</p><h3>What it means for an AI prototype to “survive”</h3><p>Most product teams don’t struggle to generate UI anymore. But they do have a challenge in deciding whether what they’ve generated is something they can both keep and use.</p><h4>It’s more than visual polish</h4><p>AI-generated prototypes can look visually polished and even behave as intended, but it still may not survive past the ideation phase. We need to think about what the prototype allows a product team to do after ideation.</p><p>Some questions to ask when deciding if your prototype will survive past ideation:</p><ul><li>Can the prototype be extended without starting over?</li><li>Can it be handed off without being reinterpreted?</li><li>Can it live outside the AI tool that created it?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Design visuals and code output produced by Framer, but is limited to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oZwkGkR7NdhBq_lFLRSHnw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> automatically produces code for the visuals generated, but can it live outside Framer?</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you begin to think about the extensibility of your prototype too late (like after it’s been validated), you might quickly reach a dead end. Though the UI looks high-quality and finished, it deceives what’s lying under the hood in the actual output.</p><p>Not only that, many AI-generated prototypes are abstract. They render well in the tool that created them, but the underlying structure is hazy or even constricted to the AI tool. These prototypes do help answer early questions, like “Does this flow make sense?,” but they’re difficult to carry forward without translation or rework.</p><h4>Proper structure outlasts visuals</h4><p>Durable prototypes are built from real frontend formatting, like structured markup, predictable layout, and clear component usage. This structure makes the prototype legible to engineers, collaborators, and the AI tools themselves.</p><p>When the prototype’s output is inspectable and portable to other tools, it can be understood and evolved.</p><figure><img alt=""Code output from Anima App that prioritizes production-readiness and portability"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wt9uB0MxkXLJ4PUX2_f0_w.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima App</em></a><em> generates designs and code intended to be used outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>AI tools can only amplify the inputs and outputs you continue to build from. Abstract AI output compounds into rework with teams regenerating or rebuilding what already exists. But clean, structured output encourages faster iteration and usable output because each change builds on the last.</p><p>An AI prototype’s “lifespan” reflects what the tool was optimized to create. Understanding the distinction between a disposable or durable helps teams choose tools that match what they intend to build.</p><h3>How AI app-building tools optimize for different lifespans</h3><p>Once you start looking at AI-generated prototypes in terms of their lifespan, you’ll notice patterns across popular AI tools available to product teams. You’re probably assuming that AI app-building tools are all trying to do the same thing, like producing high-quality designs and code.</p><p>But these AI tools are actually optimized for different stages in the product lifecycle. Most fall under three main buckets: full-stack generators, visual builders, or design-native generators. Let’s look at familiar tools found in each bucket.</p><h4>Full-stack AI generators</h4><p>Full-stack generators like Bolt, Lovable, and Replit are designed to produce end-to-end applications quickly. They can handle the generated app’s infrastructure, hosting, and behavior for multiple user flows. These tools are powerful when experimenting or needing quick product deployments.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-stack AI tools like Replit create rapid prototypes for desktop and mobile"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RBqDSAceLsOOOPUDy3qTqg.png"" /><figcaption><em>AI tools like </em><a href=""https://replit.com/products/design""><em>Replit</em></a><em> are ideal for small product teams with rapid timelines</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Extremely fast method to go from idea to working application</li><li>Low setup needed for end-to-end generation</li><li>Allows quick validation for solo or small teams</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Code output is typically bound to the tool that generated it</li><li>Code structure prioritizes quick execution over long-term durability</li><li>Harder integrate the frontend work into existing codebases</li><li>Less flexibility when engineers need more control</li></ul><h4>Visual building tools</h4><p>Visual builders such as Webflow and Framer are ideal for creating polished experiences that live within the platform itself. They’re well-suited for marketing sites or even personal websites where the tool itself is part of the delivery method. Since the AI tool is also the production environment, handoff of frontend code to engineering is secondary or unnecessary.</p><figure><img alt=""Visual builders like Framer produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool itself"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3ckByB8Nntl2Mvs1kD7TMw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Visual builders like </em><a href=""https://www.framer.com/""><em>Framer</em></a><em> produce responsive and visual UI, but are constrained to the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>High-fidelity, production-quality visual output</li><li>Supports publishing, hosting, and content management workflows</li><li>Designers can own and ship real experiences</li><li>Reliable for marketing and personal websites</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Exported code is not intended for strategic evolution</li><li>Included logic in the frontend is dependent on the platform</li><li>Restricts deep engineering customization and may need rework</li></ul><h4>Design-native generators</h4><p>Design-native generation tools, like Figma Make, are ideal for high-speed exploration. They help teams iterate on structure, layout, and user flow directly inside the design tool. The output is effective as a reference when reviewing and testing, but it’s not intended to be integrated in a production codebase.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma Make is integrated within the design tool, but it’s focused more on visual output versus code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Igk5W5dDfw6FN99LpI2JSQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1IssNgKM28""><em>Figma Make</em></a><em> is integrated within the design tool, but the output focuses on visual vs. code output</em></figcaption></figure><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Fast iteration inside existing design-product workflows</li><li>Smooth exploration for UI layouts and user flows</li><li>Effective for early validation and team collaboration</li></ul><p>Limitations:</p><ul><li>Output is a reference versus a code foundation</li><li>Engineers may need to rebuild rather than extend the frontend code</li><li>Optimized for exploration, but not product maturation</li></ul><p>None of these tool approaches are inherently better or worse, but teams need to understand what each tool is optimized to do. Whether it be to answer questions early in the ideation phase or to publish product experience. They just reflect different assumptions about what happens after a prototype proves its point.</p><h3>Designing AI-generated prototypes to continue past ideation</h3><p>Most AI-generated prototypes were created to answer questions or validate a direction while in the ideation phase. They weren’t produced to become part of the actual product.</p><p>But instead of asking, “How fast can we generate this?,” teams need to start asking, “What happens if this works?” That shift changes what kind of output matters and the right tool to use.</p><p>To help with this shift, teams need to generate prototypes that are made from the same fundamentals as production. This includes real HTML elements, predictable layout, and clear UI components to make the output understandable to engineers and other tools.</p><h4>AI accelerates continuity or disposability</h4><p>This is where the output’s effects on AI are unavoidable. Because each AI-generation builds on what already exists, unstructured output compounds issues–causing regenerating or rebuilding the same ideas again and again.</p><p>So prototypes designed to continue get better as the AI-generations evolve, while prototypes designed to be temporary get replaced.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima generates prototypes starting from Figma designs, live websites, or brand inspiration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tl2SNCCCw0yqtdTvE_npRw.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> can generate prototypes starting from Figma designs or live websites</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Tools that create durable AI prototypes</h4><p>Real products progress from existing interfaces/ patterns or partial designs; not from blank prompts. Tools that support starting from design files, live URLs, or existing UI allow teams to preserve context instead of recreating it within a prompt.</p><p>AI tools like Anima approach producing prototypes this way. The tool focuses on creating structured, real frontend code that can be handed off to development versus showing a high-quality render of UI designs.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uDzBp4JfFjnUDNhD-uiUkg.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/""><em>Anima</em></a><em> creates both high-fidelity visuals and code ready to be exported outside the tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Anima’s prototypes include added value not only from their usability from the get-go, but by reducing translation work once engineers begin to review the code output.</p><p>Designing AI prototypes doesn’t mean every prototype has to be production-ready. It just means product teams can choose whether the work they’re creating is meant to be disposable or durable.</p><h3>How teams should decide what kind of prototype they’re building</h3><p>Before evaluating any AI app-building tool, product teams need to clarify a few questions to select relevant criteria to rate each tool against. This will allow teams to use tools more intentionally and avoid the disposal of work later in the design lifecycle.</p><p>Questions teams should ask themselves:</p><ul><li>What is this prototype meant to do? (i.e., validate an idea vs. create production work)</li><li>What happens after idea validation? (i.e., restart/ re-build vs. handoff to engineers)</li><li>Should code output be modified outside the AI tool? (or is it okay for output to be bound to the tool?)</li><li>Should the code and AI tool support long-term iteration? (or is the output only for one-off ideas?)</li></ul><p>If your team’s goals are to validate ideas quickly, disposable prototypes are a wanted tool outcome versus a flaw. But if the goal is to create prototypes that will evolve into production, you’ll need AI tools that support that.</p><figure><img alt=""The AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables, like useful visuals or useful code"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UMQymkGoKbUlTF5NWrje0g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Selecting an AI tool for your team depends on your workflow and the intended deliverables</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Optimize for the prototype lifespan you need</h4><p>Different tools optimize for different lifespans; here is a key to help make quick decisions:</p><ul><li>Short-lived artifacts that answer questions quickly → Design-native generators</li><li>Platform-contained experiences that publish efficiently → Visual building tools</li><li>Structured outputs that can serve as production foundations → Full-stack AI generators</li></ul><p>Again, none of these tools are superior. The right choice just depends on how long the work is expected to “live” and who will own it from iteration to iteration.</p><p>When teams evaluate tools based on intention, like what they’ll be able to keep or build on, they shift their mindset from only speed alone to idea continuity.</p><p>AI has dramatically lowered the cost of starting in such a short time-span. Quickly generating interfaces, user flows, and functional apps is no longer the hard part. But now, it isn’t how quickly product teams can produce prototypes, it’s how much of that work they can carry forward.</p><p>The hidden cost of AI prototypes isn’t that they fail to deliver. It’s that many were never designed to. Product teams need to evaluate tools based on what they generate as well as what they help advance to move away from disposable prototypes to evolving beginnings.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=00cc4d491dec"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-hidden-cost-of-ai-prototypes-that-are-made-to-die-00cc4d491dec"">The hidden cost of AI prototypes that are made to die</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Tools like Maze, Dovetail, Outset AI, and Listen Labs have compressed what used to take six to eight weeks into hours.</p><p>The global AI-based research services market is projected to grow from roughly $8 billion in 2025 to over $35 billion by 2035, according to <a href=""https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/ai-based-research-services-market"">Future Market Insights</a>:</p><blockquote>“During the first five-year period from 2025 to 2030, the market increases from USD 7,972.1 million to USD 16,804.0 million… AI-accelerated survey analytics dominates this period with 38.3% share, as enterprises increasingly automate survey feedback and real-time opinion tracking.”</blockquote><p>The commodity layer of research is being automated, and it is happening fast.</p><p>This is good, and it's terrifying.</p><p>Good, because the structured, repeatable parts of research have been heading toward automation for a while. I was using UserTesting.com over high-volume concept testing, quick-turn usability studies, and pattern recognition across large datasets. Machines are better at speed and scale. A <a href=""https://www.displayr.com/ai-in-market-research-today-trends-tools-and-whats-next/"">Displayr study</a> found that 85% of researchers said automated tools have already improved their workflow:</p><blockquote>“What once took weeks of manual labor can now be achieved in days — or even hours — freeing researchers to focus on the strategic questions that really matter.”</blockquote><p>Terrifying, because the industry is confusing data collection with understanding… two fundamentally different things. And if you have built your career on the gathering side of that equation, you are now competing with software that works faster, cheaper, and around the clock.</p><h3>The gathering is not the knowing: Where AI tools fall short</h3><p>Hot take: the hardest part of research was never gathering the data.</p><p>The hard part is <em>making sense</em> of what you find in the context of a business that has politics, constraints, competing priorities, and customers who say one thing and do another.</p><p>AI platforms work from their own interview data. They can surface the top themes from 50 conversations and present them in a tidy dashboard… Great!</p><p>What they cannot do is synthesize those themes against your:</p><ul><li>Analytics</li><li>Competitive landscape</li><li>Organizational dynamics</li><li>And the thing your VP said in a hallway conversation last Tuesday that reframed the entire strategic direction (Yes, this happens all the time)</li></ul><p>That synthesis layer requires <strong>judgment</strong>. It requires presence. It requires years of accumulated pattern recognition that no language model can replicate, because it depends on <strong>understanding your organization</strong>, not just your users.</p><p>Svend Brinkmann warned about the <a href=""https://tidsskrift.dk/qual/article/view/6273"">“McDonaldization” of qualitative research</a> over a decade ago: the reduction of a craft-based discipline into standardized, repeatable processes optimized for efficiency.</p><p>AI has accelerated that trajectory. A <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/research-metrics-and-analytics/articles/10.3389/frma.2024.1331589/full"">2025 study in Frontiers in Research Metrics and Analytics</a> found that AI’s emphasis on structured, data-driven processes risks reinforcing positivist assumptions in qualitative work, losing the relational, situated, and cultural richness that makes qualitative research worth doing in the first place:</p><blockquote>“Automated programmes with clear rules and formulae consistently followed each time do not work well under interpretivism’s assumptions. Researchers who use a general artificial intelligence agent only cover the rules-based epistemological spectrum of positivism.”</blockquote><p>Lincoln and Guba said it best in 1985: The instrument of choice in qualitative research is the human. Humans are responsive to environmental cues, able to collect information at multiple levels simultaneously, and capable of exploring the unexpected. A machine can present raw material and initial patterns.</p><p>The act of meaning-making remains a <em>uniquely</em> human endeavor.</p><h3>Where humans must excel</h3><p>If the data collection layer is being commoditized, the question for every researcher becomes: what is left? The answer is everything that matters. But “everything that matters” demands specificity. Here are the five domains where human researchers are irreplaceable, and where the best practitioners are already doubling down.</p><h4><strong>1. Strategic synthesis across multiple inputs</strong></h4><p>AI gives you themes. A skilled researcher gives you a decision. The real value of research has always been the “so what should we actually do?” layer: integrating user data with business context, market dynamics, and organizational realities to produce recommendations that drive action.</p><p>This means your research readout cannot end with “here is what users said.” It must end with “here is what we should build, stop building, or invest in next, and here is why.”</p><p>If your deliverables do not connect to revenue, retention, or competitive positioning, you are delivering a report. The AI can do that now.</p><h4><strong>2. The relationship and trust layer</strong></h4><p>When organizations invest in research, they are buying judgment. They need someone who can push back on stakeholder assumptions, read a room, change a presentation on the fly, and tell a leadership team something they do not want to hear in a way they can actually hear it. This skill compounds over time. The researcher who understands a client’s organizational politics, who has built credibility with a skeptical CPO, who knows which battles to pick and which to table for next quarter, that person is not a vendor. They are a strategic partner. No platform replicates that.</p><h4><strong>3. Cross-cultural and international depth</strong></h4><p>AI interviews work well in English and a handful of other languages. The nuance of cross-cultural research, including regulatory differences, market-by-market strategy, and the things people mean but do not say, requires researchers who have spent years embedded in those markets.</p><p>No language model has lived in São Paulo, navigated regulatory frameworks in Mumbai, or understood why a French consumer’s “<em>No</em>” means something different than an American’s. As companies expand globally, this skill becomes a multiplier, not a nice-to-have.</p><h4><strong>4. Complex qualitative methods</strong></h4><p>Diary studies. Ethnography. Longitudinal research. Contextual inquiry in physical environments. These are immersive methods that require presence, adaptation, and the kind of rapport that only happens between people. They cannot be compressed into a chatbot interface.</p><p>And they produce the kind of deep, contextual insight that drives transformative product decisions, the kind of insight that a theme cluster in a dashboard will never surface. Even the AI knows this. When <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11103925/"">Hitch et al.</a> asked ChatGPT to perform qualitative analysis, the model responded:</p><blockquote>“As an AI language model, I cannot perform qualitative analysis on the data above as it requires a more nuanced understanding of context, and the ability to interpret and analyze human language in context.”</blockquote><p>When the tool itself tells you it cannot do the work, that is worth paying attention to.</p><h4><strong>5. AI decision advisory</strong></h4><p>This is the frontier most researchers are ignoring entirely, and the one with the most upside.</p><p>As organizations deploy AI agents, copilots, and automated workflows, someone needs to figure out where those systems should and should not operate.</p><blockquote>How do you design human-AI workflows? Where does automation create value, and where does it destroy trust? What gets delegated to an agent, and what requires a human in the loop?</blockquote><p>These are research questions. They require researchers who understand both the technology and the humans it serves. The companies making the best AI decisions right now are not the ones with the best models. They are the ones with the best judgment about where to apply them. If you are not building fluency here, you are leaving the most strategic seat at the table empty.</p><h3>The researcher’s new job description</h3><p>The researchers who thrive in this landscape will be the ones who make the best decisions from data that is already abundant. This requires a shift in how you think about your role. Here is a framework for evaluating where you stand and what to do about it.</p><h4><strong>Three questions to ask yourself:</strong></h4><ol><li>Does my contribution on this project require judgment that depends on context a machine does not have? If yes, you are in the strategic layer. If no, you are doing work that will be automated within 18 months.</li><li>Does my deliverable connect research findings to a business decision? If your output is a report that summarizes what users said, that is commodity work. If your output is a recommendation backed by synthesis across multiple data sources, that is strategy.</li><li>Am I building relationships that make my judgment more valuable over time? Institutional knowledge, stakeholder trust, and cross-functional credibility are compounding assets. They are the moat.</li></ol><h4><strong>Build the skills that sit on top of the data</strong></h4><p>Learn to read a P&amp;L statement. Understand how your company makes pricing decisions. Shadow a sales call. Sit in on a board prep meeting. The researchers who will lead this industry are the ones who can walk into a room of executives and connect a research finding to a revenue outcome in language the CFO understands.</p><p>That is not a natural extension of most research training programs. It is the gap you need to close, and closing it is entirely within your control.</p><h4><strong>Use AI tools aggressively for the commodity layer</strong></h4><p>Do not resist the tools. Use them. Automate your transcription, your initial coding, your pattern recognition across large datasets. Let the machine handle what it handles well so you can spend more time on synthesis, strategy, and the client conversations that actually move the needle.</p><p>A <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11103925/"">2024 study published in PMC</a> put it plainly: AI can augment, but not replace, the work of human researchers in producing rigorous analysis, so long as it is applied in a mindful and ethical manner.</p><p>Treat AI tools the way a skilled carpenter treats a power tool: useful for speed, dangerous if you let it do your thinking.</p><h4><strong>Start advising on AI decisions, not just user decisions</strong></h4><p>Every organization is asking some version of the same question right now: Where should we use AI, and where should we not? Researchers are uniquely positioned to answer this because the question is fundamentally about human behavior, trust, and context.</p><p>Start volunteering for AI strategy conversations. Offer to run evaluations of AI-powered workflows. Frame your expertise around the question that every executive is losing sleep over: How do we deploy this technology without alienating the people it is supposed to serve?</p><h4><strong>Position yourself as the person who turns signal into decisions</strong></h4><p>This is the through-line. Every skill on this list, every shift in how you approach your work, comes back to one distinction: Are you gathering signal, or are you turning signal into decisions? The first is being commoditized. The second is becoming more valuable every day.</p><p>If your work ends with a research readout, you are on the wrong side of that line. If your work ends with a decision that moves the business, i.e. your make the business money, you are <em>exactly</em> where you need to be.</p><h3>The Opportunity</h3><p>The research industry is being reorganized, but this is just a correction. For years, the value of research was bottlenecked by the logistics of data collection. It took weeks to recruit, schedule, conduct, transcribe, and analyze.</p><p>The practitioners who could manage that pipeline were valuable because the pipeline was hard. Now the pipeline is easy. And the people who always knew that the pipeline was not the point, that the real work starts after the data is collected, those people are about to have their moment.</p><p>The strategic layer of research is becoming <em>more</em> valuable, not less. Those of us who have spent years building judgment, who can synthesize across messy inputs, who can advise on the hardest questions organizations face about AI, growth, and customer strategy… we are holding the one asset that cannot be automated. And for the first time, the logistics of data collection are no longer standing between us and the work that actually matters.</p><p>This is the best time in a generation to be a researcher who thinks strategically. The noise is being filtered by machines. The signal is waiting for someone with the judgment to act on it.</p><p>The tools got smarter… the question is whether you did too.</p><p><a href=""https://www.joshlamar.com/""><em>Josh LaMar</em></a><em> is a product growth strategy and AI decision advisor with over 20 years in product, technology, and customer strategy.

While I thought I was getting fired or about to get started on an urgent design ask, he just wanted to talk about philosophy &amp; K-Pop. As jarring as that was, I found it hilarious. During one of those calls, he shared an anecdote about how he helped his daughter with a college essay using ChatGPT. I used to work as a writing tutor, so any use of ChatGPT in the writing process struck me as suspicious. But, what they did with AI for her essay was actually brilliant.</p><p>He suggested that she write out the full essay with reckless abandon for citing sources: no reference formatting, no concern for straw-manned arguments, accurate quotes, or making sure paraphrases are in her own words. Rather, just write all the ideas down first. Then, upload the essay to ChatGPT and have it run a plagiarism check, finding the sources the draft is referencing. From there, they would review the ‘plagiarized’ sources, cite &amp; quote them properly, or remove the content from the essay, and weave it into her original work.</p><p>While, at first glance, I had my reservations, I realized this approach didn’t replace her voice or her original work; it reduced friction in her writing process. Here’s why: She first began writing everything on her own &amp; without AI, so the tone, style, and phrasing were hers alone. Second, while she might be inaccurate or wrong about how she alluded to or referenced sources, all that can be corrected later. Lastly, she had ChatGPT handle the critical &amp; clerical work: suggesting revisions, searching for relevant sources, and helping her integrate them properly into whatever citation style her class required. AI wasn’t writing the essay for her, she was using AI effectively by keeping her “authentic voice… to <em>enhance</em> expression, not to replace original thought,” as the <em>Enago Academy</em> would couch it.¹ Her voice came first, ChatGPT came second.</p><p>At the writing center I worked for, students could ask for help with anything from brainstorming paper topics to final edits. Our job was to guide students by keeping them on topic, catching blindspots, grammatical mistakes, and shaping the general structure. We gave them the feedback, but the students still had to apply it. The same is true for setting up AI as a writing tutor. I’ll argue that AI platforms setup with a tutoring persona can preserve a writer’s creative integrity and remove friction for research &amp; citing sources. I’ll demonstrate this through a reverse-engineering drafting (or reDraft) process for writing.</p><p>Before laying the process out, I’ll explain why we should care about writing, how AI can complement it, and some caveats to consider. Then, I’ll provide a high-level overview of the reDraft process, and go through it step by step on how I used it for my last article, noting what worked well &amp; what I would have done differently.</p><h3>Get behind me, AI writer</h3><p>You’re reading this article, which indicates you value writing already. Writing for our own sakes is important for many reasons too: it organizes our thinking, allows us to contribute our knowledge, and works as a self-teaching mechanism. If you can write about a given subject, it’s clear you understand it. I know many designers &amp; former colleagues in philosophy who have great things to say. My hope is to encourage the would-be writers who have insights to share with a process that fast-tracks them through the drafting stage and into editing.</p><p>That being said, using AI for written work or any creative material is tricky. On the one hand, it can operate as a great on-demand feedback generator. When writing centers are closed — or I’m just not in an easy or quick environment to get feedback — having something give me writing a second look has benefited me greatly. I still believe human feedback is more valuable — especially for brainstorming, style, and tone at least — but it’s nice to have something that compares sources, grammatical mistakes, and mechanics quickly too.</p><p>On the other hand, the temptation is to let AI creep into your work as a co-author or a ghostwriter. While some can differentiate the AI slop from crafted work, it’s becoming more difficult to tell when something is solely generated by AI. At the worst of times, people may just post completely AI-generated content and claim it as their own. I’ll take a firm stance against that approach. So, if you’re expecting an AI-first writing process, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. AI comes second here.</p><h3>A tale of two processes</h3><h4><em>Building snowmen</em></h4><p>Before any AI tools, my traditional writing process was more akin to Randy Ingermanson’s <em>Snowflake Method</em>. While that was geared towards long-form fiction, it served me well for nonfiction &amp; academic writing too. The idea was to start with a sentence capturing your general thought, idea, or argument and then continuously expand that sentence into a paragraph, from a paragraph to a page, and so on. It’s a <em>fractal</em> process, like how a snowflake is a fractal shape of itself.² So, I may have started with a thesis statement and then thought through how I needed to support my claim.</p><p>But I had serious struggles — like many others — with writer’s block, uncertain about direction in both my ideas &amp; method, and struggled with getting thoughts to paper even when I knew what I wanted to say. Usually, I enjoy the grind of a process, but I rarely did for writing.</p><h4><em>Throwing clay</em></h4><p>Pairing my tutoring experience with my director’s brilliance, my goal was to standardize his idea into a process to get me back on track with writing. His insight to ‘reverse engineer’ finding relevant sources, could be extrapolated in other areas of writing: drafting, revisions, alt-text, image captions, SEO, etc. Further &amp; most importantly, I wanted to maintain creative ownership, integrity, and approach this process with a solid ethical foundation.</p><p>The phrase <em>reverse-engineered drafting</em> is fitting because it inverts the snowflake method completely: crank out all the content and then clean it up. I rarely would just sit down &amp; write everything without worry for what my overall draft looks like, tone, voice, and grammar — all of which I should care about later in the editing stage. By way of analogy, think of the snowflake method like basket weaving by starting with one long leaf and continuously adding more and more to create a basket.</p><p>Alternatively, the reverse-engineered drafting, or <em>reDraft</em>, process is more akin to throwing clay in the sense that you start with an unformed lump that’s morphed into a pot. I soon realized that early drafts have a lot to offer; and this isn’t exclusive to the reDraft process either. AI can help shed some light through the muck like a writing tutor can help clarify some points that your paper could be saying without robbing the author of ownership.</p><p>I know AI isn’t required for a reverse-engineered approach in the way I’m describing, either; that’s perfectly fine. But for myself, I fall into so many tangents, get into the weeds on details that aren’t pertinent and sometimes end up writing nothing at all. It could take months or years (looking at my publishing history on Medium), before I actually finish a full draft. Just giving myself the permission to work with an unformed lump for a draft, knowing that AI can give me some clear feedbac,k was enough for me to crank out some undercooked, yet fully-baked thoughts.</p><p>If you’re wondering whether I used the reDraft process on this article, I absolutely did. And, of course, I asked AI for feedback on how to standardize &amp; refine the reDraft process too. I have a dedicated Perplexity Space called “Writer’s Room” that runs off the reDraft process. In what’s to come, though, I’ll walk through the process in detail, step by step, in case you’d want to bring it to your frontier model of choice. I’ll also share a link to the custom instructions I use on Perplexity as well.</p><h3>Reverse-engineered drafting</h3><p>With AI’s help, of course, I’ve distilled this down to a 5-step process from conception to submission. Depending on how much I already know about a subject, whether I’m constructing an argument or exploring an idea, the early steps may look slightly different. I’ll explain more when we go into more detail about each step.</p><p>In addition to Perplexity, I use Obsidian to help me keep track of where I’m at in the process with multiple note files as drafts with specific naming conventions. I’ll be sure to share those, too, that I’ll add after each step’s description. For now, let’s look at the process as a whole.</p><h4>reDraft process</h4><ul><li><strong>Step 1: </strong>free-form drafting (1 FF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 2: </strong>rough feedback (2 RF draft)</li><li><strong>Step 3: </strong>revision rounds (3 R# revision)</li><li><strong>Step 4: </strong>quality check (4 QA check</li><li><strong>Step 5: </strong>final review (published title)</li></ul><p>I’ll use my last article, “<a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/useful-ads-7899e1711157"">Designing useful ads</a>,” to walk through each step in more detail since it was both an idea I wanted to explore &amp; to test out this process.³ I’ll share what worked well, learnings from mistakes I made, and some adjustments I did.</p><p>For reference, here’s how I organize my Obsidian notes based on the naming conventions for each of the five steps.</p><figure><img alt=""Sidebar view of an Obsidian-style note list titled “Frontier AI ads,” showing a sequential set of files named “0 idea — advertisements in AI chats,” “1 FF draft — ads in frontier AI,” “2 RF draft — ads in frontier AI,” three “3 R1/R2/R3 revision — ads in frontier AI” entries, “4 QA — ads in frontier AI,” and a final citation-style line, “Walsh, Tanner (2026) Designing useful ads.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yX4JvumR4DZnc2RuDtkS0g.png"" /><figcaption>Obsidian sidebar showing the full reDraft workflow for the “Frontier AI ads” article from initial idea through free‑form draft, rough feedback, three revision rounds, and quality check; and it ends in the final citation for “Designing useful ads.”</figcaption></figure><h4>Step 1: Free-form drafting</h4><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Begin writing without concern for spelling, grammar, or perfect citations. Focus on getting all ideas, arguments, visuals and references onto the page. Loosely note sources or ideas as you write.</em></blockquote><p>This step is about writing &amp; more writing. Get all the ideas on paper with that same reckless abandon, ignoring not only proper citations but also proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, paper structure, and having a clear thesis. Easier said than done, of course; I care too much about spelling &amp; grammar still. Yet, speed is key for step one. The more you have written down, the more you have to work with later.</p><p>With my last article, I began with general ideas and gave each paragraph an H4 heading in Obsidian that captured the thought for me. Because of the outline view and that headings can collapse like accordions, Obsidian makes it easy to quickly track &amp; scan a working draft. Here’s how that looked for me in step one:</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Obisidian article draft in dark‑mode showing the “Intro” section with two subsections and a collapsed accordion section: a “YouTube &amp; Spotify example” paragraph describing how ads slowly appeared on free services and frustrated users, and a “frontier models &amp; search engines” paragraph comparing frontier AI models to search engines with sponsored tags and banner blindness, ending by noting an opportunity to add ads smartly."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MoGTcAbBImMs8vV7a32LPw.png"" /><figcaption>Draft intro section for the frontier AI ads article with H4 headings to convey each paragraph’s idea in Obsidian.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s quick, messy, fairly coherent, but also some word vomit. But that’s the point. I can go back &amp; clean up what I wanted to say about YouTube during the editing stage.</p><h4><em>Reverse-engineering a brainstorm</em></h4><p>There’s another article idea I’m exploring about whether data trackers can help increase virtuous behavior. I have a Garmin watch &amp; a background in philosophy, so I know a bit about data tracking &amp; virtue ethics. What I don’t know is much about how the general data-tracking community might take data tracking to the extreme nor what the ethical implications of that might be. So, I wanted to learn more in two ways: top sources &amp; controversies. For this, I tend to use the following prompt as a starting point:</p><ul><li>“What are the top stories in [subject/topic] and what are people divided on?”</li></ul><p>If I’m just eager to write about <em>something</em> but nothing comes to mind, I might plug in either of these prompts into Perplexity:</p><ul><li>“Here are my interests [list of my interests], what are some topics I could consider writing about?”</li><li>“Generate writing prompts for me to explore based on my interests”</li></ul><p>AI is great for brainstorming &amp; giving some initial direction to start writing from scratch. I keep it ethical by making sure I’m doing the research though, looking through the summarized sources, and thinking about my own stance on the matter. AI is solely providing a general direction for me to do that. And I can narrow my focus, sources, and clarify my own position, taking notes for my Zettlekasten-inspired Obsidian vault to draw from later.</p><h4><em>Visual assets</em></h4><p>Since I work as a UX designer, Figma (and similar tools) works great for quick visuals to illustrate a point or make themed article banners like I have. I’ll create a page in a “writing” file for each article specifically with a component library that maintains a consistent color scheme &amp; typography.</p><figure><img alt=""Figma canvas showing a large black banner with a white roadside billboard mockup that reads “Driver in the red Camry, your left headlight is out. Take Exit 12 for Redline Autoshop. Typical fix for $75–120,” alongside the words “Useful ads,” with smaller UI mockups beneath illustrating conventional and “smart” AI ad responses and contextual panels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*33L56B9WwY9gJkDmxe0XkA.png"" /><figcaption>Banner &amp; UI explorations for the frontier AI ads article: a “Useful ads” billboard warning a red Camry driver about a broken headlight, paired with AI interface mocks that reframe ads as contextual cards, coupons, and right‑rail panels designed to be genuinely helpful.</figcaption></figure><p>Figma recently added a generic component library making it easy for me to quickly wire out an AI chat interface to illustrate my points &amp; examples. Further, now that more AI features are in Figma, I had an easier time working with placeholder content and didn’t have to use <em>lorem</em> text anywhere. Until I had those visuals ready, I just added placeholders in the draft like so:</p><p>Before having my Perplexity Space give some feedback on it, I polished up the formatting a little by giving each paragraph an H4 heading that I may have missed earlier and clearly explain in my prompt what is meant to be placeholder in my draft. Sometimes the thesis comes later though too, which was true for the AI ads article. So, I’ll quickly take a shot on what point I’m trying to make that I can change up later if needed. For this I started with: <em>ads in AI can be useful and done better</em>. Sure it’s not punchy, that detailed, or even helpful; but it gets my aim in a nutshell.</p><h3>Step 2: Rough feedback</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Upload the draft for feedback on:<br />- Structure: Logical flow and overall organization<br />- Thesis/Focus: Clarity and specificity of the central idea<br />- Flesh-out: Fill out details for core argument &amp; ideas<br />- Sources: Relevance and sufficiency of cited material<br />- Blind Spots: Identify missing context, underdeveloped arguments, or evidence</em></blockquote><p>I’ll export the free-form draft as a PDF and begin a thread in my “Writer’s Room” Perplexity Space. I typically write a prompt like this:</p><ul><li>“I have a free-form draft for a new article idea I’m writing as an attached PDF. So step 1 in the reDraft process is done. Provide initial feedback for Step 2. (attached PDF)”</li></ul><p>After all the feedback is generated, I have Perplexity compile it into a list of to-do items for me to tackle too.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of a dark‑mode Perplexity response showing a four‑part “Step 2” revision checklist titled “Thesis / Central Focus,” “Structure &amp; Logical Flow,” “Core Sections &amp; Main Argument,” and “Facts, Sources, &amp; Credibility,” each with short bullet points about clarifying the thesis, adding headings, defining concepts, and verifying sources."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cbPwA_KItM-yVkJDaaeLnQ.png"" /><figcaption>The Step 2 revision checklist I used for the frontier AI ads article, outlining how to tighten the thesis, restructure sections, flesh out the main argument, and shore up sources before moving on to detailed line edits.</figcaption></figure><p>If I’m struggling with a particular item, I’ll bring it to Perplexity and treat it like a writing tutorial. For example, my initial thesis lacked clarity &amp; direction. So, I asked Perplexity how it might phrase my thesis statement. While tutoring students, I would help them sharpen theses in a similar fashion, going back &amp; forth on several revisions with different wording, sentence structure, aim, and focus. I’d suggest my take on it, then the student would bounce back with theirs. Well, the same is true here:</p><p><strong><em>1 Perplexity’s suggestion:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Close‑cropped dark‑mode chat snippet showing Perplexity’s message: “Got it. How about this as a next draft:” followed by the thesis sentence about advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risking frustration and brand trust while frontier AI models can integrate them smartly into threads and responses, enhancing utility instead of disappearing into banner blindness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QFGrj0tqdRFqeitmcS9ROA.png"" /><figcaption>Perplexity’s follow-up thesis suggestion for the frontier AI ads article, proposing a version that frames ads as smartly woven into AI threads and responses rather than lost to classic banner blindness.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>2 My revision:</em></strong></p><blockquote>While advertisements in any free service risk user frustration &amp; brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to subvert user expectations for advertisements in a way that enhances the value of AI threads &amp; responses without compromising utility.</blockquote><p><strong><em>3 Perplexity’s revision:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode chat screenshot showing Perplexity’s message: “Absolutely.

So it’s important that you read it carefully &amp; adjust it to your voice &amp; needs — especially for your core argument. Setting up guard rails in your prompting can help curb that temptation &amp; have AI help focus on giving you actionable feedback, as opposed to doing the work for you. Consider explaining what your goals are for a thesis or what you don’t like about it for instance. Good prompts lead to good feedback; and, as Justin Jeffrey reported on students seeking AI feedback, “poor prompts led to weak feedback.”⁴</p><p>While I had to improve some structural changes in the article, Perplexity suggested I keep the general roadmap as is — which was flattering, I guess. But it suggested that I integrate my visuals within the case study &amp; provide analysis paragraphs that explain the design and the principles they adhere to. That suggestion was very insightful, and it was nice to decide how to capitalize on that insight myself.</p><p>Once I had fleshed out some weaker sections and cut redundant ones, it was time to check for ‘plagiarism’ and find some sources. Here’s the gist of the prompt I used:</p><blockquote>“Okay, let’s find sources that are talking about what I’m writing about, referencing or alluding to. And let’s find similar works that are talking about the same topics or ideas as I am.”</blockquote><p>While I saw many folks talking about ads in AI platforms, there didn’t appear to be a lot of discussion on how they could be better for people — admittedly, this could be me relying on AI a bit too much to catch blindspots like that. But with the sources it did recommend, Perplexity gave a brief summary for each one &amp; showed in my draft where each source challenged or complemented a point I was making. For my part, I’d check the source, read through it, and find what was most relevant or helpful or more concrete for my article.</p><p>Last, I asked Perplexity to provide a Chicago-style bibliography citation of the source for me to track references at the end of the draft and making sure the right information is included &amp; hyperlinked if needed.</p><h3>Step 3: Revision rounds</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<em><br />Compile feedback into action items for the following categories</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 1: Structure and Organization</em></strong><em><br />- Refine thesis or focus statement.<br />- Ensure logical flow and coherence.<br />- Organize sections with clear headings and subheadings.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 2: Paragraphing and Clarity<br />- </em></strong><em>Improve topic sentences and transitions.<br />- Clarify arguments and evidence.<br />- Ensure each paragraph supports the main idea.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Round 3: Sentence-level Polish<br />- </em></strong><em>Refine sentence structure for clarity and readability.<br />- Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, and syntax.<br />- Adjust word choice, tone, and style for the intended audience.</em></blockquote><p><strong><em>Embarrassing but honest disclaimer:</em></strong><em> </em>Admittedly, I didn’t go through the three rounds as I laid out above. Perplexity’s custom instructions weren’t as solidified at this point, and I conflated a lot of steps 2 &amp; 3 together where I lost a good bit of focus on what I was doing. And the same is true for steps 4 &amp; 5 too, but I’ll table that for now. For the remainder of this section, read what I <em>should</em> have done instead.</p><h4>Round 1</h4><p>Here, the focus is on tying ideas together, being consistent, and making sure the draft is complete from start to finish. I’ll begin by first collapsing all paragraph headings between the introduction &amp; conclusion sections to get an overview of the narrative flow, and then revise the intro or conclusion as needed.</p><p>The rest of round one is spent examining how a section ties to the previous &amp; following sections, and then how each paragraph ties to the previous &amp; following ones. Having labelled each paragraph topic saved time by allowing me to glance at how the paragraphs relate to each other, cut them if they don’t, or reorganize them if there’s a better fitting spot.</p><p>For example, it was time to explain how the UX principles applied to my lo-fi content cards in a few analysis paragraphs. This began with a list of principles and some rough definitions of them that later merged into analysis paragraphs near the visual design:</p><p><strong><em>Before:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Dark‑mode editor screenshot showing a short paragraph about “being smart with a few principles” followed by four bulleted definitions: information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio, with a final bracketed note about adding wires or sketches later."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm9XUTSI81ByIITN901J8Q.png"" /><figcaption>Draft section defining the four UX principles that guide “useful ads” in frontier AI (information grouping, information scent, banner blindness, and signal‑to‑noise ratio) before moving into interface sketches and wireframes.</figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>After:</em></strong></p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of explanatory copy above a Figma‑style card mockup for “BrightSpark Electrical,” showing a star rating, price tag reading “$4000,” short company description, “Read reviews” link, and two buttons labeled “Free inspection coupon” and “Request service.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/998/1*G-Ib-XBbdLnn0zbHhD2PCw.png"" /><figcaption>The merged example of a “smart ad” card for an electrician that integrates the design principles in the analysis paragraph above it.</figcaption></figure><h4>Round 2</h4><p>Now that the ideas connect and the story is consistent, it’s time to polish the formatting. I’ll start thinking through names for each section or at least a phrase that explains what the section talks about. Eventually, my hope is that I’ll come up with something clever or cheesy — like Lewis &amp; Clark themed section headings on how to <em>trailblaze</em> the <em>frontier</em> for <em>frontier</em> AI advertisements. While there seemingly isn’t a lot for this round, finalizing the larger essay structure &amp; themes would allow me to hone in on the finer details now.</p><h4>Round 3</h4><p>If anyone caught my case study article immediately after it published, you’ll know that I overlooked a lot I needed to do in this round. Unfortunately, I can’t blame the sloppy writing on AI either since it’s directly from my rougher drafts — at least it’s <em>my</em> slop though. Again, learn from my mistakes; never skip sentence-level edit day.</p><p>While the tasks might differ from article to article, some things were already done more or less like thesis statement revisions, case study coherence, and so on. So what I have above was how I approached each task per round.</p><p>This round has a higher workload than the others, as the focus is to go through each paragraph &amp; tighten up the sentences, flow, and grammar for a cleaner polish. Usually, I aim to keep sentences as short as I can without losing clarity of the ideas. But making sure your tone, voice, and style are showcased is most important.</p><p>If needed, take one section at a time. I’ve learned it’s better not to approach this round all at once, too. All the writing &amp; structure is there, so it’s easier to come back and know what’s left to do after a break from editing. Once I’m satisfied with the sentences, coherence, and structure of the paragraph, I’ll delete the paragraph headings then move to the next section. For me, this gives me the sense of completion for what sections are revised and indicates that I’ve given this some close attention at the sentence level too.</p><p>So, after three rounds of editing, I’ll move into the next step in the process. At this point, I should have my draft in good shape, my visuals replaced the placeholder spots, and trimmed down the excess content I don’t need.</p><h3>Step 4: Quality check</h3><blockquote>Instructions:<br /><em>Check that your draft meets the following criteria before publishing<br />- Clear and specific thesis or focus<br />- Logical and coherent structure<br />- Credible and well-integrated evidence<br />- Readable and engaging style<br />- No major errors in grammar or mechanics<br />- Visual appeal and formatting where appropriate<br />- Strong conclusion (summary, call to action, or takeaway)<br />- Relevant tags or SEO if publishing online<br />- Banner image<br />- Article title &amp; subtitle</em></blockquote><p>Many of the tasks here may feel they’ve already been done. But it’s nice to have Step 4 as another round of feedback from Perplexity to catch my gaffs that I’ll miss in Obsidian or just mistakes I plainly overlooked. As Riwa By claims, AI goes beyond a traditional spellchecker because it can “analyze entire sentences, understand context, suggest rephrasing, and… match tone and intent,” making it a solid writing tutor.⁵</p><p>With what AI can do now, there’s really no excuse for leaving out alt-text &amp; captions for visuals. At the very least, I think there’s an argument for having this content generated — especially if the visuals are your own work or if you want to properly reference copyrighted imagery. But if you want to keep things in your own words, draft the captions, alt-text, and SEO descriptions of the article too. The AI tutor can give solid feedback on this also for screen reader users and teasing out details in captions that might be subtle in the imagery.</p><p>What’s unique to this section, though, is coming up with a title. I would spend way too much time crafting a title &amp; subtitle before I had even the idea fully formed in my head. However, with the reDraft process, content comes first &amp; cool titles come after. For the AI ads article, I threw some of my rough title ideas at Perplexity to refine further:</p><ul><li>“AI Trailblazing: the final AI frontier”</li><li>“Helpful marketing: how AI can make ads useful”</li><li>“UX for ads: AI’s unique opportunity”</li></ul><p>I ended up with “Useful ads: Trailblazing UX for Frontier AI” but quickly realized that’s a very vague title that doesn’t convey much. So I quickly changed it to “Designing useful ads” and the good folks at <em>UX Collective</em> provided a cleaner, more descriptive subtitle (thank you!): “Redefining the relationship between AI utility and digital advertising.” Thankfully, I didn’t have to rework my article banner image, since I usually don’t have those matching one-to-one with the title anyway.</p><h3>Step 5: Final review</h3><p>For my own peace of mind, I’ll have Perplexity review it one last time, providing exactly what I’d put in Medium’s draft page. However, since most AI platforms probably could offer endless feedback for ‘improvement,’ I had included in the Perplexity custom instructions to say when something is ‘good enough for my purposes.’ I’m not trying to be the next Dostoyevsky or Nobel Prize winner, so I can strive for excellence on my own standards rather than absolute perfection.</p><p>But if you — like me — eagerly tried a new writing process and noticed a lot of mistakes after it’s posted, I have two thoughts. First, Medium thankfully allows edits after posting; I can make some minor tweaks, fix grammar, or correct mistakes that I come across. Second &amp; more generally speaking, even if you can’t (or shouldn’t) make changes, I’m comfortable with saying that was not my best work &amp; can do better next time. Even though I notice things in my very first Medium article that I want to change or improve, I’m resisting the temptation and trying to lean into my own advice.</p><h4>Don’t just eat fish, learn how to fish</h4><p>While AI can be easily abused for any creative process, it can remove a lot of friction while maintaining human ownership of a work. It just has to be done with care &amp; self-restraint on what we allow AI to do for us. The goal is to identify clear boundaries in prompts &amp; instructions so that we focus more on our ideas, style, and prose.</p><p>More work does need to be done on a process like this for more stringent, professional work. The reDraft could be a decent start which academics could refine further — keeping the ethics, ownership, and standards honest for peer-review publications.</p><p>For newer writers, it may be more challenging to pushback against an AI tutor also. The <em>Enago Academy</em> warns that these platforms sound very confident, tout expertise, and have convincing explanations even when they’re factually wrong. But sources are linked in AI responses; click the links, skim the sources, and make your own judgement — especially for topics you’re still learning. Your name is on the byline for what you post online regardless if you had human or AI feedback.¹ Thus, it’s important to couch AI as an assistant, a librarian, and as a tutor that gives <em>suggestions</em> as opposed to gospel.</p><p>I love learning new things, and I don’t do myself nor my readers any good by having AI generate content I know nothing about. The old proverb “give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime” applies to AI creativity too. Write for yourself to understand new ideas, pay attention to what feedback AI gives you, and improve your writing style. In Jeffrey’s study, he found that AI helped students improve their writing where “82% reported improved error recognition” and “80% noticed details they typically missed.”⁴ AI can give you a full article to share in minutes, but it can also teach you how to write one yourself.</p><blockquote><strong>AI usage disclaimer</strong>:<em> AI tools were used for editing visual assets, writing feedback, assistance in locating relevant sources, &amp; Chicago-style citation formatting; all early drafts, ideas, arguments, &amp; experiences in this article are my own.</em></blockquote><h3>References</h3><ul><li>Link to <a href=""https://1drv.ms/w/c/369b550a350cb50a/IQCJ0YrsXADQTaamDDJ2kmC3AY5dQuZYKD3lm92JmwqpuUQ?e=bhLFTw"">custom instructions</a> for Perplexity Space.</li></ul><p>[1] Enago Academy. “AI in Academic Writing: How to Use Technology Without Losing Your Voice.” <em>Enago Academy</em>, December 14, 2025. <a href=""https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/"">https://www.enago.com/academy/ai-in-academic-writing-how-to-use-technology-without-losing-your-voice/.</a></p><p>[2] Ingermanson, Randy. <em>How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method</em>.

Hell no!</a></figcaption></figure><p>Involving citizens in public design is much more than running an “open” process. It is about redistributing agency — enabling people to shape decisions, define problems, and participate in making change happen. It is as much about co-authoring a story of change as it is about delivering outcomes.</p><p>Over the past eight years, I’ve been fortunate to work with a broad range of people — from children on dialysis wards or someone’s friend’s uncle in Germany looking to rent power tools to everyday citizens wanting to inquire about their tax bill, and the people I work with. Across all of these experiences, I’ve come to trust something quite simple. That work gets better when people (or <em>citizens</em>) are involved in defining needs, shaping response,s and proposing designs — not just talking about change, but helping to make it happen, together.</p><p>Given that I’m currently working with a brilliant teaching team on the MPA in Innovation, Public Policy and Public Value at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose — with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rowan-conway-09bab58/"">Rowan Conway</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-gomez-mont-1186a417b/"">Gabriella Gomez-Mont</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/agostinaargirofuertes/"">Agostina Argiro Fuertes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-santucho-65578a133/"">Cecilia Santucho</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nlaport/"">Nickolas Laport Aldunate</a> — supporting students to start tuning into how we better engage, enable and empower citizens through participatory scaffolding, it felt timely to pause and reflect on what it really means to include citizens in the design process.</p><p>Drawn from fieldwork, facilitation, practice, research, and a somewhat substantial volume of reading across public innovation and social infrastructure in recent years, here are some notes from the field that I’ve been marinating on.</p><h3><strong>1. Spend more time outside than in the office.</strong></h3><p>Being and doing things together on site is where trust and respect are built across differences. Thinking doesn’t happen in spreadsheets alone; it happens in kitchens, on pavements, in school corridors, in workshops and vans. We can’t expect colleagues — or citizens — to always come to us, or to log into a Team’s call, when they are balancing lives of their own.</p><p>Instead, jump in a tradesman’s van for a ride-along, chat to your taxi driver, go on a dog walk, have spontaneous conversations where people naturally gather: the barber shop, the football pitch, the school gate. These are all so much more than romantic gestures, they are cultural and essential ethnography into how people actually live their lives.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a community engagement cycle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*x5J5gXYxwAkHOl5lvkERBw.png"" /><figcaption>Hilary Cottam — <a href=""https://www.hilarycottam.com/radical-help/"">Radical Help</a></figcaption></figure><p>This echoes much of Hilary Cottam’s work on relational welfare — the idea that change does not emerge from service transactions but from relationships built in the everyday spaces of life. In <a href=""https://www.hilarycottam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Social-Revolution-5.0-_dec19.pdf""><em>Revolution 5.0 A Social Manifesto</em></a> (which inspired this post) Hilary argues that our public systems are over-optimised for institutional efficiency and under-designed for human connection. Spending time outside the office is not a gimmick; it is a much-needed human correction.</p><p>A varied working process also opens more ways of contributing. Different spaces unlock different competencies. Some people speak best in formal rooms; others in motion, or over tea. Inclusion is not only about who is invited, but about the environments we design for participation. Basically, complex systems can’t be redesigned in conference rooms.</p><h3><strong>2. Hold back and wait.</strong></h3><p>Spend time. Percolate. Let plans evolve and be open to change. So much pressure comes from what we assume are procedural rules of the system — deadlines, reporting cycles, funding windows. But what happens when we loosen our grip? What could happen if communities genuinely shaped the direction, rather than reacting to pre-set options?</p><p>This isn’t easy. It often means moving at the “pace of trust” — and trust, that pesky, vague word, takes years to build and only moments to lose. It really means that this work cannot be rushed to meet artificial six-month timelines or funding deadlines. This theme has surfaced repeatedly in my conversations with practitioners and articulated much more fluently than I could dream of, particularly those working in place-based change like <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhitchin/"">John Hitchin</a> or <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo-blundell-1b746811/"">Jo Blundell, </a>who have that special skill at crystallising thoughts. The <a href=""https://placeandevidence.substack.com/"">Place &amp; Evidence substack</a> is a shining example of this.</p><p>In many of my own experiences, breakthroughs came only after long stretches of what looked, from the outside, like slow work: listening, showing up, returning again and again. Staying in the deep end long enough for patterns and signals to manifest. People (and by people I mean anyone from the policy teams I work with to the students I support) often ask, “How much research do we need?” But that’s a category error. You don’t know until you start learning — and learning takes time.</p><p>In complex systems, premature solutions often risk strengthening the status quo because they fail to shift underlying conditions. In this context, holding back does not mean being passive. It means resisting premature convergence of ideas. It means allowing relationships to form before solutions harden. It means accepting that the “messy middle” is not a phase to rush through, but that relationships are the core of transformation. Our role as practitioners is to continually pry open the space between problems and solutions, creating room for deeper exploration before closure.</p><h3><strong>3. Lead with deep generosity and an abundance mindset.</strong></h3><p>Reject the conventional economic logic of the “bare minimum” and instead bring intentional generosity and care into every interaction — throughout life and your work.</p><p>This can mean many things and, in public systems, it’s not easy. Generosity can feel naïve. We are trained to optimise, to reduce, to streamline. Time is scarce. Budgets are tight. Engagement becomes extractive almost by default: What do we need from people? How quickly can we get it? How cheaply can we deliver it?</p><p>Leading with deep generosity flips that frame.</p><p>It can mean taking the time to listen deeply to citizens to understand what they value and what makes a place work, rather than leading with data-heavy, deficit-focused profiles. It can mean hosting rather than merely facilitating — setting the boundaries of a space physically, socially and conceptually. Considering how much natural light is in the room. Whether the snacks are nourishing. Whether the space smells right. Whether the premise of gathering feels intentional and human. Even ensuring the font sizes in your document are consistent — because coherence communicates care.</p><figure><img alt=""Example sketch of street transition in Malmö — as part of the Climate KIC Deep Demo project"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WJ8gULYyxoffYrlU.png"" /><figcaption>Scaling the Right to Retrofit — <a href=""https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad"">Dark Matter Labs</a></figcaption></figure><p>I think that Dark Matter Labs is fantastic at illustrating this principle by arguing that transformation requires shifting underlying logics — not just introducing new tools (See: <a href=""https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-threads-52b6a66d939b"">Dm Threads</a>). In this framing, generosity is not softness; it is a structural move. It changes incentives. It signals safety. It invites reciprocity rather than compliance. And when people feel respected and safe, experimentation becomes possible. Risk becomes shared rather than imposed. Generosity creates the conditions for long-term relationships (in perpetuity) rather than one-off transactions. It moves us from episodic engagement to ongoing stewardship.</p><p>Fundamentally, working from abundance recognises the immense skills, networks and energy already present in communities or teams, rather than viewing them through a lens of scarcity, conflict or decline. In complex work, what you choose to amplify matters. An abundance mindset amplifies capability — and capability compounds over time.</p><h3><strong>4. Provide the “milk carton,” not the “flavour.”</strong></h3><p>We have the amazing <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-dark-566b6965/"">Lauren Dark</a> to thank for this framing. As practitioners, our role is to provide the “scaffolding” and guardrails for participation (the “milk carton”) — such as safeguarding, policies, and frameworks — while allowing the local community to provide their specific identities, responses and lived experiences (the “flavour”).</p><p>This means designing participatory scaffolding around psychological safety and sensory comfort. As with my note on leading with deep generosity, the physical environment is a super easy way to think about shaping how people participate. A bland community hall with poor coffee can put people on edge. Designing lounge-room-like environments — creating front rooms rather than back offices — is part of this shift. Physical space communicates whether power is shared or retained. The container should feel safe enough for people to experiment, disagree and create.</p><p>But the “milk carton” is not only physical. It extends to the social and governance scaffolding we build around engagement. Frameworks such as Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) ensure that decisions are made freely, in advance and with full information — acting as safeguards for self-determination and sustainable development. This is not bureaucratic box-ticking; it is participatory infrastructure. Practitioners such as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-thompson-66924652/"">Julian Thompson</a> (through <a href=""https://rootedcentre.org/"">Rooted</a>) are doing super important work in this space, grounding engagement in Design Justice principles. Their work reminds us that inclusion is not neutral. It requires increasing our own capacity to build empathy, recognise positionality and actively avoid harm.</p><p>My own mental model is to remember to avoid the trap of being the “hero” designer and being eternally optimistic about solving everything and helping everyone; instead, we should be striving to act as a translator or craftsperson who helps amplify the brilliant things the community is already doing.</p><h3><strong>5. Building “breadcrumbs” for policy change</strong></h3><p>Relational work is powerful — but fragile. Without translation, it evaporates at the policy interface. To ensure local insights aren’t lost, codify community conversations into thematic “breadcrumbs” that future policy decisions can remain accountable to. Make things tangible.</p><p>Dan Hill (in his book: <a href=""https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses-a-strategic-design-vocabulary-strelka-press-18551fff3133"">Dark Matter and Trojan Horses</a>) refers to these, from a strategic design perspective, as “MacGuffins” — artefacts or interventions that carry narrative weight and create movement within complex systems. Extended through ideas like Trojan Horses, they become strategic devices: visible, workable objects or experiments that bridge the gap between radical local practice and the institutional mindsets of national policymakers. They make change experiential rather than rhetorical — ensuring that inclusive growth is rooted in lived, everyday experience rather than abstract ambition.</p><p>In practice, this means getting your hands dirty. Improvising. Being creative. Perhaps it’s my background in industrial design, but I believe in working through prototypes and experiments that allow participation to become a collective act of change. It means using probes, pilots and live tests to understand how ideas behave in real space — not just on paper. When something is built, placed, trialled or enacted physically, it shifts the narrative. It becomes evidence that listening has occurred in a way people can experience.</p><figure><img alt=""Boris Johnson on a rental bike in London."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/976/0*ATIXdbuQTLuRMq9l.jpg"" /><figcaption>Question if you will, they’ve had an impact on mobility</figcaption></figure><p>There is something powerful about interventions you can see, touch and use. Think about Santander Cycles — or “Boris Bikes.” Whatever your view on their politics (of both the service and the bureaucrat), they were tangible. Rows of red bicycles appearing across London were visible proof that a conversation about congestion, health and mobility had translated into action. You didn’t need to read a strategy document or look through a spreadsheet to understand that something had changed. The city felt different.</p><p>A shared reference point was created — something that allowed disagreement to be productive rather than abstract. Something for communities to respond to, debate, adapt and reinterpret — not just hypotheticals, but lived experience.</p><p>Without these breadcrumbs, participation risks becoming episodic — a series of conversations that dissolve once the workshop ends. With them, it becomes cumulative. It becomes part of how a place understands itself, and how institutions learn to act differently over time.</p><p><strong>To close…</strong></p><p>None of these thoughts is particularly new. Most of it is slow. All of it is relational. Fundamentally, this note is acting as a reminder. Including citizens in design is not a technique to master, but a way of working to practise — one that redistributes agency not just in theory, but in the everyday spaces where change actually happens.</p><p><em>This post is part of </em><a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/""><em>CIVICWORKS</em></a><em>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d28bf115700f"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/practice-notes-on-including-citizens-in-the-design-process-d28bf115700f"">Practice notes on including citizens in the design process</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
