In CSS, we can create “stacking contexts” where elements are visually placed one on top of the next in a three-dimensional sense that creates the perception of depth. Stacking contexts are incredibly useful, but they’re also widely misunderstood and often mistakenly created, leading to a slew of layout issues that can be tricky to solve.",

As a Product Manager in healthcare, I was taught that “habit formation” was the holy grail. We ask: <em>Can our product change people’s habits?</em> But after analyzing 83 artifacts spanning from 7000 BC to 2024, I’ve realized habits are just the symptoms. The “Vibe” is the cause. We treat breakthroughs in fasting, sleep, and gut health as “disruptions.” They aren’t. They are <strong>translations</strong> of ancient practices rendered acceptable through contemporary measurement, automation, and a very specific kind of storytelling.</p><h3>The methodology: vibe coding</h3><p>Archaeologists read pottery shards to understand ancient civilizations — why this glaze, why this shape, why buried here? <strong>Vibe coding</strong> reads product design patterns to decode the invisible architecture of our moment.</p><p>I examined 83 artifacts across four domains (fasting, movement, sleep, gut health) spanning 9,000 years. Each artifact — from <a href=""https://www.worldhistory.org/Neolithic_Period/"">Neolithic globular fermentation jars (7000 BC)</a> to <a href=""https://www.eightsleep.com/"">Eight Sleep Pods (2019)</a> — contains encoded information: What anxieties did it address? What authorities legitimized it? What previous solutions had failed? What I found wasn’t innovation. It was translation: the product is just the container for the story.</p><h3>The pattern: four triggers, one cycle</h3><p>Products don’t create trends; they arrive at the exact moment a convergence of triggers makes a practice culturally acceptable again. I identified four triggers that activate every preventive health resurgence:</p><ol><li><strong>Crisis (Creates Urgency):</strong> A widespread problem makes the status quo unacceptable (e.g., <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"">1970s obesity epidemic</a> or 2020 pandemic isolation).</li><li><strong>Technology (Removes Barriers):</strong> New tools make a practice frictionless or measurable (e.g., smartphone apps or <a href=""https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data"">DNA sequencing cost collapse</a>).</li><li><strong>Authority (Reframes Legitimacy):</strong> Scientific validation or aspirational figures reframe the practice (e.g., a <a href=""https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2016/ohsumi/facts/"">Nobel Prize for autophagy</a>).</li><li><strong>Disappointment (The Vacuum):</strong> The previous “innovation” (diet pills, gym memberships) fails.</li></ol><h3>Why timing matters more than quality</h3><p>The <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.wired.com/2013/05/zeo-sleep-manager-obituary/"">Zeo Sleep Headband (2009)</a> had better technology than the <a href=""https://ouraring.com/"">Oura Ring (2015)</a> — clinical-grade EEG vs. optical sensors. It failed. Oura succeeded. Why? In 2009, only 1 trigger was present (Technology).

For thousands of years, these practices remained embedded in culture. Now, technology and capital move them through the “hype cycle” at breakneck speed:</p><ul><li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> 9,000 years (Traditional) → 15 years (Quantified) → 3 years (Fatigue).</li><li><strong>Fasting:</strong> Millennia (Religious) → 4 years (App Adoption) → 2 years (Pharmaceutical Replacement).</li></ul><h3>The meta-lesson: what the industry gets wrong</h3><ol><li><strong>Measurement ≠ Innovation:</strong> Measurement often creates “score anxiety” rather than health.</li><li><strong>Automation ≠ Improvement:</strong> Automation removes the “essential challenge” of developing body awareness.

The product is just the container for the story the culture is finally ready to hear.</li></ol><h3>The cycle accelerates</h3><p>Notice the time compression. Fermentation took 9,000 years to move from survival to science. Fasting took only four years to move from “hacker” app to a pharmaceutical injection (GLP-1s). We are approaching a <strong>pattern saturation point</strong> where cycles turn so fast that “new” products launch into immediate consumer skepticism.</p><h3>The future: 2026–2035 predictions</h3><p>Where is the “Vibe” moving next? Based on the pattern recognition from the last 83 artifacts, here is what I predict for the next decade of preventive health:</p><h4>1. The current wave crashes (2026–2028)</h4><p>We are approaching “Optimization Fatigue.” The resale market will soon flood with $2,000 bikes and $300 rings. Subscription resistance will peak — consumers will reject paying “rent” on their own health data. We will see the collapse of several “personalized nutrition” startups as users realize 40-page algorithmic reports rarely lead to actionable change.</p><h4>2. The pharmaceutical end-game (2025–2032)</h4><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.novonordisk.com/our-products/obesity-care/ozempic.html"">GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic)</a> represent the Final Extraction. We have extracted the biological mechanism so thoroughly that we no longer need the practice of discipline. Expect this to follow in other domains:</p><ul><li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Orexin antagonists replacing the need for “sleep hygiene.”</li><li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Myostatin inhibitors or “exercise mimetics” — pills that mimic the metabolic benefits of a workout without the sweat.</li><li><strong>The Backlash:</strong> By 2030, a counter-movement will emerge that views this pharmaceutical path as “synthetic living,” leading to a massive resurgence in the “Authentic” phase.</li></ul><h4>3. The resurgence of dismissed practices (2027–2035)</h4><p>Whatever we currently consider “outdated” or “inefficient” is a candidate for rediscovery. Watch for:</p><ul><li><strong>Biphasic Sleep:</strong> A return to the pre-industrial “midnight awakening” as a time for meditation or creativity.</li><li><strong>Communal Labor:</strong> Movement that serves a purpose. As gym culture fades, we will see “functional fitness” return to actual functions: community gardening, building, and manual repair.</li><li><strong>Seasonal Living:</strong> The ultimate status symbol will be eating <em>only</em> what is locally available and sleeping according to natural light cycles, rejecting the “optimized 72 degrees year-round” environment.</li></ul><h4>4. Pattern recognition becomes the product</h4><p>As consumers become savvier (largely due to the “de-influencing” trend), they will stop buying “innovations.” Successful products in 2030 will explicitly market themselves as <strong>translations</strong>. They will say: <em>“This is a 9,000-year-old jar, we just made it fit in your modern fridge.”</em> Authenticity will replace “Biohacking” as the dominant marketing language.</p><h3>Conclusion: The product as container for the story</h3><p>The practices that keep humans healthy are ancient: Eat less sometimes. Move with your tribe. Rest with the sun. Consume beneficial bacteria.</p><p>As Product Managers, we aren’t discoverers; we are <strong>translators</strong>. We build containers for stories that convince each generation to do what has always worked. But the most valuable “innovation” for the next decade won’t be a better sensor.

<h4>The redesign tested well. Users hate it anyway. Welcome to the paradox that costs companies millions and leaves everyone baffled.</h4><p>When Sonos released its <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">redesigned app in May 2024</a>, the backlash was immediate and brutal. Users couldn’t access basic features like volume control and alarms. Systems became unusable. The company’s stock plummeted 25%. Eventually, the CEO was replaced, and <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">lawsuits claimed over $5 million in damages</a> from customers who’d lost functionality they’d paid for.</p><p>But here’s the part that makes this story particularly fascinating: Sonos hadn’t just thrown darts at a wall and hoped for the best. The redesign came after extensive testing and development. They genuinely believed it was an improvement. And they’re far from alone in discovering that what looks good on paper can feel terrible in practice.</p><figure><img alt=""Netflix homepage featuring Black Mirror as the hero title under “Only on Netflix,” with badges for New Season and Emmy Award Winner, alongside thumbnails for You and Cobra Kai."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*q5vFJIgoFU_OFt2GrIEQAg.png"" /><figcaption>Netflix’s redesigned TV interface. Image source: <a href=""https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-new-tv-layout"">Netflix</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even something as small as <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Google Photos changing its crop tool</a> from square corners to rounded ones in July 2025 triggered enough complaints that Google eventually reversed the change. <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">Netflix faced similar fury</a> when it rolled out its TV app redesign later that year. They claimed months of testing showed improved user satisfaction. Yet Reddit threads exploded with users reporting the new layout as a bug, convinced something had gone catastrophically wrong. Then in October, <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Instagram reorganised its bottom navigation bar</a>, and users immediately started accidentally swiping between sections when they meant to browse photos.</p><p>The pattern repeats itself with almost mathematical precision: the company announces a redesign, users revolt, comment sections fill with rage, and everyone involved feels misunderstood. So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3>Your brain on autopilot</h3><p>Every time you open an app you use regularly, your brain isn’t really thinking about what you’re doing. You’ve developed what cognitive psychologists call automaticity: the ability to perform tasks without conscious attention. Your thumb knows exactly where that button sits. Your eyes scan the screen following a pattern you’ve rehearsed thousands of times. You’re operating almost entirely on muscle memory.</p><p>This isn’t laziness. It’s efficiency. Our brains are designed to convert frequently repeated actions into automatic processes, freeing up mental resources for more demanding tasks. <strong>When you can navigate your favourite app without thinking, that’s your brain working exactly as intended.</strong></p><p>Then comes the redesign.</p><p>Suddenly, that button you could tap with your eyes closed has moved. The menu you accessed with a quick gesture now requires three taps through nested options. Everything that was once automatic now demands active focus. You’re forced back into deliberate, effortful thinking… and it feels exhausting.</p><figure><img alt=""Before-and-after comparison of Duolingo’s learning path redesign on a green background: the old grid layout with circular skill icons (Basics, Phrases, Animals, Food, Family) on the left, and the new linear path with sequential nodes and the Duo owl mascot on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/992/1*DfLmJS5Q1DE4y1rjP6reGw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s home screen redesign. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/new-duolingo-home-screen-design/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">Duolingo redesigned its app in 2022</a>, switching from a branching tree structure to a single linear path, longtime users were livid. The company’s CEO, Luis von Ahn, acknowledged the backlash but stood firm: “People are change averse,” he said, refusing to offer users a way to revert. What he framed as resistance to change was actually something more specific. <strong>Users had built sophisticated mental models of how to navigate the app, and those models had just become obsolete overnight.</strong></p><p>The cognitive load of relearning isn’t trivial. Research into cognitive fluency shows that when information feels difficult to process, we experience it as unpleasant, regardless of whether the end result is objectively better. Your brain genuinely registers the increased effort, and it doesn’t particularly care that the new design tested well with fresh users who never had to unlearn anything.</p><h3>Loss aversion and the endowment effect</h3><p>Even if a redesign objectively offers improvements, we fixate on what’s been taken away. This isn’t just psychological stubbornness. It’s a well-documented cognitive bias called <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">loss aversion</a>. We feel losses roughly twice as intensely as equivalent gains.</p><p>The Sonos disaster illustrates this perfectly. Yes, the new app had a sleeker interface. But users couldn’t adjust their volume or set alarms — functions they’d relied on daily. No amount of visual polish could compensate for losing tools that had become part of their routines. One user’s complaint, shared thousands of times across social media, captured the sentiment: “I’ve spent over £10,000 on a complete home Sonos system. Even if you fix this app, the damage is done.”</p><p>There’s another psychological force at play here: the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">endowment effect</a>. We overvalue things we already possess. <strong>That old interface isn’t just a collection of buttons and menus–it’s ours. We’ve invested time learning it, built workflows around it, developed preferences and shortcuts.</strong> The new design might be objectively superior in controlled testing, but it requires us to surrender something we’ve claimed as our own.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups of a meal planning app showing a daily calorie tracker with macronutrient breakdown, a “3 Week Weight Loss” meal plan with a rocket illustration, and a daily meal planner with swappable breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner options."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*71XrxVq75pOPEAWdex70tA.png"" /><figcaption>Lifesum’s old UI.

Users described spending hours trying to figure out how to get their old views back. The app hadn’t just changed. It had taken something from them without permission.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional banner for the Lifesum app with the logo on the left and two iPhone mockups showing diet plan categories and a daily food diary with calorie tracking, macronutrient breakdowns, and meal logging."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uKD3b0zC7vjSxV9S_y6Ygg.png"" /><figcaption>Lifesum’s new UI. Image source: <a href=""https://yulife.com/blog/lifesum-partnership/"">YuLife</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The familiarity principle</h3><p>Here’s where things get interesting: the design you hate today might be the design you prefer in three months.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">mere exposure effect</a> is one of psychology’s most robust findings. <strong>We develop preferences simply through repeated exposure.</strong> The old design wasn’t necessarily better, it was just familiar. And familiarity feels good. It feels safe. It feels right.</p><p>This creates a paradox for designers. The Netflix redesign that users called “horrible” and “confusing” when it launched? Netflix’s own data suggested that user satisfaction actually improved over time as people adjusted. Von Ahn made the same claim about Duolingo’s controversial path update, pointing to positive engagement metrics even as the Reddit community devoted to the app erupted in fury.</p><p><strong>The question becomes: how long do users need before familiarity catches up? And how much short-term pain is acceptable for long-term gain?</strong></p><p>Instagram’s October 2025 navigation changes demonstrate the friction period. The same swipe gesture now switches between sections and browses multi-photo posts, a decision that likely made sense in design reviews but feels confusing in practice. Will users eventually develop new muscle memory? Almost certainly. But in the meantime, each accidental section switch reinforces the feeling that something is broken.</p><h3>When good design feels wrong</h3><p>This is perhaps the most frustrating part for designers: even genuine improvements can feel worse during the transition.</p><p>Change blindness (our difficulty noticing even significant alterations when we’re not specifically looking for them) means users often can’t articulate what’s different. They just know something feels off. <strong>The cognitive load of adjusting creates a general sense of friction that colours the entire experience negatively.</strong></p><p>Google Photos’ removal of the perspective correction tool in July 2025 showcases another dimension. Google buried manual editing tools deeper to highlight their new AI features, transforming what used to be a two-tap process into a three-tap journey through nested menus. From Google’s perspective, this made sense: guide users toward powerful AI assistance. From the users’ perspective: “where did my tools go?”</p><p>The backlash was significant enough that Google eventually reversed course, restoring both the perspective tool and those familiar square-cornered crop brackets that they’d changed to rounded ones. Sometimes the smallest visual details matter most, especially when they affect the tools people use daily.</p><h3>The AI complication</h3><p>Duolingo’s story adds another layer that’s increasingly relevant: what happens when redesigns coincide with fundamental shifts in how work gets done?</p><p>The 2022 interface redesign was contentious enough. But then in late 2023, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">Duolingo laid off 10% of its contractors</a>: translators whose work was being handed to AI. Another round of cuts followed in October 2024, this time affecting writers. Then in April 2025, <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">von Ahn sent an internal memo</a> (which he also shared publicly on LinkedIn) declaring Duolingo would become “AI-first.” The company would “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle.”</p><p>For users, this created a toxic combination. <strong>The redesign had already disrupted their experience and removed choice. Now they were watching human expertise being replaced by AI-generated content, with remaining contractors reduced to reviewing machine output for basic acceptability.</strong> The redesign wasn’t just annoying. It felt like evidence of a company prioritising cost-cutting over quality.</p><p>This matters because trust is fragile. When users are already frustrated with interface changes that make their experience worse, discovering that those changes might be driven by a desire to reduce reliance on human workers compounds the sense of betrayal. You’re not just fighting with unfamiliar buttons. You’re questioning whether the company still cares about delivering the experience that made you loyal in the first place.</p><figure><img alt=""Three iPhone mockups showcasing Duolingo Max’s AI features: the subscription page with the owl mascot, an “Explain My Answer” French grammar breakdown, and a “Roleplay” scenario helping a lost tourist in Paris."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DokQmHXtC4s5MbXkL7Wpgw.png"" /><figcaption>Duolingo’s AI-focus has received significant backlash from their users. Image source: <a href=""https://blog.duolingo.com/duolingo-max/"">Duolingo</a></figcaption></figure><h3>What designers can (and can’t) control</h3><p>So what’s a designer to do? The paradox is real: you can’t improve products without changing them, but users will resist change even when it’s beneficial.</p><p>First, accept that the initial backlash isn’t necessarily a sign you’ve failed. Almost every major redesign faces resistance, even ones that ultimately succeed. The Snapchat redesign of 2018 was so unpopular that over a million users signed a petition demanding they undo it. Kylie Jenner’s tweet criticising it temporarily tanked the company’s stock. Yet Snapchat didn’t revert, and the platform survived.</p><p>There is a transitioning problem at play, too. <strong>During that adjustment period, even improvements create cognitive load.</strong> This doesn’t mean your metrics are lying or your users don’t know what they want. It means change has an inherent cost that takes time to recoup.</p><p>Second, how you roll out changes matters enormously. Sonos’ biggest mistake wasn’t just removing features; it was forcing every user into the new app without offering a beta period or a graceful transition. Users reported that the app was “obviously unfinished” and full of critical bugs. When people asked why it was released in that state during a community forum, there was no good answer.</p><p><strong>Gradual rollouts give you time to catch issues before they become disasters.</strong> Duolingo rolled their path update to new users first, getting early feedback before exposing longtime users. Netflix tested their redesign extensively. But even sophisticated rollout strategies can’t eliminate the fundamental challenge: people who’ve built workflows around your old interface need time and support to adjust.</p><p>Third, communication can help, but only if it’s honest. <strong>Telling users “we tested this, and it’s better” when they’re actively experiencing it as worse creates a disconnect.</strong> Acknowledging that change is difficult, explaining what you’re trying to achieve, and being responsive to legitimate concerns about lost functionality builds more goodwill than insisting everything is fine when it clearly isn’t.</p><p>Google’s decision to eventually restore the perspective correction tool after months of complaints shows that sometimes listening to users means admitting you got it wrong. Duolingo’s refusal to maintain two versions because “it’s difficult” prioritises engineering convenience over user experience.</p><p>Finally, consider whether you’re inadvertently training users to distrust you. <strong>When redesigns coincide with AI integration, workforce reductions, or other changes that suggest cost-cutting over quality, users notice.</strong> They’re not just reacting to the interface. They’re reacting to what the interface represents.</p><figure><img alt=""A staged desk scene contrasting old and new technology.

The automatic processes that make change feel painful are the same ones that make daily tasks effortless. We evolved to build efficient mental models and resist disruptions to them, because in most contexts, that stability serves us well.</p><p>For designers, this creates a genuine dilemma. Products need to evolve. Interfaces that never change become outdated and lose competitive ground. But every change carries a cost that shows up in user frustration, support tickets, and angry Reddit threads, no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>The gap between objective improvement and subjective experience cannot be ignored. Metrics can show increased engagement while users are simultaneously threatening to cancel their subscriptions. Both things can be true at once.</p><p>Perhaps the real insight is that redesigns aren’t just about interface improvements. They’re about relationship management. <strong>Users who feel heard, who understand why changes are happening, and who trust that the company has their interests at heart are far more likely to weather the transition period.</strong> Users who feel forced into changes they didn’t ask for, who lose functionality they depended on, and who suspect the redesign is really about cutting costs will revolt — no matter how good your testing data looks.</p><p>Not all that changes, improves. But that which does improve often needs to change. The trick is knowing the difference and having the humility to admit when you’ve got it wrong. Sometimes, the most important feature you can build is an undo button.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3>References &amp; Credits:</h3><ul><li>Sonos App Redesign Backlash: <a href=""https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/sonos-app-redesign-fail-customer-outrage-and-falling-stock-prices/"">CMSWire coverage of customer outrage and falling stock prices</a></li><li>Sonos App Arbitration: <a href=""https://www.classaction.org/sonos-app-update-arbitration"">ClassAction.org lawsuit details</a></li><li>Netflix 2025 TV App UI Redesign: <a href=""https://www.webpronews.com/netflix-2025-tv-app-ui-redesign-faces-widespread-user-backlash/"">WebProNews analysis of user backlash</a></li><li>Instagram Update: <a href=""https://www.profilenews.com/en/instagram-new-update-sparks-user/"">Profile News coverage of interface redesign</a></li><li>Google Photos Tool Restoration: <a href=""https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/google-photos-restores-missing-perspective-tool-after-user-revolt/"">Android Gadget Hacks on perspective tool reversal</a></li><li>Duolingo Redesign: <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/duolingos-update-redesign-luis-von-ahn-interview-rcna44655"">NBC News interview with CEO Luis von Ahn</a></li><li>Lifesum User Reviews: <a href=""https://www.trustpilot.com/review/lifesum.com"">Trustpilot customer feedback</a></li><li>Loss Aversion: <a href=""https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/loss-aversion/"">Behavioral Economics explanation</a></li><li>Endowment Effect: <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/endowment-effect"">The Decision Lab overview</a></li><li>Mere Exposure Effect: <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/mere-exposure-effect-definition-2795100"">Verywell Mind definition</a></li><li>Duolingo Layoffs: <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/duolingo-cut-10-of-its-contractor-workforce-as-the-company-embraces-ai/"">TechCrunch coverage of contractor cuts</a></li><li>Duolingo AI-First Strategy: <a href=""https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-duolingo-replaces-contractors-ai/"">Tech Republic on replacing contractors</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=263a75915c86"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-your-brain-rebels-against-redesigns-even-good-ones-263a75915c86"">Why your brain rebels against redesigns — even good ones</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Stay relevant by honing your intuition, not your process</h4><figure><img alt=""A person holding a lightbulb surrounded by gears"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZE5eeDaCBXTna7g9GMm5gA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Hannah James</figcaption></figure><p>You likely know, or at the very least know of, a designer who just gets it. I’m talking about the designer who solves complex problems with elegant, user-centred, buildable solutions without breaking a sweat. Or maybe that designer who turns everything they touch into something genuinely beautiful. Or even the one who gets up on a stage and says what we’re all thinking more clearly and eloquently than we can. Maybe all three. Love or irrationally hate them, there they are, making the things that you struggle with daily look easy. You look skyward and wonder, “what is it they have that I don’t?”</p><p>The answer is intuition. They inherently understand what you don’t, and it’s the thing that separates good from great in every field. Paul McCartney just “gets” music. Einstein just “got” Physics. Chumbawamba just “gets” knocked down (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H5uWRjFsGc"">and they get up again</a>).</p><p>But what do we really mean when we say intuition when it comes to design, and why is it resurfacing so vehemently as AI comes into our practice, guns a-blazin’? And importantly, if you’re not feeling particularly intuitive today, how do you fix that? Can you even? The answer is everyone’s favourite “yes, but…”.</p><h4><strong>Intuition and Design</strong></h4><p>If you unpack the concept of intuition, what is it really? For psychologist Daniel Kahneman*, “intuition is thinking that you know without knowing why you do.” People who intuit correct solutions easily have trouble explaining their process in reaching them. (Zulz)</p><p>Cognitively, intuition is explained by unconscious processes, and might also be called “expertise”. The brain is very good at learning implicitly, and can compare stored memories, patterns, and even emotions with a current scenario without “thinking”. Your brain is even capable of activating what are called <em>mental schemas</em>, complex “chunks” of information, which is how I suddenly still know how to drive whenever I (rarely) find myself behind the wheel of a car. (Cockcroft et al.)</p><p>This figures into design as a practice more than other disciplines, because design trades in what are called “wicked problems”; those that are ill-defined, and lack a single “correct” solution. Design thinking pioneer Nigel Cross, writing in his landmark <em>Designerly ways of knowing</em>, separates design as a discipline, by the fact that it is solution, and not problem-focussed. (Cross 223). For Cross:</p><blockquote>“What designers know about their own problem solving processes remains largely tacit knowledge — ie they know it in the same way that a skilled person ‘knows’ how to perform that skill. They find it difficult to externalize their knowledge, and hence design education is forced to rely so heavily on an apprenticeship system of learning.”(224)</blockquote><p>Design-god Paul Rand, himself possessing a triumphant sense of intuition, stressed its importance, as a sense beyond instructions that can be followed, writing;</p><blockquote>“No system of proportion, color, or space can possibly insure meaningful results. A system can be applied either intuitively or consciously, interestingly or boringly. There is always an element of choice, sometimes called good judgment, at other times good taste. Aside from practical considerations, in matters of form the typographer, for example, must rely on intuition.”</blockquote><p>Intuition in design comes in many forms. For some, it’s finding harmonious visual balance– a nearly automatic application of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOorMb2L-KAfUCTrxzXSvboGPJfw73wM13Zk12rlL_yzBmTRDVzhV"">Gestalt principles</a>. For others, it’s an immediate jump to a solution that just works, or an immediate pivot from one that won’t. Maybe it’s that you connect the dots on where things are going naturally, without doomscrolling <em>Medium</em>. If you’re intuitive, you get to skip the steps. Within every superstar designer, you’ll find a refined intuition in some form or another.</p><p><em>(Note: Kahneman spends a large portion of Thinking Fast and Slow identifying breakdowns in intuition that we routinely make. So when I talk about intuition, it’s really intuition that turns out to be right. “Good intuition”. Lots of people trust their intuition and come to wrong answers, which is why it’s important to be critical of any idea that comes too easily. Gut-check your gut-check.)</em></p><h4><strong>Design’s Skill Cycle, AI’s Tornado</strong></h4><p>If you’re a student of history, or at the very least old, you know that change, when it comes to technology and work, follows a cycle. To begin, a small number of skilled workers produce a product or service that meets a need (demand). As that need expands, skilled labour runs short (supply), which triggers a process called de-skilling, which is exactly what you think it is; taking the skill out of the process in order to meet demand. This involves breaking down the process into small parts that can be done by anyone with training (think of the assembly line). Once a process has become as de-skilled as it can be, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_unemployment"">technology steps in and automates the process</a> (once the cost of automation sinks below the cost of labour). <em>This is classical economic theory, you’ll find it in both Adam Smith and Karl Marx.</em></p><figure><img alt=""factory workers assembling a car on an assembly line"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2SGCLKLyKVG3F24Yg6dopw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Ford assembly line, 1913 (Wikipedia)</figcaption></figure><p>Design has been through this cycle more than once. The creation of movable type in the 1450s gave swathes of scribes the heave-ho, and launched the careers of typesetters, and printers. The need for more printed materials launched type foundries, and improved printing presses, de-skilling the printing process, and making it easier and cheaper to do. Eventually printing automated many of its processes, and the cycle began again.</p><figure><img alt=""Workers at the Chicago tribune office setting type using machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyklq4aGPVsvZZFSIr5WKQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Linotype machines at the Chicago Tribune in the 1960s. InDesign sort of does the job of this entire room of people today (Illinois State Historical library)</figcaption></figure><p>By the time the personal computer started entering households in the 1980s, it brought with it desktop publishing, which wiped out the typesetting industry save for a small cottage industry. A new set of skilled designers emerged using those programs, the glut of materials produced expanded, and again automated.</p><p>Even product design (or UX, or whatever you call it) has been through this cycle before. Before UX software existed, designers used Photoshop (or maybe InDesign), slicing up assets, and redlining pdfs to hand to developers. As the demand for UX design has grown (thanks to the internet and an explosion of digital products), technical solutions have made it easier to do more with less.</p><p>UX today is well inside its de-skilling phase. With sky-high demand over the last decade, Human Computer Interaction, a field once reserved for artsy computer scientists, has ballooned into the field we know today. To meet the needs, it was imperative to de-skill the job. That began with the expansion of design education, and the creation of the “design process” in a formal way. UI kits, design systems, best practice resources, heuristics, playbooks, as well as the absolute dominance of easy-to-use Figma in the field has made it easier than ever for someone with minimal training to “trust the process” and expect that the outcome will be good. A conglomeration of a slim few tech companies that steer the look and feel of virtually all digital products means that they set “best practices”, and those are easy to copy. Even the separation of the production process into product, design, and engineering is itself a breakdown of a very complex system into more isolated parts. Not quite the assembly line, although sometimes it might feel that way.</p><p>But what’s the next step after de-skilling? Automation. We’re seeing it happen live, right now. When Jakob Nielsen posts about Gemini potentially <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/generative-ui-google"">producing better UI than humans</a>, you might feel a bit like a blacksmith pounding a horseshoe while a car rolls by. AI brings with it an automation of the parts of the information economy (and just the economy at large) that have de-skilled. UX design as we know it is most certainly in that category.</p><p><em>(A side note about progress: Do we care if it’s bad? No! As much as we like to grump about how things were better back when ______(insert thing here), fortune typically favours the cheap over the good. Hooray for Capitalism! Will AI-generated UI initially suck? Yes. Will that stop it from becoming the default? No, not if you believe that history rhymes. Early assembly line produced products were horribly bad, but here we are.)</em></p><h4><strong>The re-rise of the intuitive designer</strong></h4><p>Don’t call it a comeback. But let’s look at the facts. AI can produce UI today. And tomorrow it’ll be a little better at it. Generative AI uses both training and models of inference to produce results. And it’s capable of producing multiple solutions at once, very quickly. Any principles or best practices or research that you’re working from can be ingested. So if your design skillset is centred around your diligence in following a process, or your ability to operate design software, well, things don’t look great for you.</p><p>Claude designer Jenny Wen, speaking at last year’s HATCH conference, said the quiet thing loud. In her talk “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM"">Don’t trust the process</a>,” Wen observes that the good design work she’s seen happen is rarely a product of process, and instead born from intuition and play. The reality is that the pace of work has accelerated, and the “discover” phase of the design process is increasingly seen as extraneous, given that an automated solution can come quickly (to be clear I don’t personally love that this is happening, but it IS happening).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href"">https://medium.com/media/7631d3b179288f2cc8ef6cdffde5e9b5/href</a><p>Not that they were unsuccessful before, but here is where the intuitive designer proves themselves to be more relevant than ever, perhaps exclusively relevant. Intuition provides the things that AI can’t do better– it can bring novel solutions to the table, and make judgments about potential solutions without certainty. Design intuition can also interrogate the problem, and the requirements set to ensure that they truly align. Recall the quote (apocryphally) attributed to Henry Ford, that goes: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”. AI can think of faster horses, intuition can think of cars. This has prompted some thinkers to posit the move from a knowledge-economy, to an <a href=""https://singularity2030.ch/the-power-of-intuition-in-scientific-discovery-and-ai/#:~:text=According%20to%20Nobel%20Prize%20Winner,without%20logical%20arguments%20or%20evidence"">intuition economy</a>. (Rudin)</p><p>If the future of design involves democratising skills through automation by wielding AI tools, Wen says it best: <strong>“In a world where anyone can make anything– what matters is your ability to choose and curate what you make.”</strong> (Wen)</p><h4><strong>Let’s get intuit(ive)</strong></h4><p>Just as following a recipe doesn’t make you a great chef and learning dance steps doesn’t make you a great choreographer, flawlessly executing every step of the design process doesn’t make you a great designer. Bridging the gap requires using your intuition to elide processes, and to make correct decisions hundreds of times as you design.</p><p>If you’re feeling a little glum, and not particularly intuitive today, fear not. Intuition is like a muscle, and just about anyone is capable of building it.</p><p>One way is simply, experience. That’s not to say job experience, but it certainly helps. The more design you experience, the more you’ll build mental schemas and memories around design. Look at design, lots and lots of design. Think about it. Think about why things look the way they do, why this solution has been chosen. If it resonates with you, think about why that is. Develop your sense of taste. Have an opinion!</p><p>Understanding how something actually works might give you more perspective on the problems present, and the solutions available, and might allow you to make connections others can’t see. The great artist Michelangelo spent a creepy amount of time watching dissections, and even performing some. He was able to apply that knowledge to painting and sculpting in ways that showed the true dynamism of the human figure. If you’re a car designer, you should know how metal works. If you’re a digital designer, you should understand code.</p><p>Of course, design is not all about the artefacts, it’s about the people who use them. It’s not surprising that many a great designer, musician, artist, etc. turn out to be either charismatic or provocative. What resonates with people in the work is intuitive to the maker. You need to understand people. For UX designers, there’s a lot to know about how <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/this-is-your-brain-on-design-using-cognitive-science-to-design-effective-experiences-fb6b402047a5"">humans notice, perceive, understand, and generally think</a> that should impact your decision making. Humans also <a href=""http://growth.design/psychology"">exhibit biases, and while we can’t avoid them, we can study and understand them</a>. Ultimately, you can turn all of this information back on yourself, and understand how and why you might be drawing conclusions.</p><p>Finally, design. And collaborate with others who do. With each problem you solve, the more you have to draw on for the next one. Collaboration and play, and time spent with peers and mentors are amazing ways to broaden your horizons. These are the reasons artistic movements, “schools” of thought and practice, musical scenes, and even elite sports dynasties succeed. Even a little healthy competition sparks the need to be creative and intuitive (<em>consider men’s tennis’ “big three,” who collectively spent 900 weeks at number 1, who all claim that competition pushed them to new heights</em>). While no one can teach you actual intuition, you can learn it “from” others.</p><p>Of course, none of your intuition matters if you ignore it. It’s time to listen to that perhaps quiet but still persistent voice in your head that tells you when you’ve really nailed it. Trying to be more like a machine is a losing battle. Might I suggest leaning into the whole “being human” thing.</p><p><strong>*** </strong><br /><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4>Once the QA Engineer enters the room, everyone expects that quality issues will be magically solved.</h4><p>Throughout my career in software testing, I’ve noticed dilemmas that affect the overall team’s dynamics and product outcomes. Believe it or not, these are the patterns that are quite common for every development team I worked with. These very patterns easily block the team’s goal, e.g. to develop a cutting-edge product that could help humanity... As a result, this amazing product exists only in the dreams of the product owner. The team builds something else instead.</p><p>Some teams praise visibility over value, forget about quality in hectic sprints and approach testing without a clear strategy. Sounds familiar? Welcome to the reality of a QA’s job.</p><h3>Visibility over value?</h3><p>In many teams, louder members get praised, even though their impact might be equal to that of more silent members. To find the typical example, just observe an average stand-up meeting. The ones who talk more get all the attention.</p><p>In her <a href=""https://code.likeagirl.io/not-all-great-work-is-loud-77874c554276"">article</a>, software engineer Priyanka Jain tells the story of two colleagues assigned the same task. One posted updates, asked questions, and collaborated loudly. The other stayed silent and shipped clean code. Both delivered. Yet only one was praised as a “great team player.”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl sees Woodpecker working on the tree. Owl asks Woodpecker: “Woody, it’s 6 AM. Why are you so loud?” Woodpecker answers: “Don’t you see? I’ve found a bug!”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_G69Y-c0U7wGkeJHXt70iQ.png"" /></figure><p>In many work cultures, we mix visibility with value. If you talk often, people assume you’re contributing. If you’re quiet, they assume you’re not. That is why <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/extroversion"">extroverted personalities</a> get promoted more often than <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/introversion"">introverted ones</a>.</p><p>If you are the only QA person on board, you need to be visible and vocal. Otherwise, your contribution goes unnoticed, the major bugs get ignored, and nobody cares about the product’s quality. Some may even wonder what you are doing there because you don’t ship code.</p><p>If you are an introvert by nature and you don’t like to exhibit your opinion or updates on every corner, it may be a challenge for you. However, this is a reality of “fast-paced” environments: the more vocal and visible you are, the better it is for the team.</p><h3>Quality is the oracle, but is it really?</h3><p>Quality is meant to be the oracle for a product team; it is something that the product team should strive for and manage accordingly. Otherwise, are you sure your customers would tolerate all those bugs and inconsistencies they run into? No team wants to see their product abandoned by the users. Yet, is quality really an oracle?</p><p>Once, I had a debate with a developer about a feature. He argued that he would definitely make a toggle button instead of a drop-down menu because “it looked more fancy”. I asked him to visualise both versions in the prototype tool so we could test each option. In the context of our specific use case, the dropdown menu still looked like an appropriate choice.</p><p>After a brief testing session that we had done together, the developer gave up and agreed. We saved time on the potential rework. (Back then, AI wasn’t so powerful yet. Right now, I would use an AI-driven tool to visualise both cases for the development team. So, we could also save time on a debate.) Anyhow, everyone was happy, including the customers who got a polished version of the product promptly.</p><p>Here, the <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/making-product-quality-a-team-sport-35d94fc0a2cf"">quality mindset</a> is something that could be learned on the way. The role of a QA person is also to promote this mindset, so team members become aware of it. When realising the priority of quality, the development team will do more to prevent bugs in production. Afterall, quality is a team sport.</p><h3>Do we need a testing strategy?</h3><p>Once the QA Engineer comes to the team, everyone expects that quality issues will be magically solved. Yet, there are less chances to be successful if you are alone in your efforts.</p><p>Before I joined a team, let’s call it X, it had no testing workflow, and the team wasn’t confident enough to go through the release cycle. There was a usual panic one day before the planned release. The team wasn’t yet conscious about quality. The overall feeling was like: “Testing? We just don’t have time for it. Aren’t you QA? You should figure out something!”</p><figure><img alt=""Owl is standing in front of the flipchart. “TESTING STRATEGY” is written on the flipchart."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VwRLjdR0gdBzcUFERApprA.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The whole situation reminded me of the logic of Hattifatteners from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomins"">Tove Yansson’s book</a>, who were always on the move and wanted to reach the horizon at any price. Here, the price was quality.</p><p>In a month, I brought the team to the point where we had a hard talk about the current product quality and what we can do to release better. The team established a QA workflow that consisted of multiple testing techniques at various levels of the product (End-to-End, API, Unit). Agile Testing Quadrants, <a href=""https://lisacrispin.com/agile-testing-quadrants-version-3-from-agile-testing-condensed/"">a tool</a> first introduced by Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin, were our framework for selecting testing techniques that matched team X’s needs. The overall product quality improved a lot then.</p><p>Before a team starts building a quality assurance system for a product, it is smart to brainstorm on how quality assurance should function. It is important to define how the quality will be measured: which t<a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/test-smart-how-to-select-testing-techniques-for-agile-team-ad6847eaa242"">esting techniques</a> will be applied to the product, and how overall testing coverage will be achieved.</p><p>It is vital to discuss the current testing status and how the team could prevent defects (which tests to use and at which level). After brainstorming sessions, the QA flow can be outlined by the team. Consequently, there will be less chaos and more peace of mind once the team ships the product.</p><p>If you are struggling with similar dilemmas, there is always a solution for each. In an agile team, get more vocal and communicate the issues clearly. If the team forgets about quality in the reality of speedy sprints, remind them about it and involve team members in testing sessions. And finally, if testing efforts look messy, talk to your team about the testing strategy and create it together. Afterall, aren’t you the one who can figure it out? 🙂</p><p><em>You may check my </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-kocbek-001893128/""><em>LinkedIn page</em></a><em> if you feel like connecting with me or are curious about my background.

We mapped flows, removed steps, and optimized interactions — assuming the user would remain the primary actor.</p><p><strong>AI changes that assumption.</strong></p><p>Today, we find ourselves in a dangerous “messy middle.” We are building software that can act, decide, and synthesize, yet we are still designing it as if it were a simple tool. If we want to build products people actually love, we have to stop “sprinkling” AI onto our workflows. We have to answer one fundamental question:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Who holds the steering wheel at this specific moment, and what is the logic that justifies it?</em></strong></blockquote><p>We need a systematic way to move beyond “assistance everywhere.” We need to know when to step back and let the machine take the wheel entirely, and when to protect the human’s role as the accountable driver.</p><p>This article provides a practical framework that turns the “who does what” decision into a repeatable process.</p><h3>The Three Control Modes</h3><p>Every task maps to one of three modes. Each defines who acts, who decides, and what the interface must enforce.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vsd0D1AVKLO4pKQLFeC6zA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Three Control Modes</figcaption></figure><h3>1) Human-Led</h3><p>The human retains full control. AI’s role is to surface evidence, highlight tradeoffs, and structure the decision — but never to act. The human reads, weighs, chooses, and executes.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Improve decision quality and accountability by giving the human clear evidence, tradeoffs, and structured rationale support.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-stakes decisions requiring subjective judgment, empathy, or ethical nuance, or where the process itself creates value.</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Evidence packs (relevant facts, sources, prior cases, policies)</li><li>Tradeoff framing (pros/cons, risks, alternatives)</li><li>Structured decision templates (criteria + rationale capture)</li><li>“Second opinion” critique (counterarguments, failure modes)</li><li>Clear accountability cues (what is suggestion vs decision)</li></ul><h3>2) Assist</h3><p>AI does the heavy lifting — generating drafts, running calculations, scanning documents — but cannot commit consequential actions without explicit human approval.

It acts autonomously within defined boundaries. Humans don’t approve individual actions — they set constraints upfront and review outcomes after the fact.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Run on autopilot with guardrails — minimize user involvement while keeping traceability, monitoring, and rollback when needed.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-volume, low-stakes, predictable tasks with clear success criteria and easily detectable errors — where human review adds friction without adding value (e.g., data entry, spam filtering, meeting scheduling).</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Global constraints (allowlists, budgets, scopes, time windows)</li><li>Activity logs / timelines (what happened, when, and under which policy)</li><li>Monitoring by exception (alerts only on anomalies)</li><li>Rollback/undo where feasible (or compensating actions)</li><li>Audit views (sampling, QA workflows, policy compliance)</li></ul><h3>The Scoring Model</h3><p>Knowing the three modes isn’t enough.

Images made with Midjourney.</blockquote><p>Maybe this text will become outdated as quickly as all the changes we’ve seen happening in our field over the last few years. But even if I run that risk, I feel I need to write a bit about a feeling I’ve seen spreading more and more among designers who work with digital products: <strong>the crisis of professional identity</strong>.</p><p>It’s no longer recent that Artificial Intelligence has been popularized with the rise of LLMs accessible to all audiences on a global scale. Even if it started with large models focused on text, in a short time we saw the exponential growth of countless tools that create a bit of everything.</p><p>When this started to become increasingly evident in our field, I began to notice that people started to understand again that a return to the generalist designer was happening in the digital product space. <strong>NN Group</strong> even published an article talking about the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">return of the UX Generalist</a> as a possible — and also desirable — role due to AI’s advance in delivering so many different parts of our process.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">The Return of the UX Generalist</a></p><p>At first, I interpreted that as positive — even while aware of the ethical and social implications of AI (which won’t be the subject of this text). However, looking more closely at the current landscape, what I’ve been noticing is that:</p><blockquote>the return to generality, with the help of the LLM models available now, doesn’t necessarily have a positive effect and can generate superficiality and a reduction in innovation in the long run.</blockquote><p>In this space, I’ll explain more about this feeling — especially for those who have been feeling anxiety about how AI may affect their professional and personal identity in today’s world.</p><p>This text is not against the use of AI: it’s simply an article with reflections on this current moment of interaction between designers and LLMs.</p><h3>Hyper-specialization as a pain</h3><figure><img alt=""Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*kPUwUssmnobbeDYk"" /><figcaption>Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>In my master’s, one of the authors who helped me most in thinking about the way I liked to work was <a href=""https://www.psychaanalyse.com/pdf/EDGAR_MORIN_LES_7_SAVOIRS_A_L_EDUCATION_DU_FUTUR.pdf""><strong>Edgar Morin</strong></a>. He is a thinker who talks about how <strong>all modern knowledge</strong> (especially since the Renaissance revolution of scientific knowledge) <strong>has been guided by simplification through reductionist thinking</strong>. This reductionism pushes the individual from a broad basic education into higher education restricted to a single discipline, and then into progressively narrower specializations (until it’s expected they dedicate themselves to a single topic for the rest of their life).</p><p>I’ve always been averse to this kind of training, and I felt firsthand the effects of not following the expected path. It was only after many years that I realized doing that was very positive — especially seeing, in practice, this disjunction that Edgar Morin discusses so much in relation to twentieth-century education.</p><p>In these almost three decades that have passed in the twenty-first century, it’s possible to see that the field of digital product design specialized so much that it ended up opening internal fissures. I tend to see this as, at least, three major axes in which people specialize and navigate:</p><ol><li>a <strong>communicational axis</strong>, linked to branding, language, and art direction, where the artistic side of the interface matters a lot;</li><li>an <strong>empirical-scientific axis</strong>, linked to research, methods, data, validation, and decision-making — sometimes captured by ROI and return discourse, but not reducible to that; and</li><li>an <strong>exact and technical axis</strong>, tied to software engineering, where part of design remained close to front-end, components, systems, and implementation, as was already seen more strongly around 2010.</li></ol><p>Of course, this happened because of the size of the complexity of each major area — with only the digital product part relating to communication between humans and machines. But even if there’s a justification, what often happens is a production line between closed niches that don’t talk much to each other.</p><blockquote>Hyper-specialization leads to less communication, since each part understands only its own area and its own topic in depth, but can’t comprehend the issue that lives next door.</blockquote><p>And with that, information passes from area to area until it reaches the professionals at the end of the process: developers. I bet many of you have already witnessed this phenomenon, which creates noise around impediments or disagreements.</p><p>That’s why Morin talks so much about an <strong>education of the future</strong> in which complexity is embraced — in teaching that doesn’t funnel down but opens horizons — while maintaining depth of study. However, even if the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/1061-7361(92)90024-8""><strong>Complexity Paradigm</strong></a> exists in the educational field (and I believe in it and defend it whenever I can), it’s important to be cautious!</p><p>The effects of having professionals who can embrace so many different areas have always been desired by many sectors of the market. That’s why the idea (even if often imaginary) of the “unicorn designer” has always been so promising — a caricature name given to the imagination of a “do-it-all”: someone who, alone, produces a super artistic and interactive interface with decisions grounded scientifically and empirically, and can still make the solution tangible in front-end.</p><p>The “but” in this always-desired idea is that it isn’t humanly possible to make a single professional transmogrify into roles that demand such different cognitive training — especially if you want a product that is truly good in each aspect.</p><p>But this collective imaginary never stopped existing, and it has now been reborn with the emergence and popularization of Artificial Intelligence. By relegating activities to the machine — even without specialized knowledge in a given area — it would be possible to stimulate the existence of this professional who navigates every corner and can deliver well in any activity.</p><p>It’s at this specific point that a promise is born — but also countless risks that are not yet fully predictable.</p><h3>Generalization as a risk</h3><figure><img alt=""Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*5Z7JH1XqKcbrDedV"" /><figcaption>Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been reflecting a lot on this issue. And more and more, I feel the problem isn’t the promise of the return of the generalist in itself: <strong>the problem is the way this may emerge within the scenario we have</strong>.</p><p>Look: unlike a reformed education in which people don’t isolate themselves into niches, what can happen is:</p><blockquote>a professional who keeps the same aptitudes as before, but starts delegating to the machine responsibilities they don’t really know how to develop.</blockquote><p>As the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">NN/G article</a> approaches this issue, the professional can get an <strong>AI boost</strong> — that is, manage to produce outputs in areas they didn’t master before. The output is produced, but the user’s cognition may remain the same as before.</p><p><em>Okay, but what’s the problem with that?</em></p><p>The issue here is that we’re operating primarily with <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, created specifically by companies that operate on a global level. These models learn human language (whether textual or imagistic) from enormous amounts of data to generate, through statistics and probability, responses that are coherent to us, humans. In more technical words, they function as <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fthink%2Ftopics%2Flarge-language-models"">token “prediction” machines</a>: given an input text (prompt), the model estimates what the most likely next token will be and uses that to build the output. I know each AI will have a more specific functioning (with image and video models), but in general, they all operate with statistics from the training specific to the company that created them.</p><p>That’s why AI today is not an intelligence in the human sense of the word: it’s a super complex machine that can learn countless patterns across all areas for which data is digitally available. That’s why it (at least not yet) doesn’t have what some have been calling <strong>neuro-symbolic reasoning</strong>.</p><p>A didactic example given by <a href=""https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/technology-monitoring/techsonar/neuro-symbolic-artificial-intelligence_en"">Massimo Attoresi</a> is about reasoning in medicine: if a patient shows up with a rare symptom that has no report in previous studies, medical knowledge can be mobilized by a human to understand how to unravel that symptom. An LLM can’t do that: it can hallucinate and produce plausible answers or images, because its training prioritizes generating believable responses, even in the absence of sufficient knowledge to solve certain problems.</p><p>For most users, it’s more frustrating to receive an “I don’t know,” which is a questionable UX decision of these platforms. So when a designer who had a specialty starts producing any other specialty with LLMs, they will begin developing that only with the support of that machine that brings the probabilistic result most desired by the global average. And, even more importantly, that person will understand that their work is the output itself!</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>a professional identity is not defined only by what is delivered at the end, but by the cognitive and symbolic construction that allows one to cross complex processes </strong>— including those still unknown to the models or to humanity itself.</p><p>I’ve said so much here, and I wanted to add a parenthesis: yes, it’s possible to do a lot of design using LLMs today — in all instances of our work, including those we wouldn’t be able to do without AI due to training limitations. Now, it’s necessary to understand that when we train an agent to make the machine operate like a specialist in some part of the UX/UI process, we’re always generating probabilistic answers without a neuro-symbolic background to face new, unmapped situations.</p><p>And it’s exactly at this point that the risk lives. It’s a risk of homogenizing solutions, writing styles, innovation processes, visuals — and even code, in the case of massive reliance on LLMs. Unless the support comes from the professional identity path.</p><h3>The professional path as identity</h3><figure><img alt=""Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*-vNTMz5SGhCbVqbY"" /><figcaption>Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>Think with me through an example:</p><blockquote>We have a designer who works with digital products and who has always, since very young, fit into a more communicational axis.</blockquote><blockquote>She spent years going deep to create highly visual platforms with unique animations that create an impact that many brands want.</blockquote><blockquote>She also grew by feeding on aesthetic sensitivity, managing to blend branding with product design very well in digital platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, everything she does visually is guided by the feeling built throughout that professional trajectory. And that feeling is based on concepts and methods studied for years, which <strong>allow</strong> her to get through very different problems without impediment.</blockquote><p>That person today may look at the current scenario and begin to feel anxiety and an identity crisis: “<em>Maybe my work won’t be valued anymore in some time because of AI.</em>” With that, she might start using different LLMs, trying to deliver in research areas (both qualitative and quantitative) and also to produce Design Systems, creating already-coded components.</p><p>What will probably happen in the long run if this person doesn’t start studying those fields instead of only creating outputs with AI? <strong>We lose a talent in one area to create a generalist who produces a bit of everything — but only through the LLM</strong>. And because it’s only with the help of that kind of tool, her deliveries will tend to fit the globally expected statistical average.</p><p>Now, what happens if that same person starts using AI to deepen her work, but also to experiment with adjacent areas in order to learn how they work? It’s at this point that I think we gain more from the use of LLMs today.</p><p>Beyond automating manual and exhausting tasks, the AI boost can be applied to our training, enabling dialogues and cooperation with peers that used to be very difficult. And, returning to our dear Edgar Morin, collective thinking becomes more complex because, even though each person maintains their specialization, everyone can understand or do the basics of their teammates’ work — even if with less depth.</p><p>I think this is a very subtle difference, but fundamental for understanding the difference between production and innovation in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Want to talk more about this?<br /> Send me a message on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscervo/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><h3>References</h3><p>GIBBONS, Sarah; SUNWALL, Evan.

<h4><strong><em>Designing how models behave.</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a ux team working together building AI products using data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K1TUKUFPN-K327z9HhexYg.png"" /><figcaption>UX team using their new toolkit (Ilustration from Nothing Fancy)</figcaption></figure><p>We have entered a world where the experience is generated in the moment, and users react to it. The days when products rendered code that produced exactly what we designed are numbered. When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event.

Y Combinator.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A necessary mental shift for designers</strong></h4><p>For designers, this is a new space to conquer; it requires a mental shift away from deterministic systems and toward behavioral design. This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop. It is a hands-on training for designers shaping AI behavior through data, context, and evaluations. </em><a href=""https://www.nothingfancy.ai/#workshops""><em>Available now.</em></a></p><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=""https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals?promoCode=google-ads&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=23489291219&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23489291219&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA_BlNfmeyjzZpPokar-f2TbcswODy&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAs4HMBhBJEiwACrfNZeYc3LBNOstL9BGqVwQJa6CCLJzI-rILCAMyapthniBV6dE5XAYZKRoCSHEQAvD_BwE"">AI Evals For Engineers &amp; PMs</a> Maven</p><p><a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/"">AI Design Field Guide</a></p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/8rABwKRsec4?si=-YJkHdgny9AuhjTI"">The New Code — Sean Grove, OpenAI</a></p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/SYisFbhR7xs?si=-s7RfH2fXJYodbQg"">No Priors Ep. 128 | With Andrew Ng</a></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model designer</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9bd09fea466d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-new-ux-toolkit-data-context-and-evals-9bd09fea466d"">The new UX Toolkit: data, context, and evals</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
