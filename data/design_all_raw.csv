<h4>Visual foundations are an art that must be mastered, but stable cognitive patterns, the ones widely used in design, marketing, and behavioral science, are a law that we need to follow.</h4><figure><img alt=""Finger tapping a touchscreen showing red “ADD TO CART” and green “BUY NOW” buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9zOepvcW30zlJTGSBf4KxQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image was generated by Nano Banana (<a href=""https://gemini.google.com"">Google Gemini</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>For us as designers, this means diving deeper into psychology and user cognition. For our users, applying these principles and laws translates into simpler, more intuitive interactions and a smoother overall experience.</p><p>What may seem like ordinary observations or best practices from experienced designers are, in fact, scientific findings from the world of psychology. Researches we can easily integrate into our work to make our users’ journey much simpler. Today we’re going to talk about:</p><ul><li>Hick–Hyman Law</li><li>Cognitive Load Theory</li><li>Fitts’s Law</li></ul><p>Briefly, without unnecessary fluff. But I’ll allow myself to add to the dry definitions not just examples from Apple designers, who are almost always a great source of inspiration for beginners. I’d like to bring this down to an everyday level we all encounter, so you can explain these laws even to a 6-year-old. We’ll take a walk through the restaurants in your neighborhood and see what they can teach us.</p><h3>Hick–Hyman Law</h3><p>Many of us, myself included, have probably found ourselves sitting in a restaurant, staring at a menu for far too long, unable to decide what to order. This usually happens when the menu is extensive and the dishes don’t differ much from one another.</p><p>The reason behind this lies in the <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/""><em>Hick–Hyman Law</em></a>, which states that <strong>the time required to make a decision increases with the number of available choices.</strong> In other words, the more options we offer our users, the harder it becomes for them to make a confident decision and the longer it takes.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._Hick"">William Edmund Hick</a>, in his study <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hick%201952.pdf""><em>On the Rate of Gain of Information</em></a>, examines entropy and bits in the context of perception. Through his experiment, he concludes that human perception functions as a channel through which information flows, and the capacity of this channel is limited. Therefore, the more bits of information that need to be transmitted, the longer the transmission will take.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Hyman"">Ray Hyman</a>, in his subsequent article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/InfoProc/pdfs/Hyman%201953.pdf""><em>Stimulus Information as a Determinant of Reaction Time</em></a>, not only experimentally confirms Hick’s findings but also refines them. He adds that not only the amount of information but also different combinations of information chunks influence the speed at which it is transmitted. This is how the Hick–Hyman Law was born.</p><figure><img alt=""A black-and-white photo of a man standing at a podium (left) addressing an audience, with three panelists seated at a long table behind him."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*uI4-UKceI6xHWEjO.jpg"" /><figcaption>Ray Hyman by Robert Sheaffer. <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24738861"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The restaurant industry uses this law consciously: for instance, high-end restaurants often limit the number of dishes on their menu to reduce decision time and the stress that customers experience at the moment of choice.</p><p>But both approaches work. It all depends on the business model.<br />Lower-priced restaurants rely on the idea that you’ll order as many dishes and snacks as possible. Given the lower prices, the time spent browsing the menu can actually increase the average check, which is why they’ll often leave an extra menu on your table, inviting you to keep exploring.</p><figure><img alt=""Big menu on a wall of small restaurant"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/715/0*azhh8mbVmuKteBzz.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of big menu. <a href=""https://favbulous.com/post/7102/secret-tips-and-tricks-behind-a-restaurant-menu"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In “fancy restaurants”, however, it’s much harder to raise the average check this way. The focus shifts instead to creating a memorable experience that makes the guest want to return. And to do that, the goal is to pull the customer away from the menu as early as possible and start “delivering the show”: the sommelier, the open kitchen, the service, the atmosphere. It’s all part of the same psychological choreography.</p><p>We can apply the same logic to the world of design. For example, by hiding secondary filters under an accordion, we can reduce the delay before the first user action by roughly one-third.</p><p>Apple uses a similar principle. On their website, you can’t compare more than three products at once. You’re always making a choice among a maximum of three options. For Apple, the time from the start of the user flow to the moment of purchase is one of a key metrics and offering more alternatives would only slow down decision-making.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of compare function on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0aIHqR3VhkhNDbstU6xSA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of compare function (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/iphone/compare/"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><h3>Cognitive Load Theory</h3><p>Of course, I think the title already gives it away. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sweller"">John Sweller</a> in <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1207/s15516709cog1202_4""><em>Cognitive Load During Problem Solving: Effects on Learning</em></a> states that <strong>our working memory is limited </strong>and this directly affects both how we process information and how we make decisions. In other words according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/cognitive-load/"">Cognitive Load Theory</a> we’re not comfortable solving large or complex problems all at once.</p><figure><img alt=""Smiling elderly man wearing glasses outdoors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XrUIXxGR10nXSjay.png"" /><figcaption>John Sweller. <a href=""https://neshnikolic.com/podcast/john-sweller"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Have you ever noticed that when you go to an upscale restaurant, the food menu and the wine list are presented separately and often by different people? The waiter handles the main menu, while the sommelier, trained specifically to guide and advise on wine, takes care of the rest.</p><figure><img alt=""Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*QBPkjrpYmM4HIAcT.jpg"" /><figcaption>Sommelier pours the wine into a decanter. <a href=""https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/psychology-role-design-michelin-star-restaurant-wine-menu"">Image Sourse</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even in more casual restaurants, the waiter usually approaches the table with a specific question: “Have you decided what you’d like to drink?”</p><p>For context: I live in Germany, and this is a standard part of the customer flow here. In my home culture, however, the question usually goes the other way around: “Have you decided what you’d like to eat?” but not what to drink. So I often catch German waiters off guard when I say: “Please come back later for the drinks, but I’m ready to order the food.”</p><p>But the real lesson here is that everyone in this process knows their role and timing. You’re not expected to make all your choices at once. You start by focusing on the drinks (a small, simple decision) and only afterward the waiter gives you additional time to choose your meal.</p><p>And, of course, in design we try to take this natural limitation of the brain into account. That’s why we often split long registration forms into three short steps. This way, the user isn’t overwhelmed by a wall of questions on a single page. Instead, they move through the process gradually, with focused attention at each step, which reduces cognitive load and increases completion rates.</p><p>Or take Apple, for example. When you’ve already compared three different devices, chosen your new desired iPhone, and clicked the Buy button, a new quest begins: the configuration page.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e_S70WT8ETmQiK3Gs6xxZw.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The magic of this page lies in the fact that you’re never asked one big, abstract question like “What do you want?”. Instead, you’re guided through a series of small, sequential choices, where each step is a separate task. The entire process is designed to prevent you from overthinking how your final selection will look. Everything unfolds gradually, with minimal complexity, and without showing all the options at once.</p><p>And even when we can see several questions on the page at once, they make all inactive options unselectable, as if showing us the only correct path for configuring the device.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Product configuration page on Apple Website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BdOC6Wc7jdYKQHWsQL90YQ.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of Configuration page (<a href=""https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-air"">Apple.com</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Apple, in general, uses plenty of clever tricks to sell us what they want us to buy, rather than what we initially came for. One good example is the Pricing Ladder a tactic perfectly explained by MKBHD in a <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/NiNYOZZLOyg?si=kw9xYmQvrJhdcjA4"">one-minute video</a> that I highly recommend watching before you buy your next Apple device.</p><p>At the same time, other companies can use these techniques against us, essentially bombarding us with constant stimuli and information. Take the AliExpress app, for example. Before you even reach the actual products, you’re overloaded. You’ll see a spinning prize wheel three times, be told about two free gifts, be invited to play a game to win an extra discount, and only after all these circles of hell will you finally reach the main page. And even there, you’re hit with a dozen more psychological triggers, all carefully designed to wear down your cognitive defenses and fill your cart with things you never intended to buy.</p><figure><img alt=""Product page showing wireless earbuds with charging case on Temu."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9fi-SRlclHTlZely7ctCYA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of overwhelming Product page (<a href=""https://www.temu.com/-new-wireless-earbuds-for-running-sports-wireless-earphones-with-earhooks-pure--sound-over-ear-headphones-enc-noise-cancelling-with-dual-led-display-earphones-built-in-microphone-g-601099512659332.html?_oak_mp_inf=EIT7tJem1ogBGhZmbGFzaF9zYWxlX2xpc3RfejFqNjkxILuFwt%2BtMw%3D%3D&amp;top_gallery_url=https%3A%2F%2Fimg.kwcdn.com%2Fproduct%2F1e23310424%2F15bb81f1-bb50-420f-88da-13f8b03f85c7_1600x1600.jpeg&amp;spec_gallery_id=601099512659332&amp;refer_page_sn=10132&amp;refer_source=0&amp;freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_freesia_scene=116&amp;_oak_rec_ext_1=MjM0NQ&amp;refer_page_el_sn=201401&amp;_x_channel_src=1&amp;_x_channel_scene=spike&amp;_x_sessn_id=dfl5866dsz&amp;refer_page_name=lightning-deals&amp;refer_page_id=10132_1764626564415_d6jkn51kcm"">Temu</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The same approach is used by Temu and other simillar apps. Some might say this is just a regional design style common in Asian markets, but I’d counter that argument with Candy Crush, which uses the same cognitive overload mechanics and was created by a Swedish company for a Western audience.</p><h3>Fitts’s Law</h3><p><strong>The time it takes for a person to reach or interact with a target depends on the distance to the target and its size</strong>, according to <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/"">Fitts’s Law</a><em>. </em>The closer and larger the target is, the faster and easier it is to click or tap on it.</p><p>In his article <a href=""https://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/mordkoff/infoproc/pdfs/Fitts%201954.pdf""><em>The Information Capacity of the Human Motor System in Controlling the Amplitude of Movement</em></a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fitts"">Paul Fitts</a> not only quantitatively measured the influence of target size and distance on the action performed with it, but also argued that the motor–nervous system has a limited processing capacity, which imposes constraints on the speed and accuracy of our reactions.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man in a suit and bow tie."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2-lVJtDadnVMpeyttm_8jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Paul M. Fitts. <a href=""https://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhl/x-hs15404/hs15404"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>In our restaurant example, this could be something like a table tent featuring the dishes of the week, the chef’s recommendations, or the daily lunch specials.</p><p>The manager may not be consciously thinking about Fitts’s Law, but they instinctively know that if a guest sees the lunch specials right away during lunchtime, it can influence how quickly they place an order. Since this option is physically close to the customer and visually prominent, it perfectly satisfies both conditions of Fitts’s Law: proximity and target size.</p><figure><img alt=""Hard Rock table tent dessert menu display featuring sundaes and milkshake bites."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*baWG3S9OxBQ3P_5o.jpg"" /><figcaption>Table Tent. <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/20475989/Hardrock-Cafe-tent-cards"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s take Apple again as an example. When we walk into an Apple Store, we see a large number of devices neatly arranged on tables. And there’s a clear logic behind how they’re placed, including the influence of Fitts’s Law.</p><figure><img alt=""Modern tech store interior with display tables, staff, and a central glass staircase."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/0*F_ia-vEjHfQ52Tlh.jpg"" /><figcaption>Apple Store on 5th Avenue. <a href=""https://www.apple.com/de/newsroom/2019/09/apple-fifth-avenue-the-cube-is-back/"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Notice the height of the tables and the way the devices are positioned: everything is arranged so that it’s as easy and natural as possible for you to reach out and touch them. After all, the store’s primary goal isn’t just to sell devices, it’s to let you experience them. Ideally, Apple wants you to pick them up, test the new iPhone Pro or Air, listen to the headphones, or sketch on an iPad. Apple designs the entire environment so that you never have to stretch or hesitate. The devices seem to magically fall into your hands.</p><h3>Bringing it all together</h3><p>We saw how limiting the number of choices can accelerate decision-making, how breaking complex processes into smaller steps can reduce cognitive strain, and how proximity and scale can influence the speed and ease of action.</p><p>From restaurant menus to digital interfaces, from Apple’s carefully guided flows to AliExpress’s sensory chaos, the same psychological mechanisms are at play. They remind us that design is never neutral: every pixel, choice, and delay subtly shapes human behavior.</p><p>Of course, these are only a few examples. There are many more behavioral laws and cognitive principles worth exploring such as: <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/von-restorff-effect/"">Von Restorff effect</a>, <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/teslers-law/"">Tesler’s Law</a>, of course, the well-known <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/occams-razor/"">Occam’s Razor</a>, which we as designers should always keep close and others that I recommend you take a look at on this very handy website — <a href=""https://lawsofux.com/"">https://lawsofux.com/</a>.</p><p>I encourage you not only to look into them, but to experiment with it your self, and find the right balance for your product. And let’s always approach our users with respect and empathy, using our understanding of human nature for good, not manipulation.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5fb08e7917a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/designing-decisions-behavioral-psychology-that-moves-users-e5fb08e7917a"">Designing decisions: Behavioral psychology that moves users</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Maybe it’s the separation from the human energy of urban centres. Or maybe it’s simply excitement for where I’m heading today.</p><p>I join the commuters spilling out into the surrounding streets like a burst dam, meandering through buses, traffic lights and signposts. As I walk further, the torrents thin as people are absorbed into glass fronted offices and revolving doors, until it feels like I’m the last one walking.</p><p>Suddenly, in front of me, the gothic towers of Westminster Abbey rise up. I ponder the pioneering architects who imagined it, and the brave souls who built it. I consider the sovereigns it’s crowned, wedded and mourned, and the wonderful sense of awe it’s provided through the ages.</p><p>Before I’ve taken a dozen more steps, I hear the famous chimes of Big Ben. It appears behind the Abbey, a golden marvel glittering in the gloom, and standing guard to the adjoining Houses of Parliament. I wonder what it’s like to bear witness to some of Britain’s most profound moments and movements.</p><p>It’s the perfect introduction to my purpose today: the 2nd <a href=""https://journalofbiophilicdesign.com/biophilic-design-conference"">Biophilic Design Conference</a> in Central Hall Westminster, London. A wonderful event that brings together the world’s leading architects, interior designers, urban planners, creatives and innovators — with a mission to create a healthier, more resilient and regenerative world.</p><p>Here are my reflections on a day spent exploring a vibrant, biophilic future.</p><h3>There’s a shifting mindset to systemic change.</h3><p>The first clue arrived in the theme of the day: <em>“Biophilic Design for a Regenerative Future”</em>.</p><p>Sustainability is out! Regeneration is in! But the distinction is an important one. Regenerative design goes beyond traditional sustainability ambitions to create systems and structures that cause a net-positive impact on both environment and society.</p><p>In simpler terms, rather than finding a point of equilibrium, it recognises the damage we’ve done to our natural ecosystems and seeks to both restore and regenerate those systems.</p><p>Regenerative design also recognises the viewpoint that human and natural systems are deeply interwoven and interconnected. The global crises we face today such as climate, biodiversity loss and mental health are not standalone issues, but symptoms of a deeper disconnection between humanity and nature.</p><p>I loved this quote from Donella Meadows, author of <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557"">Thinking in Systems</a>, as shared by Luke Engleback in his talk about ecourbanism<em>:</em></p><blockquote>“Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions simultaneously.”</blockquote><p>As the day progresses, it’s clear that this mindset shift is still evolving. Many talks tend to zoom in towards individual crises like climate — whereas the real predicament to overcome remains our systemic disconnection from nature.</p><p><em>(If you’re interested in exploring more about the processes and thinking behind regenerative design, I found </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@ernesto-87727/the-art-of-regenerative-design-26bde27f72f8""><em>this article</em></a><em> a really good starting point).</em></p><h3>“There’s no such thing as neutral space.”</h3><p>If there’s one takeaway from the whole day, — and indeed the keynote from <a href=""https://www.farrowpartners.ca/"">Tye Farrow</a>, leading architect and author of the wonderful book <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Constructing-Health-Built-Environment-Enhances/dp/1487557221"">Constructing Health</a> — I think it’s this.</p><p>I love the simplicity of the message. That our built environment will take us one of two ways: it can undermine health, or it can cause health.

It’s the best summary I’ve found for exploring the very nature of biophilic and salutogenic design through architectural research that draws on fields including environmental psychology and neuroscience. It’s also a beautiful publication.</p><p>Tye’s focus on health is a critical reminder not just of the core focus of biophilic design, but what <em>all</em> design could be — and its basis in the natural world.</p><p>Architects are the undisputed forerunners, but there’s plenty of industries <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/5-biophilic-ux-solutions-for-a-sustainable-future-5d58a217649c"">exploring this further.</a></p><h3>Focusing on children is both heart-warming and mission critical.</h3><p>I found it incredibly moving to hear of wonderful businesses and approaches focused on offering the youngest minds of our world the experiences for a different future.</p><p>Adam White and Andrée Davies, founders of <a href=""https://www.davieswhite.co.uk/"">Davies-White Ltd</a>, are landscape architects specialising in nature-connected family friendly landscapes and gardens, created through the use of natural, sustainable materials. Their work exemplified how biophilic projects can capture the attention of leading advocates of the natural world, such as Sir David Attenborough and the Princess of Wales, but most importantly, how these biophilic spaces empower children.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vxDYbodWXa1aOcuit3nVWw.png"" /><figcaption>The Wild Garden at Caudwell International Children’s Centre at Keele University, supporting children with developmental disabilities (Credit: Davies-White Ltd)</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, it was brilliant to see <a href=""https://www.theschoolofbiophilia.co.uk/"">School of Biophilia</a> exhibiting — inspired, I’m told, by last year’s conference. Their focus is on sharing the power of biophilia to connect people with the natural world, focused not just on schools, but also businesses and workplaces too.</p><p>For me, it was a timely reminder that nature reconnection is a long term mission that arguably requires the young more than any other demographic. And given our connections with nature are often forged in childhood, it’s a critical area of focus for today.</p><h3>Cities can drive change. But it shouldn’t stop there.</h3><p>Figures shared from the World Economic Forum’s BiodiverCities project attribute cities being responsible for 80% of global GDP. They also contribute around 75% of greenhouse gases, and consume 75% of natural resources. When you consider they house 54% of the global population, the imbalance is clear.</p><p>From an urban planning and architectural perspective, I can understand why cities present a major opportunity for change. As Nick Grayson, former Climate Change Sustainability and Green City Manager at Birmingham City Council shared:</p><blockquote>“Nature underpins the whole growth and quality of life agenda yet most cities see nature as a maintenance issue and a cut-able budget”.</blockquote><p>Birmingham was already seen as one of Europe’s greener cities, but through the lens of the <a href=""https://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html"">Millenium Ecosystem Assessment</a>, uncovered critical need to improve the quality, size and connectedness of its green spaces to ensure nature provided wider societal benefits in areas like wellbeing, climate resilience, and managing economic risk.</p><figure><img alt=""Curving pathway covered by a deep canopy of trees"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DSsmEFPtFejzDl_SQFpL1g.png"" /><figcaption>City of Nature Plan (Credit: Bimingham City Council)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s response was to trail blaze a new governance model for cities to place nature at the heart of their overall strategy. Nature now lies at the centre of the whole council plan — including housing, children, health and jobs — and helped Birmingham to the exciting accolade of becoming the UK’s first “<a href=""https://naturallybirmingham.org/birmingham-city-of-nature-delivery-framework/"">City of Nature</a>”.</p><p>As Rob Delius, Head of Sustainability at design practice <a href=""https://stridetreglown.com/"">Stride Treglown</a>, shared whilst drawing on the example of Singapore:</p><blockquote>“Cities can completely reimagine themselves as a city in nature.”</blockquote><h3>But what about the indoors?</h3><p>Plans to transform cities into truly biophilic spaces are incredibly exciting and urgently required. But there’s clearly a need to go further, and <em>inside</em> these spaces too.</p><p>The average person spends 90% of their time <em>indoors</em> (a much travelled figure now decades old but rarely disputed). It’s where most of us spend a whopping <em>22 hours</em> of our day working, resting and sleeping.</p><p>It’s our indoor spaces that offer the ripest opportunity for paradigm-shifting change, if we get it right. Digital interventions are one route that can magic the ultimate biophilic experiences through personal, scalable and effective nature-powered spaces to transform health and performance.</p><p>It also leans into another topic that came up a number of times in conversations I had at the conference — the importance of designing for neurodiversity.</p><p>As our understanding around conditions like ADHD and autism improve, it reveals how poor certain spaces are for supporting these people. Leaning into digital offers up new opportunities for personalising individual spaces to suit different types of people, tasks and needs with effortless ease.</p><h3>Artificial intelligence can support natural intelligence.</h3><p>Beyond <a href=""https://www.moodsonic.com/"">Moodsonic</a>, a generative soundscape creator for workplaces, hospitals and education, I’m not sure I heard AI mentioned once at the conference.</p><p>This exclusion felt neither deliberate nor coincidental, but perhaps further symptomatic of a world where humanity and nature do remain extraordinarily separate.</p><p>There’s no doubt AI can be a major accelerant for the biophilic design movement. It’s not about competing with nature but creating meaningful ways to interweave its magic with our daily lives.</p><p>Visuals, sounds, air quality, lighting and temperature all contribute to the “feel” of our environments, impacting the way we think, feel and behave. They can increasingly be measured, assessed and recreated, ultimately crafting adaptive environments that offer direct evidence-based health interventions, and can instantly respond to our changing physiological needs.</p><p>It will help close the gap between design intent and real-world outcomes — bringing more science into the art of design. It can help create spaces that don’t just <em>feel</em> biophilic, but are <em>quantifiably</em> biophilic too.</p><p>There’s a lot to talk about here, and we’ll undoubtedly see and hear much more in future months of wonderful examples where AI has helped unlock some truly innovative biophilic solutions.</p><h3>We’re still stuck with numbers.</h3><p>One of the recurring frustrations I’ve heard from members of the biophilic design community is despite the long-standing and irrefutable evidence in support of biophilic design, it still struggles to scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Tropical plants contained within a large spherical dome"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_e4yWEHYbLs8eCYqhGaJiw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Places like the plant-filled spheres at Amazon’s Head Offices, Seattle, are rare and expensive (Credit: <a href=""https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/30/plant-filled-seattle-spheres-open-amazon-headquarters/"">Dezeen</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As summarised by Oliver Health, founder of design consultancy <a href=""https://www.oliverheathdesign.com/"">Oliver Health Design</a>, biophilic design remains silo’d by factors including cost, education, research adoption, regulation and procurement.</p><p>But I also think it remains misunderstood outside the industry. Beyond the numbers of percentage uplifts in productivity, wellbeing and performance — which come from environmental psychologists, architectural practices and design businesses, lie <em>human</em> stories. And we’re less good at making these the heroes of our ambitions.</p><p>To draw on Nick Grayson once more, he touched on the power of seeking “Earth Stories” to both engage locals in plans to transform Birmingham into a true “City of Nature” and to draw out people’s own realisations of the proximity of nature to people’s own faith, quality of life and way of living.</p><p>The power of storytelling is something I’ve learned a lot from my time at <a href=""http://portal.app/experience"">Portal</a>. We’ve tried to avoid dry statistics of how Portal might make people feel “27% less stressed”, or help “83% of customers sleep better”, in favour of sharing genuine, wholesome customer stories.</p><p>We’ve heard of Portal being used from childbirth to end-of-life care, to create the most beautiful and dignified experiences. We’re heard of its usage in war zones like Ukraine to protect children from the sounds of bombs landing on their city, and help them find sleep. We’ve heard of Portal helping customers manage challenging conditions like psychosis, narcolepsy and autism.</p><p>We humans are a species that communicate through stories. If we’re to create products and experiences that connect people with the natural world, then its stories — not stats — that we should champion to spread our message.</p><h3>Our biophilic future requires a connection of hearts and minds.</h3><p>Reflecting on the day, I find myself returning to the Birmingham example once more, and the realisation that their green city had so much more headroom to grow.</p><blockquote>“Birmingham’s nature wasn’t big enough, joined up enough or high enough quality to be able to reach all its citizens to give them wellbeing. It wasn’t sufficient to stand up to climate resilience and risk, and put the city at economic risk. We knew we had to do something.”</blockquote><p>I feel the same about our biophilic community. The day shared countless examples of brilliant projects, businesses and initiatives, and I hope the next 12 months sees more of us collaborate in the name of health and nature connection.</p><p>To take the NHS as an example, there were plenty of examples throughout the day of the application of biophilic principles in care, treatment and recovery settings, but I could feel the frustration at the difficulty of rolling out these successes at greater scale.</p><p>In my mind, the key challenge is to shift <em>hearts and minds</em> — of decision makers, creators and communities. Our strongest hand to achieve this is by continuing to create the most incredible experiences, sharing the human stories of transformation that lie behind them, and collaborating.</p><p>I hope, driven by values in community and connection, we can continue to surface more evidence and inspiration to improve the quality of what we do, and ensure nature-powered design spreads deeper across all industries.</p><p>With nature, we have a beautiful, wise and magical companion — it’s time to rediscover that flourishing future together.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d896346da3c3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/biophilic-design-is-the-wellness-revolution-happening-all-around-us-d896346da3c3"">Biophilic design is the wellness revolution happening all around us</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4><strong>How outdated decision logics are undermining Labour’s ambitions for a mission-driven government.</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting A to B problem-solving which ignores the complexity around us."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OlV0rTXNIS06whCZ.png"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.businessillustrator.com/"">Virpi Oinonen</a></figcaption></figure><p>Given Labour won the last general election on the promise of national renewal and a mission-driven state with a “relentless focus on long-term ends” after years of crisis management — frustration is understandable. After the Budget this week, it feels as if political ambition has met the practical reality of sustaining long-term political direction inside institutions designed around stability and risk management. Add a “<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2e12j4gz0o"">black hole</a>” in public finances and sporadic and often contradictory regulation, and it has rarely been harder for public servants to know what to decide — or, <em>critically</em>, how to make decisions in the first place.</p><p>Drawing on my work in early-stage policymaking at HMRC and research at UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, this short piece of “writing as thinking” argues that the UK’s public institutions are structurally incapable of navigating uncertainty because they are built on a decision-making logic designed for predictability, control and linear planning — not for complexity, learning or adaptation. Because, if the UK is serious about missions, or<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/labour-promises-radical-shake-up-of-uk-civil-service""> radically</a> overhauling how the civil service thinks and works, the everyday practicalities of how decisions are framed, contested and made will need to change.</p><h3>The issue of managing uncertainty</h3><p>Across government and beyond, a lot of my work has been at the earliest stages of decision-making — where ideas are half-baked, assumptions untested, and uncertainty is at its highest. In these spaces, one of the things I see teams struggle with the most is the ability to be agile enough to experiment, learn and iterate while being stable enough to maintain direction and meet deadlines. In fact, as<a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-176398097?selection=9c71ba4a-9687-4262-8f6d-c025eca300e1#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20an%20innovation%20ecosystem%20that%20excels%20at%20designing%20frameworks%20but%20struggles%20to%20change%20itself""> Rainer Kattel</a> and<a href=""https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/iterate-if-you-can-5f14b93a48cf""> James Plunkett</a> have noted, institutions are often <em>both</em> too stable and too agile — highly proficient at producing procedures and frameworks that promise control, yet poor at learning, experimenting, or re-orienting in the midst of uncertainty. The result is an all too familiar blend of paralysis, short-termism, and “<a href=""https://re-state.co.uk/publications/everythingism-an-essay/"">everythingism</a>”: needing to respond to everything while changing little.</p><p>This dynamic is not accidental. It is a lasting hangover from New Public Management — a model that has compartmentalised and hollowed out the civil service in order to make it measurable, auditable and controllable. Designed for an era of fewer citizens, slower information flows and limited data capacity, our civil service is oriented around prediction and control despite vast improvements in data, research and digital infrastructure. Put simply, we have left ourselves in a situation where we are taking 21st century challenges, evaluating them with 20th century tools, and responding within 19th century institutions built in a different time <em>and</em> for a different time.</p><p>In “Seeing Like a State”, James C Scott describes this as the state’s drive for “legibility” — making societies administratively visible by simplifying their complexity into categories that can be planned for. To illustrate this he uses the example of modern scientific forestry in Prussia. In an effort to maximise timber output, foresters cleared mixed woodlands and replanted them in perfectly straight rows of a single fast-growing species. The first generation produced higher yields, fantastic. But, by the second and third generations, yields collapsed. The drive for order — monoculture, straight lines, predictability — had unintentionally erased the complex, interdependent ecology that sustained the forest and made it viable in the first place.</p><p>New Public Management simply extends this logic into government, treating institutions as machines to be ordered rather than ecosystems to be stewarded. It rewards prediction over understanding and linear planning over iterative learning in what Funtowicz and Ravetz call a “<a href=""https://www.nusap.net/downloads/funtowiczandravetz1994.pdf"">doctrine reinforced by guesswork</a>,” reliant on cost–benefit analysis and other appraisal tools built for marginal change in predictable environments. These methods make little room for uncertainty or contested values because they flatten complexity, obscure causality and routinely miss the non-linear, cascading effects that dominate policymaking. The result is a higher<a href=""https://options2040.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Radical-How.pdf""> risk of expensive failures</a>, often harming those most in need.</p><p>More fundamentally, this mode of public problem-solving is simply too slow and too distant from the people it is meant to help, offering little opportunity for learning or course correction in the first place. And, for policymaking — a forum directly concerned with people and their behaviour — it is simply not tenable to expect civil servants and ministers to predict, design and justify interventions up-front without addressing these structural constraints. Put as many<a href=""https://publicpolicydesign.blog.gov.uk/2023/02/09/what-does-policymaking-look-like/""> policy design cycles</a> in front as me as you would like, the “waterfall” model of policy delivery, illustrated in <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how""><em>The Radical How</em></a>, makes this explicit. Planning happens early, implementation happens late, and evaluation tends to arrive long after the window for improvement has closed.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration depicting a waterfall policymaking process where decisions are made upfront when the least is known."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/0*owRgK1xqCP8gatf1.png"" /><figcaption>Waterfall policymaking — <a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how"">The Radical How</a></figcaption></figure><p>Recent literature on Human Learning Systems pushes this argument further, describing how this creates a “<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/uploads/Public-service-for-the-new-world.pdf"">pathological culture of blame and defensiveness</a>,” within the civil service, where ambiguity is treated as error and risk is transferred onto individuals. Even when uncertainty is real and unavoidable, public officials are expected to present polished cases that imply certainty, rather than surface complexity or challenge assumptions — something I see time and time again within HMRC. What this ultimately means is that talented civil servants (of which I work with many) become trapped in an environment where they are punished for being wrong, rewarded for nothing going wrong, and rarely recognised when things go right.</p><p>This paralysis and culture of negativity isn’t individualised. I work with and have met so many talented, driven and imaginative civil servants. However, because the institutional grammar, design and hierarchy of decision-making treats uncertainty as a threat to be contained rather than a condition to be worked with, they are not given the time or space to do their best work. We have designed our organisations to reduce risk and cost under the premise of control but failed to appreciate how work actually gets done in complex systems — <a href=""https://paulcairney.wordpress.com/2025/11/06/why-dont-governments-learn-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/"">ultimately treating learning as political performance</a>.</p><blockquote><a href=""https://playingwithtime.substack.com/p/three-insights-from-a-week-of-conversations"">Recent reflections</a> from municipal leaders in China — long associated with rigid target-driven governance — note that obligatory numerical targets distort behaviour, narrow attention and create perverse incentives within institutions.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, this manifests as both a bias towards inaction and an inclination to make decisions when the least is known. Jen Pahlka memorably phrases this as “<a href=""https://www.notion.so/Unfit-for-uncertainty-Rethinking-decision-making-for-missions-2b003207924880de8466f3c32dd830ab?pvs=21"">policy vomit</a>” — in which the words of the policy are vomited, essentially undigested, into the administration of a policy, without the benefit of thoughtful, learning and iteration. In a department like HMRC, where impact is traditionally inseparable from cost, this often means using cost-benefit analysis (as suggested by the UK government’s guide to policy appraisal <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-green-book-and-accompanying-guidance-and-documents"">— the ‘Green Book’</a>) as a means to centre on the risk of doing something rather than the opportunity for it to go well — effectively excluding learning from the process altogether and overlooking or under-considering real-world dynamics.</p><h3>Towards managing missions or muddling through?</h3><p>Over the last decade, governments and policymakers have been increasingly turning to mission-oriented innovation as a way to break out of incrementalism and tackle the “wicked” problems causing so much trouble for our ways of working today. It signals a shift away from the narrow technocratic logic of correcting market failures towards a more ambitious role for the state in shaping and co-creating markets, mobilising collective action and directing investment towards clearly defined public purposes.</p><p>Labour’s<a href=""https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/""> commitment to a mission-driven government</a>, not dissimilar to those across Europe as part of a broader “third generation” of innovation and policy frameworks, was meant to embody this shift — a break from short-term crisis management and a renewed focus on long-term ends. Essentially, a recognition that neoliberal and technocratic policy tools are fundamentally unsuited to steering complex socio-technical systems as they privilege efficiency, prediction and control over relevance, learning and adaptation.</p><p>There is plenty of<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5348729""> noise on mission theory</a>. The problem, however, is that while there are many practical examples of a shift towards achieving mission policy — and more pragmatic, learning centric ways of policymaking — any meaningful practices generated by this new approach to policy have struggled to take hold.</p><p>Demos Helsinki’s “<a href=""https://demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missions-for-Governance-Demos-Helsinki.pdf"">Missions for governance</a>” paper reports that a 2022 survey of more than 40 OECD countries found that only one in four mission initiatives had a clearly defined target; only 15% had a dedicated governance structure; and only one in ten had a plan for monitoring and evaluation. In other words, while governments are embracing the language of missions, they are implementing them through business-as-usual structures, inherited from New Public Management, rather than transforming the way we make decisions.</p><p>This is perhaps indicative of a larger problem of institutional change. While missions and many other forms of experimental governance look to give us a blueprint for reigniting innovation policy, they do not help shift the entrenched challenges that government faces internally. It makes me wonder — we’ve been practicing systems thinking, futures thinking and experimental forms of governance for decades (with missions as the new synthesis of some of these tools) yet regardless of how good they sound, they haven’t scaled or had the impact any of them promise because they have all failed to address these entrenched challenges (See an interesting expansion of this point <a href=""https://thesystemsthinker.com/why-few-organizations-adopt-systems-thinking/"">here</a>).</p><p>To me, this all suggests that regardless of the approach, the need for a reimagined architecture of our institutions has never been more important if we want missions to be actually transformative rather than symbolic. Missions cannot be delivered through a policymaking architecture optimised for certainty, marginal change and after-the-fact evaluation. They require a state capable of working with uncertainty rather than suppressing it — one that builds learning into the fabric of everyday decision-making, rather than treating it as an optional add-on.</p><h3>Reimagining public value must begin in the texture of everyday decisions.</h3><p>If missions are to mean anything, the civil service needs to rebuild its capacity to create public value as a practice. That requires a new grammar of decision-making: one that treats uncertainty as navigable, frames choices in terms of <em>risk and opportunity</em> rather than cost and control (See<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/final_iipp_2021-03_roa_simon_sharpe_et_al_21_jan.pdf""> Simon Sharpe</a>), and builds learning into the routine choreography of how problems are defined and acted upon.</p><p>This shift depends on everyday practices, not high-level strategies: developing shared strategic alignment; negotiating problem definitions with those affected; testing ideas early; iterating in public; and learning at portfolio scale rather than programme-by-programme. These are the capabilities that make missions possible — and without them, missions will remain symbolic rather than transformative. I will write about those practices elsewhere and be sharing my MPA thesis “(Re)imagining Mission Neighbourhoods: Emerging Practices of Urban Transformation” soon.</p><p>For now, the point is simple. If the UK is serious about missions, it must first change how everyday decisions are made.</p><blockquote>This post is part of <a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/"">CIVICWORKS</a>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</blockquote><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4936e04dc78a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/unfit-for-uncertainty-rethinking-decision-making-for-missions-4936e04dc78a"">Unfit for uncertainty: Rethinking decision-making for missions</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Today we must chose between a. a future where our software environment has a thought-shaped interface on top of all the old kludge, or b. a future where software is built from the ground up to represent our thoughts, not twist or control them.</p><figure><img alt=""Neurons, viewed with a microscope and stained in bright green, connecting to each other."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aGaZun9-bzKxCNydXA5ZoA.png"" /><figcaption>Neurons: incidentally, they are richly and freely connected, not unlike our thinking, which they power.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s how I plot our society’s timeline when it comes to computers:</p><ol><li><strong>Computer-shaped (1941-1979): </strong>The first way we communicated with modern, digital computers was entirely on their terms</li><li><strong>Thing-shaped (1979–2026): </strong>Then we interacted with computers through imagined household objects (e.g. documents, clipboards, desktops)</li><li><strong>Thought-shaped (2026–): </strong>In the future, computer interfaces will be shaped like human thought</li></ol><p>This dam has to break. It happens that AI is doing a lot the breaking: LLMs’ natural language interface is the first of a set of thought-shaped technologies to come into common use. Indeed, we need to make sure that we don’t end up with a “same circus, different clowns” story, with a thin layer of natural language (AI/LLMs) on top of the same old exploitation and insult we’re used to from technology.</p><p>During times of transition like this, we (the users, people who care but are told to shut up) have the opportunity to take things not usually subject to change — systems, norms, standards — and make them better. I think that our computer interfaces (operating systems, applications, user interfaces) are inhumane, and today we have the opportunity to demand humanity.</p><p>I invite you to take a trip with me through the previous eras of technology. Then we can think together about what the new era might look like. Let me explain how we should navigate, before we begin.</p><h3>Navigation</h3><p>There are two things to consider when navigating among these eras:</p><h4>1. Invisibility</h4><p>It might not be immediately and intuitively clear why I make a judgement about, say, the shape of a user interface. To many, even most, the nature of modern computer interfaces is just <em>how they are. </em>I’m here to say that modern computer interfaces are <em>peculiar </em>— just as your regional accent sounds to your fellow citizens, while to you it sounds <em>normal.</em></p><p>Computer interfaces are imaginary, meaning that it’s not always obvious when they are <em>wrong</em>. Unlike a broken limb or a mountain floating in the sky, it’s hard to say that something is wrong when there’s little or nothing to which one can point and say “<em>this</em> is right.”</p><h4>2. Why are we about to enter a new era?</h4><p>Why is technology progressing like this, and why this transition? In my view, technology closer to the shape of human thought is more powerful and enjoyable to use — our desires will pull technology and interfaces in this direction.</p><p>Meanwhile, LLMs with chat-style interfaces are getting very popular. These interfaces are pushing things forward because they are thought-shaped, and seem to be helping people to demand more straightforward and approachable interfaces.</p><p>Our technology is of course held back by those with an interest in keeping things as they are, usually because:</p><ul><li>They sell things that work in the old way</li><li>They control a department that does things in the old way</li><li>They can’t get their head round the new way</li></ul><p>Be vigilant, finally, for fake or dubious progress. For instance, the smartphone boom starting in the mid-noughties gave people something more accessible, but under excessive control by supercorporations. Progress is not a single line, it’s a delta.</p><h4>Ted Nelson</h4><p>Finally, I beseech you to watch and read anything you possibly can by Ted Nelson. More or less everything he predicted has come true, and where technology deviated from his recommendations it is thus weaker. His Ted talk — 1990! — is a great place to start:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6bc8bc7e01a04dafce0f8fb7f47086cb/href"">https://medium.com/media/6bc8bc7e01a04dafce0f8fb7f47086cb/href</a><p>So, to the timeline:</p><h3>The computer-shaped era</h3><p>1941–1979</p><p>Defining machine: IBM 360</p><figure><img alt=""The front panel of an IBM 360 mainframe computer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-bsp32jp41jfeU37C6Thpg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This era is characterized by the fact that, to work with a computer, you needed to do so on the computers terms — with little deviation. If you look at a mainframe or minicomputer, manufactured before the year 2000, it will likely have a lot of switches on the front panel.</p><p>Some of these switches allow you to enter bits directly into the computer’s memory. Each switch controlled a single bit in a given byte, and you flipped the switch up to set the bit as 1 and down for 0.</p><figure><img alt=""The front panel of an IBM 360 mainframe computer, zoomed to show a rank of switches used to set bits in the machine’s memory."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_u20wgrHpO8KpdWJL_qx_g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Editing bits in a byte has little to do with whatever task (like writing or mathematics) you have mind and everything to do with changing the value of bits: a computer’s reason for being. Front panels like this, along with punch cards, and paper and glass terminals, and more, are all examples of computer-shaped interfaces.</p><p>The defining user interface convention of this era was the IBM System 360: a colossal, expensive mainframe system. People ran applications on the 360, but users usually created these themselves. IBM offered several operating systems, but nothing recognizable to a modern user.</p><p>This created a caste of computer professionals to do the work, who naturally adopted a rarefied mindset. These people, having to descend to the level of bits, often never surfaced — or when they did they involved much of the computer’s rigid, sequential way of being into their own.</p><p>Ted Nelson called this “punch card brain.” The mindset is alive today, such as those who act as though one is calling for personal nuclear weapons or the abolition of the British monarchy when we inquire politely about being a little less hierarchical in how we organize data.</p><figure><img alt=""A person sitting at work on a terminal."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hoNVkchvSJPPRm_y-3BPgg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This era was venerable, however, in that it avoided a few pretenses common today: there was no pretend “document” slapped over the underlying data. Back then, what you got is what you get.</p><p>All in all, this era made us think of the computer as big, difficult, and separate. It made repetitive, sequential tasks faster. With nuanced, interleaved thinking, it helped little or not at all.</p><h3>The thing-shaped era</h3><p><strong>1979–2026</strong></p><p>Defining machine: Macintosh</p><figure><img alt=""The Macintosh computer, consisting of an integrated computer and screen, a keyboard and mouse."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bNPdcyT639HVeYZ1i5KCGg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Next came the era of computing in which we worked with computers through digital versions of common office or household objects. For instance the document, clipboard, desktop, file, folder, etc.</p><p>This is in part an apology — for the alienation of the last era — and condescension, in that they went so far as to believe that non-computer people couldn’t understand information and system concepts in themselves, but needed a metaphor to connect it an object in their home or office.</p><p>“See that thing on the screen? [a word processor] It’s like a piece of a paper in the computer.”</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from MacWrite, which is designed to look like a computer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/328/1*yxN1xfHlzGM4lst55m7Ihg.png"" /><figcaption>MacWrite, an early word processor, made to look like paper.</figcaption></figure><p>The nature of what runs on machines in this era is indeed that of a figleaf and/or a red herring: often colorful, sometimes in motion or noisy, often with fake personhood (see Clippy). Most of what we touch every day: separate applications with incompatible data, warring operating systems, “windows” feel like what the computer actually <em>is </em>but are at best an annoying expedient and at worst a cynical trap.</p><h4>We didn’t need these metaphors as much as they said we did</h4><p>Firstly, this attitude is wrong in itself: most people with jobs must understand and organize numerous formal systems. Of the top of my head:</p><ol><li>Knitters must read, understand and realize knitting patterns.</li><li>Store clerks must enter data purchase information and mange inventory.</li><li>Musicians must manage time, pitch and ensemble; in the case of Jazz and improvised genres, they must do so on the fly.</li></ol><p>The popular media present computers and their central processing units (CPUs) to us as unfathomably complex. But consider this: a computer is at base doing nothing more than turning on and off a certain set of circuits over time.</p><p>A knitter does just the same, working from a knitting pattern that tells them which type of stitch they should do, in a sequence. Some of you will know already that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card"">modern punch card was first used</a> for weaving machines, developed later into a general data medium.</p><p>Inconsiderate techies look at a knitter, clerk or musician and say “those fluffies can’t understand computers,” when those fluffies work within the same formal system every day. As with many other subjects — particularly mathematics — I think that much of our fear of computers comes not from their nature, but from how they’re presented.</p><h4>Metaphor hangover</h4><p>Secondly, these “metaphors” tend to stick around and cause trouble. Consider this: maybe there is someone — not quite grasping the function of a word processor on a computer — who would benefit from me saying, “it’s a bit like a paper document, on the computer.”</p><p>But this metaphor sticks to the digital simulacrum: we act as though digital documents are bound by the limitations of paper documents. For instance digital documents and their parts can in theory be freely intermixed and reused, but there are practically no good digital tools for this purpose.</p><p>More brutally, we reify one of the most crushing limitations of documents: pages. Put it this way, if you had a document (this one, for instance) would you say to yourself, “this would be better if the system I use to read it simulated it being split over some number of pages.” Indeed, if you were of that opinion, this feature should obviously be optional — and be off by default.</p><p>This is why I try to avoid the word “document” altogether. I don’t think there’s anything lost by referring instead to particular sets of smaller structures (sections, paragraphs, etc.) that refer to meaningful literary ideas and that can be freely recombined into any number of “works” that we show to others.</p><p>Let’s say that I write an article: is it a document? Yes. But what if I then make it instead a section within a larger article: is it still a document, or is it nullified by the larger form? These are not serious questions: they’re distractions that come up because we’re thinking about the problem in the wrong way.</p><p>In my view, any arrangements of text (combinations, subsets, etc. regardless of what came first) are equally valid (though not necessarily equally interesting). We need a new word (perhaps “work”) to replace “document” in referring to a particular thing we want to show to someone else.</p><p>Computers are indeed our best chance of building information systems shaped like our thoughts. Our thoughts — which we can associate freely, combining any one thought with any others or parts thereof, creating connections in any shape — have never fit into human information systems, which insist material must be linear, tabular or hierarchical.</p><p>But we threw away this chance for a generation by simulating paper and other household objects. The next era will give us another chance.</p><h3>The thought-shaped era</h3><p>2026–</p><p>Defining machine: to be determined</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from Coeus, showing a an article by Ted Nelson on the right and an article by me on the left, with an article from Nelson’s article reused in mine.

But you might be asking: how is thought <em>shaped</em>, then?</p><p>Thoughts, or more generally ideas, have abstract shapes in the same way that physical objects do. For instance, the following ideas are tree shaped:</p><ol><li>The evolutionary “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology)"">tree of life</a>” (after a certain point)</li><li>Organizational hierarchy</li><li>Many computer programs</li></ol><figure><img alt=""A corporate “org” or organizational chart, showing a tree of departments and managers, with one department reporting only to one department above it, and with any number of departments reporting to it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A2__sNyut5-gP2Jbnp0ycQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>If we accept this, we realize also that:</p><ol><li>Thoughts can be any shape</li><li>If a shape is unfamiliar to us, the thought will be hard for us to grasp</li><li>Likewise, things come naturally when we have their shape in our minds</li><li>And we learn new shapes over time</li></ol><p>Disconcertingly, people can sometimes forget about certain shapes or come to reject them: corporate types sometimes, for instance, are troubled by network graphs and insist everything should be hierarchical. Oddly, otherwise flexible systems like Unix enforce hierarchy of the filesystem: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Files-11"">this is unnecessary</a>, but you get so used to it that when someone poses the idea of doing something different, it feels<em> wrong.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A diagram of a file structure that one could create in DEC’s Files11 filesystem, in which one file is in two directories, which is not possible in most filesystems today."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cM3m8Uk0TSSc7w364aXrlg.png"" /><figcaption>A diagram of a file structure that one could create in DEC’s Files11 filesystem, in which one file is in two directories, which is not possible in most filesystems today.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, the hierarchical Unix filesystem is problematic because it precludes many valid ways of thinking about information — it is, thus, not thought shaped.</p><h4>Why does this matter?</h4><p>It hurts us when our interfaces are not shaped like our thoughts because you can only control a system (say a piece of airspace around an airport) if the following are true:</p><ol><li>Your control system contains a model of the system you want to control, such as an air traffic control map.</li><li>The model has a part for every aspect of your system that you care about, your map needs a model plane (today digital) for every real plane in your airspace.</li></ol><p>Just as an air traffic controller denied a map or enough detail to track every plane is sure to fail — I say that if your work is dotted with abandoned, disorganized or twisted writing projects, there’s nothing necessarily wrong with you or your ideas, only with your software.</p><figure><img alt=""An air traffic control software system, with boxes for several flights that a given controller is managing.

Here I defer to Kant, who said that there are three modes of thinking, allowing us to:</p><ul><li>Separate ideas from anything irrelevant (abstraction)</li><li>Combine several ideas into a new idea (combination)</li><li>Set several ideas side by side and look at them together (relation)</li></ul><p>We can use these principles as a system to build idealized forms of either general structures (e.g. a tree) or particular structures (e.g. my network of friends). Specifically:</p><ol><li>We start by imagining in our system that there are things.</li><li>Each thing is unique.</li><li>Each thing can be divisible into other things or indivisible.</li><li>The process of dividing things is called <strong>abstraction</strong>.

Read more about this in <a href=""https://olivermeredithcox.medium.com/the-cybernetic-word-processor-20537de5c482"">my article on the subject</a>. Here are some important aspects of the design:</p><ol><li>Every consistent idea of literature exists in COEUS. When something is thought-shaped, it needs to have a feature/function for every concept in the human system that it’s modeling. A word processor models literature, but no word processor models aspects of language like sentences, clauses, and words (and their components). COEUS does: every sentence, say, is uniquely identified, can be moved around and referenced as a unit.</li><li>COEUS can do relationships. For instance, I can think about the relationship between a given paragraph in one article and a word in another: the closest thing we have to modeling this in modern word processors/Web editors is what we term euphemistically a “hyperlink,” but which is innately flawed in that it is not visible when you’re looking at the thing it points to. COEUS’ links are visible from every endpoint they connect, and are visualized as lines on screen.</li><li>“big picture”COEUS lets you <em>point </em>to anything you like and retrieve anything you like. As mentioned in point 1, everything that is real in literature is real in COEUS: this means that I can link to a single sentence in an article (not just the whole article). For that matter, if I want to edit a single paragraph or heading from a book, with COEUS I can open and work with that, just that, and nothing else.</li></ol><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from COEUS, showing visibly linked pieces of text (solid lines), as well as the same text reused in two different places (hatched lines)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I-I6vs8b8KJoTUgSW0h7ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot from COEUS, showing visibly linked pieces of text (solid lines), as well as the same text reused in two different places (hatched lines). I’m told our UI is gnarly: we hear you. At HSM, first we make things work, then we make them fast, then we make them beautiful — so, we’re working on it.</figcaption></figure><h3>Two paths: more alienation, or liberation at last from the restrictions in media that held back our thinking</h3><p>AI and its purveyors come to you with a false prospectus. They claim to bring clarity, organizing information and explaining it in your own language. In fact, they are a jolly coat of paint on top of a rotting structure, which will further decay with our eyes averted and focused on the AI sitting on top.</p><p>AI does nothing to help:</p><ol><li>Our systems<em> actually</em> work together.</li><li>Us <em>actually</em> to own/control our data and information, rather than having supercorporations do so.</li><li>Us make our software more capable of <em>actually</em> expressing important human information rather than what comes easily to computers (tables and hierarchies).</li></ol><p>We need, urgently, to build a better future. We must avoid the same sort of sleight of hand that gave us the thing-shaped era: we needed systems that allow us to express our ideas and expand our intellects; this means systems capable of expressing any idea, richly interlinking material, collaborating, versioning and reusing our writing.</p><p>What did they give us? Fonts, flashing lights, and print-preview.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YtgjBi4bIs1jE2MrVcUiaA.png"" /></figure><p>This is all to say — leaning on <em>Back to the Future </em>— that we the users have the power to choose which timeline we go down: the good timeline, or the Biff timeline. The decisions we make now will determine how we think about information and by extension how we experience reality.</p><p>Of course, when you start this sort of talk, people say:</p><ul><li>“Users don’t care about that, they just want things to be easy.”</li><li>“That’s too different from what they’re used to!”</li><li>“Be realistic.”</li></ul><p>But people before me have proved this perspective wrong again and again:</p><ul><li>They said all computers should be colossal and expensive like IBM’s, DEC proved them wrong by making computers for a few thousand dollars.</li><li>They said computers were the domain only of extremely technical people, and Apple proved them wrong by creating the Mac.</li><li>They said all operating systems should be closed and proprietary like Microsoft, and Linus Torvalds proved them wrong by creating Linux.</li></ul><p>Today, they’re saying that users want a drip of AI slop, powered by a too-big-to-fail data system to horrible to face up to. I invite you, dear user, to join with me and prove them wrong.</p><p>We invite you to<a href=""https://form.jotform.com/253228033234044""> fill in our survey</a> to help us find out more about what you need from your software.</p><ul><li>1 Some provisos on this sort of thinking: 1. All eras are named by people, some are named better — more aligned with a related change in a preponderance of events; 2. Era-oriented thinking seems to be a trap for messianic and conspiratorial beliefs; 3. I speak of eras above only to make vivid important change in something I care about: ideas.</li><li>2 For instance, we can think about the interaction between two balls colliding; there provably is some sense in which the two balls held together are one object but it is fleeting and tenuous compared to the reality of the individual balls.</li><li>3 I use examples here because I haven’t found a way to distinguish relation and combination: for instance, what does it mean to combine two paragraphs to make a larger section of text other than “setting them by one another, so as to take a view of them at once” which is precisely how Kant described <em>relation</em>; Kant clarifies that this happens “without uniting them into one,” and I’m not sure what this means. Specifically, if I set two things together, they are necessarily united into one larger thing; this is especially true in the case of links in my system, HSM, which are uniquely identified, persistent, first class objects, which literally unite however many other things they link (text, media, other links) into one new thing. I would go further than Kant, therefore, and say that the difference between combination and relation is more a question of <em>feel</em>: but is no less valid, nonetheless.</li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=108313ff4401"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/we-are-entering-the-era-of-thought-shaped-software-108313ff4401"">We are entering the era of thought-shaped software</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
