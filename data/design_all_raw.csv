We mapped flows, removed steps, and optimized interactions — assuming the user would remain the primary actor.</p><p><strong>AI changes that assumption.</strong></p><p>Today, we find ourselves in a dangerous “messy middle.” We are building software that can act, decide, and synthesize, yet we are still designing it as if it were a simple tool. If we want to build products people actually love, we have to stop “sprinkling” AI onto our workflows. We have to answer one fundamental question:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Who holds the steering wheel at this specific moment, and what is the logic that justifies it?</em></strong></blockquote><p>We need a systematic way to move beyond “assistance everywhere.” We need to know when to step back and let the machine take the wheel entirely, and when to protect the human’s role as the accountable driver.</p><p>This article provides a practical framework that turns the “who does what” decision into a repeatable process.</p><h3>The Three Control Modes</h3><p>Every task maps to one of three modes. Each defines who acts, who decides, and what the interface must enforce.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vsd0D1AVKLO4pKQLFeC6zA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Three Control Modes</figcaption></figure><h3>1) Human-Led</h3><p>The human retains full control. AI’s role is to surface evidence, highlight tradeoffs, and structure the decision — but never to act. The human reads, weighs, chooses, and executes.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Improve decision quality and accountability by giving the human clear evidence, tradeoffs, and structured rationale support.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-stakes decisions requiring subjective judgment, empathy, or ethical nuance, or where the process itself creates value.</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Evidence packs (relevant facts, sources, prior cases, policies)</li><li>Tradeoff framing (pros/cons, risks, alternatives)</li><li>Structured decision templates (criteria + rationale capture)</li><li>“Second opinion” critique (counterarguments, failure modes)</li><li>Clear accountability cues (what is suggestion vs decision)</li></ul><h3>2) Assist</h3><p>AI does the heavy lifting — generating drafts, running calculations, scanning documents — but cannot commit consequential actions without explicit human approval. The human reviews, edits, and signs off.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Maximize speed and iteration while ensuring safe commitment through previews, diffs, and explicit human approval at key points.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-variability tasks with medium-to-high stakes where errors are costly or hard to detect, and accountability must remain with a human</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Draft-first flows (generate → edit → approve)</li><li>Plan-before-execute (“here’s what I will do”)</li><li>Diff-based review (show changes, not just final output)</li><li>Provenance panels (inputs, sources, constraints used)</li><li>Uncertainty and “why” explanations (when/why the system is unsure)</li><li>Tight correction loops (edit a section, regenerate locally)</li><li>Clear commit controls (approve/apply with scope visibility)</li></ul><h3>3) Delegate</h3><p>AI owns the task. It acts autonomously within defined boundaries. Humans don’t approve individual actions — they set constraints upfront and review outcomes after the fact.</p><p><strong>Design goal:</strong> Run on autopilot with guardrails — minimize user involvement while keeping traceability, monitoring, and rollback when needed.</p><p><strong>When to use it:</strong> High-volume, low-stakes, predictable tasks with clear success criteria and easily detectable errors — where human review adds friction without adding value (e.g., data entry, spam filtering, meeting scheduling).</p><p><strong>Common UX patterns</strong></p><ul><li>Global constraints (allowlists, budgets, scopes, time windows)</li><li>Activity logs / timelines (what happened, when, and under which policy)</li><li>Monitoring by exception (alerts only on anomalies)</li><li>Rollback/undo where feasible (or compensating actions)</li><li>Audit views (sampling, QA workflows, policy compliance)</li></ul><h3>The Scoring Model</h3><p>Knowing the three modes isn’t enough. You need a systematic way to decide which mode fits which task. These variables determine whether a machine <em>should</em> act and whether it is <em>worth</em> the investment to make it do so.</p><figure><img alt=""UI-style scoring framework for automation decisions, showing sliders for Automation Suitability (reversibility, safety/risk, logic type) and Automation ROI (frequency, data readiness, AI proficiency) used to evaluate which tasks should be automated."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*awgQ8QXt7x6BynhMzD-HVw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Scoring Model Dimensions</figcaption></figure><h3>Dimension 1: Automation Suitability (S_SUIT)</h3><p>This measures <strong>risk and controllability</strong>.

High reversibility allows for deeper delegation.</li><li><strong>Safety / Risk:</strong> What is the “blast radius” of a failure? Catastrophic risks require human-led guardrails.</li><li><strong>Logic Type:</strong> Is the task governed by objective rules (deterministic) or subjective “vibes” (probabilistic)?</li></ul><h3>Dimension 2: Automation ROI (S_ROI)</h3><p>This measures <strong>value and feasibility</strong>.

By plotting <strong>Automation ROI</strong> on the X-axis against <strong>Automation Suitability</strong> on the Y-axis, you can categorize any workflow into one of four distinct strategic buckets.</p><ul><li><strong>Delegate (High ROI / High Suitability):</strong> The AI executes end-to-end within constraints while humans move to an auditor role. The goal is <strong>work removal</strong> through invisible execution and background guardrails.</li><li><strong>Assist (High ROI / Low Suitability):</strong> High-leverage tasks that are too risky for full autonomy. The AI drafts in steps, requiring a “human handshake” via previews and explicit approval at critical commits.</li><li><strong>Human-Led (Low ROI / Low Suitability):</strong> High-stakes or subjective tasks where human judgment is the primary value. The AI advises with evidence, but the human remains firmly at the steering wheel.</li><li><strong>Defer (Low ROI / High Suitability):</strong> Safe to automate, but the effort outweighs the gain. Keep these manual or use lightweight helpers until task frequency or AI proficiency shifts the ROI.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Example of an AI delegation matrix for interview scheduling, showing high automation suitability and ROI scores and placing the task in the “Delegate” quadrant of a human-led vs. AI-driven workflow grid."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bfyPhEzmtSk9s8NJrJE5sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Example application of the AI Delegation Matrix: interview scheduling scores high on suitability and ROI, making it a strong candidate for full AI delegation with human oversight.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s an example: <strong>interview scheduling coordination</strong>. <br />It’s frequent and time-consuming (high ROI), it’s mostly rules-based, low stakes, and easy to undo (high suitability).

These tasks require judgment that can’t be delegated — not because AI isn’t capable, but because accountability must remain with humans.</p><p><strong>(Assist):</strong> Content generation, insight detection, triage, and any task where AI can produce a strong first draft but the final call requires human review. Payment approvals and moderation decisions sit here too — AI flags and suggests, humans commit.</p><p><strong>(Delegate):</strong> Data operations dominate this range. ETL jobs, categorization, normalization, spam filtering, scheduling, notification routing. High volume, structured inputs, clear rules, easy rollback.</p><p>The scoring isn’t meant to be precise — it’s meant to force the conversation.

Images made with Midjourney.</blockquote><p>Maybe this text will become outdated as quickly as all the changes we’ve seen happening in our field over the last few years. But even if I run that risk, I feel I need to write a bit about a feeling I’ve seen spreading more and more among designers who work with digital products: <strong>the crisis of professional identity</strong>.</p><p>It’s no longer recent that Artificial Intelligence has been popularized with the rise of LLMs accessible to all audiences on a global scale. Even if it started with large models focused on text, in a short time we saw the exponential growth of countless tools that create a bit of everything.</p><p>When this started to become increasingly evident in our field, I began to notice that people started to understand again that a return to the generalist designer was happening in the digital product space. <strong>NN Group</strong> even published an article talking about the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">return of the UX Generalist</a> as a possible — and also desirable — role due to AI’s advance in delivering so many different parts of our process.</p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">The Return of the UX Generalist</a></p><p>At first, I interpreted that as positive — even while aware of the ethical and social implications of AI (which won’t be the subject of this text). However, looking more closely at the current landscape, what I’ve been noticing is that:</p><blockquote>the return to generality, with the help of the LLM models available now, doesn’t necessarily have a positive effect and can generate superficiality and a reduction in innovation in the long run.</blockquote><p>In this space, I’ll explain more about this feeling — especially for those who have been feeling anxiety about how AI may affect their professional and personal identity in today’s world.</p><p>This text is not against the use of AI: it’s simply an article with reflections on this current moment of interaction between designers and LLMs.</p><h3>Hyper-specialization as a pain</h3><figure><img alt=""Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*kPUwUssmnobbeDYk"" /><figcaption>Hyper-specialization and isolation. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>In my master’s, one of the authors who helped me most in thinking about the way I liked to work was <a href=""https://www.psychaanalyse.com/pdf/EDGAR_MORIN_LES_7_SAVOIRS_A_L_EDUCATION_DU_FUTUR.pdf""><strong>Edgar Morin</strong></a>. He is a thinker who talks about how <strong>all modern knowledge</strong> (especially since the Renaissance revolution of scientific knowledge) <strong>has been guided by simplification through reductionist thinking</strong>. This reductionism pushes the individual from a broad basic education into higher education restricted to a single discipline, and then into progressively narrower specializations (until it’s expected they dedicate themselves to a single topic for the rest of their life).</p><p>I’ve always been averse to this kind of training, and I felt firsthand the effects of not following the expected path. It was only after many years that I realized doing that was very positive — especially seeing, in practice, this disjunction that Edgar Morin discusses so much in relation to twentieth-century education.</p><p>In these almost three decades that have passed in the twenty-first century, it’s possible to see that the field of digital product design specialized so much that it ended up opening internal fissures. I tend to see this as, at least, three major axes in which people specialize and navigate:</p><ol><li>a <strong>communicational axis</strong>, linked to branding, language, and art direction, where the artistic side of the interface matters a lot;</li><li>an <strong>empirical-scientific axis</strong>, linked to research, methods, data, validation, and decision-making — sometimes captured by ROI and return discourse, but not reducible to that; and</li><li>an <strong>exact and technical axis</strong>, tied to software engineering, where part of design remained close to front-end, components, systems, and implementation, as was already seen more strongly around 2010.</li></ol><p>Of course, this happened because of the size of the complexity of each major area — with only the digital product part relating to communication between humans and machines. But even if there’s a justification, what often happens is a production line between closed niches that don’t talk much to each other.</p><blockquote>Hyper-specialization leads to less communication, since each part understands only its own area and its own topic in depth, but can’t comprehend the issue that lives next door.</blockquote><p>And with that, information passes from area to area until it reaches the professionals at the end of the process: developers. I bet many of you have already witnessed this phenomenon, which creates noise around impediments or disagreements.</p><p>That’s why Morin talks so much about an <strong>education of the future</strong> in which complexity is embraced — in teaching that doesn’t funnel down but opens horizons — while maintaining depth of study. However, even if the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/1061-7361(92)90024-8""><strong>Complexity Paradigm</strong></a> exists in the educational field (and I believe in it and defend it whenever I can), it’s important to be cautious!</p><p>The effects of having professionals who can embrace so many different areas have always been desired by many sectors of the market. That’s why the idea (even if often imaginary) of the “unicorn designer” has always been so promising — a caricature name given to the imagination of a “do-it-all”: someone who, alone, produces a super artistic and interactive interface with decisions grounded scientifically and empirically, and can still make the solution tangible in front-end.</p><p>The “but” in this always-desired idea is that it isn’t humanly possible to make a single professional transmogrify into roles that demand such different cognitive training — especially if you want a product that is truly good in each aspect.</p><p>But this collective imaginary never stopped existing, and it has now been reborn with the emergence and popularization of Artificial Intelligence. By relegating activities to the machine — even without specialized knowledge in a given area — it would be possible to stimulate the existence of this professional who navigates every corner and can deliver well in any activity.</p><p>It’s at this specific point that a promise is born — but also countless risks that are not yet fully predictable.</p><h3>Generalization as a risk</h3><figure><img alt=""Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*5Z7JH1XqKcbrDedV"" /><figcaption>Speed and chaos. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been reflecting a lot on this issue. And more and more, I feel the problem isn’t the promise of the return of the generalist in itself: <strong>the problem is the way this may emerge within the scenario we have</strong>.</p><p>Look: unlike a reformed education in which people don’t isolate themselves into niches, what can happen is:</p><blockquote>a professional who keeps the same aptitudes as before, but starts delegating to the machine responsibilities they don’t really know how to develop.</blockquote><p>As the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-ux-generalist/"">NN/G article</a> approaches this issue, the professional can get an <strong>AI boost</strong> — that is, manage to produce outputs in areas they didn’t master before. The output is produced, but the user’s cognition may remain the same as before.</p><p><em>Okay, but what’s the problem with that?</em></p><p>The issue here is that we’re operating primarily with <strong>Large Language Models</strong>, created specifically by companies that operate on a global level. These models learn human language (whether textual or imagistic) from enormous amounts of data to generate, through statistics and probability, responses that are coherent to us, humans. In more technical words, they function as <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fthink%2Ftopics%2Flarge-language-models"">token “prediction” machines</a>: given an input text (prompt), the model estimates what the most likely next token will be and uses that to build the output. I know each AI will have a more specific functioning (with image and video models), but in general, they all operate with statistics from the training specific to the company that created them.</p><p>That’s why AI today is not an intelligence in the human sense of the word: it’s a super complex machine that can learn countless patterns across all areas for which data is digitally available. That’s why it (at least not yet) doesn’t have what some have been calling <strong>neuro-symbolic reasoning</strong>.</p><p>A didactic example given by <a href=""https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/technology-monitoring/techsonar/neuro-symbolic-artificial-intelligence_en"">Massimo Attoresi</a> is about reasoning in medicine: if a patient shows up with a rare symptom that has no report in previous studies, medical knowledge can be mobilized by a human to understand how to unravel that symptom. An LLM can’t do that: it can hallucinate and produce plausible answers or images, because its training prioritizes generating believable responses, even in the absence of sufficient knowledge to solve certain problems.</p><p>For most users, it’s more frustrating to receive an “I don’t know,” which is a questionable UX decision of these platforms. So when a designer who had a specialty starts producing any other specialty with LLMs, they will begin developing that only with the support of that machine that brings the probabilistic result most desired by the global average. And, even more importantly, that person will understand that their work is the output itself!</p><p>On the contrary, <strong>a professional identity is not defined only by what is delivered at the end, but by the cognitive and symbolic construction that allows one to cross complex processes </strong>— including those still unknown to the models or to humanity itself.</p><p>I’ve said so much here, and I wanted to add a parenthesis: yes, it’s possible to do a lot of design using LLMs today — in all instances of our work, including those we wouldn’t be able to do without AI due to training limitations. Now, it’s necessary to understand that when we train an agent to make the machine operate like a specialist in some part of the UX/UI process, we’re always generating probabilistic answers without a neuro-symbolic background to face new, unmapped situations.</p><p>And it’s exactly at this point that the risk lives. It’s a risk of homogenizing solutions, writing styles, innovation processes, visuals — and even code, in the case of massive reliance on LLMs. Unless the support comes from the professional identity path.</p><h3>The professional path as identity</h3><figure><img alt=""Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/0*-vNTMz5SGhCbVqbY"" /><figcaption>Professional and personal trajectory. Midjourney, 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>Think with me through an example:</p><blockquote>We have a designer who works with digital products and who has always, since very young, fit into a more communicational axis.</blockquote><blockquote>She spent years going deep to create highly visual platforms with unique animations that create an impact that many brands want.</blockquote><blockquote>She also grew by feeding on aesthetic sensitivity, managing to blend branding with product design very well in digital platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, everything she does visually is guided by the feeling built throughout that professional trajectory. And that feeling is based on concepts and methods studied for years, which <strong>allow</strong> her to get through very different problems without impediment.</blockquote><p>That person today may look at the current scenario and begin to feel anxiety and an identity crisis: “<em>Maybe my work won’t be valued anymore in some time because of AI.</em>” With that, she might start using different LLMs, trying to deliver in research areas (both qualitative and quantitative) and also to produce Design Systems, creating already-coded components.</p><p>What will probably happen in the long run if this person doesn’t start studying those fields instead of only creating outputs with AI? <strong>We lose a talent in one area to create a generalist who produces a bit of everything — but only through the LLM</strong>. And because it’s only with the help of that kind of tool, her deliveries will tend to fit the globally expected statistical average.</p><p>Now, what happens if that same person starts using AI to deepen her work, but also to experiment with adjacent areas in order to learn how they work? It’s at this point that I think we gain more from the use of LLMs today.</p><p>Beyond automating manual and exhausting tasks, the AI boost can be applied to our training, enabling dialogues and cooperation with peers that used to be very difficult. And, returning to our dear Edgar Morin, collective thinking becomes more complex because, even though each person maintains their specialization, everyone can understand or do the basics of their teammates’ work — even if with less depth.</p><p>I think this is a very subtle difference, but fundamental for understanding the difference between production and innovation in the twenty-first century.</p><p>Want to talk more about this?<br /> Send me a message on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheuscervo/"">LinkedIn</a>.</p><h3>References</h3><p>GIBBONS, Sarah; SUNWALL, Evan.

<h4><strong><em>Designing how models behave.</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a ux team working together building AI products using data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*K1TUKUFPN-K327z9HhexYg.png"" /><figcaption>UX team using their new toolkit (Ilustration from Nothing Fancy)</figcaption></figure><p>We have entered a world where the experience is generated in the moment, and users react to it. The days when products rendered code that produced exactly what we designed are numbered. When someone uses an AI product, they are responding to behavior unfolding in real time, shaped by probabilistic systems rather than fixed screens. This marks a break from the era where designers could predict and control every outcome, and it forces UX to confront a new kind of material.</p><p>AI products are defined by non-deterministic behavior. The experience is something that unfolds on the fly, produced by AI models. What users see, read, hear, or are guided through is the result of systems making decisions on their behalf. Yet much of the current focus in UX and AI remains on production speed. Faster prototyping. Vibe coding. These practices matter, but they stop short of addressing the real shift AI introduces.</p><p>The real transformation of our craft lies in designing how the model behaves.</p><p>Engineering, and now Product, have moved upstream. They shape models, constrain outputs, define system behavior, and determine what is possible or impossible. UX often treats the model as a black box and designs around it. The result is AI products that may appear user-centered, but are often misaligned with the user intent and, at times, harmful.</p><h4><strong>How it works today</strong></h4><p>In many organizations, engineering and product teams are already designing the core of the experience. Not through screens, but through system prompts, fine-tuning strategies, tool definitions, orchestration logic, and evaluation frameworks. They are using an AI product Flywheel, and iterating constantly. UX is often brought in downstream to make the output feel nicer, more on-brand. That is not where the real leverage is.</p><p>During a talk last summer, <a href=""https://www.andrewng.org/"">Andrew Ng</a> argued that the real bottleneck is no longer engineering, but product. As AI accelerates code production, the hard part becomes deciding what to build. His advice was for PMs to talk to users, develop empathy, create mental models of the users they are serving.</p><p>UX was notably absent from this framing, which says a lot about how poorly our discipline has articulated its value. The proposal is for product management to take on a larger role relative to engineering, even changing the ratio. His example shifts from one PM to four engineers, to one PM to half an engineer. As this space opens up for product, it should open to designers as well, with comparable influence. After all, understanding users, framing problems, and deciding why we build things have always been core to UX.</p><figure><img alt=""Andrew Ng speaking at the Y combinator event.

Y Combinator.</em></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A necessary mental shift for designers</strong></h4><p>For designers, this is a new space to conquer; it requires a mental shift away from deterministic systems and toward behavioral design. This does not mean abandoning user-centered design, it means applying it where it matters most. Models are not magic, they are material that can be designed.</p><p><em>“In the pre-software age the only thing designers had to worry about was how a product was built. But in the post-software era we have to think about how the products will behave. That’s a new paradigm and many people are still stuck in the pre-software era when it comes to design…” — </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ovettasampson/""><strong><em>Ovetta Sampson</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timbrownatlindkedin/""><strong><em>Tim Brown</em></strong></a><strong><em> (99U 2019)</em></strong></p><p>For us to enter this space, we need to get educated. Not to become AI engineers, but to understand how behavior emerges from systems. That means asking about training data, shaping the context a model processes, and contributing to evaluation strategies that define what is acceptable and what is not.</p><p>Some companies are already ahead of the curve. They employ <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-rise-of-the-model-designer-cef429d9c134"">Model Designers </a>whose work focuses explicitly on shaping model behavior. This is a reality at companies like OpenAI, Google and <a href=""https://www.aidesignfieldguide.com/articles/barron-webster"">Figma</a>, but it should not be treated as an exception. Every organization building AI products needs this capability within its design practice, whether as a dedicated role or as a core skill embedded in existing design roles.</p><h4><strong>The new toolkit: Data, context, and evals</strong></h4><p>When AI models <a href=""https://youtube.com/shorts/fSy3MNG0QIQ?si=rpXVTcKgAv24THyY"">are the material</a>, then data, context, and evals are the tools we need to shape it. Let’s get familiar with your new tools.</p><figure><img alt=""A flywheel with 3 components: data, context and evals"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/860/1*RMWX4Vl_Q7XXTPaWxKpamQ.png"" /><figcaption>AI Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Data shapes what a model knows and what it predicts.</strong> Pretraining data, fine-tuning data, and data generated during interaction shape what will be generated, and no data is created equally. Designers should be asking what kinds of behavior this data encourages, what perspectives it excludes, and also how it was acquired.</p><p>We are immersed in a world of large multimodal models, where much of the data has been scraped from the internet, often taken from authors without consent, and filled with biases and unfair patterns. As designers, we also must question whether this is the path we want to take, or whether smaller, more ethical models are the better choice.</p><p><strong>Context shapes what a model can consider in the moment.</strong> This includes user input, environmental signals, retrieved knowledge, system prompts, safeguards, and instructions. The context window is where most of the experience is assembled. Writing system prompts, instructions, and constraints is design work. It is mostly done using plain, simple language with XLM markups, and of course AI can help designers with this process.</p><p>Lately, we have witnessed AI models generate adult content, sometimes involving minors, often without consent from the real people in the images. We have seen models suggest harmful acts during conversations, in some heartbreaking cases resulting in death. Choosing not to implement strong safeguards, or deciding not to block or redirect certain conversations, is also a design decision. With technology this powerful, designers must be truly intentional about defining what systems should not do.</p><p><strong>Evals determine what success means.</strong> What is acceptable. What is unsafe. What must never happen. Deciding what to measure is deciding what matters. It is highly influential, and for most AI companies evaluations have become the moat. Without evals, we cannot know what is failing or how broken a system really is.</p><p>This becomes especially critical when working with large pre-trained models (such as GPT or Gemini). These models are continuously updated, and engineering teams will change them over time. How do you know whether a new version performs better for your product than the previous one. How can you recover quickly knowing that the user will be ok. This is where evaluations come in.</p><p>A good place to start is with frameworks. These are highly use-case dependent and often form part of a company’s secret sauce. One framework I find useful is RISK. Relevant, Inclusive, Safe, and Kind. We want to measure if and how often the output is relevant, whether it is a generated interface or a response.</p><p>Strong evaluation strategies also mix different types of evaluators:</p><p><strong>1/Human evaluations</strong> involve manually reviewing outputs. They are necessary, but expensive and slow.</p><p><strong>2/Automated evaluators </strong>complement human judgment.</p><ul><li>Code-based evaluators are deterministic tools that apply explicit, predefined logic.</li><li>LLM as Judge evaluators use language models to assess quality along dimensions that are difficult to encode in traditional code.</li></ul><p>Once we have evaluations in place, we can start to measure results and decide how to act on them to improve the product. This might include adding new data sets for fine-tuning, grounding responses by connecting to a knowledge base, revising context through system prompt changes, or even introducing antagonistic models. We work with data, context, and evaluations in a continuous AI flywheel of improvement.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a team working together"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*4688kvNZnkYsn4PgdL5XkQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s join engineering and product</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Agentic design and systemic thinking</strong></h4><p>Agentic design is not about a single model responding to a user. It is about ecosystems of specialized AI agents, each with its own instructions, memory, tools, and goals. They coordinate, hand off tasks, make decisions, and act over time.</p><p>Designing this requires systemic thinking. Designers must understand how agents work, how they delegate, how failures propagate, and how users control these workflows.</p><p>There are many definitions of agents today. But at their core, they are AI models and rely on the same design materials. Your new toolkit: Data, context, evals.</p><h4><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h4><p>We might not need AI at all.</p><p>Before jumping into the hype, technology should not be the thing driving the solution. Many problems can and should be solved with simpler systems. When AI is truly needed, smaller or more specialized models are often better than massive multimodal ones for everyday goals. They are easier to shape, easier to evaluate, and less risky for users. If an organization chooses to build on large, popular multimodal models, then being a critical participant in shaping behavior becomes non-negotiable.</p><p>Engineering looks after the technology. Product looks after the business. The user, however, is alone without us.</p><p>This is where UX must step in. Designers need to move upstream, working alongside engineering and product to shape AI products end-to-end.</p><p>Go and learn your new tools.</p><p><em>Note: If this resonates and you want to build these skills with your team, I offer the Model Designer workshop.

<h4>The one with React, Tailwind and the separation of concerns</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kZN4DxRu31nQssMHRuFCTg.png"" /></figure><p>When I started learning about web development I learned clean HTML, vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS, which are three different ways of saying: “No Frameworks”.</p><p>That’s the way most developers learned to code, at least in my age group, since we didn’t have any framework other than jQuery back then, and AI coding assistants weren’t a thing yet.</p><p>Years later I did learn React (a JavaScript framework) and I did had to get to know Tailwind (a CSS framework) for work projects so everyone in the development team would be on the same page.</p><p>For years I didn’t understand why React or Tailwind worked in the way they did, I felt frustrated because every little thing seemed to require more work then in plain JavaScript or CSS.</p><p>I didn’t think those frameworks save me much time or work in the long run and I was annoyed that I had to use them every day.</p><p>When I asked other developers about that, they often cited the concept of “separation of concerns” as a reason that makes React simpler to use or more suitable for team projects.</p><p>At the time I didn’t get it. But now — after years of working with React and Tailwind I think I’m finally getting it. If you’re anything like I was, confused or frustrated about it, please keep reading.</p><h3>What is separation of concerns</h3><p>Separation of concerns is a programming term that means that any “problem” can be separated into smaller and easier to deal with “concerns”.</p><p>In our example the “concerns” are just long code that is hard to grasp all at once. HTML has a few ways of dealing with code that is too complex already built-in to the technology.</p><p>One way we can handle code that’s too long is to separate it into different files — HTML for the content, CSS for the styles and JavaScript (js files) for functions.</p><p>This way you can more easily separate the different areas you’re dealing with: HTML for the structure, CSS when you handle the design and JavaScript when you handle the hardcore programming stuff.</p><figure><img alt=""The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0KoD-Ccdg_1Qg2R3p4b1qA.png"" /><figcaption>The big 3 file types: HTML, CSS and JS.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course in real projects every file will be in multiples, multiple HTML files for different pages (or parts of pages), multiple CSS files for different aspects of the design and multiple JavaScript files for different kinds of functions.</p><p>As the project goes up in complexity the pile of files gets bigger and it is murky at best where is the line to split the files.</p><p>If we’ll take for example CSS files, as it is closest to the design aspect and so easier to explain, we have multiple options how to slice it:</p><ol><li>Maybe just to work with one huge file</li><li>Slicing it to smaller files by platform: Desktop.css, Mobile.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by components: Header.css, Footer.css, Button.css etc.</li><li>Slicing it by pages: Index.css, About.css, Contact.css … General.css</li><li>Slicing it by function: Common.css, Breakpoints.css, Vars.css etc.</li></ol><p>It isn’t clear at all where to draw the line of separation and I’ve seen many teams do it in very different ways, sometimes even combining more than one option unintentionally.</p><p>So how can React and Tailwind help us to decide?</p><h3>The component based approach</h3><p>Let me preface what I’m about to say with that, like HTML, there’s lots of ways of making a React app.</p><p>The most common way is to separate each component into its own file, so we’ll end up with files named Button.jsx, Checkbox.jsx, Avatar.jsx, Card.jsx etc.</p><p>These components get imported into different screens with different configurations (via props) so the code inside the components will potentially get replicated an infinite amount of times.</p><p>Unlike HTML, we don’t need to manually copy the code to different places and different files, we just import the component and React will swap its code into every place we’ve called it from.</p><p>If we’re thinking about the separation of concerns, what React does is very different from HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript .</p><figure><img alt=""React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*7qEbNSNibMNpTJg7SqU1PA.png"" /><figcaption>React common files structure, notice how every component has a complimentary CSS file</figcaption></figure><p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript separate our concerns into multiple areas of responsibility, while React takes a different approach.</p><p>React separates our concerns based on component structure, so different developers can work on different components without bumping into one another.</p><p>But they’re all React developers, no longer a CSS specialist or an HTML architect, everyone is doing the same kind of work but on different building blocks.</p><p>The distinction here is major since it slices the work for optimization rather than for specialization, which is almost the opposite approach.</p><h3>Entering Tailwind CSS</h3><p>Tailwind is a very popular CSS framework that works as a utility framework meaning all styles are done with inline classes instead of a big giant stylesheet.</p><p>This way you can copy and paste components from different layouts and ensure they will look exactly the same, of course when working with React components, the component gets imported into many layouts, pages or screens so consistency is key — and Tailwind enables just that.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*huR5zgz0VL57FIMgfHXKlA.png"" /><figcaption>The same button 3 times (left to right): Pure HTML/CSS, Tailwind, rendered result.</figcaption></figure><p>If this is your first time seeing Tailwind code, I implore you to go and try it out, it’s not as strange to work with as it might seem at first glance and it is much better than making inline styles.</p><p>Now that every codebase is in some degree written with AI I can’t stress this enough — Tailwind is much better than regular inline styles, if you’re a CSS purist working with a stylesheet file or files that’s great, even a simple inline style here and there is mostly fine.</p><p>But never let the AI just make lots and lots of inline styles for everything, always ask to convert them to another file or just to work with Tailwind, inline styles are unmaintainable in the long run.</p><p>I know what you must be thinking when encountering Tailwind, and it’s the title of the next section.</p><figure><img alt=""Now we don’t have any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx, jsx or js file)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/850/1*ps_lonYDcBT14XsvgL6TVw.png"" /><figcaption>When working with Tailwind we don’t need any CSS files, every component is just one file (tsx or jsx file)</figcaption></figure><h3>What happened to separation of concerns?</h3><p>I know that at first it looks like our separation of concerns is gone, React already implements all the HTML (via JSX) and the JavaScript in the same files.</p><p>Tailwind CSS takes it even further and it pulls the CSS utility classes into the JSX as well, instead of leaving them on separate files.</p><p>That way we don’t get any separation by areas anymore, the functions, design and structure all live together.</p><p>What we DO get, however, is separation by component, which can be more useful for big teams who work on the same system or same project together.</p><p>Separation by component means that even though a developer might be working on all the different areas of an Avatar component, the same developer doesn’t need to be concerned about the Button component while doing it.</p><p>Tailwind CSS ensures that all components will be designed as planned, even if they were designed in isolation, outside the system itself, since its utility classes are all deterministic by design and no style should ever leak outside its intended scope.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Separation of concerns is subjective and it is done differently in different systems, React and Tailwind do it component-based while pure HTML and CSS are more area-based.</p><p>There is no right answer to how you should do it, but consistency is key, especially when working in a team.</p><p>Guidelines and best practices are great, but a separation that is inherit to the technology itself will always be better since everyone in the team can agree on it.</p><p>When we consider a separation of concerns based on areas of expertise we can also consider to hire a CSS specialist, for example, but a Button specialist is not currently a job title, and maybe it should be as React and Tailwind becomes more popular.</p><p>I didn’t touch on all the ways to separate CSS into multiple files and achieve something similar to component-based separation of concerns in pure HTML and CSS because I don’t believe it’s the right way to go when working in large teams.</p><p>There are a million technologies out there and a million

<h4>What we can learn from Linear about trusting judgement without ignoring evidence</h4><figure><img alt=""Migrating flock of birds, silhoutte on a sunset sky."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*nUcS3dsfo9Mw2Xgu"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@the_ova?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Vitaly Otinov</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Data feels objective, defensible, and safe. In many product teams, it has quietly become the most powerful decision-maker in the room — not because it consistently leads to better outcomes, but because it removes personal accountability. When a decision can be justified with numbers, no one has to truly own it.</p><blockquote>“Although you may think that people instinctively want to make the best possible decision, there is a stronger force that animates business decision-making: the desire not to get blamed or fired.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><p>‘Data-driven design’ is often framed as maturity. In practice, it can become a way to defer judgement, smooth over disagreement, and default to the option that will attract the least resistance. The result isn’t better products — it’s safer ones. Incremental improvements which optimise what already exists, while bolder ideas are quietly filtered out because they can’t yet be proven.</p><p>The uncomfortable truth is that data doesn’t make decisions, people do. Data can inform, challenge, and validate — but it can’t decide what <em>should</em> exist, only describe what <em>has</em> happened before. When teams hide behind metrics, they’re not being rigorous; they’re avoiding the risk that comes with choosing a direction and standing behind it.</p><blockquote>“It’s important to remember that big data all comes from the same place — the past.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Rory Sutherland</blockquote><h3>How Linear balances judgement and evidence</h3><p>In an interview reflecting on Linear’s design philosophy, co-founder and designer Karri Saarinen speaks directly about the limits of “<a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=wTvMaV6-txFSlIa4"">hiding behind data</a>” and the harder work of judgement. <a href=""https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1706745692965027994"">He describes how teams often lean on quantitative signals because they’re afraid of making the wrong choice — and how data becomes a comforting shield.</a> But that safety is an illusion. Data doesn’t make choices for you; it only reports what has already happened.</p><p>Too much deference to metrics doesn’t just slow teams down — it actively pushes them toward incrementalism. When evidence is treated as a prerequisite for action rather than an input into judgement, bold ideas struggle to survive long enough to be tested.</p><p>What’s striking in Saarinen’s thinking is his insistence that product teams should feel empowered to decide based on a deep understanding of the problem, and rich context gained from direct engagement with users and the product — not just dashboards or scoreboard metrics.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Linear product management platform, showing the sleek, clean interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*acTrxuSLfk04FWlNXWH6Jg.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Linear is a product development tool built with an unusually strong emphasis on craft, clarity, and focus — designed by people who believe good software should feel deliberate.</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://linear.app/now/why-is-quality-so-rare"">At Linear, design isn’t something you outsource to analytics — it’s a product philosophy.</a> They pursue quality not as a growth tactic or a differentiator, but because they believe good software should be well made. Craft isn’t justified by metrics; it’s a responsibility the team chooses to take seriously.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-linear-builds-product"">Rather than waiting for perfect metrics before acting, Linear routinely builds features and ships them to internal users or small opt-in groups early — even when the experience is rough.</a> This accelerates learning, sharpens judgement, and creates real feedback long before broad exposure. Engineers and designers are encouraged to own problems end-to-end, including small inefficiencies that may not yet register in analytics, but materially affect the lived experience of users.</p><h4>Data is a tool, not a crutch</h4><p>Saarinen points out that teams often invoke data when they’re afraid to own a decision. At Linear, they don’t rely on exhaustive ranking exercises or metric-driven roadmaps to determine direction. Instead, decisions emerge from a blend of:</p><ul><li>Direct customer conversations and qualitative feedback</li><li>Founders’ and team intuition, shaped by deep product familiarity</li><li>Contextual signals from real usage</li></ul><p>Data is still present, but it becomes one signal in a broader conversation, not the authority that ends it.</p><blockquote>“Data isn’t bad — it’s just not the decision-maker.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Build with confidence, fail fast, and fix things</h4><p>Linear treats mistakes as an expected part of building good products. This flips the narrative from fear to responsibility. Designers and product leads aren’t protected by metrics; they’re accountable for choices — and expected to correct them quickly when they’re wrong.</p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes we make the wrong choice, and then we just fix it — but at least </em>we<em> made the choice, and the data didn’t make the choice for us.”</em></blockquote><blockquote>— Karri Saarinen</blockquote><h4>Safe decisions are rarely transformative</h4><p>Safe decisions are rarely transformative — and transformative decisions are rarely safe. Direction at Linear is chosen through judgement informed by deep engagement with users, even when the metrics haven’t caught up yet.</p><p>By combining context, craft, judgement, and fast feedback loops, teams can avoid both extremes: blind intuition on one side, and the paralysis of waiting for perfect data on the other.</p><h3>What we can learn from Linear</h3><h4><strong>Ship early and often</strong></h4><p>Don’t wait for perfect analytics before releasing. Internal launches and small cohorts create faster, richer learning than prolonged analysis ever will.</p><h4>Build shared product understanding</h4><p>Distribute customer stories, recordings, and qualitative insights. When context is shared, judgement becomes defensible without needing a dashboard to prove every choice.</p><h4>Treat data as input, not authority</h4><p>Use metrics to inform and challenge intuition, not replace it. Data should contribute to decisions — not make them by default.</p><h4>Give designers space to pursue craft</h4><p>Quality isn’t always measurable upfront, but it’s immediately felt. When teams prioritise craft, they make better decisions because they’re deeply attuned to user experience.</p><h4>Close the accountability loop</h4><p>Make decisions based on expertise and judgement — then measure the outcome. Celebrate learning, not just success. That’s how intuition becomes a skill, not a superstition.</p><h3>References and resources</h3><h4><a href=""https://youtu.be/4muxFVZ4XfM?si=nIj236gra4EU8b7c"">Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus</a></h4><p>The main inspiration for this article was an interview with Karri Saarinen on design judgement, data, and decision-making — particularly from around 49m, where he critiques hiding behind data and emphasises ownership of decisions.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/if-youre-not-using-ux-data-it-s-not-ux-design-9e02c388d196"">If you're not using UX data, it's not UX design</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-onboarding-linear-built-without-any-ab-testing-b035572ced72"">The onboarding Linear built without any AB Testing</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/a-b-testing-done-wrong-87beee4a5328"">A/B testing done wrong</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a07360337dd8"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-safest-decision-is-rarely-the-right-one-a07360337dd8"">The safest decision is rarely the right one</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
