<h4>Using AI in UX design, Interactions, Motion, &amp; Marketing.</h4><figure><img alt=""AI Hat"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJH-70_fdENoXr8UHWpGyQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Recently top companies have publicly come out to share their processes implemented by senior designers and entire creative teams. Some notable companies like Meta and Atlassian stood out. Not only are these companies building their own AI workflows, but they are spending millions of dollars to train their employees on them. From watching interviews to reading lengthy articles, here is what I’ve learnt about their carefully crafted AI workflows.</p><h3>Atlassian’s design-to-prototype workflow, powered by AI</h3><figure><img alt=""Atlassian AI workflow"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4fZ32GccUsAaebh-zYfjBg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The famous software company has to build large scale tools and software for some of the biggest enterprises in the world. AI is the perfect companion for their team to design and test faster.</p><p>In a recent <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">hands-on session</a> with their design team, the wonderful people at Dive Club who interviewed them, shared exactly the methods that work for them. PS. It’s all about the balance here.</p><h4><strong>Using a pre-built template strategy:</strong></h4><p>The Atlassian team realized that AI was often messing up core elements and not completely understanding complex commands. So they created a sort of “design system” for their AI led prototyping. Here they feed a page with pre-coded elements which AI doesn’t change, but lets the tool work on other elements which are open to interpretation in a way.</p><h4><strong>They built instruction files:</strong></h4><p>Unlike most designers who just ask AI tools to code in a certain programming language or use a certain framework, their team has created certain instruction files to “guide the AI”. This instructions file (essentially a text file) might have a specific instruction to use a design system element, variable or certain token in case the AI encounters a certain type of element.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u6dpoZI88gIqb_QfvirDcg.png"" /><figcaption>Their template file in Figma — These are written instruction for the AI to follow</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">the interview</a>, their team discusses using tailwind (a CSS framework), but writing specific instructions to <em>only use their own design components</em> in certain areas. This is essentially an <strong>over-ride instruction</strong>, where the AI skips certain actions in order to fulfill their prompts.</p><h4>Recipes over hard work:</h4><p>A complex business like Atlassian requires simplified workflows to make life easier. The team just uses the copy-paste strategy to add pre-baked instructions to their prompts. The team talks about how most of their products consists of a dark mode switch. So, whenever they prototype a new page or product, they just add a dark mode switch command in their prompts. It’s barbaric, but it works!</p><h4>They calibrate AI to see better:</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8yxOdybbjgNqV-x8RFV7IQ.png"" /><figcaption>Calibrating the AI to learn their style &amp; components</figcaption></figure><p>Custom software production needs custom AI. When training their AI, they feed their design elements in and ask the AI what it sees. If the AI is accurate they move on, but if the AI gets an element wrong, they correct it to avoid future issues. This also fixes the screenshot-to-code conversion that they use in their company.</p><h3>Designers at Meta are adopting AI at all levels</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/780/0*RXUAbEMhSvc9JSHL.jpg"" /></figure><p>A slew of designers across different departments at Meta are scrambling to incorporate AI and supercharge their workflows. They’ve stated how AI currently is only for mundane tasks, while manual human-centered processes rule the more important steps like user research and strategy.</p><h4>Automating execution:</h4><p>VP of monetization design — <a href=""https://medium.com/u/474193af24c"">(JJ) Jhilmil Jain</a> states how designers at meta are using AI for generating quick screens and even coded components for better hand-off. However, they are focused on more manual, age-old ways of working when it comes to product intuition and strategy. They are also more focused on the user’s POV to ensure they are going in the correct direction. You should check out her article <a href=""https://medium.com/@jhilmil.jain/how-ai-is-reshaping-product-design-leadership-and-what-to-do-about-it-9125d5af750c"">here</a>.</p><h4>Using playbooks for better adoption:</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*o5ZkX2r-PSlbiRaru_XQyA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Companies are using Meta’s Llama model to customize AI workflows</figcaption></figure><p>Much like Atlassian, they are building sets of instructions and playbooks for designers to follow when using AI. Recording and documenting processes early and setting a standard has been crucial.</p><h4>Changing roles:</h4><p>A product manager at Meta recently shared how his role at the company has shifted from a generic PM to a true product owner. Being able to give code has given him “superpowers”, he explained on a <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/episode/3XBzlIzna8dZP2l32NZGfs?si=8nvqBeuTR7WcT0LoiJCqzQ&amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A2dR1MUZEHCOnz1LVfNac0j&amp;t=0"">podcast</a>.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JVCSIVgsiImYp69ou82Xsw.png"" /><figcaption>Zevi Arnovitz with Lenny showcasing his workflow in Claude</figcaption></figure><blockquote>His statement saying, “everyone is going to be a builder” stood out to me.</blockquote><p>He further dives deeper by sharing that he now sets up the basic UI design and vibe codes a concept to handover to the developers directly. He clarifies that he’s only taking over smaller tasks rather than completely removing designers from the equation. According to the PM, a majority of roles at these companies are collapsing, and one person needs to do much more.</p><h3>Tesco designers are vibe coding their own Figma plugins</h3><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*G_-I9J7BZXsjYVEN3z1P5g.png"" /><figcaption>Tesco is publicly using Adobe AI &amp; Firefly</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href=""https://youtu.be/ISoolpPvIyU?si=IdNcG_8w8KqCeLz2"">recent interview</a> with Tesco’s senior designer, it was revealed that they developed their own powerful Figma plugins to get the most out of the tool.</p><p>They’ve created a Figma plugin that connects directly to the data of their website. So whenever the team wants to populate their prototypes with real data, the plugins fetches information from their live website — images, product descriptions, ratings, etc. and inserts it into different UI components at once. This saves so much time and also keeps the designs true to the actual products listed on their platforms.</p><figure><img alt=""Tesco senior designer creates his own Figma plugin"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*D2XbNH53ioSntV8ruqzbJA.png"" /><figcaption>Tesco senior designer showcasing his internal plugins</figcaption></figure><p>The designer reveals the tools that he used — Cursor for vibe coding, and the Figma MCP server to ensure that the results stay on brand.</p><p>I actually explored building my own Figma plugin myself, check the video out if that is something you’re interested in — <a href=""https://youtu.be/A0lCwgRtAWU?si=wgkKqphagto149Av"">watch video</a>.</p><h3>Designers at Faire are researching using AI</h3><figure><img alt=""Faire AI"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*yspmjJDFNZzSGx1a"" /><figcaption>Large data requires AI filtering at Faire</figcaption></figure><p>Faire is a popular platform that connects wholesale retailers to customers, and research is an absolute necessity for them. The quality of research data defines their future in a way.</p><p>In a detailed <a href=""https://craft.faire.com/leveraging-ai-in-design-work-464f0f39922e"">Medium article</a>, Jess Brown reveals the techniques they use at the company to gather data and connect with users faster.</p><h4>Implementing AI Chat-bots</h4><p>The team released an AI chat-bot called Fairey for internal purposes, which can quickly fetch user queries and tickets and help them make out the problems and issues being faced by their users from a distance. She states that whenever she has a question about their users or brands working with them, they just ask the chat-bot. A good example of these questions is — “<em>Can you find support tickets from brands about our Top Shop program in the last six months?</em>”.</p><figure><img alt=""Faire team at Toronto Tech Week"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*W_pQi8zsxLxS13GQ"" /><figcaption>The Faire team at Toronto Tech Week revealing their use of AI</figcaption></figure><p>This is a great way to do primary UX research, without the hassle of reaching out to customers directly or doing expensive interviews. Since they have such a vast set of customers from different regions and use cases, the chat-bot helps filter out the right information.</p><h4>Raw Data to Readable Content</h4><p>Now synthesizing interviews can be a long process, sometimes taking more time than actually collecting data. This laborious task was replaced at Faire with ChatGPT with a security layer of course. Whenever they conduct real interviews, the transcript data is inserted into the tool, and a concise prompt is given to get organized information.</p><p>Here is what a <strong>prompt template</strong> at Faire looks like:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IM5DT2rDMJRoj2EdEO9LrA.jpeg"" /></figure><p>This is a series I intend to keep on doing, so make sure you <a href=""https://medium.com/@punitweb"">follow me</a> for more articles like this!</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d10ec40fb6af"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-top-companies-are-using-ai-in-their-design-workflows-d10ec40fb6af"">How top companies are using AI in their design workflows</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What it really takes to build a product inside ChatGPT while the ecosystem is still forming (and without an engineering team)</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a hand pressing the ChatGPT logo, surrounded by abstract shapes, nodes, and connecting lines on a blue background, suggesting interaction within a networked system."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0B3_mRr5_B3ZZYMtsXm6RA.png"" /></figure><h3>Building in a space that doesn’t exist yet</h3><p>A ChatGPT app isn’t an app in the way we’ve learned to think about software.</p><p>It doesn’t ship with a standalone interface or a familiar navigation model. It lives inside a conversational surface, where <a href=""https://blog.uxtweak.com/conversational-ux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">language, intent, and orchestration shape how a product is experienced</a> just as much as UI does. Still, companies are moving quickly to integrate, sensing that showing up inside these systems will soon be table stakes for discovery.</p><p>The moment feels familiar. In the early 2010s, <a href=""https://resources.latana.com/post/mobile-first-brands-level-up/"">teams rushed to become mobile-first</a> before fully understanding what mobile would demand of product, design, or infrastructure. Large language models are triggering a similar shift — except this time the interface is conversational, the distribution layer is centralized, and many of the constraints are still undefined.</p><p>Participating in this new layer requires more than exposing an API. Products need a way to express what they do, how they should be used, and under which conditions they should be invoked. <a href=""https://getsquid.ai/blog/what-are-mcps"">MCP</a>s are one emerging attempt to make products legible to language models, though the standard itself is still taking shape.</p><figure><img alt=""Modal titled “New Connector (Beta)” with fields for name, description, MCP server URL, authentication type set to OAuth, and a warning indicating the connector is not verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vuiQNBn2oJH3kx0Ndm_1Rg.png"" /><figcaption>Adding connectors in ChatGPT developer mode. Full breakdown of steps <a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode"">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>What stands out most is how early this ecosystem feels.</p><p>Tools are appearing faster than shared mental models. Founders are building in parallel toward very different interpretations of what a “ChatGPT integration” actually is. For non-technical builders — designers, product thinkers, operators — the promise of access exists alongside real uncertainty about control, responsibility, and realism.</p><p>This article is a set of field notes from trying to build a ChatGPT app early, without a technical background, while the space itself is still in flux.</p><h3>A platform shift that pulled me in</h3><p>I started paying attention to this space out of curiosity more than mandate.</p><p><a href=""https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/"">When OpenAI released the ChatGPT app ecosystem</a> to direct submissions in Dec 2025, it felt like the opening of a new product surface — one that would quietly reshape how discovery works and how products are understood. Conversational interfaces were no longer just answering questions; they were influencing what users saw, compared, and acted on.</p><figure><img alt=""ChatGPT “Apps (Beta)” directory screen showing a featured “Create with Canva” card, category tabs, and a list of integrated apps such as Adobe Photoshop, Airtable, and Booking.com."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*97ppIXhA8gP73ShHZ0l6qA.png"" /><figcaption>ChatGTP’s Apps directory as of Dec 2025</figcaption></figure><p>It was obvious that <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">surfacing inside ChatGPT would matter, and quickly</a>. Not as a simple presence, but as a product that could be interpreted, ranked, and differentiated within a conversational flow.</p><p>I wanted to understand what that actually meant in practice.</p><p>Rather than speculating from the outside, I started exploring the space by trying to build something concrete: a prototype that behaved like a real app inside ChatGPT, constrained by its strict UX &amp; UI guidelines, its invocation patterns, and its rules.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow mapping document titled “Product selection &amp; handoff,” showing a multi-row UX analysis with labeled sections, notes, and a large embedded property listing interface on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NmpIfEnyO5qXNr0ppEOuGg.png"" /><figcaption>My initial research led my to observe &amp; analyze flows and patterns of behavior around the very first ChatGTP partner apps (here Zillow)</figcaption></figure><p>That exploration pulled me into an ecosystem I didn’t fully understand yet, but one that felt important to experience from the inside.</p><h3>The constraint: moving fast without being technical</h3><p>I approached this as a product designer — someone whose value comes from shaping behavior and orchestrating systems, not writing production code. That constraint became clarifying: it forced me to focus on the product questions that actually mattered. At the start, my mental model was incomplete: I didn’t yet understand where code actually lived, how APIs differed from MCPs, or how invocation worked once a product entered a conversational system.</p><p>What I did have was urgency, and a strong drive to understand the space.</p><p>Waiting for engineering availability wasn’t realistic. No-code tools became leverage — a way to maintain velocity while the ecosystem was still forming.</p><p>I expected the process to be relatively fluid. That these tools would absorb complexity and make experimentation easier.</p><p>Instead, I encountered a fast-growing ecosystem full of ambition, pressure, and partial solutions. Many platforms promised to bridge the gap between non-technical builders and ChatGPT integration. Very few actually reduced the friction involved.</p><h3>Entering the frontier: a fragmented ecosystem</h3><p>My exploration started with a straightforward question: which tools could realistically help me export an MCP and demo a functioning ChatGPT app?</p><p>I did my due diligences and experimented first with general no-code and AI-assisted platforms like <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor</a> and <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> in order to get a reference.</p><p>Cursor, while powerful, assumed familiarity with local development environments, file systems, and publishing semantics that weren’t obvious without a development background. “No-code” didn’t remove complexity — it required architectural intuition most designers simply do not have. The recent emergence of various <a href=""https://adplist.notion.site/cursor-for-designers"">courses</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faezjTHA5SU"">tutorials </a>explicitly aimed at making Cursor more approachable to designers reinforces that this gap is structural, not personal.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from a marketing video displaying a Cursor interface, with a design inspector panel open on the right showing component properties, and an embed chat UI panel on the left."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4j2r_Pa-lBy5prbKnf0q_g.png"" /><figcaption>Cursor introduces their <a href=""https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor"">visual editor</a> end of 2025 in an attempt to make its software more accessible to non-coders</figcaption></figure><p>Lovable, as I had rightfully assumed, assisted in creating beautiful and realistic enough visuals when carefully prompted but never could extend beyond the role of ingenious prototype.</p><p>I then quickly moved on to exploring several early platforms attempting to solve this problem specifically, including <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a>, <a href=""https://fractalmcp.com/"">Fractal</a>, <a href=""https://noodleseed.com/"">NoodleSeed</a> and <a href=""https://manifest.build/"">Manifest</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Four landing pages arranged in a grid, each promoting tools for building or deploying apps inside ChatGPT, with headings, call-to-action buttons, and product interface previews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TeDhUZwtkXCTyugG8cQgMw.png"" /></figure><p>In conversations with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmatthews-pm/"">Colin Matthews</a>, founder of <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a> and instructor at <a href=""https://maven.com/tech-for-product/ai-prototyping-for-product-managers"">Maven</a>, he described the value as enabling teams to “export code, view sharable specs, and run evals directly within the platform to facilitate cross-functional handoffs.” That made sense for what I was trying to do — bridging design intent and implementation without owning production code.</p><p>Each of these emerging tool approached the problem differently. Some were strong on prototyping but struggled when pushed toward something deployable. Others required a level of technical investment that conflicted with my constraints. A few were promising but blocked by access limitations, incomplete products, or early-stage instability.</p><p>Nearly everything I tried was in beta.</p><p>Platforms were buggy. Context was frequently lost. Documentation was thin. Many tools assumed users already knew how to prompt effectively, how to reason about conversational flows, or how to debug hallucinations when things broke.</p><p>Alongside the tooling, I spent time talking directly with founders building in this space. Those conversations became just as informative as the products themselves.</p><p>Even when tools looked similar on the surface, the underlying visions were very different. Builders had conflicting ideas on who the primary user was, what MCPs should represent, and whether this layer was fundamentally about infrastructure, product creation, or distribution.</p><p>You could feel that divergence in how each platform behaved.</p><h3>Where things broke</h3><p>As I kept experimenting, patterns began to repeat.</p><p>Hallucinations showed up in different forms — including code that looked convincing but simply didn’t hold up. Some abstractions accelerated early progress, only to break under real constraints. Context loss meant restating intent again and again.</p><p>In several cases, MCPs appeared to work inside builder environments but failed to surface at all inside ChatGPT. In others, the system repeatedly reported success — changes “applied,” actions “completed” — while nothing had actually changed. Debugging became conversational: repeatedly prompting the system to self-diagnose. When that failed, progress depended on reaching out directly to founders to investigate issues that weren’t visible from the surface.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing an error message while creating a custom connector on the left, and a ChatGPT conversation on the right explaining that live event data cannot be verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tKa5E30Fiwa0arbzoYTF2w.png"" /><figcaption>Left: MCP fails to connect altogether despite numerous attempts at self-diagnosis | Right: Although app is connected it fails to respond when invoked</figcaption></figure><p>These issues aren’t unique to any one tool. They’re <a href=""https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/"">well documented</a> across current LLM platforms and early-stage developer tooling, particularly when systems rely heavily on generative output without strong validation layers.</p><p>The harder part was understanding where responsibility sat.</p><p>When behavior deviated from expectations, it wasn’t obvious whether the issue came from the platform, the MCP configuration, or the tool itself. There was very little support for reasoning across those layers.</p><p>I also realized that I had more influence than I initially thought — over ChatGPT-native layout, conversational flow, and follow-up questions — but that influence was rarely surfaced clearly. It lived behind structured inputs and assumptions that were easy to miss if you didn’t already know they existed. That realization forced me to get more deliberate about what I was actually optimizing for.</p><h3>How I learned to choose</h3><p>Facing this level of fragmentation and instability, I needed a way to evaluate what actually mattered.</p><p>I stopped optimizing for comprehensiveness and started optimizing for learning velocity. That shift required being explicit about tradeoffs — what I was willing to sacrifice and what I wasn’t.</p><p>The framework that emerged:</p><p>Speed to behavioral validation over perfect infrastructure — I cared more about seeing how something behaved in ChatGPT than building it “correctly.” Mock data, hardcoded responses, simplified flows — whatever got me to a testable embedded interaction fastest.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing screengrab from various softwares.

I’d rather ship one well-orchestrated flow than ten that worked but felt bolted on.</p><p>Debuggability over abstraction elegance — When something broke, I needed to understand why. Tools that hid complexity behind beautiful abstractions became liabilities. I favored visibility, even if it meant more manual work.</p><p>This hierarchy shaped everything: which tools I abandoned, which compromises I accepted, and how I structured the interaction model itself.</p><h3>Patterns that emerged across tools and conversations</h3><p>Looking across tools and conversations, a few themes stood out.</p><p>Guidance was mostly under-designed. Many platforms offered powerful capabilities but assumed a level of prompt literacy and architectural intuition that designers don’t naturally start with — and that the tools themselves didn’t teach.</p><p>“No-code” didn’t remove the need for systems thinking. It redistributed it. I found myself reasoning about flows, tool invocation, compliance, system architecture and boundaries, even without writing production code.</p><figure><img alt=""Dashboard-style interface showing six configuration panels labeled Attachments, Connectors, Filters, Model management, Modes, and Parameters, each describing options for controlling data sources, model selection, interaction modes, and prompt settings."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tqfV5fo1MGgNWpJ9KDLfdg.png"" /><figcaption>Tuners, as described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmiecampbell/"">Emily Campbell</a> in the <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">Shape of AI</a></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest source of friction was translation. Enterprise assets — APIs, design systems, UI kits, brand and photography guidelines — aren’t LLM-ready by default. Converting them into something that could be safely and predictably invoked required manual judgment at nearly every step.</p><p>ChatGPT<a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/ui-guidelines/""> UI guidelines</a> added another layer of ambiguity. It wasn’t always clear what was disallowed, what was risky, and what simply needed adaptation. Validating those decisions ahead of review remained difficult, even when an app appeared to work. That ambiguity isn’t accidental — it reflects a space where standards, responsibilities, and even product definitions are still being negotiated.</p><figure><img alt=""Slide showing a question about implementing brand colors in ChatGPT UI, alongside two panels outlining a “Brand Colors — Implementation Plan,” with color tokens, SDK-compliant areas, gray areas, and sections marked “keep as-is.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LM8ZeYvQmVFZ_3zSyWOlWg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Chippy illustrating ambiguity in ChatGPT UI compliance due to unclear SDK guidance.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it became obvious that the space hasn’t converged yet. Founders are building toward different futures, and that lack of alignment shows up directly in the products.</p><h3>What the workflow revealed</h3><p>Over time, I stopped expecting the tools to define the experience for me.</p><p>Progress came from taking ownership of the interaction model: deciding which results to surface, how they should appear, and what kind of conversational path felt intentional rather than reactive. I worked with mock data instead of real APIs to focus on behavior before scale.</p><p>Visual control required additional effort. UI components &amp; the data they should contain were thought through and designed separately, exported as structured assets, and reintroduced into the platforms to better align with each product’s unique requirements.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of two content cards, one showing restaurant listings with images, ratings, addresses, and selectable reservation times, and the other showing hotel listings with photos, review scores, amenities icons, pricing per stay, and “View on Booking.com” buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9SgFgdIcq_QK1bwFx6iDEw.png"" /><figcaption>Left: ChatGTP’s inline carousel widget template | Right: Booking.com’s interpretation</figcaption></figure><p>Testing always happened inside ChatGPT itself. Differences between builder environments and real platform behavior were common, and those gaps often surfaced the most insight.</p><p>What this workflow ultimately revealed was less about process and more about role. Building in this space required judgment across design, systems, and platform interpretation. The work sat somewhere between product design and infrastructure awareness, even without owning production code.</p><h3>What this shift changes about who gets to build</h3><p>This experience clarified something: the line between “product” and “technical” work is dissolving.</p><p>In an informal conversation I had with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamsegal/"">Noam Segal</a> — AI Insights Lead at Figma — he framed it simply: “designers in this space have to agree to tinker, fail often, and share those failures in order to learn.” Even without owning production code, I had to understand how tools connect, how data flows, and how decisions propagate through an LLM-driven product. These aren’t optional skills for designers working in AI — they’re foundational.</p><p>Prompting felt less like creative expression and more like intent specification. Over time, it became clear that this skill will likely be absorbed into tooling rather than remain a standalone practice.</p><p>For designers, this shift is significant. The work moves away from static artifacts and toward shaping behavior in uncertain systems. Comfort with experimentation, ambiguity, and failure matters more than deep mastery of any single tool.</p><p>Finally, product leadership too, is shifting. Outcomes matter more than mechanics. Adaptability matters more than precedent. And direct visibility into how products behave in the world matters more than perfectly polished specs.</p><h3>Open questions and forward-looking bets</h3><p>This exploration surfaced more questions than it resolved — and that feels appropriate for a space still taking shape.</p><ul><li>Where does responsibility sit when hallucinations slip through?</li><li>How much control will non-technical builders retain as governance tightens?</li><li>How do teams meaningfully validate products when preview environments remain incomplete?</li></ul><p>At the same time, a few patterns feel durable enough to bet on:</p><p>The translation layer will become its own discipline. Converting enterprise systems into LLM-legible interfaces isn’t a one-time technical task — it’s an ongoing design problem that requires new kinds of judgment.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface showing Slack-style messages, an audio digest player titled “Q4 projects — Weekly Insights,” and a “Configure digest” panel with fields for title and destination channels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m0v180qrT0PFk_rGKVWKZw.png"" /><figcaption>Rather than replacing existing tools, AI products are increasingly embedded within them — shifting the design challenge toward translation and orchestration, from Design Patterns For AI Interfaces course, by <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/vitaly-friedman/"">Vitaly Friedman</a></figcaption></figure><p>Conversational coherence will matter more than feature count.

<h4><em>It’s not about adding AI, it’s about solving problems better than before.</em></h4><p>Lately, I've seen a shift in the market… one that gives me hope for the future. Instead of asking, <em>&quot;How can we put AI into our product?&quot;</em> the new question to ask is, <em>&quot;How might we solve customer problems with AI?&quot;</em></p><figure><img alt=""Two sales people from the sketch comedy show, Portlandia, with the phrase, &quot;Put a bird on it.&quot;"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5uSmq93bQqBjA9TpYR-Tpw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Put a bird on it — Portlandia, Source <a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/put-bird-on-xugExlK"">imgur</a></figcaption></figure><p>This seemingly subtle difference represents a massive mindset shift because one question is driven by hype, and the other is driven by value.</p><p>The first question, “How can we add AI?” is <em>trend-chasing</em>. It puts technology before purpose, and often leads to bloated features no one asked for, wasted development time, money, and opportunity cost of building something desired and innovative instead.</p><p>The second, “How can we solve a real problem better with AI?” is <em>value creation</em>. It puts the customer at the center and treats AI as a tool, not a trophy.</p><p>That’s the shift we’re seeing. And it’s the difference between shipping gimmicks and building enduring solutions.</p><h3>Put some AI in it!</h3><p>Since the start of the AI revolution, we've been doing research with both Big Tech and smaller AI-based startups to help them understand their customers and their response to AI-based products and services.</p><p>The initial request was simply to, &quot;Put some AI into the product.&quot; It makes sense: it's a new, emerging technology and it's important to stay competitive…</p><p>What it looked like in real life was a different story: It became more of a race to integrate a chatbot into the product than a process of determining whether a chatbot is really the solution to a problem.</p><p>I mean, unless the business problem is have a chatbot because my competitors also have a chatbot.</p><p>If you remember the sketch comedy show, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia""><em>Portlandia</em></a>, then you might recall the sketch, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw"">Put a bird on it</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the sketch, two well-meaning artists try to help struggling businesses by literally adding birds to random products:</p><blockquote>&quot;Look at this sad little tote bag… I know, I'll put a bird on it!&quot; easily becomes, &quot;Look at this sad Pre-GenAI product… I know, I'll put some AI on it!&quot;</blockquote><p>It’s funny because it’s true. And it’s tragic because it’s happening.</p><p>That sketch nails the problem with trend-first thinking: it’s surface-level. Aesthetic over substance. AI becomes a sticker, not a solution. When you chase a trend, you decorate. When you pursue end-user value, you solve.</p><p>And solving is where the real growth is.</p><p>(Continue watching as it devolves hysterically at your own risk).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href"">https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href</a><h4>You aren't asking the right question</h4><p>Having spent my career helping companies uncover deep customer pain points and design real solutions, this wave of “just add a chatbot” feels like watching innovation on autopilot.</p><p>It wasn’t strategic. It wasn’t solving for anything. It was tech for tech’s sake fueled by FOMO (Fear of missing out). The real question that drives long-term growth is this:</p><blockquote>“Are we solving our customer’s most urgent problem better than anyone else?”</blockquote><h4>AI is a means to an end</h4><p>Simply adding AI is like when the internet exploded in the mid-90s saying that we needed to add some HTML into our product. Or, to have a website. But a website to do what? To solve what problem?</p><p>AI can help answer that question. But it doesn’t replace the question itself. AI is a means to an end, not the end in itself. And to be clear: the end goal is happy customers that purchase your product or service.</p><p>This is where the mindset shift comes in: It's not about <em>adding AI </em>as much as it's about <em>solving customer problems.</em></p><h3>The mindset shift</h3><p>&quot;I have a new tool in my toolbox. It's called AI. Or Agentic AI. Or an LLM.&quot;</p><p>Ok, cool, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>The real shift is this: instead of jamming AI into an already bloated product roadmap, teams are starting to ask a smarter question:</p><blockquote>“Where can this tool help us solve a customer problem in a better way than we could before?”</blockquote><p>This may sound obvious, but the implications are transformative.</p><p>The best companies aren’t leading with the tool. They’re leading with the outcome. AI is a means, not the mission. A lever, not the solution itself.</p><p>Think of it this way: You used to have a hammer, maybe it was a really good hammer, but it was really good at nails. Now you also have a screwdriver. It's flashy and helps you solve new problems because not every problem is a nail.</p><figure><img alt=""Quote from Star Wars: &quot;These aren't the droids you're looking for.&quot; Obi-Wan Kenobi."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*wYrXWxbixlOW_G__CcIiig.png"" /><figcaption>Obi-wan from Star Wars (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_aren%27t_the_droids_you%27re_looking_for"">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The shift isn’t just about what tools are available, it’s about what problem you’re solving and what’s now possible because of this new AI toolset.</p><p>The leading Tech companies understand this shift because it comes from a place of power. By reframing the problem and the approach, you're able to stop playing catch-up and start leading the market with your new, innovative approach.</p><p>Leveraging AI for what it does best allows product development teams to focus on what they do best: designing and developing solutions, now with more options on how to solve problems.</p><h3>Taking action</h3><p>If you’re building with AI, here’s your first step: pause and reframe the question.</p><p>Don’t start with, “Where can I use AI?” Instead, start with:</p><blockquote><strong>“What is the biggest, most urgent, and most underserved problem our customers face? And what is now uniquely possible because of AI?”</strong></blockquote><p>To help you shift into this problem-first mindset, try this simple diagnostic:</p><ul><li>What’s the #1 frustration your customers keep bringing up?</li><li>What do they wish they could do but currently can’t?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand, what would you remove, automate, or radically improve?</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself: does AI give us a new advantage to solve that?</p><p>If the answer is Yes: Great! Keep going and build with intentionality.</p><p>If not: don’t force a square peg into a round hole. This isn't the screw your AI-screwdriver is looking for.</p><h4><strong>Now it's your turn</strong></h4><p>Putting the <em>most </em>AI into your product isn’t a winning strategy. Instead, it’s being <em>intentional</em> and <em>selective</em> about when, where, and why you chose to incorporate AI into your product.</p><p>This is your opportunity to lead the shift inside your team, your company, your product. Solve real problems by being the one who helps your team make the mindset shift and asks the better question.</p><p>That’s how meaningful innovation and growth happens.

It’s been my default across dozens of projects and, in my opinion, represents the best of open-source typography. Its clean geometry, strong engineering, and consistent rhythm have made it a staple of modern design systems. Over time, especially while working on accessibility-focused products, I began noticing small limitations. Certain glyphs blurred together at smaller sizes, some bowls felt tight in low-vision contexts, and characters like I, l, and 1 weren’t distinct enough for readers who rely on extra clarity. None of this diminished my respect for Inter, it simply highlighted areas where accessibility could be improved.</p><p>Because of these legibility challenges, when I started doing product work for <a href=""https://loudandclear.io/""><em>Loud + Clear</em></a>, an app designed for people with Parkinson’s, I turned to <a href=""https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. It’s one of the most thoughtfully designed accessibility fonts available, with radically open forms and unmistakable glyph shapes that prioritize clarity. For low-vision users, it excels.</p><p>But I missed Inter’s visual aesthetic, its modern geometry, contemporary rhythm, and the familiarity designers expect in UI typography. I admired Atkinson’s readability and Inter’s overall look, and kept wishing there were a way to bring the strengths of both into a single design.</p><p><strong>Hyperlegible Sans</strong> is the result. It’s an open-source fork of Inter that preserves its modern character while incorporating hyperlegible principles inspired by Atkinson. It isn’t meant to replace either font, just to offer another option, one that didn’t exist before.</p><p>What I changed (and why)</p><p>The philosophy behind Hyperlegible Sans is simple: keep the visual identity of Inter intact, but reduce ambiguity wherever it appears. That meant making targeted, deliberate adjustments rather than redrawing the font from scratch.</p><p>Here are the most impactful changes:</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison image showing Inter on the left and Hyperlegible Sans on the right, with highlighted letters demonstrating clearer apertures, improved differentiation between I, l, and 1, a wider capital O, and a slashed zero in Hyperlegible Sans."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZLD_DI4KANEeF9uaOSqhmQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side comparison of Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, highlighting changes to ambiguous glyphs, including a, e, I, O, and 0, to improve character differentiation and legibility.</figcaption></figure><h4>Capital I</h4><p>I added subtle top and bottom bars.

Good typography should simply work for everyone.</p><p>Hyperlegible Sans reflects a belief I carry into every project: <strong>design can be both beautiful and accessible</strong>.</p><p>We don’t need to choose between modern geometry and clear letterforms. We can have both.</p><p>Design is full of these false choices, and part of the work is expanding the range of tools available so designers can choose what best fits their intentions.</p><h3>What’s next for Hyperlegible Sans</h3><p>This is only version 1. The roadmap includes:</p><ul><li>additional weights</li><li>a full variable font</li><li>expanded punctuation</li><li>broader language support</li><li>refinements for dark mode and low-contrast environments</li></ul><p>And like Inter, this project is open-source. I’m uploading the complete files to GitHub, along with documentation on the changes and a roadmap for future versions.</p><p>My hope is simple: that this font becomes another tool in the accessibility toolkit. Something UI designers, developers, and product teams can reach for when they need both clarity and beauty, when they want typography that reflects how modern design should work.</p><p>Not less beautiful.

Trust is built on transparency, neutrality, and multi-source verification.</p><p>For years, social media has thrived on <strong>pluralistic ignorance.</strong> This is a psychological trap. You privately doubt a post. You wonder if it is AI, but you stay silent. You don’t publicly call it out. You don’t even like the post. Instead, you send it to a friend in a DM.

<h4><strong><em>How brand, data, and reuse help ideas move past the demo phase</em></strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IZ6fOsQkSAw4pHD1iXAFuA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Music platform screens vibe coded with various AI tools like Anima and Uizard</em></figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we know there are many tools at our disposal to create AI-generated UI, like Lovable, Anima, and Uizard. There has been a lot of progress in this space, with AI output at unthinkable speeds and of unprecedented quality. But still…most of it feels short-lived and unusable.</p><p><strong>The generated screens look convincing, but they’re treated as placeholders instead of starting points in the ideation process</strong>. For instance, when a generated screen needs to reflect a brand’s styling, handle real data, or align with existing patterns, the work has to be rebuilt (and the generated UI is tossed).</p><p>This is simply a mismatch between how UI is generated in AI tools and how products are actually built. So instead of avoiding constraints such as branding and data, they need to be integrated into the generation process. This way, the UI becomes more valuable and can be used to continue to iterate past a demo or proof of concept (POC) phase.</p><p>Let’s look at 3 constraints (brand styles, data, and pattern reuse) that separate generated UI that gets discarded versus UI that is used end-to-end in the product development cycle</p><h3>Start with a brand versus restyling later</h3><p>AI-generated screens typically use visual styles that are neutral, like system-default colors and typography. Though the UI feels “close enough,” it’s not truly accurate to your product’s brand (or any other brand you want to test). And once real branding is introduced, the UI designs break down from the gaps created from the neutral styling used during generation.</p><p><strong>This ultimately causes rework to better incorporate the product’s branding (either restyling elements or starting over completely)</strong>. To avoid this issue, brand alignment must become part of the initial AI prompt versus being considered as extra steps to fix in later stages.</p><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Anima that is inspired by the Airbnb brand and AI prompting"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IJ-5YTLl4BBmz8LZKf_17g.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>Anima generates UI inspired by a brand</em></a><em> (like Airbnb) from the first AI prompt, and can make modifications to individual elements as needed</em></figcaption></figure><p>But generating UI with brand context doesn’t eliminate design judgment– it more so reduces how much work gets discarded. When generated UI reflects a real brand early in the design or ideation process, it becomes something teams can refine rather than replace.</p><h4>How to integrate branding and generated UI</h4><p>Many of the AI tools we already know are beginning to account for specific brand inclusion:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: With <a href=""https://dev.animaapp.com/"">Anima Playground</a>, you can generate an application using the visual language of an existing brand. Just write the app you want to build, along with the brand to use as inspiration (from your own brand to Airbnb’s). You can also refine individual UI elements or adjust inline copy without regenerating the designs again and again.</li><li><strong>Uizard</strong>: <a href=""https://uizard.io/autodesigner/"">Uizard’s Auto-designer</a> allows you to write a text-based prompt, then select a style (from a screenshot, URL, or brand kit). After the designs are generated, you can modify elements and generate themes.</li><li><strong>Google Stitch</strong>: Similar to the other tools, <a href=""https://stitch.withgoogle.com/"">Google Stitch</a> generates screens based on your prompt, which can include brand styling. Stitch’s output is solid, but you cannot modify individual elements; you can only use an entire screen as reference for modification requests.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""UI generated by Google Stitch that is based on the prompted brand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0HsQrO4-IZeMRk-WU1V6-g.png"" /><figcaption><em>Google Stitch generates screens based on the requested brand, but can only modify entire screens versus single elements</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: Some of the tools, like Anima, generate the UI with flexibility and can be restyled with </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lMHFWD8I3E""><em>different branding inspirations</em></a><em> without rebuilding the entire layout. So you can easily compare visual directions or get stakeholder feedback.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of branding from the start</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster alignment</strong>: Introducing brand context early reduces the gap between initial concepts and stakeholder expectations (shifting feedback away from styling and toward design intent)</li><li><strong>Comparison between directions</strong>: Applying different brand styles to the same layout makes it easy to evaluate options without redesigning the experience each time</li><li><strong>Less restyling later</strong>: When typography, colors, and tone are set from the start, teams spend less time retrofitting as the design evolves</li></ul><h4>Limits of branding with AI tools</h4><ul><li><strong>Surface-level branding</strong>: AI-driven branding captures visual cues like color and type, but doesn’t replace a deeper Design System</li><li><strong>Accessibility and content review</strong>: Generated UI still needs to be manually reviewed and validated by designers for accessibility and content standards</li></ul><h3>Apply real data to reveal if the UI actually works</h3><p>Screens that have been generated with AI typically use mock data as placeholder content. Though mock data helps teams understand the design idea, it also masks the hardest UX problems. Not every user goes through the ideal, “happy path”…they will encounter empty states, error flows, and permission rules.</p><p><strong>These unexpected, but common scenarios don’t show up in static screens, which means early designs can give a false sense of readiness</strong>. Without real data and content driving interactions, product teams discover these gaps late in the design and development process.</p><figure><img alt=""Database feature in Anima to view and edit real data for your app"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lWxdv2nCddjR-rjiLJXFYw.png"" /><figcaption>Anima automatically creates a database with editable data to support your project</figcaption></figure><p>Though this doesn’t replace user-centered design thinking, it ensures ideas are grounded in authentic user behavior from the beginning of the design process. So by integrating real data into the generated UI, teams can see whether interactions work, content fits, and user permissions behave as expected. This is especially important when features rely on user input, authentication, or content submission.</p><h4>How to include real data with generated UI</h4><p>With the right AI tools, you can replace placeholder content for real data:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: You or your team can describe the data a feature needs in Anima’s Playground text prompt, and the system will generate databases and/ or tables based on the instructions. The data will be connected to the project and will automatically come with <a href=""https://www.animaapp.com/blog/product-updates/built-in-databases-for-anima-playground-zero-config-backend/?ref=fmt-handpicked"">default security policies</a> that match the intended usage.</li><li><strong>Cursor</strong>: With <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>, you can integrate your codebase (GitHub or GitLab) to give AI more context, as well as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfkpZzs04-I"">connect MySQL database</a> to create elements like tables.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Manually configuring a database via extension to the Cursor tool"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0XQGV9bKFQb8nVp8VgxWGQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Cursor requires manual configuration to connect a database via extension to the AI agent</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: With Anima, just about anyone can create a database (even with no code knowledge). On the other hand, Cursor’s MySQL setup process is more technical and hands-on.</em></blockquote><h4>Benefits of using real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Discover problems early</strong>: Testing with real content surfaces UX gaps (like validation and edge-cases) before they become costly rework later</li><li><strong>Clear sense of readiness</strong>: When screens behave with actual data, it’s easier to know what’s ready for iteration versus what’s purely visual</li><li><strong>Reduced throwaway</strong>: By grounding UI in common behavior from the start, teams rely less on static mockups that will probably be discarded</li></ul><h4>Limits of integrating real data</h4><ul><li><strong>Developer input</strong>: Complex tables, queries, or structured data often need manual configuration beyond what AI can create</li><li><strong>Premature focus on data</strong>: Focusing on data structure before validating broader design concepts can distract from testing core user flows</li></ul><h3>Reuse and build off familiar patterns</h3><p>Many product teams rely on established UI components and patterns that AI ignores when generating screens. So teams have to rebuild or replicate familiar components, which adds unnecessary work and risks inconsistency.</p><p><strong>When screens don’t leverage existing assets or common interaction patterns, they won’t integrate with the rest of the product ecosystem</strong>. When AI can build off trusted patterns and components from the start, the generated UI becomes more durable, consistent, and easier to refine.</p><figure><img alt=""Anima’s Chrome extension lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hp-9Z4oohRw0brznSurstQ.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo""><em>Anima’s extension</em></a><em> lets you capture any kind of UI element on a live website, as well as manage the elements in the right rail</em></figcaption></figure><h4>How to reuse what already exists</h4><p>Tools that allow you to grab existing elements to use in your generated UI:</p><ul><li><strong>Anima</strong>: In <a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-to-code-by-anima/paddhneaanoeljlmdepnheehdkaegblo"">Anima’s Chrome extension</a>, you can capture UI components directly from live websites using the Clipboard feature.

After screenshotting, you can convert the images into coding prompts within KwikUI for more context-based output.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""YoinkUI’s Chrome extension lets you select and save elements from live sites"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0yU5q6lxr8LSr21ch5-QMA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yoinkui/ihlkclcengelgcfkkmpkhgadepmgijkk""><em>YoinkUI’s extension</em></a><em> lets you select and save single to grouped elements from any live website, like </em><a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/""><em>Airbnb</em></a></figcaption></figure><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: After capturing UI elements from the site of your choosing, you can select the Clipboard Gallery button in Anima Playground’s prompt to insert them into your generated screens.</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Insert captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l7uEriwp1pss7WmedPH7fA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Insert your captured elements into Anima Playground’s generated screens to recycle real UI components and patterns</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Benefits of reusing familiar patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Faster iteration</strong>: Designers can leverage existing UI and patterns, which reduces the need to recreate components from scratch</li><li><strong>Continuity across projects</strong>: Reused components help maintain a consistent look and feel; even generated and manual UI are combined</li><li><strong>Reduced cognitive load</strong>: Familiar patterns make it easier to evaluate new screens and maintain predictable interactions (for both product teams and end users)</li></ul><h4>Limits of reusing patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Captured UI may need adaptation</strong>: Elements from other sites may require cleanup or adjustment to fit the current project’s needs</li><li><strong>Legal and licensing</strong>: Reusing UI from external sources may require extra consideration to copyright or usage rules</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Generated UI begins to show actual value when it holds up under real-world constraints; not simply from its delivery speed or trendiness. Brand alignment, real data, and reuse makes early concepts sturdy, reliable, and less prone to be thrown away. These 3 constraints allow product teams to continue to iterate on generated UI instead of regenerating or starting from scratch.</p><p><strong>As AI tools like Anima and Lovable continue to evolve, their progress will be shown in how usable their output is past the demo phase</strong> (rather than producing work that will be discarded). Because when AI-generated work fits into product workflows and design constraints, it will start becoming part of the product development cycle.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=96b44ade04a1"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-makes-generated-ui-worth-keeping-96b44ade04a1"">What makes generated UI worth keeping?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
