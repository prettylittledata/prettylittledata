<h4><em>Today, too many images are little more than filler and bait.</em></h4><p>It feels like almost all text published online today <em>needs </em>an image with it. White paper, blog post, social post, news article: these things must have an image with them to <em>survive — </em>how do you expect your writing to reach people by throwing away all the <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/photos-generate-engagement-research/"">engagement that images give you</a>?</p><p>But, obviously it wasn’t always like this. See below an image of the cover of the <em>New York Times</em> on armistice day 1918:</p><figure><img alt=""An photograph of the front page of the New York Times, featuring no images, only text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zXtVyVNl99j8jZisckx5uw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>And a screenshot from CNN from today, October 11 2025:*1</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage, featuring a large number of very colorful images."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTMClsXCpIhaAvYz9uHSnQ.png"" /></figure><p>It wasn’t always like this, and we apparently managed to get information before. It wasn’t perfect, but we managed.</p><h3>What are accessory images?</h3><p>You might be thinking, “But I, or someone I know, sometimes finds these images useful.” Indeed: my disagreement is primarily with images whose nature is not to give you information in themselves, but which act as bait or filler.</p><p>So what are accessory images? Here’s a test: let’s say that an article you have written is being recognized in some way — such as receiving an award, being used for training, etc. Under what circumstances would you include the accompanying image?</p><p>For instance, if your article was about hacking and your editor had added a stock photograph of an unidentified man in a hoodie on a computer, would you submit that image along with the article for recognition by a prize? Or as a materially important part of the article for training purposes?</p><p>Such images — often stock or AI slop (all of which I shall discuss below) — are an insult to the visual crafts like photography and painting. These images don’t matter in themselves; rather they are just there to fill space or draw people to something actually important (or profitable). They are an accessory to the crime of clickbait.</p><p>They thus distort our networks and our information environment:</p><ol><li>The article most read should be the most interesting one, not the one with the most distracting image.</li><li>Conversely, our social networks are today brain-addling filler images whose only characteristic is existing.</li></ol><p>Any medium can be an accessory: images are special to me because they are the normal accessory to my primary medium, text. But so can text be an accessory, as can music: see “stock music” or (trade name) Musak.</p><h3>Careless taste</h3><p>Where are all these images coming from? Apparently, at least one person asked the question: “Now we can easily deliver images over the Internet, where can we put them? Why not have an image with every article on our website, and every preview in our article listing page, and every preview on our social network feed.”</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t long before you need your thing to have a preview/featured image for it to go anywhere online: anything without a featured image will be at disadvantage. Now, images are for the most part <em>compulsory.</em></p><p>This has led to two overlapping phenomena:</p><h4>Slock</h4><p>Slock images are created to fill the gap, they’re usually either stock photography (iStock, Getty, etc.) or AI-generated (slop) — hence “slock.” These images are most popular among stressed-out content managers, writers, and people trying to get somewhere on LinkedIn.</p><p>These people are told — explicitly by managers, or implicitly by the networks, that every piece of writing needs an image. Then begins the panicked process of finding one: note that for any writer paid by the article (not the hour) this wasted time is quite painful.</p><p>This brings forth a rogue’s gallery of trash:</p><p>We have of course the corporate-looking stock, like this mysterious person who pops up everywhere:</p><figure><img alt=""A stock photograph, featuring a person dressed in a suit reading a newspaper, whose title is “Business.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUf5404HX_-DzQfwHjnTuw.png"" /></figure><p>Then the figures:</p><figure><img alt=""An uncanny-valley figure, a misshapen humanoid with an oversized expressionless head and overly-defined hands, seemingly made from grey plastic."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/621/1*WJB97hrG3RK8OX280z-o1A.png"" /></figure><p>And of course the recent AI slop:</p><figure><img alt=""An AI slop cartoon, featuring animals dressed in suits apparently performing business, and saying nonsensical things."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MurCiXczBjpVcHcZqGMY4g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Please note that images of the grade shown above are common on LinkedIn, despite the gibberish.</figcaption></figure><p>Slop is more insidious than stock. Now that people can create images quickly with AI, the problem of finding something relevant is solved, superficially.</p><p>For example, a colleague of mine wrote a good article on “Excel Hell” — Copilot dutifully made him an image of a man standing in a burning room surrounded by floating tables in Excel-brand green.</p><p>Relevant? From the perspective of someone with no concept of a spreadsheet (and therefore of Excel Hell), yes.</p><p>Useful, clarifying, aesthetically pleasing? No, and so lacking in these qualities that it threatens to tear the mind to shreds.</p><p>This comes with uncountable problems, including:</p><ol><li>The disturbing nature of the pictures, and their universally crass and/or cheesy persona</li><li>The environmental impact immense power required to create them (remember that the vast majority of these images are pointless)</li><li>The overproduction of real-enough looking images such that it’s becoming hard to know what’s real</li></ol><h4>Bait</h4><p>As I suggested above, the overabundance of images has turned our media from places where we read and explore and decide what we wish to learn more about, to places where we scroll — barely consciously — browsing until something jolts us enough to pause or click.</p><p>We used to explore, now we doomscroll. In this environment, people obviously use images as a tool to snap people out of it — or deeper into it, depending on your perspective.</p><p>This of course gives us the shock face:</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a YouTube preview, with the host exhibiting the common “shock” face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e6dXlY3vQGRSKHjZVckNPw.png"" /></figure><p>And, with the medium curling back on itself, the fake quote, usually shop sign or imagined book:</p><figure><img alt=""A fabricated quote, made to look as though it were written in a book then highlighted: “Everything in your life is a reflection of a choice you have made. If you want a different result, make a different choice.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*ijva-XnO3OWqzkKEenjB_w.jpeg"" /></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of overlap between slock and bait.</p><p>We must demand to know, in all these cases, what we the readers/listeners/watchers gain from this. Were the images and hence gasping faces absent — leaving just the title, account ID and a description — would we all say, “all this needs is someone faking surprise”?</p><h3>Proposals</h3><p>So, what do we do about it? Here are some ideas:</p><h4><strong>Text-only mode (perhaps by default in some cases)</strong></h4><ol><li>All hypertext systems that have a text mode, and should provide a facility for the user to use that mode only, i.e. show text only.</li><li>Users should be able to suppress images <em>ad hoc</em>, or everywhere, at particular times, on particular Internet domains, etc. Ideally, online media would be made to look good without the images.</li><li>One might build, for instance, a text-only social media platform, where images are never shown unless one accesses the particular post where they’re found.</li><li>These settings would be organized as a fractal, with any entity at any level of abstraction capable of setting this parameter.</li><li>For instance, the moderators of a given community on a given social network could set the default setting for the visibility of images, but individual users always have final control.</li></ol><h4><strong>One, the other, or both</strong></h4><ol><li>To dam the production of slock images, publications or we could create a rule something like the following: a post can be previewed either as text (showing the title, author and a snippet) or as image (showing a the title, author, and a thumbnail).</li><li>This way any writer, photographer and publication must make the hard choice: does this image stand alone, or is it merely bait or wallpaper for the accompanying text?</li></ol><p>There is of course the question of what to do with media that has both a legitimate text and image component. I say we create the category, e.g. multimedia feature/comic-book and in such cases preview with an image. This type might have to be prohibited or creatively governed in many freely accessible social media, because it presents the opportunity for skullduggery.</p><p>Accessory media (and particularly images) are a disease of luxury. It’s only because our computers are this powerful and our networks fast that it is even possible. It was different not so long ago, and it changed without, apparently, giving us enough time to built norms to deal with it.</p><p>You might be saying, “But accessory images are a result of human nature/the market, it’s out of our hands.”</p><p>True about human nature and the market, but this fact means we know how to change things. A market is a system — one might say — which determines outcomes via profit and loss. We need to make it pay to build networks that encourage people to be honest with their images.</p><p>We should, therefore:</p><ol><li>Seek out, patronize and build social networks with more sensible policies around images.</li><li>Remind people that images of the sort above are <em>in poor taste.</em></li><li>Never click on a link with an accessory image.</li><li>Never voluntarily use an accessory image.</li></ol><p>Let’s shake off the ennui of learned helplessness and take back our media. Slock-bait is deranging, depressing and distracting: let’s get rid of it. Contrary to popular (usually subconscious) belief, the nature of technological culture is not <em>just the way it is </em>but a function of our decisions, norms and tastes. Let’s quit, therefore, while we still have some control left.</p><p>1 I’m not claiming that this is an exact comparison, only that CNN is widely used and representative of our obsession with images.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=92f43b0d45e9"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-images-as-accessories-92f43b0d45e9"">Against images as accessories</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

They behave based on their design. As a result, many systems, even those found in nature, exhibit frequent, common behaviors. Moreover, these behaviors will typically manifest the same problems and issues, so much so that we may even name and categorize them. These are <a href=""https://ctl.mit.edu/sites/ctl.mit.edu/files/attachments/tab%204c%20Pacheco%20-%20system%20archetypes.pdf"">sometimes called archetypes</a>, but I prefer to call them familiar system mechanisms. For designers they are important to know, recognize, and avoid.</p><p><strong>Why Feedback Matters</strong></p><p><a href=""https://deming.org/systems-thinking-feedback-loops/"">Feedback</a> refers to the way systems communicate with individuals. By providing information about the system state and its performance, feedback enables the individual to make decisions (or evaluate system recommendations). It is perhaps one of the most important aspects of systems design.</p><p>Feedback is critical for building system resilience; when errors occur, a system should give feedback about the error and allow for an immediate response to correct the error.</p><p>Think about the simple act of adjusting your shower water temperature. You turn the handle, stick your hand in the water stream, and receive immediate feedback about whether you need to adjust further. This feedback loop — action, measurement, adjustment — is fundamental to how we interact with systems.</p><figure><img alt=""A feedback diagram representing how feedback influences decisions for shower water temperature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HR27BtltXVpGjhVn"" /><figcaption>A feedback diagram for adjusting water temperature Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>But not all feedback is immediate. And that’s where things get interesting.</p><p><strong>The Power of Recognizing Familiar System Mechanisms</strong></p><p>Recognizing familiar system mechanisms (FSMs) is important for several reasons:</p><p>First, by recognizing them, you can quickly and accurately predict how the system will act. This knowledge enables you to situate yourself in the position of <a href=""https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/"">highest leverage</a> to alter or improve the output of the system, or to use it to your greatest advantage.</p><p>Second, when FSMs fail, they typically fail in a common and familiar way. This particular way is called <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea?srsltid=AfmBOopzD-3sRK4wAdAfwmwwOXuUiXJp_-2VaxrLpbR-RkCUBgF2PEEA"">a failure mode</a>. Correctly recognizing and categorizing an FSM will enable you to prevent and guard against the most common failure modes quickly and with little effort.</p><p>Third, FSMs provide clarity and agency in the face of complexity. Many problems found in life and business are different manifestations of similar system mechanisms. To recognize this is to empower yourself. As Peter Senge writes in “<a href=""https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwiGlPWI0JSQAxUzU38AHRSkLCAYACICCAEQABoCb2E&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyNSZA9FSkzRSfU8oAEkhgyHIC3oYPpCLned0Lsgkmns-hk7TN0RO0aApuIEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASN-Ro7p02t7zrIE99lr3KKPQTsiEMmszea3aV6W-dh_yCGmIKxIuUYCampmvLlX_PqknYuAXUK9E&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_33&amp;sig=AOD64_3gk13R_6gaoEyz9g4bDPS0YncTxg&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjypu-I0JSQAxX34ckDHXLUOU4Q0Qx6BAgVEAE""><em>The Fifth Discipline</em></a>:”</p><blockquote><em>“Systems archetypes [FSMs] reveal an elegant simplicity underlying the complexity of management issues.

If they are not aware that the system has a feedback delay, or misjudges the delay, they will over or under adjust the controls, or become discouraged from lack of change in the controls.</p><p>A shower provides a great example for this. We all know that the controls of the shower are not instantaneous and that the shower has a startup time associated with getting hot water to the showerhead. Because of experience we allow some time for the system (shower controls, plumbing, hand) to register a change before making further adjustments. And yet despite ample experience, we’ve all been surprised by an icy or excessively hot stream of water as we’ve mistakenly adjusted the controls.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of a man adjusting the shower with a feedback diagram superimposed on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CHgxWUHBUzeN2W44"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson to be learned from this type of scenario is that aggressiveness increases risk and volatility. Stock market bubbles are a macro-level phenomenon of the same mechanism at play. Investors see delayed feedback from their actions, panic, and over-correct, creating wild swings in valuation.</p><p>This mechanism shows up everywhere:</p><ul><li>Dieting and weight loss (results take weeks to show)</li><li>Learning new skills (improvement feels slow initially)</li><li>Economic policy (effects take months or years to materialize)</li><li>Exercise routines (strength gains and muscle growth have delayed feedback)</li></ul><p><em>Mechanism #2: Limits to Growth</em></p><p>In this system mechanism, (of which a famous, <a href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/"">1972 paper was written</a>) the system grows organically, but eventually encounters a limit to continued growth. Actors within the system may be tempted to ignore early signs of the limit to growth or discount it as trivial because of the current success. As the limit goes unaddressed, growth continues to slow. The way for the system to continue to grow is to remove the limit.</p><p>In the NBC sitcom, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"">The Office</a>, Michael Scott starts his own paper company to compete against his former employer, Dunder Mifflin. By undercutting prices, he steals away Dunder Mifflin’s customers, but as he looks to expand his business, he’s confronted by a startling reality: the prices that are making him successful are also putting him out of business.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture from the NBC sitcom the office, featuring Michael Scott, Pam, and Ryan"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*OzCQzbnur4hIZLrP"" /><figcaption>The Michael Scott Paper Company, in it’s heyday. Source: Reddit.com/</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson of this mechanism is to address limitations early to avoid roadblocks later.</p><p><em>Mechanism #3: Tragedy of the Commons</em></p><p>In the <a href=""https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues"">tragedy of the commons</a>, actors within a system all have access to shared but limited resources. They use this resource for their individual needs, and since the resource is free to them, they benefit from its use.

<h4><em>It’s not taste that will set designers apart from AI. It’s judgment.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""A photo-realistic image of an art studio wall with about a dozen charcoal drawings of figures and drapery pinned for critique, lit by moody fluorescent light with soft shadows."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SCdoTVV0fHpJ6XgbMV1OgA.png"" /><figcaption>Composite AI-created image by author</figcaption></figure><p>There’s that word again. Taste.</p><p>Listen to a few podcasts with designer A talking to designer B in echo chamber C, and you’ll likely hear it a few more times.</p><p><a href=""https://carlbarenbrug.com/taste-matters?ref=sidebar"">We’re talking about taste </a>like it’s the thing that will keep the cyber robots from stealing away our jobs.</p><p>It’s not that I disagree. But I think once again we’ve rushed out of our way to promote <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-broken-rhetoric-of-ai-f3a24165899d"">exactly the wrong word</a> to convey what we really mean.</p><h3>Where do I start?</h3><p>When I hear the word <em>taste</em>, I often think about fashion.</p><p>Somebody who dresses well is often considered to have great taste, but what does that really mean? Is it something born within us, or is it developed over time?</p><p>Despite deep respect for people with good fashion sense, there’s a truth that often floats above the mystique of someone’s innate ability of looking sharp:</p><blockquote>To dress well is to dress appropriately.</blockquote><p>In other words, forethought to context (e.g. an incoming rainstorm) often plays a part in the senses people see in us.</p><p>When we talk about having taste during our collective AI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development"">storming and norming</a> phase <em>(to borrow from Tuckman’s group development model)</em>, I know we’re talking about something similar.</p><p>But it also takes time, which leads to experience, which leads to judgment and arbitration — the real words we mean when we talk about taste in this context.</p><h3>Fade to gray</h3><p>When I was in art school, we used to have some bang-out critiques — some real barn burners, if you want to know. Unlike my business-credit-taking dorm buddies, fine art studio sessions were often three-hour jams that culminated in everyone hanging up their work for stark and uncomfortable examination.</p><p>We learned techniques from <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/standing-in-the-shadow-of-giotto-43d0133cfea2"">the old masters</a> to create wonderful studies of light and shadow on objects, scenes, and eventually the human figure, culminating with ourselves in portrait.</p><p>We used sandpaper to sprinkle charcoal dust on heavy paper, creating a mid-tone canvas for adding light with a chamois and a series of erasers. Then darkening with more charcoal, finding and building our tolerance for shape, mood, and eventually meaning.</p><p><em>Pro tip: The secret to finding shadows is simply squinting your eyes.</em></p><p>Regardless of the subject, there was always a time requirement. We were expected to put an hour into our first take-home assignments. Then two. Then three. Then eventually six.</p><p>Six!? Everyone outside of the art program scoffed at this labor-intensive task.</p><p>Once the work was ready to present, my professor, a perky and passionate painter with a Texas drawl, would start at the left of the wall and work her way over during our always-awkward crits, pointing and smiling to each piece before a word was even spoken.</p><p>She always, without fail, asked the same question starting each student’s critique.</p><h3><em>How many hours?</em></h3><p><em>How many hours? How many hours? How many hours, y’all?</em></p><p>We’d all wait until a fellow student chimed in, giving a rough estimate based on the work in front of us.</p><p><em>Looks more like one to me.</em></p><p>Invariably, the artist would cave — admit to going to an all-nighter at Blue House or some downtown bar, and only finding a spare 20 minutes over a hungover weekend to put together a passable representation.</p><p>This admission was necessary because it was always obvious in contrast to the other work. The output always told the story.</p><p>Time is evident in craft. What we put into it is usually what we get out of it.</p><p>What I learned in those classes informs me to this day.</p><p>Quality isn’t automatic. It’s nurtured through time, technique, and feedback from others who are willing to tell us what they see in our own work.</p><p>It’s a process of discovering and defining <a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/driving-product-teams-to-become-more-design-mature/"">what <em>good</em> looks like</a>. And it comes over time, which is necessary for knowing how our work is received relative to the unforgiving forum of mass perception.</p><p>Compare this with today’s AI slop and the absurd notion of “Look what I did with X number of prompts” — it starts to feel like an oxymoron.</p><p>The idea that <em>taste</em> is the antidote to bad AI decisions simplifies a much more <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/design-is-a-conversation-2af15b555c80"">nuanced conversation</a>.</p><p>And that’s why I think <em>taste</em> isn’t the right word. It’s too foofy.</p><p>Not to mention that in 25 years of doing UX and product design, I’ve never heard a user express any appreciation for the <em>taste</em> of a particular design— let alone the designer. Seldom are products elevated at the surface level that word immediately conjures.</p><h3>In other words</h3><p>What we’re really reaching for isn’t taste. It’s a strong <a href=""https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/taste-is-a-dead-end"">point of view</a>, shaped by memory, practice, and a willingness to stay in the work long enough to know what matters.</p><p>That’s our goal. And it hasn’t really changed.</p><p>Businesses will always want output that’s better, faster, and cheaper.</p><p>But generative AI? I see it more like the charcoal and the eraser — not the finished piece.</p><p>It can help us block in the basics. It might even suggest a direction or tease out a shape we hadn’t seen before. But <em>we</em> should be the ones squinting to see what’s there. AI can’t choose what to leave out, or where to press harder. It doesn’t know when to stop, when to share, or when to start over.</p><p>That’s not subjective taste. That’s practiced judgment.</p><p>And judgment only comes from showing up again and again — building tolerance for ambiguity, seeking critique, and developing the context to make decisions with intent.</p><p>So maybe the next time we reach for “taste” as the thing that separates us from the machine, we take a beat.</p><p>What we really mean is more nuanced.</p><p>What we’re trying to say is: <em>I’ve been here before. I know what good looks like. And I know what to do next — because I’ve put in the hours.</em></p><p>It’s not taste that makes the difference.</p><p>It’s time well spent.</p><h3>Keep in touch</h3><p>If this resonated with you, <a href=""https://medium.com/@mschindler"">follow me</a> on <strong>Medium</strong> for more stories about staying grounded in today’s design culture.</p><p>Find me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschindler"">LinkedIn</a> or my personal website, <a href=""http://mschindler.com/"">mschindler.com</a>.</p><p>Related reading:</p><p><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/taste"">Taste</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b5caacddbec4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">The importance of taste, and other lies we tell ourselves</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

We’re here today to demote a sentient diagram.</p><p>Long story short: afew years ago a lightning bolt totally hit a Texas data center while someone had Lucidchart open, and a Information Architecture Tree Diagram (our old reliable sitemap buddy) woke up, and has been with us ever since.</p><figure><img alt=""Lightning striking a modern style warehouse building on a decilate landscape."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVW-6kKKIBa5rfZOpzHlpA.png"" /><figcaption>Image AI Generated (Midjourney)</figcaption></figure><p>The I.A.Tree drops into the meeting late– connection lines crinkled and nodes misaligned.</p><p>“I’ve been up all night reorganizing the course pages. The client added three new ‘top-level categories’ that are actually just filters. The homepage has eight parents now. And someone renamed one of my root nodes ‘Global Navigation 2.’ Wait… why is HR here?”</p><p>I take a breath. “This is going to be a hard conversation.”</p><p>A couple of I.A. diagrams’ boxes squeeze into near triangles — making a kind of squint. “If this is about course registration prerequisites again, that’s not my job. I’m an architecture diagram, not an interactivity diagram. Or a… relationship diagram. Or whatever new kind of diagram you design kids are using to cosplay as engineers now.”</p><p>I glance at HR’s tiny Zoom window. I’m sure the HR lady is doing the same to me.</p><p>“Exactly,” I say. “You’re great at hierarchy, I.A. Diagram. But we keep asking you to model things that aren’t just parents and children. We need our go to diagram to show shared data, reusable components, relationships that shift when users interact or when the system changes over time — and you keep telling us doing those things aren’t your job.”</p><p>The Tree folds a few of his far off branches in what I think is supposed to be a sort of cross armed pout. “Because it’s not my job! You want to show relationships that move? That’s a <em>state diagram.</em> You want to show dependencies? That’s a <em>system map.</em> I’m an <strong>architecture</strong> diagram, I only should have to show where content lives.”</p><p>“Right,” I say. “But we need to show <em>cardinality</em> now — how many relationships exist, how things multiply or overlap as systems evolve.”</p><p>The Tree bristles. “Cardinality? Who the hell do you think you are — the Pope?”</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch of a laptop screen with a man speaking to a woman in another panel in the video conference interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CG7FmSg9mAHZBTLPDJRbyA.png"" /><figcaption>Image AI Generated (Midjourney)</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, the Tree isn’t malicious — just absolutely certain about where its job ends.</p><p>“Okay,” I say, “let’s walk through this again. A course can have multiple instructors across different semesters — how do we show that with you?”</p><p>“I don’t,” the Tree says flatly. “That’s not my job.”</p><p>“What about courses that fulfill multiple degree requirements?”</p><p>“Still not my job.”</p><p>“Okay… and prerequisites that reference other courses?”</p><p>“Definitely not my job.”</p><p>“Students registered across multiple sections — sometimes cross-listed — how would you handle that?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t. Sounds like somebody else’s problem.”</p><p>“Whose problem?”</p><p>“Maybe a flowchart. Maybe, I don’t know, ask an engineer.</p><p>Every time relationships appear, the Tree punts: put it in a flowchart, an entity relationship diagram, or “engineering will figure it out.” But in 2025 UX, structure <strong>is</strong> part of the designer’s job: we’re expected to map persistent objects, cardinality, reuse, role-based access, and system constraints — well before anyone writes code.</p><p>We need a diagram that can carry that weight.</p><p>A horrible realization crosses the Tree Diagram’s root node where it’s face would have been, “am I Being… Fired?”</p><p>HR unmutes, voice gentle and corporate: “I.A. Tree Diagram, you’ve been a huge part of this team’s documentation. Your impact on navigation and hierarchy has been — ”</p><p>I.A. Tree freezes. “You’re firing me.”</p><p>“No,” I say quickly. “Not firing. <em>Demoting</em>. You’re no longer our primary structural diagram. You’ll still be critical to how we design navigation and be used every time we create content hierarchy. But the product design team is promoting class diagrams to our go to diagram.”</p><p>He stares. A few nodes detach.</p><p>“Class diagrams? That’s full-on UML. Why not sell your guitar, buy Magic cards, and rock a fanny pack while you’re at it?”</p><p>“Look,” I say. “We’re not role-playing engineers. We’re trying to plan out and communicate how the product actually fits together — that’s like the definition of design work. Class diagrams show objects, attributes, and relationships — cleanly. That’s what we need.”</p><h3>Why class diagrams need a promotion in design teams</h3><p>As design literacy spreads beyond traditional “Product Designer” titles — <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2024/06/06/new-essential-92-of-leaders-expect-employees-to-have-design-skills/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Forbes notes that 92% of leaders now expect employees to have some level of design skill</a> <strong>— </strong>Those of us who pay the mortgage with our design skills need to bring value that goes well beyond making and explaining interface-level decisions. The old approach — classifying information monolithically and statically — no longer fits the realities of today’s complex, high-stakes digital products.</p><p>The Nielsen Norman Group recently published a great piece called <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/future-proof-designer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>The Future-Proof Designer</em></a>, arguing that today’s best product designers aren’t just defining how a product looks from state to state at launch — they’re also creating the kinds of diagrams and doing the type of work that helps cross-functional teams solve complex problems together.</p><p>An information architecture tree diagram, for example, is like trying to survey a river by taking a single snapshot. It’s useful for orientation, but no longer the tool we need to deliver what’s expected of us now — showing how systems connect, and evolve.</p><p>Class diagrams are different from I.A. trees because they let us:</p><ul><li>Define <strong>what</strong> exists (objects/classes),</li><li>Specify <strong>what they contain</strong> (attributes),</li><li>Show <strong>how they relate</strong> (associations with cardinality),</li><li>Capture <strong>inheritance/extension</strong> (when needed),</li></ul><p>If you want a “how to make class diagram” resource go watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XrL5jXmTwM"">Lucidchart’s excellent, short intro to class diagrams on YouTube</a>.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>A tree diagram can show hierarchy beautifully — parent, child, sibling. It can even make an unruly architecture look organized (if only at a glance). A tree diagram <em>does</em> have its place — especially early in the design cycle. As the Nielsen Norman Group points out in their article “<a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tree-testing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com""><em>Tree Testing: Fast, Iterative Evaluation of Menu Labels and Categories</em></a><em>”</em>, tree testing is ideal <strong>before</strong> you build page layouts or visual design: it lets you “test multiple IA options … without any design, coding, or content development” to see which structure works best. But a tree assumes that every object has one clear parent and that relationships flow neatly downward. That’s a comforting fiction, but fiction isn't’ what’s needed when making critical decisions about the design of a system.</p><p>For an example let’s think of a course registration product for a university. If the design team was required to wireframe out this system we’d need to diagram at a minimum to represent :</p><ul><li>A <strong>Student</strong> can register for many <strong>Courses</strong> (and vice versa).</li><li>Each <strong>Course</strong> may be taught by multiple <strong>Instructors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> can have <strong>Prerequisites</strong> (other Courses).</li><li>Some <strong>Courses</strong> fulfill <strong>Degree Requirements</strong>.</li><li><strong>Courses</strong> are offered in specific <strong>Semesters</strong>.</li></ul><h4>What’s the Problem Starting With a Tree Diagram?</h4><p>If I took this problem and made a tree diagram out of it — well it would look like this, and how the hell could I go back to my desk and start sketching a wire frame from this spaghetti? But more importantly it can’t identify design flaws early, something class diagrams are <em>explicitly designed to do</em>, as noted in <a href=""https://www.archimetric.com/the-importance-of-class-diagrams-in-software-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">Archimetric’s “<em>The Importance of Class Diagrams in Software Development</em>.</a>”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Dou5K2TnwLV0RT3yiOlfYw.png"" /><figcaption>Tree Diagram Generated using <a href=""https://www.mermaidchart.com"">Mermaid Chart</a></figcaption></figure><p>There’s no clear canonical “object.” Are these <em>course instances</em> or just <em>labels</em>? What on this diagram represents an actual, screen-level piece of information — and what’s simply a class definition? Cardinality is either invisible or misleading. Are there many instances of a node, or just one? Tree diagram you drive me crazy!</p><h4>How and Why I’d Use A “Designerly Class Diagram Instead”</h4><p>I’d treat each category as its own “designerly class,” separating the information and interactivity into distinct conceptual objects, then map how they work together to create value for the user. That diagram would look something like this (although honestly most of the time I just sketch it on my iPad)</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O4BpHoKk_fzomhwBmdNviQ.png"" /></figure><p>As a designer, I know which input methods users are most familiar with when interacting with these properties. I know where they’ll likely look for the information needed to complete each task. What I <em>don’t</em> instinctively know is how all these pieces of information work together — as a system, as a product. It’s too complex to hold in my head while I’m working. That’s what the diagram is for: not just to share how the system works with others, but to free up mental space so I can actually solve problems.</p><h3><strong>“I’m Architecture, Not Interactivity”</strong></h3><p>Back on Zoom, the I.A. Tree digs in:“I show where things go. Someone else can say how they connect.”</p><p>“That’s the crux,” I say. “In 2025, <em>structure</em> isn’t just ‘where stuff goes.’ It’s what the stuff <strong>is</strong> and <strong>how it relates</strong>, across roles and contexts. If our documentation can’t carry that, engineering inherits ambiguity — and users inherit weirdness.”</p><p>He grumbles, a grizzled veteran tone. “In my day, we mapped a whole site with a sharpie, a few sticky notes, and a dream. And it worked.”</p><p>“It did — for brochureware and early apps. Today we’re designing systems.”</p><p>He eyes me. “So we’re… opening the relationship?”</p><p>“We’re building an ensemble, not a monarchy,” I reply.</p><p>The HR lady nods, proud of us all while the Tree goes quiet, then mutes. The tile turns gray. I hear what can only be described as a leafy sniffle. When he reappears, he looks smaller. “Okay,” he says. “I’m not the lead anymore. That… stings. But if you need a three-tier menu with mobile fallbacks — ”</p><p>“You’re our first call,” I say.</p><p>He lifts a branch. “And don’t draw those class diagrams like code. Keep them human. We all need to read them — no curly braces, OK?”</p><p>“We will.”</p><p>He sighs — a wind-through-leaves sound. “All right. Just… make sure my pension vests.”</p><p>HR: “We’ll, uh, look into that.”</p><p>We end the call. And for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel compelled to invent a new dashed-gold-double-legend line on a I.A. Tree diagram just to explain the structure underneath our design.</p><h4>Acknowledgments</h4><p><a href=""https://intertwingled.org/the-polar-bear-book/""><em>The Polar Bear Book</em> — <em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web</em></a> by Peter Morville and Louis Rosenfeld — has been hugely influential in how I think about structure, systems, and the evolving role of design literacy in product teams.</p><p>Morville, Peter, and Louis Rosenfeld. <em>Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-Scale Web Sites</em>. 4th ed., O’Reilly Media, 2015.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=47b44e18e8d4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/its-not-you-it-s-hierarchy-47b44e18e8d4"">It’s not you, it’s hierarchy</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In fact, I made a similar prediction nearly two years ago. In December 2023, I published an essay titled <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/design-is-dead-and-we-have-killed-it-ba46cf1dc18b""><em>Design Is Dead. And We Have Killed It.</em></a><em> </em>I explored how AI’s rapid evolution would render design — not just designers — obsolete.</p><p>I argued that visual design’s core purpose is to translate complexity into clarity. And if AI can achieve that same clarity by unifying experiences and anticipating needs across contexts — particularly through non-visual interfaces — it will eventually absorb the function of UI design entirely.</p><p>But since writing that article, my perspective has been shifting. I now believe that visual design may still have a pulse. Understanding that future starts with a simple metaphor— <em>taking the scenic route</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Map with a red route through New Hampshire’s towns and a bright autumn scene of a red covered bridge surrounded by vibrant yellow foliage."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PhVuxIjHSaAi0aL6MOV0vw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://www.aarp.org/travel/vacation-ideas/road-trips/new-hampshire-road-trip/"">aarp.org</a></figcaption></figure><h4>From utility to choice</h4><p>When traveling, we often face a choice. The fastest route is efficient and predictable, optimized to get us from point A to point B. The scenic route is slower and longer, but richer — winding roads through forests, detours along a coastline. It doesn’t make “sense” in a strictly utilitarian framework, but it does as an expression of human values.</p><p>This metaphor maps directly onto the current debate about design. The rational view assumes that once AI and invisible interfaces handle functional tasks, visual design will become unnecessary. After all, if a <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-agents"">voice agent</a> can complete a transaction instantly, why bother designing a screen?</p><p>The answer is that necessity and value are not the same thing. While the fastest route may be a straight highway, that doesn’t make it the most meaningful or memorable. In the same way, a frictionless voice interface might be the most efficient way to get something done, but it is not always the most satisfying.</p><p>When trying to understand how such value is communicated, <a href=""http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem06.html"">semiotics</a> can help explain this process by describing the dualistic nature of interface communication.</p><p>Every interface communicates on two levels—the denotative (what it does) and the connotative (what it means). Invisible systems excel at the first. Visible, intentional design emphasizes the second — signaling care, identity, values, and intent. Choosing to design something, even when you don’t need to, declares that the interaction is meant to be experienced, not just completed.</p><p>Think of a banking app that still shows you a welcoming dashboard instead of just confirming a deposit by text, or a smart-home system that visualizes energy usage rather than simply optimizing it silently. Both are gestures that transform a transaction into a relationship. They show that interfaces do more than deliver outcomes—they infuse narratives, values, and meaning into those outcomes.</p><h4>The value of inefficiency</h4><p>Once utility is taken care of by automation, effort itself becomes expressive. What optimization once treated as waste — time, ornament, friction, even delay — can instead become thoughtful design materials. They slow people down just enough to notice, reflect, or connect.</p><p>For users, the “scenic route” means richer, more meaningful interactions. A well-crafted interface invites exploration instead of simple completion, shaping how people feel as they move through a system because it makes the care and effort behind it visible.</p><p>We often feel that difference when someone chooses to spend effort on us.</p><p>For example, when I left a company after nearly 13 years, my boss and mentor mailed me a handwritten note congratulating me and thanking me for my work and friendship. He could have sent an email — faster, clearer, and certainly more legible (his handwriting is atrocious) — but I would have read it once and moved on. Instead, I keep that note on my shelf as a reminder of the effort and story it represents.</p><p>This dynamic is well described by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"">signaling theory</a>, which helps explain why effort itself can communicate value. A “costly signal” — one that takes time or effort — carries more weight because it tells users that the experience was worth investing in.</p><p>A handwritten note feels meaningful because someone cared enough to write it. And in the same way, a thoughtfully designed product feels intentional because it respects the user’s humanity.</p><h4><strong>Human variability and the future of design</strong></h4><p>Most people will choose frictionless utility for routine tasks. But smaller groups seeking deeper, more intentional experiences often shape markets and brand perception in unexpected ways. Just look at how <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/31/the-observer-view-on-the-joys-of-the-vinyl-record-resurgence"">vinyl records made a comeback</a>. Few would have predicted such a revival in an era dominated by streaming music.</p><figure><img alt=""Vinyl album sales chart from 1993 to 2013 shows a rise, peaking in 2013.

The rise of AI and agent-based interaction won’t erase visual design—it will reframe it. As everyday interactions shift toward voice and conversation, design’s role will move from functional to expressive.</p><p>Designers won’t win by competing with AI on speed and output. Machines will always outperform there. But they cannot replicate human judgment, taste, or the ability to infuse meaning into form. The designer’s work will be knowing when a scenic route is worth taking — when inefficiency signals values or identity.</p><p>Visual design will no longer be the default. But precisely because of that, it will become more powerful — shaping meaning in ways automation cannot, long after screens disappear.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=45983f55196e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/visual-designs-future-is-the-scenic-route-45983f55196e"">Visual design’s future is the scenic route</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Why clear, strategic writing is more critical than ever.</h4><figure><img alt=""An outline of a pencil surrounded by AI icons that look like stars."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sSQy65QWDjIgpqyXRWkEFw.png"" /></figure><p>If you’ve used an AI product recently, you probably know that the technology is incredible. The UX? Not so much.</p><p>Maybe you’ve gotten comfortable writing prompts or using simple one-click tools. But as AI interfaces start to take different forms, many of them are still kinda hard to figure out. Navigating them can be overwhelming. It doesn’t feel like you’re <em>using</em> these products so much as <em>deciphering</em> them. The engineering is powerful, but the flows don’t make sense.</p><p>If you’re lost in an AI user flow, blame the writing.</p><p>Lots of these tools use unclear labeling, make phony promises, or simply cram interfaces with vague, hyphenated phrases like “AI-enabled.”</p><p>The usability issues make sense, because AI is relatively new. We’ve seen this happen before. Think about the first time you tapped on a smartphone. Or the first time you sent an email. Every big shift takes a little getting used to. As new technology arrives, new interaction patterns emerge. And the role of words in the interface needs to be figured out.</p><p>The solution: good UX writing. Smart, strategic, honest language that keeps users clear and makes products simpler. It’s more important than ever.</p><p>So if you’re designing an AI product, here are some things to consider.</p><h3>Define your audience</h3><p>And do it <em>before</em> you write. The first step of writing is understanding your reader. This decision will influence the way you write. It’ll also influence your feature set and product roadmap. Different audiences need different things. An AI fact-checking tool for journalists will look very different than one for biology students.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different CTAs with different phrasing speaking to different audiences."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*penmi9jhlEEyTg33fxDhYg.png"" /><figcaption>Understand who you’re writing for and how they’ll use your product.</figcaption></figure><h3>Decide where AI sits in the product</h3><p>That means shaping the strategy and architecture of whatever you’re building. Before you add AI language and icons onto every screen, align on your approach to AI. Does AI live across the <em>whole</em> product, or just one feature? Is there a character that sits “on top” of the interface?</p><p>Now is also a good time to ask: is your product using AI at all? Have an honest discussion. If it’s not AI, don’t say it is.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens that introduce an AI product in different ways.

So when you’re writing, think about the first-time user. Will they know what to search? Which file to upload? Where to go for help? Find ways to share guidance or give examples. The best products make sense from the very first screen.</p><figure><img alt=""Three different ways of showing a search bar.

As you’re choosing good words, think about form, size, color, and spacing. Find the right approach for your information. Maybe that’s a perfect paragraph. Increasingly, it’s short, scannable pieces of text. Try different ways to show the same idea. You can work with the engineering team to create guidelines around how text gets displayed.</p><figure><img alt=""Three screens showing how color, formatting, and lists can add clarity to writing."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bdAajcoy654fJfUlHqCgUg.png"" /><figcaption>Explore different ways of displaying the same information.</figcaption></figure><h3>Choose smart, specific actions</h3><p>This is one of the toughest pieces of language to land for AI tools.

They understand user needs and suggest a path forward. The next time you’re designing one screen of your product, consider what might come next. Explore common use cases and try to avoid dead ends.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of next steps after a query.

Users should know if they’re talking a chatbot—or a person. They should know if the song was written by a musician—or generated by an app. The solution is simple: use words and images to tell the truth.</p><figure><img alt=""Three versions of how content can be labeled depending on if it was created by AI or a person."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MeUCJ5qaDBU6r4EgoNA4TQ.png"" /><figcaption>Be honest about how AI was involved.</figcaption></figure><h3>Show your sources</h3><p>It’s a way to build trust with the user. It’s also a way to keep people safe. Showing your source doesn’t feel all that urgent if you’re displaying NBA scoring titles. But AI products are now commonly used for things like nutrition, finance, and medicine. Users should know where important information is coming from.</p><figure><img alt=""Three ways an AI-generated response might cite the source material."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZvXH_GCOwVg0vpHNJQIbYw.png"" /></figure><h3>Write for all people</h3><p>Many of today’s AI products were built for early adopters. These products use the language — and acronyms — of engineering. And they presume a deep fluency with technology.</p><p>As AI products move into the mainstream, the writing in the interfaces should evolve, too. The writing should become more readable. Respectful. Inclusive.</p><p>Crafting that language takes talent and experience. It requires deep expertise and a sense of empathy. Sure, AI tools can generate endless amounts text.

Unlike Chrome or Safari, where you navigate TO information, Comet brings information to you.</p><p>Here’s how it works: Instead of a traditional address bar, Comet presents a natural language interface. But the real innovation happens behind the scenes — the browser maintains persistent context across your entire session, understanding not just your current query, but your underlying intent.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*47gAe3dhGpY0bHBdR4gxqg.png"" /><figcaption>Comet’s clean interface featuring natural language search instead of traditional URL navigation.</figcaption></figure><p>Three core capabilities distinguish Comet from traditional browsers:</p><p><strong>Contextual AI assistant</strong>: A sidebar that doesn’t just answer questions — it proactively analyzes what you’re viewing and suggests relevant insights. Looking at flight options? It compares prices across tabs automatically.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3UPryT_FiqFtjfytQbdKGQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI sidebar analyzing gluten-free candy selection at Mercadona, displaying contextual product recommendations while maintaining awareness of celiac dietary constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Persistent intent memory</strong>: Unlike chat interfaces that forget context when you close them, Comet maintains understanding of your goals across your entire browsing session. Start researching hotels in one tab, and it remembers your budget constraints when you switch to restaurant searches.</p><p><strong>Cross-site synthesis</strong>: The system can simultaneously process multiple sources, comparing information and identifying patterns across everything you have open — something that would take humans dozens of manual steps.</p><p>This isn’t just a faster way to browse. It’s a different paradigm for how humans interact with information online.</p><h3>Three breakthrough discoveries</h3><p>After two weeks of systematic testing, three insights emerged that every UX team needs to understand:</p><p><strong>The mental model shift is instant</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based interfaces within <em>days</em>, not weeks — even when AI only delivers 60–70% reliability</p><p><strong>AI excels where we least expected</strong>: 90% success rate for synthesis tasks vs 30% for linear workflows — most teams are building AI features backwards</p><p><strong>The future is distributed, not monolithic</strong>: Specialized AI services collaborating feel more seamless than one system trying to do everything</p><h3>Day 3: The moment my brain rewired itself</h3><p>The difference is immediate and stark. Traditional browsing: Chrome’s blank page asks “where do I go?” AI-native browsing: Comet’s search field invites “what do I want?”</p><p><strong>My first test:</strong> “Find cheap flights to Tokyo for May, maximum budget $800.”</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*apgdrt0u57htaseGxsZKeQ.png"" /><figcaption>Natural language query replacing traditional navigation: delegating a complex task with multiple constraints.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Traditional approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Open 15+ tabs across multiple flight sites</li><li>Manually compare prices and schedules</li><li>Cross-reference dates and availability</li><li>Time investment: 15–20 minutes of active navigation</li></ul><p><strong>Comet approach:</strong></p><ul><li>Single natural language request</li><li>AI handles research and synthesis automatically</li><li>Time investment: 30 seconds setup + background processing</li></ul><p><strong>The critical insight:</strong> When Comet worked, it was transformative. When it failed, it was frustrating enough to reset user confidence to zero.</p><p>Success rates I documented:</p><ul><li>Simple requests: ~70%</li><li>Complex criteria: ~30%</li><li>Booking workflows: ~30%</li></ul><p>But users mentally adapted to the new paradigm <em>regardless of success rate</em>.</p><h3>Day 7: When AI surprised me (and why most teams build backwards)</h3><p>Day 7 brought an unexpected revelation. I had 8 browser tabs open with diverse UX research from different sources — articles, studies, case studies, forum discussions.</p><p>Command: “Analyze all open tabs and identify common patterns in UX trends for 2025”.</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI assistant displaying synthesized findings from eight UX research sources, identifying five recurring design trends with specific citations and detecting contradictions between sources in under 60 seconds."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KKcTcLyHaXuifqP19Ki-bQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI assistant displaying synthesized findings from eight UX research sources, identifying five recurring design trends with specific citations and detecting contradictions between sources in under 60 seconds.</figcaption></figure><p>Result in under 60 seconds:<br />→ Analyzed content from 8 diverse sources<br />→ Identified 5 recurring trends with specific citations <br />→ Detected contradictions between sources<br />→ Suggested connections my manual analysis missed<br />→ Success rate: 90%+ reliability</p><p>This was <em>significantly superior</em> to AI’s performance on sequential tasks like booking flights or shopping.</p><p><strong>The Strategic Insight:</strong> AI excels at parallel information processing, not sequential task execution. Framework for teams: Build AI features around analysis and synthesis <em>first</em>. Save execution automation for later iterations when reliability improves.</p><h3>Day 10: Two AIs started talking to each other — without integration</h3><p>The most surprising discovery wasn’t about Comet itself — it was about how AI systems can work together without explicit integration.</p><p>What happened: I asked Perplexity to analyze my travel spending from Gmail. When I switched to Gmail to verify results, Comet Assistant was immediately contextually aware of my travel expense research.</p><p>No API integration required. Both systems maintained “intention persistence” — understanding my underlying goal across platform transitions.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BGEhBQVOqO5HBCy_KYWH6g.png"" /><figcaption>Distributed AI systems collaborating through shared intention context without technical integration.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Critical validation:</strong> Distributed AI collaboration can feel more seamless than monolithic systems. Users benefit from specialized intelligences working together rather than one system attempting everything.</p><h3>Day 12: When delegation actually works</h3><p>By the end of week two, I decided to test Comet with a real-world, high-stakes scenario: planning my daughters’ 11th birthday party. The constraint? They’re celiac, and I needed to shop at Mercadona, a Spanish supermarket.</p><p>My query: “I need to prepare a birthday party for my 11-year-old daughters who are celiac. Help me create a shopping list for Mercadona with all categories: bread, cookies, cakes, candies, and ice cream.”</p><figure><img alt=""Mercadona online store in Comet browser showing initial product search results with AI sidebar providing contextual shopping assistance for gluten-free products suitable for children’s parties"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wj0VeCCdKHIzRjh612c8mA.png"" /><figcaption>Mercadona online store in Comet browser showing initial product search results with AI sidebar providing contextual shopping assistance for gluten-free products suitable for children’s parties.</figcaption></figure><p>What happened next demonstrated the difference between AI that responds and AI that collaborates.</p><p>Instead of dumping a generic list, Comet’s assistant:<br />1. <strong>Understood the constraint</strong> (gluten-free requirement)<br />2. <strong>Maintained context</strong> across multiple product categories<br />3. <strong>Verified availability</strong> in the specific store<br />4. <strong>Built incrementally</strong>, category by category with my approval<br />5. <strong>Executed the outcome</strong>, adding items to my actual cart</p><figure><img alt=""Comet AI organizing gluten-free products by category (snacks, candies, cookies) with real-time availability verification and stepwise user approval"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nNUGK2A9WrVKUNC5y5HmdA.png"" /><figcaption>Comet AI organizing gluten-free products by category (snacks, candies, cookies) with real-time availability verification and stepwise user approval.</figcaption></figure><p>The breakthrough wasn’t speed — it was <strong>control</strong>. At each stage, I could see what the AI was selecting and why. When it found bread options, it explained the selection. When moving to cookies, it remembered the celiac constraint without being reminded.</p><figure><img alt=""Completed Mercadona shopping cart populated by AI assistant with gluten-free birthday party items across all requested categories, totaling €31.32 after stepwise user approval process demonstrating successful task delegation"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pfiIj4bHeRHxx8jONJI1ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>Completed Mercadona shopping cart populated by AI assistant with gluten-free birthday party items across all requested categories, totaling €31.32 after stepwise user approval process demonstrating successful task delegation.</figcaption></figure><p>This is what genuine delegation looks like: I specified the goal, the AI orchestrated the execution, and I maintained meaningful oversight throughout.</p><p><strong>Success rate for this complex, multi-step task: 95%</strong></p><p>The 5% gap? One item suggestion wasn’t available in my postal code, but the AI caught this and offered alternatives before I even clicked checkout.</p><p>This experience crystallized the difference between intention-based and navigation-based interfaces:</p><p><strong>Traditional approach would require:</strong><br />- Manually searching each category<br />- Verifying each product is gluten-free<br />- Cross-referencing availability<br />- Remembering what you already added<br />- 30–45 minutes of active work</p><p><strong>Delegation approach:</strong><br />- Single natural language goal<br />- AI handles research and verification<br />- Stepwise approval of selections<br />- 5 minutes of oversight, 10 minutes of AI work</p><p><strong>Critical insight: Users will tolerate AI reliability issues if they maintain control over outcomes.</strong></p><h3>When the magic broke: Understanding AI failure modes</h3><p>Documenting failures is as important as celebrating successes. But after two weeks of testing, I learned that not all failures are equal — and the distinction matters for design.</p><h4>When AI admits its limits (the good kind of failure)</h4><p>I asked Comet to find hotels in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park, budget under $200/night for October dates.</p><figure><img alt=""Booking.com hotel search interface in Comet browser with natural language query specifying downtown Manhattan location near Central Park with $200 per night maximum budget constraint for October dates"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TFmmb3pyyaTQCEp82wuNXg.png"" /><figcaption>Hotel search in Comet with explicit constraints: downtown Manhattan, walking distance of Central Park, under $200/night.</figcaption></figure><p>After processing multiple sources, it returned results significantly above my budget — but with crucial transparency:</p><figure><img alt=""Comet browser showing Booking.com hotel search results with transparent failure communication, displaying available Manhattan hotels priced at $463-$1,882 while explaining that no properties meet the $200 budget constraint and offering alternative search parameters"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KmKY4a-4WdIhblrVEmPvqw.png"" /><figcaption>Comet displaying search results with transparent communication about constraint limitations, showing available hotels above budget while explaining why and offering alternatives.</figcaption></figure><p>The AI didn’t fail silently. It acknowledged my constraints, searched comprehensively, and honestly communicated the reality: “There are currently no hotels available in downtown Manhattan within walking distance of Central Park for under $200/night on Booking.com for your dates. Most available properties in this area range from $400-$2,000/night.”</p><p>Then it offered alternatives: expand search radius, adjust budget, or try different dates.</p><p>This is <strong>transparent failure</strong> — the system attempted to fulfill my intention, couldn’t, and explained why with actionable options. Crucially, user trust remains intact because the AI showed its reasoning.</p><h4>When AI fails silently (the dangerous kind)</h4><p>Real trust destroyers look different. These are failures where AI confidently delivers wrong results without signaling uncertainty:</p><p><strong>Silent execution failures I documented:</strong><br />- Grocery queries returning “cilantro seeds” instead of “fresh cilantro”<br />- Flight bookings with incorrect date interpretations<br />- Multi-constraint searches that quietly ignore specific criteria<br />- Location parameters that get deprioritized without explanation</p><p>The pattern: AI appears confident while being incorrect. No warning signals. No acknowledgment of limitations. Just wrong results presented as right ones.</p><p><strong>The design implication:</strong> AI systems must distinguish between “I can’t fulfill this request” and “I fulfilled this request incorrectly.”</p><p>The first builds trust through honesty and explanation. <br />The second destroys trust through false confidence.</p><p>For UX designers: Design for graceful failure acknowledgment, not just graceful success paths. The quality of your error states determines long-term user trust more than the quality of your success states.</p><h4>Performance and security considerations</h4><p>Beyond functional reliability, Comet faces technical challenges that affect real-world viability:</p><p><strong>Performance: </strong>Noticeably slower than Chrome for basic browsing tasks, particularly on initial page loads and when processing multiple tabs simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Security:</strong> <a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave researchers documented prompt injection vulnerabilities</a> in Comet’s architecture, revealing attack vectors unique to AI-native browsers that traditional security models don’t address. As AI becomes infrastructure rather than feature, new security paradigms become necessary.</p><p>These aren’t dealbreakers — they’re growing pains of a new category. But they’re important context for teams considering similar architectures.</p><h3>The new metrics you need to track</h3><p>Traditional engagement metrics miss the fundamental shift. In AI-native interfaces, success depends on the system, not the user. Track these instead:</p><ul><li><strong>Intention success rate</strong>: Does the user’s goal get accomplished?</li><li><strong>Delegation trust index</strong>: How quickly users trust AI with different tasks</li><li><strong>Intention continuity rate</strong>: How well user intent persists across platform transitions</li></ul><h3>The threshold that will reshape everything</h3><p>Based on systematic analysis: <strong>Traditional navigation interfaces will feel cognitively primitive to users who have experienced genuine delegation — the question isn’t if, but how quickly this threshold is reached.</strong></p><p><strong>Supporting evidence</strong>: Users adapt to intention-based paradigms within days, but current AI can only reliably deliver on those intentions 60–70% of the time. This creates a unique design challenge — bridging transformed user expectations with current technological limitations.</p><p><strong>Industry implication:</strong> Companies should focus on AI interoperability and intention continuity rather than building comprehensive AI monoliths. The competitive advantage lies in orchestrating collaborative AI ecosystems, not singular super-systems.</p><h4>What changes Monday morning</h4><p><strong>→ Start with synthesis, not automation</strong><br />Build AI features around information processing first</p><p><strong>→ Map intention flows, not user flows </strong><br />Design for delegation, with traditional navigation as fallback</p><p><strong>→ Design trust incrementally</strong><br />Prove reliability in low-stakes scenarios first</p><p><strong>→ Build graceful degradation</strong><br />Clear pathways back when AI fails</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Comet represents the first complete empirical validation of theoretical AI UX principles. More importantly, it revealed that the future lies not in monolithic AI systems, but in specialized services collaborating to create unified user experiences.</p><p><strong>For UX designers:</strong> The shift from navigation to intention is operational, not theoretical. Start designing intention flows that span multiple AI systems.</p><p><strong>For product managers:</strong> “Intention Continuity Rate” may be more predictive of success than traditional engagement metrics.</p><p><strong>For the industry:</strong> Early implementation of ecosystem-level AI collaboration provides competitive advantage over isolated AI features.</p><p>The paradigm shift is happening whether our technology is ready or not. The question isn’t whether to participate — it’s whether you’ll lead the transition or follow it.</p><h4><strong>References and further reading:</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.perplexity.ai/comet"">Perplexity Comet Browser</a><br /><a href=""https://brave.com/blog/comet-prompt-injection/"">Brave Security Research: Agentic Browser Security</a><br /><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mental-models/"">Mental Models in UX Design — Nielsen Norman Group</a><br /><a href=""https://www.starburst.io/blog/parallel-vs-sequential-processing/"">Parallel vs Sequential Processing in Computing</a><br /><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06322v1"">Multi-Agent Collaboration Mechanisms in AI</a><br /><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266730532300056X"">Distributed AI Systems: Taxonomy and Framework</a><br /><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/human-computer-interaction"">Human-Computer Interaction Design Principles</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d7a702529a4a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/what-perplexitys-ai-browser-reveals-about-ux-s-future-d7a702529a4a"">What Perplexity’s AI browser reveals about UX’s future</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
