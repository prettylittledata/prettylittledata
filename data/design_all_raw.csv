<h4>AI coding tools are rewriting who gets to make software. The question isn’t whether that’s good. It’s what it does to the things we use every day.</h4><p>In 2023, a controlled study found that developers using GitHub Copilot completed a coding task <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590"">55% faster</a> than those without it. That’s your 4-week sprint becoming a 2-week sprint.</p><p>By 2025, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/a-quarter-of-startups-in-ycs-current-cohort-have-codebases-that-are-almost-entirely-ai-generated/"">25% of Y Combinator’s Winter batch</a> had codebases that were 95% AI-generated. Collins Dictionary named “vibe coding” its <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/06/vibe-coding-collins-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025"">2025 Word of the Year</a>. The <a href=""https://www.secondtalent.com/resources/ai-coding-assistant-statistics/"">AI code generation market</a> hit $4.91 billion.</p><p>Thanks for reading Built for People! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p><p>A UX designer in an academic study said it best: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“What used to take me hours, I can now do in two minutes with AI.”</a></p><p>Everyone celebrated the democratisation of software. And rightly so. But here’s the thing nobody’s spending enough time on: <strong>the constraints that made software expensive also shaped the experience of using it.</strong></p><p>Remove the constraint, and you don’t just get faster software. You get <em>more</em> software. The question is whether more is better — or just more.</p><h3>The old world: when software was precious</h3><p>Let me paint you a picture of product management in 2021.</p><p>You’re a PM at a fintech. You have 6 engineers. US-based senior developers cost <a href=""https://stssoftware.com/blog/software-development-hourly-rates/"">$150–$200 per hour</a>, and when you factor in benefits, recruitment, and overhead, the true cost of a fully employed engineer runs roughly <a href=""https://neontri.com/blog/software-development-costs/"">2.7x their base salary</a>.</p><p>Every sprint is a zero-sum game. Every feature you build means something else you don’t.</p><p>The ritual goes like this: spend 3 days writing a PRD nobody fully reads. Two design review cycles. A stakeholder alignment meeting. At least one “can we push this to next quarter?” Get engineering estimates that are optimistic by 40%. Build anyway. Ship late. Celebrate like you conquered something.</p><p>The process was slow and annoying. But it had a hidden benefit: <strong>it was a quality filter.</strong></p><p>The pain of getting anything built meant only things worth building got built. Everything had to survive interrogation. ROI calculations. Stakeholder scepticism. Engineering capacity constraints.</p><p>Internal tooling? Almost never.</p><p>At Wise, a globally scaled fintech where I worked back then, building tools for operations teams was notoriously difficult — not because it was technically hard, but because engineering resources were too scarce to point at anything that didn’t directly move a customer-facing metric.</p><p>The ops team needed a custom dashboard? Great idea. Back of the queue behind the 11 customer-facing features committed in Q1.</p><p>Software was expensive, so you built less and built it well.</p><figure><img alt=""GIF of the jealous girlfriend"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/962/0*gKXmYpyUHmNA9ft1.png"" /></figure><h3>Enter the Vibe coders</h3><p>In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy — former head of AI at Tesla, co-founder of OpenAI — coined the term “<a href=""https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383"">vibe coding</a>.” Describe what you want in plain English. Let the AI write the code. Don’t even look at it (although you should).</p><p>A Meta PM named Zevi Arnovitz, who described himself as someone who finds code “terrifying,” told <a href=""https://lennysvault.com/insights/leadership-perspectives/11e6d6b8-1ca7-4fca-b5f8-bd735cfaf8e3"">Lenny’s Podcast</a> that AI coding tools felt like being handed “superpowers.” He rebuilt his entire workflow using Cursor and Claude — no engineering background, shipping features independently.</p><p>Figma CEO Dylan Field noted that designers, engineers, PMs, and researchers were all starting to <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/figma-ceo-job-titles-merging-everyone-product-builder-2025-10"">“dip their toe into other roles.”</a> The walls between disciplines were dissolving.</p><p>Meanwhile, one designer summarised what this felt like in practice: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“From ideas in my head to ideas I can see. It’s like having a thought partner to explore, learn, and debug with.”</a></p><p>If software used to be an expensive, scarce resource, it just became abundant and cheap.</p><p>So what happens to the user experience when the cost of building drops to near zero?</p><h3>The Michelin-Star problem</h3><p>Here’s the mental model that changed how I think about this.</p><p>Every great chef will tell you the same thing: the hardest part isn’t cooking. It’s deciding what <em>not</em> to put on the plate.</p><p>Joël Robuchon — the most Michelin-starred chef in history with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%ABl_Robuchon"">32 stars at his peak</a> — was famous for a dish of three ingredients, plated so precisely the kitchen would redo it if a garnish sat one millimetre off.</p><p>Compare that to a diner with a laminated 200-item menu. More options. Worse food. The menu isn’t generous — it’s just unedited.</p><p>When building is expensive, you’re forced to be Robuchon. When building is free, the temptation is to become the diner.</p><p>The constraint wasn’t just slowing you down. It was making you good.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EI5NQvmuq4Bab_fl.png"" /></figure><h3>What cheap software actually unlocks</h3><p>Let’s start with the upside, because it’s genuinely massive — and it’s not where most people are looking.</p><p><strong>1. The internal tools revolution.</strong></p><p>Remember the Wise ops team? That dashboard request that died in the backlog — not because it was bad, but because a senior engineer costs <a href=""https://stssoftware.com/blog/software-development-hourly-rates/"">$150–$200 an hour</a> and the dashboard couldn’t compete for sprint slots against customer-facing features?</p><p>Today, that ops manager can build it in an afternoon using <a href=""https://www.getproductpeople.com/blog/introduction-to-vibe-coding-for-product-managers-from-idea-to-mvp"">Lovable, Bolt, or v0.dev</a>. No sprint slot. No ROI calculation. No stakeholder approval. Done.</p><p>Software stopped being a bottleneck for operational efficiency. The internal tools that lived in PowerPoint decks for years are becoming real. And this is happening in a context where the quality bar is naturally lower, the stakes of failure are contained, and users are forgiving colleagues. Perfect fit.</p><p><strong>2. Prototyping goes from days to minutes.</strong></p><p>This is the one designers should care about most.</p><p>A <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">study of 20 UX professionals</a> published in 2025 found that vibe coding fundamentally changed how designers test ideas. Instead of spending days building a static mockup in Figma, they were generating working prototypes in minutes — complete with real interactions, real data flows, and real feedback loops.</p><p>One participant described it as overcoming <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">“whiteboard fear”</a> — the paralysis of starting from a blank canvas. AI gave them a starting point they could refine instead of a void they had to fill.</p><p>Product designer Kshitij Agrawal summarised the shift perfectly: <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/vibe-coding-vibe-design"">“Mockups existed because coding was difficult. Now that coding is easy, the future is prototypes.”</a></p><p>Think about what that means for UX research. Instead of testing a static Figma flow and asking users to imagine how it would work, you can test <em>the actual thing</em>. The feedback is richer. The iteration is faster. The gap between what you designed and what users experience collapses.</p><p><strong>3. The designer-developer wall dissolves.</strong></p><p>Smashing Magazine described the new paradigm: designers are becoming <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2025/09/intent-prototyping-pure-vibe-coding-enterprise-ux/"">“design engineers”</a>, using AI tools to add not just visual styles but basic functionality to UI components — without programming skills. The deliverable is changing from a spec document to an actual working element.</p><p>For the first time, the person who understands the user can also build the thing. That’s a powerful loop.</p><figure><img alt=""Workflow illusration"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rpOR0_XSJxvOO1yk.png"" /></figure><h3>But here’s what happens to the user experience</h3><p>All of this speed is extraordinary. The risk isn’t that the tools are bad. It’s that they make it trivially easy to build things that shouldn’t exist.</p><p><strong>The pixel-perfect trap.</strong></p><p>A UI/UX designer at agency COAX described the core problem: <a href=""https://coaxsoft.com/blog/whats-wrong-with-vibe-coding"">“An AI-generated form looked perfect in Figma but failed basic usability tests. It had no validation, poor error states, and confusing navigation.”</a></p><p>This is the signature failure mode of AI-generated interfaces. They look polished — beautiful layouts, consistent spacing, professional typography. But they’re missing the invisible layer that makes software <em>work</em>: error handling, edge cases, loading states, accessibility, and the dozens of micro-decisions that come from actually watching someone use the thing.</p><p>AI builds from patterns. It doesn’t build from empathy.</p><p><strong>The Spotify problem.</strong></p><p>You don;’t need a history lesson to see what unconstrained feature-building does to a product. Just open Spotify.</p><p>It launched as a music app. One job, done brilliantly. Then it added podcasts, audiobooks, AI playlists, AI-generated music, social features, TikTok-style video clips, and a live events marketplace. Each addition made strategic sense in isolation. Together, they turned a music player into something users increasingly describe as <a href=""https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social-Random/Spotify-s-UI-Needs-a-Redesign-It-s-Cluttered-Messy-and/td-p/6690860"">cluttered and confusing</a>.</p><p>The Spotify Community forums read like a UX case study in what happens when “can we build it?” replaces “should we?” One user in <a href=""https://community.spotify.com/t5/Social-Random/App-Interface-is-Entirely-Broken/td-p/6650155"">another thread</a> put it plainly: “I will never use the audiobooks features. I will never use the podcasts features. I only care about music. Making your app more confusing in hopes that I stumble upon an audiobook or podcast is incomprehensibly stupid.”</p><p>Spotify added audiobooks partly because of a<a href=""https://www.howtogeek.com/apps-everyones-complaining-about-2025/""> 2022 legal settlement</a> allowed bundled services to pay lower royalties to musicians. The feature wasn’t built for users. It was built for the business model. Users got a more cluttered app as a side effect.</p><figure><img alt=""Spotify over time"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*J1dvZjUVvjpu22hT.png"" /></figure><p>Spotify evolution over time</p><p>This is the Evernote trajectory in real time. (Evernote pulled the same move a decade ago — expanded from notes into business cards, presentations, work chat, and eventually <a href=""https://iamreliable.com/the-system-that-failed-evernotes-growth/"">a marketplace selling socks and backpacks</a>. Downloads <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/what-happened-to-evernote/"">collapsed 82%</a>. Its new owners spent their first year stripping features to return to basics.)</p><figure><img alt=""Evernote downloads vs new features"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*MUjgyOiNwo2bogBH.png"" /></figure><p>And neither company even had AI coding tools. Every feature they added required real engineering time. Imagine what happens when adding a feature costs nothing.</p><h3>The state of UX saw this coming</h3><p>The <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective’s State of UX 2025</a> diagnosed the moment with uncomfortable clarity.</p><p>Their observation: teams are <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">“optimizing flows for clicks, not clarity”</a> and have <a href=""https://trends.uxdesign.cc"">“stopped building tools and started building engagement traps.”</a> Designers are spending their days in stakeholder alignment meetings rather than doing design work. Products get launched because someone needs a promotion. Timelines are built around performance reviews.</p><p>They described an industry that was already drifting toward feature bloat <em>before</em> AI made building free. Add vibe coding to this culture, and the incentive to ship more — without asking whether more is better — only intensifies.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-reset-2025/"">NN Group’s UX Reckoning piece</a> put the positive frame on it: this is the moment where curated taste, research-informed judgment, and critical thinking become the differentiating skills. Not because they’re trendy — but because they’re the things AI genuinely can’t do.</p><p>Jakob Nielsen himself noted that by Q3 2025, <a href=""https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ux-roundup-20251222"">“the era of pixel-pushing had effectively ended for commercial production”</a> — tools like Figma AI and v0 could generate high-fidelity UI from text prompts. But he also observed that this made UX <em>more</em> important, not less: someone still needs to decide what to build, for whom, and why.</p><h3>Who wins. Who loses.</h3><p>The loser is any team whose answer to “can we build it?” is always “yes.” The Evernote trajectory awaits.</p><p>The winner is any team that uses the speed for the right things — rapid prototyping, internal tooling, faster research loops — while maintaining the discipline to ask, for every customer-facing feature: <em>does this respect the user’s attention?</em></p><p>The <a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.10652v1"">academic study of UX professionals</a> found exactly this tension. They called it the gap between “intending the right design” (using AI to build faster) and “designing the right intention” (knowing what to build in the first place). Speed only helps if you’ve already answered the second question.</p><p>There’s an old product design saying that’s about to become the most important sentence in every team’s vocabulary: <strong>the best feature is the one you decide not to build.</strong></p><h3>The opportunity</h3><p>Product management and UX design have always had an awkward relationship with engineering constraints. Those constraints were frustrating. They were also making you better.</p><p>Now the constraint is gone. So the designer, the PM, the researcher — they need to become the new constraint.</p><p>Not by slowing things down. By using the speed for prototyping, testing, and internal tools — and holding the line on what ships to users.</p><p>For the first time, the person closest to the user can also build the prototype, test it with real people, and iterate in hours instead of weeks. The designer doesn’t need to wait for engineering. The PM doesn’t need to write a spec and hope it gets interpreted correctly. The researcher can go from insight to testable prototype in an afternoon.</p><p>This is a great opportunity, but only if the industry resists the temptation to treat speed as the goal rather than the tool. <strong>When building is cheap, restraint becomes the most valuable thing a team can practise.</strong></p><p>The teams that figure this out will build the next generation of things people actually love.</p><p>The rest will spend the next decade undoing what they built this year.</p><p>Thanks for reading Built for People!

Here’s the full, unfiltered story of who’s building the future, what’s working, what’s failing, and what it all means.</p><h3>The vibe coding uprising</h3><p>In February 2025, AI pioneer Andrej Karpathy coined a phrase that sent shockwaves through software communities worldwide: “vibe coding.” He described it as “fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists.” At the time, many professional developers rolled their eyes. Six months later, they were using it themselves.</p><p>The term captured something genuinely unprecedented: a new generation of tools that let anyone — designers, marketers, founders, students — describe an app in plain English and watch it get built in real time. No compiler knowledge. No debugging in terminals. No Stack Overflow. Just a conversation with a machine that builds things.</p><p>What happened next defied almost every prediction.

The fastest-growing platform in the space. <br /><strong>$200M ARR</strong> — targeting $1B by summer 2026</p><h4><strong>Cursor</strong> — Dev power tool</h4><p>Made by Anysphere. VS Code-based AI code editor — the choice for professional developers. Supports Claude, GPT-4, and other models. Produces production-grade code with proper architecture. Required technical knowledge but unmatched depth. Valued at $9.9B. <br /><strong>$500M+ ARR</strong> — 2 years to get there</p><h4><strong>Bolt.new</strong> — Speed demon</h4><p>Browser-based. Zero setup. Type what you want, get a shareable URL in under 30 minutes — the fastest time-to-demo of any platform. Built on StackBlitz. Powered by Supabase backend. Best for hackathon prototypes and quick experiments, but code quality degrades over iterations.<br /><strong>Fast-growing</strong> — $100M+ ARR threshold crossed</p><h4><strong>Replit</strong> — Full environment</h4><p>The cloud IDE with an embedded AI Agent. Educator-favored. Strong for collaborative team environments. Built-in databases, deployment, and real-time multiplayer coding. Most powerful “middle ground” platform — too complex for pure beginners but excellent for learning developers and startup teams.<br /><strong>$10M → $100M ARR</strong> — in under 9 months</p><h4><strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> — Enterprise standard</h4><p>Microsoft’s flagship. Integrates into VS Code, JetBrains, and more. The largest user base of any AI coding tool. 82% of developers surveyed use it — the default entry point for enterprise teams. Code completion and inline suggestions rather than full app generation. $10–39/month.<br /><strong>$1B+ ARR</strong> — market leader by user count</p><h4><strong>Claude Code</strong> — Terminal agent</h4><p>Anthropic’s command-line AI engineer. Deep code understanding, multi-file reasoning, and agentic task execution. CB Insights named it the “runaway market leader” among LLM providers for pure coding use cases. For developers who want maximum intelligence with full control. Crossed $1B ARR.<br /><strong>$1B+ ARR</strong> — top 3 market position</p><h4><strong>Windsurf</strong> — Acquired by OpenAI</h4><p>Formerly Codeium. IDE-based with deep code understanding and agentic “flow” mode. Highest code quality scores in independent benchmarks (8.5/10). Acquired by OpenAI for $3 billion in May 2025 — the biggest statement yet about where AI coding is heading.<br /><strong>$3B acquisition</strong> — by OpenAI · May 2025</p><h4><strong>v0 by Vercel</strong> — UI specialist</h4><p>Vercel’s AI-powered UI generator. Highest quality score in benchmarks (9/10). Specializes in component and UI generation using React + shadcn/ui. Not a full app builder but the best tool if you want beautiful, production-quality front-end components fast. Free tier available.<br /><strong>Free + pro tiers</strong> — part of Vercel ecosystem</p><blockquote>“A year ago, they would have built their product from scratch. <br />But now 95% of it is built by an AI. You don’t need a team of 50 <br />engineers anymore. Companies are reaching $10 million in revenue with <br />teams of less than 10.” - Garry Tan, CEO, Y Combinator, March 2025</blockquote><h3>Who is actually using these tools?</h3><p>The data paints a picture that surprises most people. This isn’t just developers upgrading their workflow. The user base of AI coding platforms is fundamentally different from what the software world has ever seen before.</p><figure><img alt=""Developer adoption by segment — 2025 SegmentAdoptionEnterprise devs97%Full-stack devs90%Startup founders85%Frontend devs82%Non-technical47%Backend devs35%"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wf-P4Ygqa9AEq5huJcdSdQ.png"" /><figcaption>(Source: <a href=""https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai/"">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Three distinct tribes are using these tools, each for very different reasons:</p><h4>Tribe 1: The non-technical founder</h4><p>The biggest story of the AI coding era isn’t that developers got faster — it’s that the definition of “developer” has exploded. 47% of people now applying AI to coding do so for work or school, and 41% use it for personal projects, according to Menlo Ventures’ 2025 State of Consumer AI report. These are designers, product managers, marketers, and domain experts who previously needed to hire engineers to build their ideas. With Lovable or Bolt, they don’t anymore.</p><p>Gartner predicts 70% of new applications will be built outside traditional IT departments by end of 2025. That is happening. Real estate agents are building property management tools. Teachers are building grading apps. Small business owners are building custom CRMs. The phrase you see repeated constantly in community forums:</p><blockquote>“Lovable figured out what to build when I couldn’t.”</blockquote><h4>Tribe 2: The technical Startup Founder</h4><p>This is the group that surprised everyone — including YC. These aren’t non-technical people using AI because they have no choice. They’re highly skilled engineers using AI because it’s <em>dramatically faster</em>. The YC Winter 2025 data is stunning: 25% of startups with 95% AI-generated code were <strong>fully capable</strong> of writing that code manually. They chose not to. This cohort grew at 10% per week collectively — the fastest-growing YC batch ever recorded. Companies in this wave are reaching $10M revenue with teams of fewer than 10 people.</p><h4>Tribe 3: The enterprise developer</h4><p>The 63% of the market held by large enterprises is quieter but massive. GitHub Copilot integration into existing IDE workflows. Amazon CodeWhisperer for AWS shops. Internal deployment of fine-tuned models for regulated industries. These teams aren’t vibe coding — they’re using AI for code review, documentation, test generation, and completing specific functions. 61% of mid-to-large U.S. software enterprises have integrated AI pair-programming into their CI/CD pipelines as of 2025.</p><h4>Sector distribution — who uses it</h4><ul><li><strong>Saas products</strong> — 34%</li><li><strong>Fintech</strong> — 21%</li><li><strong>Healthtech</strong> — 15%</li><li><strong>E-commerce</strong> — 13%</li><li><strong>Other (Education / Government / Misc.)</strong> — 17%</li></ul><h3>The real problems nobody talks about</h3><p>Every platform announcement shows beautiful demos. Every founder testimonial is glowing. But spend enough time in the trenches — building 47 applications across these tools as one reviewer did — and a very different picture emerges. Here are the seven critical issues users face globally, backed by real research:</p><h4><strong>01<br />Security holes</strong></h4><p>A May 2025 study found 170 of 1,645 Lovable-built apps exposed personal user data. Guardio Labs discovered “VibeScamming” — attackers can inject malicious prompts that cause AI to generate backdoors. No platform auto-audits for security. Human review is non-negotiable for production apps.</p><h4><strong>02<br />Code degrades over time</strong></h4><p>Multiple independent studies confirm: the 50th prompt produces measurably worse code than the 5th. As projects grow, AI-generated code becomes inconsistent and difficult to maintain. The context window fills up, patterns break down, and the codebase becomes something “nobody fully understands.”</p><h4><strong>03<br />The perception gap</strong></h4><p>The July 2025 METR study stunned the industry: experienced developers using AI tools took 19% longer on complex tasks despite feeling 20% faster. The illusion of speed is real. Code appears fast — but debugging AI output, understanding what was generated, and fixing mistakes eats the time saved.</p><h4><strong>04<br />Runway token costs</strong></h4><p>Consumption-based pricing is wildly unpredictable during iterative debugging. Bolt.new users have burned 2+ million tokens fixing a single bug. Some spent over $1,000 on a single project. Replit Agent credit depletion during active iteration regularly shocks users. There’s no cost ceiling.</p><h4><strong>05<br />Compliance blind spots</strong></h4><p>For regulated industries — finance, healthcare, government — none of these platforms meet production compliance requirements. No SOC2. No HIPAA-ready default configurations. No audit trails. All platforms are explicitly prototyping tools. Trying to ship to production without human review in these sectors is genuinely dangerous.</p><h4><strong>06<br />Vendor lock-in</strong></h4><p>Bolt.new and Replit make migration painful. Your project becomes deeply tied to their infrastructure. v0 and Lovable are easiest to migrate away from. For startups choosing these platforms, the exit strategy is rarely considered upfront — and becomes a serious problem at scale.</p><h4><strong>07<br />The almost “ right “ frustration</strong></h4><p>Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey found that 66% of developers’ biggest AI frustration is “solutions that are almost right but not quite.” This near-miss problem is uniquely maddening: the AI produces something that looks correct, passes casual inspection, but breaks at the edges. Debugging this is a new cognitive skill entirely.</p><h4><strong>08<br />Technical debit explosion</strong></h4><p>AI-assisted coding leads to 4x more code cloning, increasing maintenance effort over time. Google’s 2024 DORA report found AI use caused a 7.2% drop in delivery stability. 62.4% of developers cite technical debt as their top frustration — and AI is accelerating its accumulation for teams without strong review practices.</p><h4><strong>09<br />No real production-ready code</strong></h4><p>Every benchmark study reaches the same conclusion: no AI coding platform produces code you can ship to production without significant manual finishing. The speed gains are genuine for prototypes. But the quality gap is equally real for anything that needs to last beyond a demo.</p><h3>AI coding vs. Manual coding: The real comparison</h3><p>The debate “AI vs. human coding” misframes the reality. The better question is: for what tasks, for what users, at what stage does AI coding deliver genuine value — and where does it create hidden costs?</p><h4>Time to first prototype</h4><p><strong>AI Coding platforms</strong><br />Applications can be generated in 28–45 minutes. These tools provide dramatic gains for non-technical founders and small teams seeking rapid validation.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Initial builds typically take hours to days depending on architecture, complexity, and stack decisions.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI platforms provide a significant advantage in early-stage prototyping and rapid iteration.</p><h4>Code quality (Simple applications)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Generally sufficient for MVPs and demos. Generated code is functional and often built on consistent starter stacks.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Quality depends entirely on developer skill level. Strong engineers can produce clean, extensible foundations from the start.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> For straightforward applications, AI-generated code is often adequate.</p><h4>Code quality (Complex systems)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Code quality degrades over time. As projects expand, inconsistencies increase, architectural patterns fragment, and maintainability becomes challenging.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Architectural integrity is intentionally designed and maintained. Technical decisions are deliberate and aligned with long-term system goals.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> For complex or long-lived systems, manual engineering maintains structural coherence more effectively.</p><h4>Security</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Elevated vulnerability risk without manual auditing. Prompt injection risks and insecure defaults require active oversight.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Security patterns are applied intentionally through training, experience, and established review processes.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Production-grade security still requires human review regardless of AI assistance.</p><h4>Speed (Senior developers)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Studies indicate experienced developers may take longer on complex tasks when using AI tools, despite a perception of increased speed.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Expert engineers often move faster on nuanced architectural and system-level decisions.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI accelerates repetitive tasks but does not consistently outperform experienced developers on sophisticated work.</p><h4>Speed (Junior developers and non-technical users)</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Documented productivity gains of approximately 26% in certain studies. Enables non-coders to build functional applications.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Requires months or years of training to achieve similar output.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI significantly lowers the barrier to entry.</p><h4>Cost</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Subscription pricing combined with unpredictable token consumption. Costs can spike significantly during debugging cycles.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Fixed salary costs. High per-hour expense but predictable for planning purposes.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI lowers upfront cost but introduces variability.</p><h4>Startup viability</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Small teams can achieve meaningful revenue milestones with minimal engineering headcount. Rapid iteration supports aggressive growth experimentation.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Requires larger teams to reach similar output velocity.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> AI creates leverage in early-stage startups.</p><h4>Scalability</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Production systems often require significant refactoring. AI-generated code rarely scales without human rework.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Systems can be designed for scale from inception when architected by experienced engineers.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Scalability depends heavily on human oversight.</p><h4>Learning and understanding</h4><p><strong>AI coding platforms</strong><br />Risk of using code that developers do not fully understand. May create “black box” dependencies.</p><p><strong>Manual human coding</strong><br />Deep understanding compounds over time. Knowledge of system components strengthens architectural decision-making.</p><p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Long-term technical mastery requires active engagement beyond generated output.</p><p>AI coding platforms are powerful acceleration tools. They are highly effective for prototyping, validation, and enabling non-technical creators. However, long-term system stability, security, architectural integrity, and scalability still rely heavily on human engineering judgment.</p><p>The strategic question is not whether AI replaces developers. It is where AI meaningfully augments them — and where human expertise remains indispensable.</p><blockquote>The verdict isn’t simple. “AI tools are genuinely transformative for prototyping, validation, and non-technical builders”. They’re genuinely problematic for production systems without human oversight. The “right” answer depends entirely on your position in the product lifecycle and your risk tolerance.</blockquote><h3>Where the money is: Market data</h3><figure><img alt=""Bar chart titled “Platform Revenue Race — 2025 ARR Estimates (CB Insights)” showing GitHub Copilot and Claude Code at $1B+, Cursor at $500M+, Lovable at $200M, Replit at $100M, and Bolt.new at $100M+.Market Data"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IuBZj12TfpG3JwVESJ4Geg.png"" /></figure><p>The total AI coding market is on a trajectory that analysts estimate will reach $99 billion by 2034. The combined equity funding raised by players in this space already exceeded $5.2 billion in 2025 alone — more than double the $2 billion raised the year before. Over 60 mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships occurred in the AI developer tools ecosystem in 2024–2025. This is not a niche software category anymore. It is a platform war <em>(Source: </em><a href=""https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-software-development-market-map/""><strong><em>CB Insights Market Map</em></strong></a><em>)</em></p><p>Geography matters too: North America holds 43% of the current market but Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing region at a 27.4% CAGR. India, particularly, is seeing explosive growth in AI-assisted development across both enterprise adoption and startup formation. The IT and telecommunications sector leads usage at 29.4% of the market — but banking and financial services (BFSI) is the fastest-growing vertical at 28.13% CAGR.</p><h3>The human truth at the core</h3><p>Here is the thing that gets buried under all the revenue numbers and platform wars: every AI coding platform in existence was built by humans. Trained by humans. Fed data by humans. Evaluated by humans. Corrected by humans. The “intelligence” that pops out a React app from a text prompt is the crystallized output of millions of hours of human code written by developers over decades, scraped from GitHub repositories, Stack Overflow answers, documentation pages, and technical blogs.</p><p>This isn’t a criticism — it’s a clarification. The AI doesn’t “know” how to build software the way a senior engineer knows. It pattern-matches. It predicts what code should follow the tokens you gave it, based on what it saw in training.</p><p>That is why it fails in ways that feel eerily specific: it produces code that looks correct but has subtle logical errors. It follows conventions without understanding the reasoning behind them. It solves problems it’s seen before brilliantly; it stumbles on genuinely novel architectural challenges.</p><figure><img alt=""Dark-themed code snippet explaining how AI generates code: tokenize prompt, attend to context, predict next tokens, repeat — while noting it doesn’t truly understand business logic; ends with returning “code that looks right” plus hidden complexity.71% of developers say they do not merge AI-generated code without manual review."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yie8x0iI5YhOxWPXYB1Khg.png"" /></figure><p>This is why the most dangerous users of AI coding platforms are the ones who trust them completely. The safest users are those who treat AI output the way a senior developer treats a junior developer’s pull request: read it carefully, understand it fully, question its assumptions, test its edge cases, and only then merge it.</p><p><strong>71% of developers say they do not merge AI-generated code without manual review. </strong>That number should be 100%. The 29% who skip review are accumulating technical debt faster than they realize, in a codebase increasingly full of code whose logic they don’t fully understand.</p><p>The brilliant insight buried in the METR study is that AI doesn’t make developers faster across the board — it makes <em>less-experienced</em> developers faster, while potentially slowing down senior engineers on complex problems. This suggests the technology is doing something more interesting than pure acceleration: it is compressing the skill gap.</p><p>A junior developer with <strong>AI tools can produce work that once required mid-level experience.</strong> A non-technical founder can now build what once required a small engineering team. That democratization is real and meaningful. But it comes with the risk of deploying systems built without the depth of understanding that comes from having built them the hard way.</p><h3>Are people actually launching real products?</h3><p>Short answer: yes, but with important asterisks.</p><p>YC’s Winter 2025 data is the most compelling evidence. Companies in that cohort growing 10% per week with sub-10-person teams and genuine customers are not demos or experiments — they’re real businesses. YC CEO Garry Tan pointed to startups reaching $10M in revenue with fewer than 10 people. That would have been structurally impossible in 2019.</p><p>The common pattern in communities like Reddit and Indie Hackers follows a “graduate workflow”: prototype fast in Lovable or Bolt, validate with real users quickly, then either rebuild properly in Cursor or traditional development once the idea is proven — or hire an engineer to clean up the codebase for production. Start vibe, graduate to code.</p><p>Lovable projects $1 billion in ARR by summer 2026 — five times its current $200M run rate. That would make it one of the fastest-scaling B2C software products in history. Whether that reflects genuine product launches or churning users experimenting with prototypes is the key question. The honest answer: both. High-churn is a documented concern across all these platforms, precisely because the barrier to trying is so low that many users spin up projects they never finish.</p><p>The sectors where AI coding platforms are generating real-world product launches break down clearly: SaaS tools (34%), fintech applications (21%), healthtech prototypes (15%), and e-commerce storefronts (13%). The fintech and healthtech numbers are notable precisely because these are <em>regulated industries</em> where AI-generated code requires the most careful human review before shipping — and where the security vulnerabilities documented in 2025 represent the highest actual risk.</p><h3>Final word</h3><p>So what does it all mean?</p><p>We are in the middle of a genuine platform shift — one that happens once or twice per generation in software. The printing press didn’t replace writers; it made writing accessible to millions more people and changed what “writing” meant forever. The spreadsheet didn’t replace accountants; it changed what accountants spent their time doing. AI coding platforms are doing something similar to software development.</p><p>The question is not whether to use these tools. <strong>82% of developers already do, daily.</strong> The question is whether you’re using them with eyes open — understanding what they actually are (pattern-matching engines trained on human knowledge), what they’re good at (speed, scaffolding, prototyping, compressing the skill gap), and what they’re bad at (security, novel architecture, complex production systems).</p><h4>The real win</h4><p>AI coding tools have genuinely democratized software creation. Millions of people who could not previously build software now can. That is a profound and real expansion of human capability — not hype.</p><h4>The real risk</h4><p>Production systems built with AI and not reviewed by experienced engineers are accumulating vulnerabilities, technical debt, and architectural problems that will surface at scale. The bill will come due.</p><h4>The uncomfortable truth</h4><p>AI doesn’t know what it doesn’t know. It generates plausible code, not correct code. The difference only becomes visible when the system fails under real-world conditions that the training data didn’t anticipate.</p><h4>The bigger picture</h4><p>Every model was built on human knowledge. AI is not a new form of intelligence — it’s the stored pattern of human intelligence, made instantly accessible. The humans who fed it that knowledge are still the source of everything it can do.</p><p>The most honest summary: AI coding platforms are the best prototyping tools ever built and potentially dangerous production deployment tools if used without human oversight. Use them to go from zero to validated idea in a weekend. Use experienced engineers to take it from there. The future belongs to builders who understand both sides of that line — and know precisely when they’re on the wrong one.</p><blockquote>The code revolution isn’t coming. It’s here.

<h4>How systems become risky without anyone noticing.</h4><figure><img alt=""A Painting of Alexander Cutting the Gordian Knot"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*urJTxEUxB1exhlGRMTz9tg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Alexander Undoing the Gordian | Source: Knot 1st-art-gallery.com</figcaption></figure><p>No one decides to build a fragile system. No executive convenes a meeting to discuss how best to make operations inscrutable, unreliable, brittle. No engineer sets out to create software that no one can maintain or discern later on. No organization deliberately designs processes so convoluted that they guarantee failure.</p><p>Yet fragile, incomprehensible, unmaintainable, and failure-prone systems are everywhere. They are the norm. Systems that excel and are resilient are exceptional. So how come? Fragile systems didn’t arrive through dramatic decisions or catastrophic errors. They evolved. Their fragility and brittleness were accumulated gradually, through a thousand small, locally rational choices that collectively created something unmanageable. Therein lies the importance of Systems Thinking. To understand the aggregate dynamics of individual choices.</p><p><a href=""https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/ask-mit-professor-what-system-thinking-and-why-it-important"">Systems Thinking </a>is the best defense we have against the complexity run amuck. Complexity is an emergent property of systems. It evolves not from reckless decision-making but from responding sensibly to immediate, localized needs. A new feature here, a workaround there, an exception to handle an edge case, a patch to fix an urgent problem. Each addition seems small. Each solves a real problem. Each is approved and implemented with good intentions.</p><p>But complexity isn’t an additive attribute. It multiplies.</p><figure><img alt=""A diagram that demonstrates that the complexity of a system (connections) grows exponentially with the number of components in a system"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/776/0*2MfYpvTLBmGK5aYk.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>Take the image above. In the abstract it does a good job of demonstrating complexity. A system of 3 nodes has just 3 unique connections. A system with 1 more node, doubles the number of connections to 6. Double that system and the number of connections grows exponentially. Somewhere along the way the system crosses a threshold where the system becomes so fraught with complexity that it creates genuine risk. Like the emergence of complexity, the probability also increases exponentially.</p><p><strong>How Complexity Accumulates</strong></p><p>The first step in managing complexity is understanding how it sneaks into systems despite everyone’s best efforts to keep things simple.</p><p>Feature Creep</p><p>Every user wants one more feature. Every stakeholder has a use case that isn’t quite covered. Every competitive analysis reveals something rivals offer that you don’t. The pressure to add is constant and multifaceted.</p><p>Individual feature requests seem reasonable. A customer needs the system to handle a specific edge case. A sales prospect will sign if you just add this one capability. An internal team needs special handling for their workflow.</p><p>Saying yes to each request improves the system for someone. But each addition increases the surface area of the system, manifesting in more code to maintain, more interactions to test, more documentation to write, more training to conduct, as well as an expanded Optimal Design Domain. The complexity grows with the factorial of features.</p><p>Procedural Layering</p><p>Organizations respond to problems <a href=""https://irb.northwestern.edu/compliance-education/corrective-and-preventive-action-capa-plans.html"">by adding procedures</a>. A mistake occurs; a new approval process is implemented. An audit finds gaps; a new compliance check is required. A risk materializes; a new control is instituted.</p><p>Each procedure makes sense in isolation. We should approve major purchases. We should verify compliance. We should control risk. But procedures accumulate faster than they’re removed. Organizations rarely ask, “What procedure can we eliminate now that we’re adding this one?”</p><p>The result is sedimentary layers of process, each representing a response to some past problem, many now obsolete but all still in force because no one has authority or incentive to remove them.</p><p><a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">The Theory of Constraints</a> (ToC) identifies this as policy constraints — rules and procedures that become bottlenecks themselves. <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/eliyahu-goldratt.html"">Goldratt </a>(the creator of ToC) observed that organizations often implement policies to optimize local efficiency but never revisit them when conditions change, creating system-level dysfunction.</p><p>Informal Complexity, Work Arounds</p><p>When formal systems don’t serve user needs well, people create workarounds. They copy data manually between systems. They use spreadsheets to track what the official system should track but doesn’t. They develop informal communication channels because formal ones are too slow.</p><p>In my experience as an engineer, systems designer, and consultant, this is actually the norm of how business gets done. People are very entrepreneurial by nature. There’s never a formalized meeting to figure out how business operations ought to be completed, they just figure out what works, and that becomes the best practice. This is great for getting things done, but it also means that there is usually lots of low-hanging fruit to optimize these systems, usually at low cost.</p><p>Workarounds are innovations at the edges. They represent localized problem-solving that keeps work flowing. But they’re also a key driver of hidden complexity. The formal system looks simple on paper, but the actual operating system includes dozens of undocumented workarounds that only certain people know about.</p><p>When those people leave, their workarounds break. When systems change, workarounds that depended on specific quirks stop working. When new people join, they don’t know the workarounds exist and make errors because the formal system doesn’t match operational reality.</p><p>Technical Debt and The Infrastructure Accumulation</p><p>In software, technical debt is explicit and easy to detect. Shortcuts are taken to complete a project faster, leaving behind code that should be refactored later. Often, “later” never comes, and the debt accumulates.</p><p>But technical debt exists in all systems, not just software. In manufacturing, we regularly see equipment that’s been patched repeatedly, or modules added onto instead of replaced. In organizational design we even see it in the form of reporting lines being added without rethinking the fundamental design. It’s the sales training program that’s been updated piecemeal for every new product instead of redesigned.</p><p>Each piece of debt makes future changes harder. The code becomes harder to modify, because the internal logic is already fractal. The manufacturing equipment becomes more fragile. The organization becomes more difficult to reorganize. The training becomes less effective. The system becomes rigid precisely when it needs to be adaptive.</p><p><strong>Complexity Increases Faster Than Our Ability to Understand It</strong></p><p>A system’s complexity doesn’t scale linearly with system size. A system twice as large isn’t twice as complex. It’s often four times, eight times, or exponentially more complex.</p><p>Interaction Effects</p><p>An interaction is the reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between two components within a system. This is important to understand how systems behave as a whole. Systems are not merely the sum of their parts. It means that as systems grow their complexity is boosted by the mutual and cyclical relationships., highlighting that influences are mutual and cyclical, not linear. A system with 10 components has 45 potential interaction pairs, but a system with 100 components has 4,950.</p><p>Most interactions don’t matter most of the time. But under stress, under unusual conditions, or when specific combinations occur, obscure interactions become critical. And the more interactions exist, the more likely that some will create failure modes no one anticipated. This is the principle of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/bad-design-is-like-a-virus-design-defects-and-latent-failures-1e0ab4be7e52"">resident pathogens</a>.</p><p>You cannot understand a system by understanding its parts in isolation. The interactions between parts often dominate behavior. As those interactions multiply, understanding the whole becomes exponentially harder.</p><p>Emergent Behaviors</p><p>Complex systems exhibit emergent behaviors. Emergent behaviors are system-level properties that don’t exist in any individual component. Traffic jams emerge from individual driver decisions. Market crashes emerge from individual trading behaviors. Organizational dysfunction emerges from individual departmental optimizations. Flocking patterns of birds and Schools of Fish emerge as a result of many constituents which don’t, in and of themselves, possess these emergent properties.</p><figure><img alt=""A flock of birds during a yellow sunset"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*wIMNA47WVg3BzCiR.jpg"" /><figcaption>A Flock of birds as emergent behavior found in nature | Source: Arstechnica.com</figcaption></figure><p>Often spawned by localized decision making, these emergent properties are often negative (at least from the system designer’s perspective), namely because they are unintended and unexpected consequences. And they’re nearly impossible to predict because they emerge from the interaction of many factors, not from any single cause.</p><p><em>A side note/rant:</em></p><p><em>This is why I’m bearish when it comes to the future of gene editing technology. Gene editing methods like </em><a href=""https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/06/stanford-explainer-crispr-gene-editing-and-beyond""><em>CRISPR </em></a><em>uses correlations and probability to edit genes for some desired effect, eye color. But (1) these may correlate with other factors not accounted for (</em><a href=""https://www.the-scientist.com/how-are-earwax-and-body-odor-linked-72476""><em>like the relationship between earwax and body odor</em></a><em>) and (2) the collective editing of multiple genes can have greater unintended [read: emergent] consequences.</em></p><p>Cognitive Limits</p><p>Human working memory can hold roughly seven chunks of information. When a system has hundreds or thousands of interacting components, no individual can hold the complete system in their head. Understanding becomes distributed across many people, each of whom has a partial view.</p><p>This fragmentation of understanding is itself a risk. No one sees the whole. Decisions are made based on local knowledge that doesn’t account for global effects. Changes are implemented without understanding full implications. The system becomes too complex for anyone to fully reason about.</p><p><strong>Real-World Complexity Failures</strong></p><p>Healthcare.gov Launch (2013)</p><p>The Affordable Care Act’s federal insurance exchange launched in October 2013 and immediately collapsed. The website couldn’t handle traffic. Applications failed. Users couldn’t complete enrollment.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*bbTMPytERu-EIAQH.png"" /><figcaption>The now famous error screen of HealthCare.gov | Source: Medium.com</figcaption></figure><p>The failure wasn’t a single bug or bad decision. It was systemic complexity. Multiple contractors built different pieces. Systems needed to integrate with existing federal databases. State exchanges needed to interface with the federal system. Security requirements added layers. Compliance rules created conditional logic. <a href=""https://medium.com/dataseries/small-is-beautiful-the-launch-failure-of-healthcare-gov-5e60f20eb967"">Edge cases demanded special handling</a>.</p><p>Each component worked (more or less) in isolation. But integrating them revealed cascade failures, timing issues, and interaction effects no one had anticipated. The system was too complex for anyone to fully understand, and that complexity created fragility.</p><p>Knight Capital Trading Loss (2012)</p><p><a href=""https://www.henricodolfing.ch/en/case-study-4-the-440-million-software-error-at-knight-capital/"">Knight Capital</a> deployed new trading software to seven of eight servers. The eighth still ran old code. When trading began, the old code executed differently than the new code. Orders from the mixed system created erratic behavior that cost $440 million in 45 minutes.</p><p>The complexity wasn’t in the trading logic itself but was in the deployment process, version control, and fail-safes (or lack thereof). Each element seemed manageable. But the interaction of partial deployment, legacy code, and automated trading created a failure mode that destroyed the company.</p><p>Boeing 787 Development Delays</p><p><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/24/business/boeing-787-dreamliner-halt"">Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner was years late </a>and billions over budget, largely due to complexity in managing a global supply chain with unprecedented outsourcing.

It was organizational and logistical. Coordinating work across dozens of companies, ensuring interface compatibility, managing schedule dependencies, and integrating testing added complexity that multiplied with every additional partner and interface.</p><p><strong>Detecting Accumulated Complexity</strong></p><p>Complexity accumulates invisibly until it causes problems. How do you detect it before it becomes critical?</p><p>Warning Signs:</p><ol><li><strong>Lengthening cycle times</strong>: Changes that used to take days now take weeks. This often signals that complexity has increased friction.</li><li><strong>Rising error rates</strong>: More defects, more support tickets, more exceptions. Complexity creates more failure modes.</li><li><strong>Knowledge silos</strong>: Only certain people can work on certain systems because they’re too complex for newcomers to learn quickly.</li><li><strong>Fear of change</strong>: Teams resist modifications because they’re not confident about side effects. “If it’s working, don’t touch it” becomes the mantra.</li><li><strong>Escalating maintenance costs</strong>: More time spent fixing and patching, less time spent building new capability.</li><li><strong>Integration problems</strong>: New features break existing functionality in unexpected ways.</li><li><strong>Documentation drift</strong>: Formal documentation no longer matches actual operation because the system has evolved through undocumented changes.</li></ol><p>These symptoms don’t prove complexity directly, but they correlate strongly with systems that have accumulated too much of it.</p><p>Quantitative Measures:</p><p>For software systems, metrics like <a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/cyclomatic-complexity/"">cyclomatic complexity</a>, coupling metrics, and dependency graphs provide numerical complexity measures and diagnostic tools. But even non-software systems can be measured:</p><ul><li><strong>Decision tree depth</strong>: How many conditional branches exist in a process?</li><li><strong>Role count</strong>: How many different roles touch a workflow?</li><li><strong>Approval layers</strong>: How many sign-offs does a decision require?</li><li><strong>Exception frequency</strong>: How often do standard processes require exceptions?</li><li><strong>Handoff count</strong>: How many times does work transfer between people or systems?</li></ul><p>High values don’t automatically mean there’s a problem. Complexity is sometimes necessary. But they indicate where to look for opportunities to simplify and where to triage when something breaks.</p><p><strong>Pruning Unnecessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Once you’ve detected complexity, how do you reduce it without breaking things that work?</p><p>1. Dependency Mapping</p><p>You can’t simplify what you don’t understand. Create visual maps of dependencies:</p><ul><li>What depends on what?</li><li>What components interact?</li><li>What can be changed independently?</li><li>Where are the tight couplings?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of a dependency map"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZidzvGzhvpLFVASu2l9qtQ.png"" /><figcaption>An example of a dependency map | Source: dependency-map.com</figcaption></figure><p>Tools exist for software (dependency analyzers, architecture visualization). For organizational systems, this might be process maps, responsibility matrices (RACI), or workflow diagrams.</p><p>2. The 80/20 Analysis</p><p>Most systems exhibit <a href=""https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pareto-distribution"">Pareto distributions</a>: 20% of features deliver 80% of value, 20% of code contains 80% of bugs, 20% of procedures handle 80% of cases.</p><figure><img alt=""An Example of a Pareto Distribution"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hKMuHOxk7ZxHLk1Z"" /><figcaption>An Example of a Pareto Distribution | Source: scirp.org</figcaption></figure><p>Identify:</p><ul><li>Which features are rarely used?</li><li>Which procedures handle edge cases?</li><li>Which code paths are seldom executed?</li></ul><p>These low-value, high-maintenance components are prime candidates for elimination. Removing them reduces surface area without significantly reducing capability.</p><p><a href=""https://www.lightsondata.com/why-focus-reduce-variation/"">Deming’s focus on variation reduction</a> is relevant here. Simplification reduces sources of variation, making systems more stable and predictable. Eliminating rarely-used features eliminates rare but costly failure modes.</p><p>3. Complexity Budgets</p><p>Treat complexity as a constrained resource, like memory or budget. Every addition must fit within the budget, which means something else might need to be removed.</p><p>This forces explicit trade-offs: “To add this feature, we need to remove three existing ones. Which should go?” The question surfaces costs that are otherwise hidden.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/@ankitsingh1583/how-netflix-uber-and-amazon-manage-their-microservices-at-scale-97b028da2134"">Netflix famously has a policy limiting microservices complexity</a>: teams can add new services, but the total count must stay within bounds, forcing consolidation and simplification as a regular practice.</p><p>4. Simplification Audits</p><p>Regularly review systems specifically to identify simplification opportunities:</p><ul><li>Which procedures exist because of problems that no longer occur?</li><li>Which features could be consolidated?</li><li>Which integrations could be eliminated?</li><li>Which exceptions could be standardized?</li></ul><p>The <a href=""https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html"">Theory of Constraints</a> teaches to focus improvement efforts on constraints. But TOC also recognizes that non-constraint resources shouldn’t be optimized to full capacity. Similarly, not every part of a system needs maximum capability. Some parts can and should be simplified, even if it means slightly reduced local performance, if it improves overall system manageability.</p><p>5. Modular Decomposition</p><p>Break complex systems into loosely <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/ecis2022_rp/52/"">coupled modules </a>with clear interfaces. This doesn’t reduce total complexity, but it contains and partitions it.</p><p>A monolithic system with 1,000 interconnected parts is unmanageable. Ten modules of 100 parts each, with well-defined interfaces between modules, is manageable. You can understand one module deeply without needing to understand all modules.</p><p>This requires discipline in interface design: modules should interact through narrow, well-specified interfaces, not through deep coupling or shared state. When modularity is maintained, complexity within modules stays local and doesn’t ripple system-wide.</p><p>6. Standardization and Platforming</p><p>Reduce variety by standardizing components and building on common platforms. Instead of five different authentication systems, use one. Instead of three different data formats, standardize on one.</p><p>This trades flexibility for simplicity. You can’t optimize each use case perfectly, but you reduce the number of things that need to be understood, maintained, and integrated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.6sigma.us/business-process-management-articles/process-standardization-for-operational-excellence/"">Standardization of processes is foundational for quality</a>. You can’t improve what varies wildly. You can’t maintain what’s different everywhere. Standardization creates the baseline from which to build, measure, and improve.</p><p><strong>Culture and Resisting Complexity</strong></p><p>Technical approaches help, but the deeper challenge is cultural. Organizations must develop a <a href=""https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/dealing-with-complexity-by-creating-a-bias-for-simplicity"">bias toward simplicity</a>, which cuts against many incentives.</p><p>Incentive Misalignments:</p><ul><li>Product managers are rewarded for feature additions, not feature removals</li><li>Engineers are evaluated on what they build, not what they eliminate</li><li>Processes are added in response to visible problems; removing them is invisible work</li><li>Budgets reward spending, not simplification</li></ul><p>To counter these, organizations need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Celebrate simplification</strong>: Publicize cases where removing features improved the product</li><li><strong>Measure complexity explicitly</strong>: Track metrics like code complexity, process steps, and approval layers</li><li><strong>Require simplification alongside addition</strong>: New features must be accompanied by the removal of old features</li><li><strong>Create dedicated simplification initiatives</strong>: Not as ongoing work but as explicit projects with resources</li></ul><p>The Power of “No”</p><p>The most important complexity control is saying no to additions. This is politically difficult — every addition has a constituency. But the cumulative cost of saying yes too often is a system that collapses under its own weight.</p><p>Saying no requires:</p><ul><li>Clear criteria for what’s in scope and what’s not</li><li>Explicit recognition that the capacity for complexity is limited</li><li>Willingness to disappoint stakeholders in the service of system sustainability</li><li>Authority structures that can enforce boundaries</li></ul><p><a href=""https://www.uwyo.edu/ceps/development/awards/deming.html"">W. Edwards Deming</a>’s point about <a href=""https://deming.org/create-constancy-of-purpose/"">constancy of purpose</a> applies here. Without a consistent commitment to simplicity, complexity accumulates as each decision optimizes locally without considering global effects.</p><p><strong>Living with Necessary Complexity</strong></p><p>Some complexity is essential. Real-world problems are complex; solutions must match that complexity to some degree. The eliminate unnecessary complexity while managing necessary complexity effectively.</p><p><strong>Essential Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li>Business rules that reflect genuine domain complexity</li><li>Integration points that correspond to real organizational boundaries</li><li>Features that deliver significant value to significant user populations</li><li>Redundancy that provides resilience</li></ul><p>This complexity should be:</p><ul><li>Explicit: Documented and understood</li><li>Contained: Modularized so it doesn’t leak</li><li>Justified: Regularly validated as still necessary</li></ul><p><strong>Accidental Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://idenhaus.com/why-workarounds-are-iams-silent-killer/"">Workarounds</a> for systems that should be fixed</li><li>Procedures created in response to one-time events</li><li>Features that sounded good but are rarely used</li><li>Integration patterns that evolved organically without design</li></ul><p>This complexity should be systematically hunted and eliminated.</p><p>The distinction isn’t always clear, but the question should be constantly asked: is this complexity necessary, or did it just accumulate?</p><p><strong>Conclusion: Complexity as Systemic Debt</strong></p><p>Complexity is like financial debt: sometimes useful, always carrying a cost, and dangerous when it accumulates beyond your ability to service it.</p><p>Taking on debt to invest in growth can be smart. But debt that accumulates from routine operations without producing value is insidious. It constrains future options, increases risk, and eventually demands painful restructuring.</p><p>The same is true of complexity. Some complexity enables capability. But much of how complexity propagates is just accumulation, the residue of past decisions that no one has cleaned up. It makes the system fragile, expensive to maintain, and difficult to evolve.</p><p>The challenge is that complexity accumulates gradually and locally while its costs manifest globally and suddenly. Each small addition seems manageable. The cumulative effect is system failure that seems to come from nowhere but was actually built up over years of accretion.</p><p>Managing this requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Vigilance</strong>: Constantly watching for complexity creep</li><li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Resisting additions and forcing eliminations</li><li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Mapping and measuring complexity</li><li><strong>Investment</strong>: Dedicating resources to simplification</li><li><strong>Culture</strong>: Valuing simplicity as much as capability</li></ul><p>Systems should be designed for improvement, not just for operation. This means building systems that can be understood, modified, and simplified. Systems that resist simplification, where every change risks breaking something else, have accumulated too much complexity. I also mentioned this as a key principle to designing <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/responsible-tech-principles-for-technological-use-and-development-3de9f6d8f49d"">Responsible and Humane Technology</a>.</p><p>The risk isn’t that your system will fail catastrophically tomorrow. It’s that complexity accumulates silently until one day you discover your system has become so fragile, so opaque, and so expensive to maintain that it’s effectively unmaintainable. By then, you have few options: live with mounting failures or undertake expensive, risky restructuring.</p><p>The solution is prevention: treat complexity as debt, recognize when you’re taking it on, ensure it’s justified, and regularly pay it down. Build systems that can be simplified, not just systems that work. Create cultures that celebrate subtraction as much as addition.</p><blockquote>“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” — <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1020792.Antoine_de_Saint_Exup_ry"">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a></blockquote><p>Because in the long run, the systems that survive aren’t the ones with the most features, the most procedures, or the most components. They’re the ones that remain understandable, maintainable, and adaptable. They are the ones that resisted the inexorable accumulation of unnecessary complexity.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e222182a67f5"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-complexity-accumulates-e222182a67f5"">How complexity accumulates</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

Yes, they’re powerful. Yes, they let us do more. But there’s this weird disconnect growing between me and the things I make. When everything is instant, it starts feeling like a slot machine. Except you always win. Which makes it more addictive. And somehow… also boring?</p><p>And you can’t stop. Social media keeps telling us to ship more, faster, be first. But when anyone has the power of a team of 10x engineers (lol), being first isn’t even a moat anymore. It’s just being slightly less late.</p><p>The worst part is what this comic is about. I catch myself using AI for things I used to enjoy doing. Changing a font size. Adjusting the border radius. Pushing pixels until the result made me proud.</p><p>I still do something similar, but now it’s a conversation. I tell the spirit in the terminal to do it for me. “Make the left padding a bit wider. Make the animation snappier. Use our subtle foreground color… don’t use any color, use our color token. Oh, and make it smaller, go from sm to xs.” That’s my new <em>pixel-pushing.</em></p><p>Why? Because I can. And that’s the trap.</p><p>The thing gets done but it doesn’t feel like I did anything. I could’ve written that code myself… but sometimes I don’t even know where the component lives in the files. I’d have to inspect the element in the browser, find the classes, copy them, search them in my IDE, locate the file, then edit it (am I the only one who does this?) So instead… I just talk to the machine. I overexplain so it only changes what I want. I don’t design anymore. I direct.</p><p>But these things could direct themselves too. The “human in the loop” feels less like the guide and more like the thing slowing it all down. Some people call this slowing of the machine… this fine-tuning… “taste.” The ultimate human moat. Guys, stop it with your “taste.” I’ve seen how you dress. You don’t have any. And taste is really just doing things the way the top 10% of creators do instead of the average. That’s a pattern. Patterns are exactly what these things are built to learn… just give it time (a month?).</p><p>But hey… this comic? I tried new angles, more creative shots. All hand-drawn. No model. No worktree. No extra-high reasoning. Just me and the canvas. And that feels good. Like… “look, mom, I made this!”</p><p>Look, I’m in a rut. I really love these tools, I love creating with AI, I’ve never felt so productive. They’re wild and they’re powerful. But I hope we keep the joy.

Users didn’t analyze it consciously, but it helped them navigate and gave them a sense of control.”</li></ul><h3>Little gems this week</h3><figure><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/openai-ads-as-content-708666ddab2b""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*OSVZofLgd90C-i9G.png"" /></a></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/openai-ads-as-content-708666ddab2b""><strong>OpenAI: from ads to content</strong></a><strong> →<br /></strong>By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/a0f35cc87dd4"">Rodrigo Osornio</a></p><figure><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_yFegXZURrXnb0SR.png"" /></a></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/getting-carried-away-when-intelligence-is-replaced-by-compliance-f6c63585f7af""><strong>Getting carried away: When intelligence is replaced by compliance</strong></a><strong> →<br /></strong>By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/a23f14c0ef83"">Gaurav Ramesh</a></p><figure><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-your-ceo-acts-like-a-clown-the-tribal-myths-of-leadership-b3c2a5f6cc17?sk=1de04a1232f05d8d7e6d95d2b562c873""><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*AHKFU1FAtcUtNRL7.png"" /></a></figure><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/why-your-ceo-acts-like-a-clown-the-tribal-myths-of-leadership-b3c2a5f6cc17?sk=1de04a1232f05d8d7e6d95d2b562c873""><strong>The tribal myths of leadership</strong></a> →<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/161b4eee2ac1"">Maxim Kich</a></p><h3>Tools and resources</h3><ul><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-80-job-how-design-leads-are-using-ai-and-its-not-about-mockups-ce5df0ed78cf""><strong>How design leads are using AI</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />The 80% job.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/7e26e3cc0dfd"">Vlad Derdeicea</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/practice-notes-on-including-citizens-in-the-design-process-d28bf115700f""><strong>Including citizens in the design process</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />Field notes on trust and shared agency.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/e1ffebbf296c"">Jack Strachan</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/field-study-prototypes-over-mockups-8581f20102ff""><strong>Prototypes over mockups</strong></a><strong> →</strong><br />A practical guide to designing with code in 2026.<br />By <a href=""https://medium.com/u/ef9e6832a598"">Édouard Wautier</a></li></ul><h3>Support the newsletter</h3><p>If you find our content helpful, here’s how you can support us:</p><ul><li>Check out <a href=""https://bit.ly/uxc-mob1"">this week’s sponsor</a> and support their work too</li><li>Forward this email to a friend and invite them to <a href=""https://newsletter.uxdesign.cc/"">subscribe</a></li><li><a href=""https://uxdesigncc.medium.com/sponsor-the-ux-collective-newsletter-bf141c6284f"">Sponsor an edition</a></li></ul><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=568b86eb87f2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hidden-cost-of-ai-prototypes-leadership-myths-how-designers-use-ai-568b86eb87f2"">Hidden cost of AI prototypes, leadership myths, how designers use AI</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Designers should be thriving in the age of AI. Here’s why we aren’t, why it’s probably our fault, and how we can fix it.</h4><figure><img alt=""The Beatles on red pointy hats with sunflowers"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wXwxelMpQ2KNjnTN1Tzm-w.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm3997504000/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Much has been said about the future of design in the age of AI. Some think the role will disappear completely. Others say only super-seniors will survive. And yet others say it’s all just a blip in time and there will be no fundamental change.</p><p>I think all are wrong.</p><p>For two reasons:</p><ol><li>Designers are naturally attuned to adapt to technological change. We are trained to identify and acknowledge change, manage adaptation, and find solutions for friction.</li><li>We’re moving towards a totally new definition of digital products. Away from interfaces, and towards fluid use cases that we’re only beginning to imagine now. To make this accessible and valuable to all, we will need designers at all levels. <em>Obviously</em>.</li></ol><p>Why, then, has the design community been in absolute panic since AI has been taking off?</p><p>Seniors are telling juniors to count themselves lucky if they’ll ever find a job.</p><p>Design leaders are jumping from one AI-tool hypetrain to the next in mere weeks.</p><p>Monday, it’s all about prototypes. Thursday, it’s vibe coding. Friday, we’re preaching that output no longer matters (everyone can design now!) and that we should be brilliant strategists instead. By next Monday, we’ll be half-heartedly debating which soft skills are absolutely vital to survive.</p><p><em>Survive.</em> As designers.</p><p>As if our skills have evaporated overnight, and we can only stick around if we somehow show that we’re good for (undefined) other stuff.</p><p>No.</p><p>We should be thriving.</p><p>Where has it all gone wrong? Why aren’t designers winning in the age of AI, which, at its core, is about <em>making</em>?</p><p>The thing we do best.</p><p>Here’s what I think.</p><h4>We’ve been sabotaging ourselves.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7ogC1IGrkuO2HuDnFDBoKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm1950683648/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Please don’t be enraged. Take a deep breath and think about it.</p><p>Ever since the first AI tools with strong visual output started emerging, we seemingly overnight started screaming from all rooftops about:</p><p><strong><em>taste</em></strong>.</p><h4>What the fck is taste?</h4><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/taste-vs-technical-skills-ai/"">According to NNG</a> it’s “the learned, subjective ability to discern and select the most effective, harmonious, and high-quality elements for a project”.</p><p>Maybe, if you’re really smart, you can picture what that means. But really, if you’re honest, taste is a vague concept. Taste is subjective. Taste is not something that makes a product win (for the most part).</p><p>And vague is not <em>good</em> — especially not in a time of transformation where no one really knows where we’re going yet. Where tech stacks are changing weekly, and user needs are developing at rocket speed.</p><p>You know what else <em>vague</em> is bad for? Convincing an executive to invest in something.</p><p>It generally takes three things to grab an executive's attention.</p><ol><li>Connection (Do you get their problem?).</li><li>Authority (Do you know your stuff?).</li><li>Vision (Do you know where this is going?).</li></ol><p>Taste doesn’t answer any of those. You know what else doesn’t?</p><h4>Shitty prototypes.</h4><p>Yeah, I’ve made my fair share of them, too. But the time when these impressed anyone is over. Even my 0% designer husband can now vibe code stuff and knows how to whip up a design prototype.</p><p>There is a time and place for them. Prototypes and vibe-coded projects are great to show a vision, build excitement, or unblock a team that’s stuck in process. But they’re not what’s gonna convince your engineering stakeholders to give you access to their codebase so you can actually start shipping fixes from your design backlog.</p><p>I’d like to argue that excessive prototyping is the next big issue that’s messing with the status of design in the age of AI.</p><p>Because they undermine our authority. There’s the executive’s next red flag. <em>Do you know your stuff?</em></p><p>Of course, designers recognised this concern quickly. How did we respond?</p><p>By starting never-ending discussions about:</p><p><strong><em>craft</em>.</strong></p><h4>What the heck is craft?</h4><p>I like <a href=""https://www.nsead.org/resources/teaching-inspiration/craft/defining-craft/"">this definition</a>: “Craft can be defined as intelligent making. It is technically, materially and culturally informed. Craft is the designing and making of individual artefacts and objects, encouraging the development of intellectual, creative and practical skills, visual sensitivity and a working knowledge of tools, materials and systems”.</p><p>Welp.</p><p><em>Taste and craft walk into a bar…</em></p><p>Just kidding.</p><p>You get my point. Here is another vague concept that most people associate with activities they liked to do back in kindergarten.</p><p>And listen, I’m not knocking craft. I love writing poetry, painting, throwing pots at the wheel. All that takes craft and skill, just as my designs at work do. But craft should be so obvious to us as designers that we should not make it our <em>main</em> selling point.</p><p>Obviously, we develop incredible craft as our experience builds. Obviously, individual designers have different styles. Obviously, we put thought and care into what we make.</p><p>Craft is the baseline. That’s what we want the executives to know. By debating it and what it even means, we’re again undermining our authority. And I’d argue we’re also not really connecting with them OR showing much vision.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p><strong>How do we get out of this mess?</strong></p><p>We need to remember — and remind others — why design is irreplaceable.</p><h4>We’re the OG makers.</h4><p>We’re “growth mindset”, personified.</p><p>In most classic product companies, there are <a href=""https://www.producttalk.org/glossary-discovery-product-trio/"">trios</a>: A product manager, a designer, and an engineer. The point? To ensure that the perspectives of the users and the business are balanced with the technical capabilities throughout the development process.</p><p>While a well-functioning trio feels like a cheat code to achieving product velocity, an unbalanced one can slow things down, ship mediocre stuff, or not at all.</p><p>The best trios I’ve worked in and observed had one very obvious trait in common: we all respected each other's practice, but we also understood enough about each other’s domains to be unafraid to push back.</p><p>Only a designer who understands the business side of things can really translate business goals into conversion flows.</p><p>Only a product manager who understands the fundamentals of good design can push a designer to level up.</p><p>And only an engineer who cares for users and understands how the business works is an equal partner in a trio.</p><p>And while AI is bringing all of our roles closer together, we are still the builders of <em>the experience</em>.</p><p>The thing that is actually being used. The thing executives aim to deliver.</p><ol><li><strong>Connection</strong>: You want to make something. We can tell you if it’s possible. If yes, we can ensure it’s made in the best possible way.</li><li><strong>Authority</strong>: We work at the intersection of what the business wants, the user needs, and what actually works.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong>: We have the skills, tools, and mindset to create something you <em>can’t even/can only</em> imagine.</li></ol><p>Sold.</p><h4>The design mindset is unique.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iI-tGWT87XJnnLmo7XwFKA.png"" /><figcaption>The Beatles, Magical Mystery Tour (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt0061937/mediaviewer/rm725418752/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>And it’s beautiful.</p><p><strong>It’s human-centred. </strong>Deep empathy for the user is the foundation, ensuring solutions address real needs, feelings, and motivations.</p><p><strong>It embraces ambiguity.</strong> Viewing problems as opportunities rather than roadblocks.</p><p><strong>It kills its darlings by default and favours learning.</strong> A willingness to “fail fast,” learn from prototypes, and constantly adapt solutions based on feedback.</p><p><strong>It’s, at its core, optimistic and inclusive.</strong> Bringing diverse perspectives together, believing that better solutions can always be created.</p><p><strong>It’s the most curious of mindsets.</strong> Asking “why” and “what if” to challenge the status quo at every turn.</p><p>You don’t have to read this twice to know: hell yes, we need designers with AI taking over more and more space in our lives.</p><h4>Here’s what we need to do. Now.</h4><p>In most classic design teams, there are different roles: Product designers, content designers, user researchers, sometimes motion designers, and ops people. Their educational background is essentially the same: developing an understanding of users, business, and products. Some focus more on the look and feel, others on going in depth on the “how it works”.</p><p><strong>So, for the love of everything good, can we please stop debating our titles?</strong></p><h4>We are all designers.</h4><p>Designers make stuff. Some use words and taxonomy, others use pixels. Some use language, others use code. The mindset is the same. The mindset is what matters.</p><p><strong>Yes, AI is muddying the lines between design roles. But it doesn’t matter.</strong></p><p>Not because it can replace people, but because it can save time that, in return, can be used to develop the skills traditionally only another role would need. Not so you can replace someone, but:</p><p><strong>So you can become a more holistic, better maker.</strong></p><p>This is not new.</p><p>There’s always been a push for all designers to do their own research. For content designers to develop visual skills. For product designers to get strong at prototyping. Now, finally, we can do so — with far less effort than before.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we should think less. It means we <em>can</em> think more.</p><p>I, personally, love thinking. Nothing gets me as high as solving a problem. It’s the reason I got into design, and specifically design in tech, in the first place. There were actual (cool) problems to solve.</p><p>I originally picked UX content as my toolkit. Now, my toolkit has expanded. I love that. And I don’t want to waste time wondering what my title should be, whether my taste is good enough, or what <em>exactly</em> my craft is now.</p><p>I want to make stuff.</p><p>And I think you do, too.</p><p>Nicole is a Content Designer turned Design Director based in Stockholm, Sweden.
