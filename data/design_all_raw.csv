<h3><strong>The 80% job: how design leads are using AI — and it’s not about mockups</strong></h3><h4>Design leads spend 80% of their time communicating, aligning, and justifying. That’s exactly where AI helps most.</h4><figure><img alt=""A drawing of a man looking straight at the camera surrounded by a crowded desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bR4xPhoVSjwHhgLtf6Pdew.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 1: The Reality of Design Leadership</h3><p>Here’s what my job description says I do: set design vision, mentor designers, elevate craft quality, drive innovation.</p><p>Here’s what I actually do: run 1:1s, mediate conflicts, write justifications for decisions, align with stakeholders, update Jira, answer Slack, prepare for meetings, sit in meetings, follow up on meetings.</p><p>I lead a team of 7 designers at a European bank. I can’t remember the last time I opened Figma for actual design work.</p><p>This isn’t a complaint. This is the job. And if you’re a design lead, you probably recognize it.</p><p>(Whether your title is Design Lead, Chapter Lead, Head of Design, or Design Manager — if you’re responsible for other designers and their output, this is for you.)</p><h4>The Myth vs The Reality</h4><p>When I was an individual contributor, I assumed design leads spent their days reviewing designs, setting creative direction, and occasionally stepping in to solve tough UX problems.</p><p>Then I became one.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72103bc2102b"">Megan Schofield</a> <strong>Experience Design Manager at Google</strong>, put it perfectly in an interview with <a href=""https://www.goabstract.com/blog/stakeholder-review-meetings"">Abstract</a>:</p><blockquote>“I would be inclined to propose that we, as designers, actually spend a significant amount of time, not designing, but in fact communicating, reviewing, justifying and defending.”</blockquote><p>Here’s what the typical breakdown actually looks like:</p><h4>What job descriptions say:</h4><p>- 30% Design strategy &amp; vision<br />- 25% Mentoring &amp; craft elevation<br />- 20% Stakeholder collaboration<br />- 15% Process improvement<br />- 10% Hands-on design work</p><h4>What the calendar says:</h4><p>- 30% Meetings (syncs, reviews, alignments, 1:1s)<br />- 25% Communication (Slack, email, status updates)<br />- 20% People management (coaching, conflict resolution, career conversations)<br />- 20% Justification (proposals, business cases, defending decisions)<br />- 5% Operations (Jira, planning, HR, tools, budgets)</p><p><strong>That’s 100% before you even get to design.</strong></p><p>Notice what’s missing? Exactly.</p><p>This isn’t because we’re bad at our jobs. It’s because the job isn’t what we thought it was.</p><h4>Why This Happens</h4><p>This isn’t a failure of time management. It’s structural.</p><p>Design leads sit at an intersection that no one else occupies. You’re translating between:</p><p>- Designers who think in users and flows<br />- Developers who think in systems and constraints<br />- Business stakeholders who think in metrics and deadlines</p><p><strong>You’re the only one in the room who speaks all three languages</strong>. So you become the translator, the mediator, the justifier.</p><p>Add to that: most design teams exist inside non-design hierarchies. You report to Product, or Engineering, or in my case, a Tribe Lead responsible for multiple disciplines.</p><p>This means every design decision carries a “<strong>justification tax</strong>” — the time spent explaining, documenting, and defending choices that other disciplines make in a quick conversation.</p><p>When your engineering counterpart says “we’ll use microservices,” nobody asks for a slide deck. When you say “we need to simplify this flow,” suddenly you need user data, business impact, and a prototype to prove it.</p><p>That’s the job. And once you accept it, you can start optimizing for it.</p><h4>The 80% Opportunity</h4><p>Here’s where it gets interesting.</p><p>If 80% of the job is communication, documentation, and justification — that’s exactly where AI tools excel.</p><p>And yes, AI is already changing design work itself. Tools like <a href=""https://cursor.sh/"">Cursor</a>, <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, and <a href=""https://www.figma.com/ai/"">Figma AI</a> mean we’re not starting from scratch anymore — not on code, not on prototypes, not on layouts.</p><p>But here’s what most “AI for designers” content misses: design leads don’t spend their days in Figma. W<strong>e spend them in Slack, Docs, and meetings.</strong></p><p>So while AI-generated mockups get the headlines, the bigger opportunity for leads is quieter: drafting that stakeholder update. Summarizing research into exec-friendly bullets. Turning meeting notes into action items. Writing the first version of a business case.</p><p>The stuff that eats your calendar but doesn’t require your craft skills.</p><p>The next parts of this series will break down exactly how I use AI for each of these:</p><p>- Synthesizing research without drowning in transcripts<br />- Writing business cases that actually get read<br />- Communicating with stakeholders in their language<br />- Enabling my team without becoming a bottleneck</p><p>This isn’t about working faster. <strong>It’s about reclaiming time for the 20% that actually needs a design lead’s judgment</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""A drawing of an old desk with a big red clock above the desk"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q6efJjHmz22Z4Cve-8SPOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 2: AI for Admin — Reclaim Your Time</h3><p>Before we get to the exciting stuff (building prototypes, validating ideas), let’s address the elephant in the room: the 80% of your week that isn’t design work.</p><p>The <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/"">State of AI in Design Report 2025</a> by Foundation Capital and Designer Fund found that <strong>89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, with 84% using it in the research and ideation phase while only 39% use it during delivery.</strong>*</p><p><em>*Note: This report comes from VC and investment firms with stakes in the AI design space — it’s useful directional data, not independent academic research.</em></p><p>Design leads? We’re not even in those stats. We’re too busy in meetings.</p><p>So let’s fix that.</p><h4>Start with what hurts most</h4><p>For me, it was meetings. Six a day, sometimes more. By Friday, I couldn’t remember what we decided on Monday. Sound familiar?</p><p>I started using <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a>— it sits quietly in my Google Meet or Zoom calls, transcribes everything, and at the end gives me a summary with decisions and action items. What used to take me 20 minutes of post-meeting note cleanup now takes 2. <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies.ai</a> does something similar and integrates with Slack if that’s where your team lives.</p><p>The trick isn’t the tool. It’s breaking the habit of thinking you need to manually capture everything. You don’t. Let the robot do it.</p><h4>Research doesn’t have to be a black hole</h4><p>Here’s a scenario: you’ve got 12 user interviews, survey results from 200 people, and a competitor analysis your team put together last quarter. Your stakeholder meeting is Thursday. They want “the key insights.”</p><p>This used to mean two days of reading, highlighting, and synthesizing. Now I dump everything into a tool like <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> and ask it to find patterns. “<strong>What are the top 5 pain points mentioned by at least 3 users? Give me direct quotes as evidence.</strong>”</p><p>Is it perfect? No. You still need to sanity-check the output. But it gets you 70% of the way there in 30 minutes instead of 2 days.</p><p><a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a> works well for this too if you’re already living in Notion. It can summarize messy interview notes, pull themes from a database, and clean up transcripts that look like someone typed with their elbows.</p><h4>A note on confidentiality</h4><p>If you work in a regulated industry — banking, healthcare, finance — <strong>you need to think carefully about what data you feed into AI tools</strong>. I work at a European bank with a security department that takes data classification seriously, and rightfully so.</p><p>User interview transcripts, internal research, and anything containing customer data should never go into a public AI tool without clearance. <strong>Check with your security and compliance teams first</strong>. Many organizations now have approved AI tool lists or enterprise versions with data processing agreements in place.</p><p>This isn’t a small thing. In financial services, confidentiality isn’t optional — it’s regulated. Plan your AI workflow around what’s approved, not what’s convenient. The last thing you want is to save 2 hours on research synthesis and spend 2 months explaining a data breach to regulators.</p><h4>Speaking stakeholder</h4><p>This one’s personal. I spend a lot of time translating design decisions into language that non-designers understand. “We need to simplify this flow” doesn’t land. “This flow has a 40% drop-off at step 3, and here’s why” does.</p><p>I use <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a> for this. When I need to justify a timeline change or explain why we’re recommending a different approach, I’ll draft my argument and ask it to pressure-test it. “What would a skeptical product manager push back on here?” Then I refine before the actual conversation.</p><p>You can do the same with <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/"">ChatGPT</a>, though I find it tends to be more… diplomatic. Sometimes too diplomatic. When I ask for honest feedback, I want honest feedback, not a sandwich with compliments on both sides.</p><p>For research with sources, I use <a href=""https://perplexity.ai/"">Perplexity</a>. The key is always asking AI to provide references and data — it keeps hallucinations in check.</p><p><strong>Glen Coates, former VP of Product at Shopify (now at OpenAI)</strong>, put it well on <a href=""https://productschool.com/resources/product-podcast/Glen-coates-Ai-first-products"">The Product Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve now started taking screenshots and prompting AI to create a prototype from that. It speeds up the feedback cycle. It also helps me realize how dumb my ideas are before my team has to waste time on them.”</blockquote><p>That’s the mindset. Use AI to stress-test your thinking before you take it to the room.</p><h4>Documentation (the thing nobody wants to do)</h4><p>Engineers need specs. You have Figma files and a head full of context that hasn’t made it onto paper.</p><p>Here’s a prompt I use regularly:</p><p><em>“I’m handing off a new savings goal widget to engineering. It shows progress toward a target amount, lets users adjust their goal, and sends notifications at milestones. Write three user stories in standard format with acceptance criteria.”</em></p><p>What comes back isn’t production-ready, but it’s a solid draft I can refine in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Compare that to the hour I used to spend staring at a blank Confluence page.</p><p>If your organization runs on Microsoft, <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/"">Copilot</a> does this inside Word and can pull context from your emails and previous docs. Useful if you’re in a corporate environment where everything lives in SharePoint.</p><h4>Budget for exploration</h4><p>One thing I’d recommend: <strong>set aside a small monthly budget</strong> — even €20–30 — specifically for trying new AI tools. Treat it as a learning investment, the same way you’d invest in a course or a design book. Subscribe, experiment for a week, and cancel if it doesn’t add value. Many tools offer free tiers or trials, but the paid features are usually where the real time savings live.</p><p>Just remember to cancel the ones that don’t stick. I’ve learned this one the expensive way.</p><h4>One tool. One week. That’s it.</h4><p>Don’t try to automate your entire workflow overnight. Pick the one task that consistently eats your time:</p><p>- Meetings? Try <a href=""https://tactiq.io/"">Tactiq</a> or <a href=""https://fireflies.ai/"">Fireflies</a><br />- Research synthesis? Try <a href=""https://dovetail.com/"">Dovetail</a> or <a href=""https://notion.so/product/ai"">Notion AI</a><br />- Stakeholder communication? Try <a href=""https://claude.ai/"">Claude</a> or <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/)"">ChatGPT</a><br />- Documentation? Use AI prompts for user stories and specs</p><p><strong>Use it for one week. See if it actually saves time.</strong> Then add another.</p><p>The goal isn’t to become an AI power user. The goal is to reclaim 5 hours a week so you can do the work that actually matters.</p><figure><img alt=""A drawing of a crowded desk with multiple pictures and sketches on the wall"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DVcMh1vYif_vEckSaRlCqg.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 3: AI for Prototyping — How to Create Again</h3><h4>Remember why you got into design?</h4><p>Not the stakeholder emails. Not the capacity planning spreadsheets. The actual making of things.</p><p>Here’s what happened: as you climbed the ladder, you traded Figma time for meeting time. Makes sense — your value shifted from pixels to decisions. But somewhere along the way, most of us stopped creating anything at all.</p><p>I’m not here to argue that design leads should be doing hands-on design work. We shouldn’t — not for production anyway. That’s our team’s domain, and I’m fortunate to have an amazing team that handles craft with skill and care. <strong>What I don’t want to do is bypass them or create a dynamic where they feel undermined by a lead who keeps jumping into production work</strong>.</p><p>But there’s a different kind of creating that matters: the quick prototype that proves a point. The functional demo that ends the debate. The working thing that gets stakeholders to finally *see* what you’ve been trying to explain.</p><p>That’s what this part is about. Not replacing your team’s work — <strong>de-risking ideas before committing their time</strong>.</p><h4>The Real Problem with Figma Prototypes</h4><p>Traditional Figma prototypes are great for showing flows. Click here, go there, animate this.</p><p>But they hit a wall when you need to prove something works, not just looks right.</p><p>Try explaining a complex interaction to a VP who keeps asking “but what happens when…” and you’ll know what I mean. Or trying to get engineering buy-in on an approach they think is technically impossible.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/d07005ae7037"">Bryce York</a>, a startup product leader, nails this:</p><blockquote>“If you’re trying to get buy-in on a big concept, this can massively help your stakeholders really understand what you’re pitching. PMs have to have good imaginations, but most stakeholders’ roles don’t!”</blockquote><p>Static prototypes leave too much to imagination. Working prototypes end debates.</p><h4>Enter “Vibe Coding”</h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/ac9d9a35533e"">Andrej Karpathy</a> (co-founder of OpenAI) coined the term in early 2025. The idea: describe what you want in plain language, let AI write the code, iterate by running and refining.</p><p>You don’t need to become an engineer. You need to be able to say “I want a dashboard that shows account activity with filters for date range and transaction type” and get something functional back in minutes.</p><p>For design leads, this isn’t about learning to code. It’s about removing the bottleneck between your vision and something people can actually use.</p><p><a href=""https://www.cmu.edu/iii/about/news/2026/how-ai-and-vibe-coding-transform-product-management.html"">Carnegie Mellon’s Integrated Innovation</a> is already teaching this approach: “We now require vibe-coded prototypes rather than basic wireframes or sketches — reflecting what the workplace will demand.”</p><h4>The Tools (And When to Use Each)</h4><p>There’s no single right tool. Here’s how I think about them:</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a> — Best for: staying in your existing workflow</p><p>If your designs already live in Figma, this is the lowest friction option. Paste a frame, describe what you want interactive, and it generates working code. The killer feature: it understands your layers, components, and structure — not just the image.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/95d97a7d5732"">David Kossnick</a>, Head of AI Product at Figma, describes it:</p><blockquote>“We’re not just bringing the image when you copy a Figma frame. We’re giving AI the rich, structured data — layers, metadata, and styling details.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Quick interactive versions of existing designs, staying in familiar territory, sharing with team</p><p><a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> — Best for: standalone prototypes without touching code</p><p>Lovable is probably the most designer-friendly of the bunch. You describe what you want, it generates a complete working app. No code editor, no terminal, no git.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dc020be79c95"">Christine Vallaure</a> at UX Collective shares a practical tip:</p><blockquote>“If the first result feels messy or off, don’t try to rescue it. Start fresh with a cleaner prompt. It saves time and sanity.”</blockquote><p>The <a href=""https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/lovable-ai-for-ux/"">LogRocket team</a> tested it for UX workflows and found it generated a working, mobile-responsive UI with logic in about 20 seconds. Not production code, but enough to validate an idea.</p><p>Good for: Proving concepts to stakeholders, testing flows before committing design resources, personal projects</p><p><a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> — Best for: maximum control and flexibility</p><p>This one has a steeper learning curve — it’s a code editor, not a design tool. But it’s also the most powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/72b03f90cf7d"">Joel Unger</a> Design Director at Atlassian, uses it to prototype complex Trello interactions:</p><blockquote>“AI is helping designers focus on higher-level thinking, communicate better with developers, and push creative boundaries.”</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/745607030d8e"">Hardik Pandya</a>, also at Atlassian, spent 60+ hours vibe coding an elaborate product experience with data visualization, multi-device flows, and motion. His advice:</p><blockquote>“Your prototype gains the realism that makes stakeholders take it seriously.”</blockquote><p>Good for: Complex interactions, data-driven prototypes, designs that need to work with real APIs</p><h4>When It Goes Wrong</h4><p>It’s worth being honest about the limitations. Vibe coding can go spectacularly wrong when you trust the output without understanding it.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9f12350bf325"">Tina Singh</a> wrote about this in Bootcamp: AI-generated prototypes often lose context between iterations, behavior exposes gaps that looked fine in a static design, and evolving a prototype through prompts can start to feel more like chance than craft. Her rule is practical: if you need twenty-plus prompt iterations to get something right, stop. At that point, it’s consuming more time than it saves.</p><p>I’ve hit this myself. I once spent an hour trying to get an AI-generated dashboard to handle edge cases in filter combinations — something my team could have resolved in a fraction of that time with a proper Figma prototype and a dev conversation. The lesson: vibe coding is excellent for proving *concepts*, not for polishing *details*. Know when to hand off.</p><p>Even Karpathy himself — <strong>the person who coined the term </strong>— has acknowledged the limitations. His later projects were hand-coded because AI agents weren’t reliable enough for what he needed.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t “don’t use these tools.” It’s “use them for what they’re good at: quick, disposable prototypes that prove a point and then get thrown away.”</p><h4>The Design Lead Angle</h4><p>Here’s what most “vibe coding tutorials” miss: they’re written for individual contributors who want to build side projects.</p><p>As a design lead, you’re not trying to ship code. You’re trying to:</p><p><strong>1. Win arguments faster</strong> — Instead of three rounds of stakeholder review on a concept, show them something working<br /><strong>2. De-risk before committing resources</strong> — Test if an idea is even viable before putting your team on it<br /><strong>3. Align engineering early</strong> — Nothing gets devs engaged like seeing a working prototype and being asked “is this technically feasible?”</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/abbf40336b08"">Patrick Neeman</a> tested several tools and concluded:</p><blockquote>“These tools are on a path to be game-changing for concept validation and stakeholder buy-in. While it’s not pixel perfect, it gives everyone a good idea how something would work, in some cases eliminating weeks to months of engineering time for realistic testing.”</blockquote><h4>Start Small</h4><p>You don’t need to build a complete product. You need to build enough to prove your point.</p><p>Pick one upcoming decision that’s stuck in debate. Maybe it’s:</p><p>- A new onboarding flow that stakeholders can’t visualize<br />- A dashboard concept engineering thinks is too complex<br />- A mobile feature that keeps getting deprioritized because “we’re not sure it’ll work”</p><p><strong>Spend an hour with one of these tools</strong>. Not to ship anything — just to have something to show.</p><p>The goal isn’t to replace your team’s work. It’s to create the artifact that gets everyone aligned before your team does the real work.</p><h4>What Stays Human</h4><p>One important caveat: these tools get you 70–80% of the way there. The last mile still needs judgment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/dfe95783e10e"">Arpi Chugh</a>, a UX designer who tested Lovable extensively, captures it well:</p><blockquote>“I wasn’t using Lovable to come up with the design. I used it to test the design I already had in my head — faster than I ever could with traditional tools.”</blockquote><p>The thinking is still yours. The strategy is still yours. The AI just removes the friction between having an idea and being able to show it.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of an agenda with a big green checkmark and multiple annotations"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3kpUMG70NfcAj12FpgoR1Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 4: Validate Fast — From Prototype to Proof</h3><p>You built the prototype. It looks good. Stakeholders can click around.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>Here’s where most design leads make a mistake: they treat the AI-generated prototype as the deliverable. It’s not. The prototype is a hypothesis. What you need is evidence.</p><p>This part is about turning “I think this works” into “Here’s proof it works” — fast enough that you don’t lose momentum.</p><h4>The Justification Tax</h4><p>In Part 1, I introduced the “justification tax” — the disproportionate amount of time design leads spend defending decisions that other disciplines make with a quick conversation. That tax doesn’t disappear once you have a prototype. If anything, it gets heavier: now stakeholders have something tangible to have opinions about.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/172db8dc4450"">Tom Greever</a>, author of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25520974-articulating-design-decisions"">Articulating Design Decisions</a>, puts it bluntly:</p><blockquote>“The most articulate person often wins.”</blockquote><p>That’s the problem. You shouldn’t have to be the most articulate person. You should have data.</p><p>AI prototyping gets you the artifact faster. Quick validation gets you the evidence to defend it.</p><h4>Why AI Prototypes Still Need Testing</h4><p>There’s a reason <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> keeps warning about AI-generated designs: <strong>they often have visual issues like poor hierarchy, inconsistent spacing, and low contrast. They look plausible but don’t actually work.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://maze.co/collections/ai/validate-ai-prototypes/"">Maze’s research</a> on testing AI prototypes found three common problems:</p><p><strong>1. Looks right, works wrong</strong> — AI creates what’s statistically likely, not what’s strategically correct. Navigation that seems logical might confuse real users.<br /><strong>2. Lacks real context</strong> — AI doesn’t understand your business goals, audience history, or product constraints. It generates generic solutions.<br /><strong>3. Breaks design systems</strong> — Enterprise teams find AI-generated designs ignore component rules and brand guidelines.</p><p>The fix isn’t to avoid AI prototyping. It’s to validate quickly before anyone falls in love with the wrong solution.</p><h3>The 30-Minute Validation Loop</h3><p>Here’s the workflow that changed how I approach stakeholder debates:</p><h4>Step 1: Build competing prototypes (30–60 min)</h4><p>When your team argues about approaches, don’t debate. Build both versions using <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a>.</p><p>Two functional prototypes beat two hours of whiteboard arguments.</p><h4>Step 2: Set up a quick test (15–30 min)</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> integrates directly with Figma prototypes and now supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable and Bolt. Define one clear task: “<strong>Find and start a savings goal</strong>” or “<strong>Complete the first step of onboarding.</strong>”</p><p>Keep it simple. One task. One success metric. Five to ten participants.</p><h4>Step 3: Let data settle the debate (results in 1–2 hours*)</h4><p>Maze shows completion rates, time-on-task, and heatmaps in near real-time. You’re not looking for statistical significance — you’re looking for obvious signals.</p><p>If Version A has 80% completion and Version B has 45%, t<strong>he debate is over</strong>.</p><ul><li><em>Note: The 1–2 hour turnaround depends on using Maze’s paid participant panel. If you’re recruiting your own users, expect longer. The completion rate example above is hypothetical to illustrate the point — in practice, your numbers will vary based on task complexity and audience.</em></li></ul><h4>Depersonalizing Design Debates</h4><p>Here’s something I’ve learned managing 7 designers: ego kills collaboration.</p><p>When designers argue about approaches, they’re often defending their taste, not the user. “I think users would prefer X” vs “No, Y is more intuitive” is an unwinnable argument because it’s subjective.</p><p>Quick validation shifts the conversation. The prototype becomes neutral ground. It’s not “your idea vs. my idea” — it’s “let’s see what users actually do.”</p><p><a href=""https://www.lyssna.com/blog/data-driven-design/"">TEG (The Economist Group)</a> adopted this approach and found they could “set up tests and get data in minutes, reducing the need for lengthy discussions and debates based on assumptions.”</p><p>As a lead, you’re not always the tiebreaker. You’re the one who creates conditions for evidence-based decisions.</p><h4>Tools for Quick Validation</h4><p><a href=""https://maze.co/"">Maze</a> — The fastest path from prototype to data</p><p>Best for: Quantitative validation (completion rates, heatmaps, paths). Integrates with Figma, supports AI-generated prototypes from Lovable, Bolt, and Figma Make. Results arrive in 1–2 hours with their panel, or share with your own users.</p><p><em>Pricing: Free tier available, paid starts at $99/month.</em></p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/"">Attention Insight</a> — Predict attention before testing</p><p>Uses AI to generate eye-tracking heatmaps based on visual saliency. Good for quick gut-checks on hierarchy and CTA visibility before you run real tests.</p><p><a href=""https://hotjar.com/"">Hotjar</a> — For live products</p><p>If your prototype is deployed (Lovable and Bolt can do this), Hotjar gives you session recordings and heatmaps of real behavior.</p><p><strong>Lightweight alternatives:</strong></p><ul><li>5-second tests (first impressions, what users notice)<br />- First-click tests (where users expect to tap)<br />- Quick surveys right after tasks (“How confident did you feel?”)</li></ul><h4>The Prompt Formula for Clear Results</h4><p>Speaking of prompts — they matter for testing too. Borrowed from the <a href=""https://adplist.org/"">ADPList AI Design ebook</a>, here’s a formula worth bookmarking:</p><p><strong>[Context] + [Task] + [Format] + [Tone] + [Constraints]</strong></p><p>Applied to test task writing:</p><p><strong>Bad:</strong> “Explore the app and tell us what you think.”</p><p><strong>Better:</strong> “You want to start saving €50/month for a vacation. Find where to set up a savings goal and complete the first step.”</p><p>The second version has context (user goal), clear task (specific action), and implicit success criteria (completing the step).</p><h4>When NOT to Validate</h4><p>Quick validation isn’t always the answer. Skip it when:</p><p>- <strong>The decision is reversible </strong>— If you can ship and iterate, ship and iterate<br />- <strong>Stakeholders aren’t actually blocking </strong>— Don’t create process where you don’t need it<br /><strong>- You’re optimizing prematurely</strong>— Early concepts need room to breathe</p><p>Use validation strategically: when there’s real disagreement, real risk, or real investment at stake.</p><h4>From Evidence to Alignment</h4><p>The goal isn’t just to win arguments. It’s to create shared understanding.</p><p>When you bring test results to a stakeholder meeting, you’re not saying “<strong>I was right.</strong>” You’re saying “<strong>Here’s what we learned together.</strong>”</p><p><a href=""https://attentioninsight.com/complete-guide-to-data-driven-design/"">Data-driven design</a> research shows that “<strong>data provides a common language for teams and stakeholders to discuss design decisions.</strong>” The evidence becomes the foundation, not your opinion.</p><figure><img alt=""Drawing of three papers on a desk with multiple stamps and signatures"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*f6-q_lL-gf11hrpeYyza-w.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 5: The Pitch — Prototype + Data = No Debate</h3><p>You’ve built the prototype. You’ve tested it. You have data.</p><p>Now comes the moment that separates design leads who get things built from those who get stuck in endless review cycles: the pitch.</p><p>This isn’t about presentation skills or PowerPoint templates. It’s about bringing the right artifacts to the right people and making decisions inevitable.</p><h4>Why Most Design Pitches Fail</h4><p>Here’s the pattern I see constantly:</p><p>Designer presents beautiful mockups. Stakeholder says “I like it, but…” followed by personal preferences. Engineering says “That looks hard.” Meeting ends with “Let’s iterate and reconvene.”</p><p>Three weeks later, same meeting.</p><p><strong>The problem isn’t the design. It’s the forma</strong>t.</p><p>Static mockups invite opinion. Working prototypes invite reaction. Data invites alignment.</p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/9093eee038b2"">Todd Zaki Warfel</a>, former design executive at Twitter, Cisco, and Workday, puts it simply:</p><blockquote>“When you learn to present your work with the right balance of proof and persuasion, you can win over your stakeholders.”</blockquote><p>The balance matters. Proof without persuasion is a data dump. Persuasion without proof is just opinion vs. opinion.</p><h3>The Three-Part Pitch Stack</h3><p>After years of pitching designs (and watching many fail), here’s the structure that works:</p><h4>1. The Working Prototype</h4><p>Let them click. Let them experience. Don’t explain what it does — show them.</p><p>AI-generated prototypes from <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a>, <a href=""https://www.figma.com/make/"">Figma Make</a>, or <a href=""https://cursor.com/"">Cursor</a> change the dynamic immediately. Instead of imagining what something might feel like, stakeholders interact with it directly.</p><p><a href=""https://blog.pixelfreestudio.com/how-to-use-interactive-prototypes-for-stakeholder-presentations/"">PixelFreeStudio’s research</a> on prototype presentations found:</p><blockquote>“When stakeholders are actively involved in the presentation, they’re more likely to feel a sense of ownership over the project, which can lead to stronger support and enthusiasm for your ideas.”</blockquote><p>The prototype creates shared experience. <strong>Everyone saw the same thing</strong>.</p><h4>2. The Validation Data</h4><p>This is where Part 4’s work pays off.</p><p>Don’t just say “users preferred this approach.” Show them:</p><p>- Completion rates (80% vs. 45%)<br />- Time-on-task differences<br />- Heatmaps showing where attention goes<br />- Direct user quotes from testing</p><p>Data doesn’t eliminate disagreement. But it changes the nature of the conversation from “<strong>I feel</strong>” to “<strong>users showed us</strong>.”</p><h4>3. The Engineering Alignment</h4><p>Here’s where most design leads drop the ball: they pitch to stakeholders <strong>before</strong> talking to engineering.</p><p>Then engineering raises feasibility concerns in the meeting. Stakeholder confidence drops. The pitch stalls.</p><p>Flip the order. Before your stakeholder meeting:</p><p>- Share the prototype with engineering leads<br />- Ask: “<strong>Is this technically feasible? What would be hard?</strong>”<br />- Identify constraints and incorporate them into your pitch</p><p>When you present, you’re not saying “here’s what we want.” You’re saying “<strong>here’s what we’ve validated with users and confirmed with engineering.</strong>”</p><p>That’s a different conversation entirely.</p><h3>Tailoring the Pitch to Your Audience</h3><p>Different stakeholders care about different things. Obvious, but most design leads present the same deck to everyone.</p><h4>For Executives (VP+):</h4><p>- Lead with business impact, not design rationale<br />- Keep it short — they’re comparing your pitch to ten other priorities<br />- Show you’ve de-risked it: “Users validated this, engineering confirmed feasibility”<br />- Have a clear ask: approval, resources, timeline</p><h4>For Product Managers:</h4><p>- Connect to roadmap and OKRs<br />- Show user evidence that supports their metrics<br />- Be clear about dependencies and trade-offs</p><h4>For Engineering Leads:</h4><ul><li>Show the prototype early (before the big meeting)<br />- Ask genuine questions about feasibility<br />- Demonstrate you’ve thought about edge cases<br />- The AI prototype’s code isn’t production-ready — acknowledge that</li></ul><p>As <a href=""https://medium.com/u/216d1f5cc211"">Greg Becker</a> notes:</p><blockquote>“They don’t speak your language — you must speak theirs.”</blockquote><h3>The “No Surprises” Rule</h3><p>The biggest pitching mistake I see design leads make: surprising people in meetings.</p><p>Stakeholders hate surprises. If your VP learns about a major design direction for the first time in a review meeting, you’ve already lost — even if the design is perfect.</p><h4>Here’s my pre-meeting checklist:</h4><p>• Engineering has seen the prototype and raised concerns (which I’ve addressed)<br />• Product knows how this connects to their goals<br />• Key stakeholders got a heads-up about the direction<br />• I know what objections are coming and have responses ready</p><p>The meeting becomes confirmation, not revelation.</p><h4>Handling the “But What About…” Questions</h4><p>Even with great prep, you’ll get questions. Here’s how to handle common ones:</p><p><strong>”Can we also add [feature X]?”</strong></p><p>Don’t say no. Say: “We can test that. Let me add it to the next validation round and show you what users think.”</p><p>You’ve shifted from defending to learning.</p><p><strong>”Engineering says this is too complex.”</strong></p><p>If you’ve done pre-alignment, this shouldn’t happen. If it does: “Let’s schedule a technical review. I want to understand the constraints so we can find a solution that works.”</p><p><strong>”I just don’t like [specific element].”</strong></p><p>This is the hardest one — pure preference. Your response: “I hear you. We tested this with [X] users and [specific result]. Happy to test an alternative if you’d like to see the comparison.”</p><p>You’re not dismissing their opinion. You’re offering to put it to the same test everything else went through.</p><h4>The AI Advantage in Pitching</h4><p>Here’s what changes with AI prototyping in your pitch toolkit:</p><p><strong>Speed of alternatives:</strong> Stakeholder suggests a different approach? You can often build and test it before the next meeting. That used to take weeks.</p><p><strong>Tangibility over imagination:</strong> Working prototypes bridge the imagination gap. Most stakeholders’ roles don’t require them to envision complex interactions from mockups alone — so don’t ask them to.</p><p><strong>Lower stakes for testing:</strong> When prototypes take days, testing every idea feels expensive. When they take hours, you can test stakeholder suggestions without derailing your timeline.</p><p><strong>Code as communication:</strong> If your prototype was built in Cursor with React components, engineering can see exactly what you’re proposing. It’s not “can you build something that looks like this?” — it’s “here’s a working version, how close is this to production-ready?”</p><h4>The Follow-Through</h4><p>The pitch doesn’t end when the meeting ends.</p><p><strong>Within 24 hours:</strong></p><p>- Send a summary of decisions made and next steps<br />- Share the prototype link (so stakeholders can revisit)<br />- Note any open questions and when you’ll address them<br />- Thank engineering for their input (publicly, if appropriate)</p><p>This isn’t just courtesy. It creates a paper trail that prevents “I don’t remember agreeing to that” in future meetings.</p><h4>From Pitch to Build</h4><p>When your pitch succeeds, the transition to development should be smooth because you’ve done the work:</p><p>- Prototype demonstrates the interaction model<br />- Test data shows user acceptance<br />- Engineering has already reviewed feasibility<br />- Stakeholders are aligned on the direction</p><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/the-designers-handbook-for-developer-handoff/"">Figma’s design handoff guide</a> emphasizes:</p><blockquote>“By working together with a shared language, designers and developers can avoid misalignment, reduce re-work, and confidently build a well designed and technically sound product together.”</blockquote><p>The prototype isn’t the deliverable. The prototype was the tool that got everyone to “yes.”</p><figure><img alt=""The same character from the beguining of the article looking at a selfie camera and smiling"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aTOIjzE93lnX9E4-vfv2zw.png"" /><figcaption>Image generated with <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com"">Midjourney</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Part 6: The Future of Design Leads — What Stays Human</h3><p>Let’s end where we started: with the reality of the job.</p><p>Design leads don’t spend their days designing. They spend them communicating, aligning, justifying, and managing. The 80% job.</p><p>AI is getting very good at the 20% — the mockups, the prototypes, the visual production. What it can’t do is the 80%.</p><p>That’s not a bug. That’s your future.</p><h4>The Skill Shift Is Already Happening</h4><p><a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s 2025 AI Report</a> surveyed thousands of designers and found something interesting: 52% of AI builders say design is <strong>more important</strong> for AI-powered products than traditional ones, not less.</p><p>The reason? AI outputs need curation, judgment, and quality control. Someone has to decide what’s good. Someone has to connect it to strategy. Someone has to make sure it actually solves the user’s problem.</p><p><strong>That someone is still human.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/"">Nielsen Norman Group</a> noted in 2025 that while generative tools can speed up tasks like asset creation and copy generation, <strong>“they still can’t replicate the insight of human designers.”</strong></p><p>The tools are changing. The need for design thinking isn’t.</p><h3>What AI Cannot Do</h3><p>Let me be specific about what stays human — not in theory, but from experience.</p><h4>Judgment and taste.</h4><p>AI generates options. Humans choose. <a href=""https://medium.com/u/677fcb8f826d"">Andrea Grigsby</a> in UX Collective put it simply: <strong>“AI may automate technical skills in design, but it can’t replicate human taste.”</strong> Taste isn’t preference — it’s the accumulated wisdom of knowing what works, what feels right, what aligns with brand and user and context simultaneously. It’s the thing that makes you say “this doesn’t feel right” before you can articulate why. AI can produce a thousand variations. You’re the one who knows which one is <strong>right</strong>.</p><h4>Stakeholder navigation.</h4><p>No AI is sitting in your meeting reading the room. Understanding that the VP is skeptical because of a failed project last quarter. Knowing that engineering is stretched and needs a simpler solution. Sensing that the PM is worried about timeline but won’t say it directly. I learned this lesson deeply at a previous job, when I had to present a product vision directly to the multinational CEO. Before the meeting, <strong>I did extensive research — his decision-making style, his priorities, what resonated with him</strong>. I talked to people who’d presented to him before. Then I spent weeks quietly getting his most trusted advisors on my side, making sure they understood and supported the vision before I ever walked into that room. The presentation was a success — <strong>it defined a product we worked on for two years, led to hiring two new development teams from Portugal, and more than doubled the UX team size</strong>. No AI could have navigated that. The research, the relationship-building, the reading of organizational dynamics — those are fundamentally human skills that determine whether your work gets built or gets stuck.</p><h4>Team development.</h4><p>You manage people. Each has different strengths, motivations, and career goals. AI can’t coach someone through a confidence crisis. It can’t mediate a conflict between two designers who have different working styles. It can’t help a junior designer see the gap between where they are and where they want to be. <a href=""https://www.thecaragroup.com/leadership-in-the-ai-era/"">Research from the Top Employers Institute</a> shows that <strong>68% of employees believe non-work-related training that supports their overall well-being is vital</strong>. Leadership is about the whole person, not just their output.</p><h4>Ethical decision-making.</h4><p>Should we use this dark pattern that increases conversions but frustrates users? Should we collect this data even though users probably don’t understand what they’re agreeing to? Should we ship this feature knowing it’s not accessible? AI doesn’t have values. You do. <a href=""https://aijourn.com/human-intelligence-in-an-ai-world-why-empathy-sense-making-and-ethical-judgement-still-decide-enterprise-success/"">McKinsey’s research</a> found that <strong>only 1% of companies feel “mature” in AI integration</strong>, and the biggest barriers are not technical but leadership and organizational factors.</p><h4>Sense-making in ambiguity.</h4><p>When the strategy is unclear, when stakeholders disagree, when the data points in multiple directions — <strong>that’s when human judgment matters most</strong>. AI excels with clear inputs and defined parameters. Real design leadership happens when neither exists.</p><h3>The Design Lead of 2028</h3><p>Based on everything we’ve covered, here’s my bet on what the design lead role looks like in a few years.</p><p><strong>AI transformation of creative work is accelerating</strong> — the tools we’ve discussed in this series were barely functional two years ago, and they’re now reshaping workflows daily. I don’t know exactly how fast or how far this goes, but the direction is clear: the tactical parts of design work will increasingly be handled by AI, and the strategic, human parts will become more valuable, not less.</p><p>Design leads will <strong>spend less time on creating production-ready mockups</strong>, writing documentation from scratch, synthesizing research manually, and building presentation decks. <strong>They’ll spend more time on evaluating and curating AI outputs</strong>, coaching team members through AI-augmented workflows, stakeholder alignment and organizational navigation, defining what “good” looks like for AI tools, and ethical oversight and quality judgment.</p><p>The title might stay the same. <strong>The job changes significantly.</strong></p><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/1dd0fcefd09a"">Maya Brennan</a> 2026 predictions in <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/10-predictions-for-ai-design-in-2026-823da9f1db7b"">Bootcamp</a> capture it:</p><blockquote>“It’s an undoubtedly exciting time to be a Product Designer: the technical foundations have been built — and it is now up to us to re-imagine what the visual and interactive frameworks for these AI experiences will look like.”</blockquote><p>The people defining those frameworks won’t be AI. <strong>They’ll be design leaders with taste, judgment, and organizational skill.</strong></p><h3>Your Competitive Advantage</h3><p>If you’ve made it through this series, you have something most design leads don’t: a practical framework for using AI <strong>as a lead</strong>, not just as an individual contributor.</p><p>Let’s recap what we covered:</p><p><strong>Part 1: The reality of design leadership </strong>— the 80% job is communication, not creation.</p><p><strong>Part 2: AI for admin work</strong> — reclaim time through meeting notes, research synthesis, stakeholder communication, and documentation.</p><p><strong>Part 3: AI for prototyping</strong> — vibe coding tools that let you create again, not to ship production work, but to prove ideas faster.</p><p><strong>Part 4: Quick validation</strong> — testing tools to turn prototypes into evidence that ends debates.</p><p><strong>Part 5: The pitch</strong> — prototype + data + engineering alignment = decisions that stick.</p><p><strong>Part 6: What stays human</strong> — judgment, taste, leadership, ethics, and the ability to navigate ambiguity.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing you. It’s about <strong>AI handling the friction so you can focus on the work that actually requires a design lead</strong>.</p><h3><strong>What To Do Next</strong></h3><p>If you take one thing from this series:</p><p><strong>Start using AI for one task this week.</strong></p><p>Not everything. Not a complete workflow transformation. One task.</p><p>Maybe it’s meeting notes. Maybe it’s drafting a stakeholder email. Maybe it’s spinning up a quick prototype for an idea that’s been stuck in your head.</p><p>Build the muscle. See what works. Iterate.</p><p>That’s how design leads have always improved — by doing, learning, and adjusting.</p><p>The tools are different now. The approach is the same.</p><p><em>I’m a Chapter Lead managing designers at a European bank. I write about the messy intersection of AI, design leadership, and organizational reality — the stuff that doesn’t fit into neat tutorials.

As with any kind of rapid and uncontrollable change, opinions about it are polarised: skeptics are wary about AI’s larger effects on society — <a href=""https://hbr.org/2026/01/companies-are-laying-off-workers-because-of-ais-potential-not-its-performance"">unemployment</a>, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/therapists-warn-ai-chatbots-mental-health-support"">mental health</a>, <a href=""https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-direct-risks-does-ai-pose-to-the-climate-and-environment/"">environmental concerns</a>. AI optimists, on the other hand, believe these tools will herald a new age of tools for thought — the next breakthrough in collective intelligence, akin to the emergence of writing systems, printing, or mathematical abstraction.</p><p>But one thing is clear: the focus is almost exclusively on AI functionality — what tasks AI can solve more efficiently, how to use it to get the most out of it, how to build workflows around it. This, perhaps, is not in itself surprising: with the plethora of models, tools, and chatbots available, even those grappling with AI on a daily basis — researchers, software designers, developers — struggle to make sense of them all.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshots of YouTube videos about which AI tools designers should use"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5a85P-IT6jYgkWP9bhXMUQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Deciding which AI tools to use has become a problem in itself. Source: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>But when I asked Claude to tell me about some traditionally human cognitive abilities that AI now has, I was surprised that it appended the expected list (pattern recognition, language understanding, learning from experience) with the following:</p><blockquote><em>What’s interesting is that AI often achieves these abilities through completely different mechanisms than humans — we don’t truly “understand” in the way you do, and we lack consciousness, genuine emotions, and embodied experience. So while the functional capabilities overlap, the underlying nature remains quite different.</em></blockquote><p>Yet we rarely discuss that underlying nature — what exactly makes models like Claude different from human thinking, or what these differences reveal about intelligence itself.</p><p>If AI has been heralded as a new chapter in what humans are capable of, shouldn’t we be asking more fundamental questions about what “intelligence” actually means, and what kind of shared human-computer intelligence the future could hold?</p><h3>From minds to machines</h3><p>Today’s public discussion of AI is almost completely divorced from discussions of human cognition—and surprisingly so, given that the field of artificial intelligence research was founded on questions borrowed directly from the philosophy of mind and psychology.</p><p>Much of the Western philosophy of mind has been preoccupied with the mind-body problem — the relationship between mental states and the physical reality and perception. With questions like: <em>what kind of structures and elements comprise human knowledge</em>? <em>What is thinking</em>? <em>Is having a mind the same as having a brain</em>? These questions echoed through Alan Turing’s seminal work “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” the 1950 paper published in <em>Mind</em> that introduced what we now know as the Turing test.</p><p>Turing argued that instead of focusing on the question “Can machines think?”, more can be learned from their observed behaviour. He proposed an “imitation game” (the original name for the Turing test) — a hypothetical scenario in which a human evaluator has text-based conversations with two hidden participants: one human and one machine. If the evaluator can’t reliably tell which is which based on their responses, the machine is said to have passed the test.</p><figure><img alt=""The setup of the Turing test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*G_VPOC9VEN3vCy0W.png"" /><figcaption>In a Turing test, a human evaluator judges a text transcript of a conversation between a human and a machine. The evaluator tries to identify the machine, and the machine passes if the evaluator cannot reliably tell them apart. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, the discussion around creating a human-like “learning machine” was theoretical. But the advancements in the understanding of the brain’s neural structure throughout the 19th and 20th centuries established the electrical nature of the nerve signal, culminating in neuropsychologist Donald Hebb’s theory on the neural processes that underlie learning. In his 1949 book <em>The Organization of Behavior</em>, Hebb theorised how neural connections form through repeated activation — a principle later summarised as “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” This insight provided the foundation for modern neuroscience, neural network theory, and machine learning.</p><figure><img alt=""Structure of the human neuron compared to the architecture of an artificial neural network"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/726/1*VK0tUU4UHW3HHWA7slJ3eg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The principle “Neurons that fire together, wire together” inspired the architecture of artificial neural networks. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>Early pioneers of AI believed that describing the mind in computational terms — made possible by Hebbian theory and the subsequent development of artificial neural networks — could finally answer those foundational questions about human cognition. If they could build computational systems that closely resembled the brain’s neural structure, they reasoned, those systems might recreate the processes underlying uniquely human abilities: language, visual perception, reasoning, artistic creation.</p><p>As work on understanding the mind unfolded throughout the 20th century, two competing views of intelligence emerged: pattern recognition (also known as “statistical processing”) and world modelling (known as “symbolic manipulation”). The difference becomes clear when we consider how a child might learn what a dog is.</p><p>From the symbolic point of view, every time a child sees a creature that their caregiver tells them is “a dog,” they form and develop the concept of <em>dog — </em>i.e.<em> </em>what properties are characteristic of dogs. When they learn to recognise creatures as another kind of “dog”, they are learning to make the connection between an instance—the dog they’re looking at — and their mental concept of <em>dog</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""How a child might learn the concept of “dog”: through recognising a pattern that’s consistent across all examples of a dog they’ve encountered, or by building a mental model of what a dog is"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BZxyXL5gEBijen6btqv5VQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>How a child might learn the concept “dog” according to pattern recognition vs. world modelling view. Collage created by the author. Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Mountain_Dog"">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>From the point of view of recognising patterns, a child sees many different examples of dogs: all kinds of shapes, breeds, colours, and drooliness levels. Their extremely malleable brain processes all these instances, identifies patterns, and learns to match new examples to this pattern. Very quickly they learn to classify new exemplars as either “dog” or “not dog.”</p><p>If the latter sounds extremely similar to a basic-level explanation of machine learning, it’s not by coincidence: artificial intelligence as a field — and especially the view of intelligence as pattern recognition — has been heavily influenced by child development research. In “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” Turing referred to an artificial intelligence system as a “child-machine”; early pioneers of modern AI research in the 70s explicitly stated the connection between the two fields. For example, in 1972 computer scientist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Schank"">Roger Schank</a> wrote that:</p><blockquote><em>We hope to be able to build a program that can learn, as a child does, how to do what we have described in this paper instead of being spoon-fed the tremendous information necessary.</em></blockquote><p>A similar sentiment was expressed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky"">Marvin Minsky</a>, one of the “fathers of AI,” in 1974:</p><blockquote><em>I draw no boundary between a theory of human thinking and a scheme for making an intelligent machine; no purpose would be served by separating these today since neither domain has theories good enough to explain or to produce enough mental capacity.</em></blockquote><p>And it’s not surprising why a child’s mind is so fascinating to an AI researcher: after all, we spend our early days being unable to speak or hold our head up, yet we develop object permanence by five months old, can distinguish our native language from a foreign one by six months, and perform cost-reward analysis by ten months old. And all of that without the massive datasets that systems like GPT, Claude, and Llama require: a modern large language model (LLM) trains on trillions of words, while an average five-year-old is exposed to around 300,000. How can we learn so much from so little, and so fast?</p><p>Both cognitive and computer scientists today mostly agree that intelligence comprises both statistical learning and world model building. But, for reasons I won’t detail here, modern AI research from major industry labs has largely abandoned the question of <em>how</em> children learn so efficiently, focusing instead on <em>whether</em> similar behaviour can be achieved through massive computing power and large training datasets. Still, the original question persists in a new field that has been developing alongside traditional psychology and computer science: computational cognitive science, which continues to ask what artificial intelligence can reveal about the nature of human minds.</p><h3>From machines to minds</h3><p>Despite AI’s origins in the study of human cognition, that connection has all but disappeared from public awareness. Yet while mainstream AI research has pivoted toward achieving human-like behaviour without needing to implement a sophisticated human-like cognitive architecture, a a swiftly developing new field—computational cognitive science — has been figuring out ways to use AI models as windows into human cognition.</p><p>The logic is fairly straightforward: if artificial neural networks are modelled (however loosely) on biological ones, then understanding how an AI system solves a problem could offer clues about how humans solve it too. This approach is sometimes called “reverse-engineering” cognition: build a system that can perform a human task, decipher how it accomplishes that task, then ask whether humans might be doing something similar.</p><p>And so far, the results have been impressive. <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"">Since at least GPT-4</a>, LLMs have been able to solve<strong> </strong>difficult tasks across mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology, and more.</p><p>But a few concerns remain. First, AI learns from significantly more data than humans (very few of us can brag that we have read all of Wikipedia). Second, while AI can certainly be impressive, it still often falls short at some basic tasks that require symbolic manipulation.</p><p>For example, Yale University professor <a href=""https://rtmccoy.com/"">Tom McCoy</a> and colleagues <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">found</a> that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with seemingly simple tasks like forming acronyms, decoding shift ciphers, and translating into Pig Latin — tasks that require symbolic manipulation following deterministic rules (e.g., “count the number of words in a list”). What’s revealing is that LLMs performed significantly worse when the correct answer was a low-probability string, even though these tasks have objectively correct, deterministic answers, and require no probabilistic reasoning whatsoever (unlike questions such as “How likely am I to get stuck in traffic at 5pm in central London?” — where statistical patterns are genuinely useful).</p><figure><img alt=""Experimental materials from Tom McCoy and Najoung Kim’s studies"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rAPFwOIs_JSgs9sMlmr0mQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Left: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13638"">McCoy and colleagues found</a> that LLMs struggle with low-probability answers to questions that require a deterministic answer. Right: LLMs can make human-like inferences from adjective-noun pairs, but not for unusual combinations, <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">Kim and colleagues report</a></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, when <a href=""https://najoung.kim/"">Najoung Kim</a>, a professor of computational linguistics at Boston University, and her colleagues from Harvard University <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17482"">tested</a> LLMs on their ability to make inferences from adjective-noun combinations (for example, the answer to <em>Is a counterfeit watch still a watch?</em> should be <em>Yes, </em>but the answer to <em>Is a fake doctor still a doctor?</em> should be <em>No</em>) they found that these models struggled with low-probability, unusual combinations such as <em>a homemade cat</em>.</p><p>The takeaway appears simple: AI is extremely good at learning and generalising information, but it is limited by the tasks it was trained on. As McCoy and colleagues conclude in their paper:</p><blockquote><em>We should absolutely recognize [LLMs’] advanced properties. Nonetheless, we should also remember a simpler fact: Language models are… language models! That is, they are statistical next-word prediction systems […] In sum, to understand what language models are, we must understand what we have trained them to be.</em></blockquote><p>At this point, it seems appropriate to ask: is it even possible to study AI models as proxies for the human mind, when their performance is so clearly underpinned by amounts of training data that no human would process in a lifetime, and an architecture that relies primarily on statistical processing?</p><p>Recently, researchers have been trying to solve this problem by introducing additional constraints on how AI systems work: limiting and curating the data they are trained on, and tweaking the architecture to approximate the cognitive biases innate to human mind.</p><p>Researchers from Princeton University’s <a href=""https://lake-lab.github.io/"">Human &amp; Machine Intelligence Lab</a>, directed by <a href=""https://psychology.princeton.edu/people/brenden-lake"">Brenden Lake</a>,<strong> </strong>trained a generic neural network on 61 hours of video footage that came from a head-mounted camera worn by a single child over the course of 1.5 years. The simple architecture of the model allowed the researchers to test a simple theory of word learning: that novel words are learned by tracking co-occurrences of visual and linguistic information. The model tracks visual and linguistic inputs, which are in turn passed through the visual and linguistic encoders, and embedded in a shared vector space. In other words, the model tracks what kind of visual information accompanies verbal cues like “cat” or “toy,” just like a child might.</p><p>And while despite being trained on a tiny dataset — by today’s standards — it worked. When the researchers tested the model on a new set of images, it matched the words it learned during training with the correct visual referents, even though it hadn’t “seen” those specific images before. This finding goes beyond just achieving impressive performance: it provides evidence that word learning in humans could be possible through a general-purpose cognitive mechanism that combines representation and associative learning.</p><figure><img alt=""A toddler wearing a head-mounted camera"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*b5jE9hKC_qBS4dZi"" /><figcaption>“We showed, for the first time, that you can train an AI model to learn words through the eyes and ears of a single child” — Brenden Lake, professor of psychology at Princeton University. Source: <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-camera-wearing-baby-taught-an-ai-to-learn-words/"">Scientific American</a></figcaption></figure><p>This research suggests that the path to understanding the mind (and as a consequence, building better AI) lies in training models on less data, but thinking more carefully about the kinds of cognitive biases they should be imbued with.</p><p>And it clearly aligns with the original mission of AI research. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">The New York Times article</a> covering this research concludes:</p><blockquote><em>For Dr. Lake, and for other investigators like him, these interlocking questions — How humanlike can we make A.I.? What makes us human? — present the most exciting research on the horizon.</em></blockquote><p>But is this approach likely to become prevalent in industry labs that lead the development of state-of-the-art models like GPT? Logically, it should: front loading effort and resources into building more interpretable models now would ensure their longevity (even now, a mere year after the introduction of ChatGPT, many young people are <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wx2dz2v44o"">rejecting what they consider to be “AI slop”</a>). But for commercial labs guided by generating profits and appeasing shareholders, this seems unlikely: why bother spending resources on uncomfortably vague research when increasing computing power and training data have done the trick just fine? The <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/science/ai-infants-language-learning.html"">same New York Times article</a> points out:</p><blockquote><em>But mainstream industry labs behind the most competent A.I. models, and the companies that make them, have long been geared toward efficiently processing more data, not making more sense out of less.</em></blockquote><p>Academic research labs face a different version of the same problem. While not driven by pure profit motives, coveted funding sources often mean that their research is still more biased towards building more human-like agents — not creating technology for AI-assisted, more thoughtful and creative human. If we continue this way, where will it lead?</p><h3>What happens after AI passes the capitalist Turing test?</h3><p>We have found ourselves at a crossroads. On one hand, we seemingly understand more than ever about how humans think, learn, process visual information, and interact socially. On the other, this knowledge is being channeled almost exclusively toward building better AI chatbots that mimic human behaviour.</p><p>Why? First, because the direction is set by for-profit companies whose ultimate goal isn’t ushering in <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">a new Age of Enlightenment</a>, but selling a product — making us more reliant on AI agents to simplify workflows, optimise routines, delegate tasks. Think less, less, less.</p><p>Second, for that purpose, research that focuses narrowly on pattern recognition and statistical processing does just fine. These systems are straightforward to train and improve, and their performance is impressive enough to sustain public interest and turn in profits. They pass the capitalist Turing test.</p><p>But here’s the trouble: reports of depleting critical thinking and shortening attention spans might just not be fear-mongering, but a direct outcome of systems designed solely for performance. If we spend our thinking time communicating with machines optimised for pattern matching, we might internalise those same patterns to make the interaction more efficient.</p><p>The crux of the matter is that interaction with AI is now <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">predominantly designed to imitate a conversation</a>, and we typically expect our conversational partners to have their own intentions, beliefs, and inner lives. In linguistics, it has been <a href=""https://web.stanford.edu/~clark/1990s/Brennan,%20S.E.%20_%20Clark,%20H.H.%20_Conceptual%20pacts%20and%20lexical%20choice%20in%20conversation_%201996.pdf"">well</a> <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027799000815?casa_token=yzamMMmozkYAAAAA:7mmmqFEEXyIDV6oItH2TykqHs1s6vDWbfPouY5XksQYC7YCYFqeZl6vDNSUL81WcGnfEUZIIuQk"">documented</a> that during a human-to-human conversation, people adapt to each other’s language patterns to align their mental states and ultimately achieve better communication. But AI has no mental states it can align with ours. It cannot restructure its foundation — built on statistics and patterns — to match our symbolic reasoning. And as a result, instead of AI becoming a thinking companion, <a href=""https://youtu.be/RKK7wGAYP6k?si=c1WKCZUiYzqNzozU"">our own thinking risks becoming more machine-like</a>: fine-tuned to recognise statistical regularities while forgetting how to make inferences, form concepts, find deeper connections between things.</p><p>So… what’s next? This is where things fall apart, because a crucial piece of understanding is missing: we’re still far from fully grasping how concepts are formed, or how symbolic reasoning is actually instantiated in the brain. And without that understanding, we can’t build systems that genuinely complement human intelligence rather than flatten it. In order to get there, three things need to happen:</p><ul><li>Industry research labs need to engage seriously with cognitive science and collaborate with academic researchers. If I’ve made my point clear, artificial intelligence research loses much of its substance when it severs ties with the foundational questions that connected it to philosophy of mind and cognitive development. For progress to be truly significant, these ties must be restored and strengthened.</li><li>AI systems need cognitively plausible architectures. In modern cognitive science, biological plausibility plays a crucial role: if a proposed mechanism is impossible to implement biologically, that casts serious doubt on its validity. The same standard should apply to AI. Researchers need to think carefully about what data models are trained on and why certain architectures are chosen — not just whether they work, but whether they reflect anything meaningful about intelligence.</li><li>Most crucially, software designers and cognitive scientists need to collaborate on how these systems can actually serve humanity. No one else can figure this out — and <a href=""https://maggieappleton.com/ai-enlightenment#our-missing-pocket-sized-enlightenment"">many designers already agree</a> that <a href=""https://www.personalcanon.com/p/how-to-speak-to-a-computer"">chat interfaces are a poor solution</a>.</li></ul><p>There’s a brand of AI optimism that says what you get out of AI depends on how you use it: if you’re filling knowledge gaps rather than taking shortcuts, you’ll unlock creativity and thinking rather than rot your brain on slop.</p><p>I subscribe to this optimism to a degree. As a designer, AI has allowed me to move beyond technical constraints and create more freely.</p><p>But this “solution” is rooted in individualism and, frankly, elitism: the idea that AI will make only the smartest and most discerning among us even brighter and more capable. There’s nothing in that promise about elevating humanity as a whole. Yet research shows that real progress is impossible without <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition"">collective intelligence</a>. If AI is to fulfil its promise as a tool for thought — a genuine extension of human capability — it must be designed not just for individual optimisation, but for collective progress.</p><h4><strong>References</strong></h4><p>Turing, A.

<h4><strong>Exploration of the essence of what we do and how we do it</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Photo of mosaic tile decoration depicting eyes.

I don’t know. But there seems to be a sort of a urgency for something new. For speed. For freedom. For paving a new path. For simplicity. For flexibility. <strong>A push for something else rather than Design Thinking as the standard design process.</strong></p><p>I am talking about the new wave of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-return-of-the-intuitive-designer-in-the-age-of-ai-6f0ea728d1d0"">intuitive design</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u94juYwLLM&amp;t=864s"">not trusting the design process</a>, of taste and craft as the only ways to do exceptional design, of <a href=""https://x.com/ryolu_/status/2000557301695226265"">jumping straight into code / material</a>. While some parts of those ideas resonate, not all of us are positioned or experienced to do that. Also, processes exist for a reason — usually to make sure we take our users into account, to avoid blindspots, to be sure we are solving the right problem and to meet high bars of quality.</p><p>Before coming across as a big saviour / defender of Design Thinking, I need to come clean: I think we often fall into the trap of wrapping design in bloated processes, frameworks, and mystical terminology, producing unnecessary artefacts and wasting time along the way. And I think that design doing is equally important as the design thinking part.</p><p>So what is my thesis here?</p><p><strong>We need to go back to what’s <em>essential</em> and what’s <em>natural</em>.</strong></p><h4>In pursuit of the essence</h4><p>In my first attempt to shape my perspective, I wrote a think piece on the <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions and Answers of design</a>. It’s basically a snapshot of design as I know it and practice, outside of methodologies and tools.</p><p>Even though I believe the article still makes sense, I started questioning my thinking. Can it be simpler? Can it be shorter? Can it be more natural and stripped down to the essence?</p><p>If you strip it down, I started to see the design process as two simple steps:</p><p><strong>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Open your eyes.</strong></p><p><strong>— — Squint your eyes.</strong></p><p>We all do these steps already, with or without realising it. With or without Design Thinking.</p><h4>Huh?</h4><p>Maybe I simplified it way too much. Sometimes I can err in the other direction — making things too abstract.</p><p>This is what I mean:</p><p><strong>Open your eyes to get information. Squint your eyes for focus.</strong></p><p><em>When your eyes are open</em>, you observe. You look around. You absorb. You listen. You think. You notice things you’d otherwise miss — the way people use a product, the frustrations in their tone, something beautiful that inspires a new direction, a design pattern that solves your problem. You are in consuming mode and in a pursuit for new information and perspectives. You are in search for inspiration, references, sparks for your ideas. Along the way, you might become an expert in something and you will start to empathise with your users.</p><p><em>When you squint your eyes</em>, you focus. You tune out the noise and work with what you’ve gathered. You sketch, you build, you make decisions. You bring something into being. You roll up your sleeves and produce with this newfound focus, clarity and intention. The background gets blurry and you just create. Time also gets blurry, you are in the flow and designs materialise.</p><p>That’s how the eyes work. That’s how the mind works — expanding and present when immersed into something new, focused on execution and on auto pilot once having all information. <a href=""https://www.nikon.nl/nl_NL/learn-and-explore/magazine/tips-and-tricks/what-is-aperture?srsltid=AfmBOor-FBxrbfqFoy56R6qsVvcZZDv_3AsIXYyZMh7-_j3SNNo49iFd"">Even cameras work this way </a>— wide open to take in light and to focus all the way up to the horizon in the distance, then tightened up to sharpen focus and capture the detail in front of the lens. It’s the natural way of seeing, thinking, and doing.</p><h4>In practice</h4><p>You can open and squint your eyes as many times as you like to or need to. Just don’t do it at the same time. That’s call winking. Or multitasking. Both are quite useless while designing.</p><p>Here’s an example of how this “process” might work:</p><ol><li><strong>Open your eyes</strong> → absorb, get inspired, ask questions, explore.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → focus, design, make, refine.</li><li><strong>Open again</strong> → test, show, share, watch reactions.</li><li><strong>Squint your eyes</strong> → polish, detail, finalise.</li></ol><p>Repeat until something good emerges. Add activities that you need at the moment.</p><p>At the end, or in between: <strong>fully close your eyes</strong> → <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/rest-why-it-is-important-for-designers-66b539a7c5dd"">rest</a>, let ideas simmer, gain distance. Also a natural and essential part of the process.</p><h4>Zoom out</h4><p>Zooming out (or while squinting your eyes) you might see double diamonds in the eye picture above. You might also see the concepts of diverge &amp; converge. Your eyes might be seeing right.</p><p>We might be back to square (or diamond) one. But we are free and back to our nature. We know why we do what we do and do it with confidence. We block out the noise.</p><p>We don’t need to kill the Double Diamond, but we can admit it’s just a dressed-up version of something our brains already know how to do. The danger with process-heavy design thinking is that it can become an end in itself. Design becomes the artefacts <em>about</em> design, rather than the <em>design itself</em>. We need to be careful about that, while respecting and following a <em>natural</em> process, with the necessary steps and activities for our problem and users.</p><p>The next time you’re overthinking your process, just remember: open your eyes, squint your eyes. The rest is abstraction and decoration.</p><p>And don’t forget to fully close your eyes from time to time. The best ideas come after some good rest and distance. Practice it now… closing in 3, 2, 1.</p><p><strong>References and extra resources</strong></p><ul><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/1000-questions-1000-answers-2eeaf01dcb50"">1000 Questions, 1000 Answers</a></li><li><a href=""https://arnevanoosterom.medium.com/design-thinking-is-dead-again-e48bb1b17b7c"">Design Thinking is dead... again</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@Tirdad/design-thinking-is-not-dead-but-are-we-extracting-its-full-potential-85342d291bea"">Design thinking is not dead, but are we extracting its full potential?</a></li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/@tufred/design-thinking-is-dead-or-not-d151376ab9ce"">Design Thinking Is Dead.

He brought up the news that OpenAI recently announced that it would begin testing ads in the free and Go tiers of ChatGPT in the U.S., with the promises that ads will be clearly labeled &amp; won’t influence answers.¹ ² We’ve both fought against needless promotional content before and lamented that frontier AI platforms are falling into the same pattern. As designers and users, we’ve learned that “free” usually means putting up with interruptive, slightly creepy ads that feel more like a tax than a benefit — a frustration tax that now colors how we approach free‑tier services and now AI tools. However, we started chatting through it a bit more and explored whether there might actually be some good that can come out of it.</p><p>While advertisements in free services like ChatGPT risk frustrating users &amp; harming brand trust, frontier AI models have a unique opportunity to replace the traditional “sponsored” tag with promotional features that genuinely enhance the utility of threads &amp; responses — instead of undermining them. Before exploring how digital ads might actually do this, I want to briefly revisit how ads evolved on TV and YouTube, then look at the unique opportunities frontier AI platforms have, and finally ground it in a simple electrician problem to show how ads could enhance an AI chat thread.</p><h4>New platform, same commercial</h4><p>Billboards, cable TV commercials, and radio ads typically felt like a jarring distraction — pulling me out of driving, the show I was watching, or the song I was listening to. Further, the commercials themselves were usually irrelevant to whatever I was interested in. But since ads were less targeted to specific demographics on TV (aside from channels that entertained a certain subject like Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, or TV Land, etc.), it made sense that you would see a variety of advertisements ranging from uplifting prescription drug commercials to wacky toy ads for kids. And I remember feeling frustrated when I started seeing that same pattern begin on YouTube as though TV commercials were now coming to this new platform.</p><p>YouTube used to feel like a ‘free expression’ platform for anyone &amp; everyone to make videos on the internet. It gave people the means to show off talented, creative, strange, and hilarious content that we used to expect from YouTube. Even though ads came onto the scene just a year later, YouTube’s CEO Chad Hurley put his ad approach this way:</p><blockquote>We think there are better ways for people to engage with brands than forcing them to watch a commercial before seeing content. You could ask anyone on the net if they enjoy that experience and they’d probably say no. <br /> — <em>Chad Hurley ³</em></blockquote><p>But when YouTube was acquired by Google, ads started to function like commercials on TV by the end of 2007, confirming my worry. While they were annoying, they were at least short, skippable, and rarely shown.⁴ Today, however, ads can last over 90 seconds if the user allows it, becoming a <em>de facto</em> commercial break. Free-tier users pay a ‘price’ too, since ad-breaks have a cool-down timer before having the choice to skip.</p><p>But YouTube ads felt more targeted, which was both helpful &amp; creepy at times. If I started watching skateboarding videos, I might see advertisements for things skaters are interested in: skate decks, certain clothing brands, and <em>X-Games</em> announcements. With data sharing more broadly, I’d start seeing ads based on things I searched for online or just after I made an online purchase for a similar item. Still, it was better in a sense and more dialed in to relevant audiences than traditional TV or radio commercials.</p><p>All of this has taught us to expect that “free‑tier” experience means interruptive, slightly creepy, and rarely on our terms. That’s the mental model users will bring to free‑tier plans with ads in AI tools, and it functions like a frustration tax: <em>free </em>feels less like a gift and more like a tax you pay by waiting to actually use the product. The opportunity for frontier AI is to break that pattern by making promotional content feel like a feature that even paid‑tier accounts may want to keep, so paid plans can focus on adding capabilities rather than simply removing frustration taxes.</p><h4>Strengths of the AI pioneer</h4><p>Shifting over to ChatGPT and other frontier AI platforms, the obvious risk is that ads will simply adopt the same look &amp; feel they have on search engines — specifically those “sponsored” results at the top of the page — but these tools are capable of much more than that. While I don’t have the exact data in front of me, I often wonder how frequently people scroll past those sponsored results to reach the first organic link and how often accidental clicks leave them feeling misled instead of helped. One recent roundup of digital ad research found that around 86% of users report banner blindness (effectively ignoring banner‑like advertising) and that average banner engagement rates hover around 0.06%.⁵</p><p>If frontier AI platforms adopt a similar pattern, I imagine the analytics data won’t change much. However, these platforms aren’t doing the same things as search engines are either — they do a lot more, of course. They’re great at synthesizing content from a variety of sources based on the content of the user’s prompt. And they’re quickly doing more.</p><p>Advertisements can also be better with AI platforms. If search engines, YouTube, and other digital platforms can have targeted ads just based on what’s known about the user’s interests, they can do all the more with a conversational AI-chat thread. Even a basic prompt contains far more data than a general search query, and users are far more likely to write in natural language to AI platforms than to traditional search boxes. This can include nuanced details, context, and specificity that wasn’t as easy to do with a search engine — even with advanced search tools. Further, AI removes the need to scan through each individual webpage because of synthesized responses and linking to the sources, allowing us to verify content.</p><h4>Discovering marketed electricity</h4><p>A month or so ago, several outlets in our kitchen stopped working after a GFCI outlet tripped, and a quick do-it-yourself (DIY) attempt led to a small spark behind the outlet. At that point, the problem moved from <em>easy DIY project</em> to <em>I need a reputable professional who won’t overcharge me</em>. So imagine I turn to an AI assistant and type something like:</p><blockquote>I have three outlets that went out in our kitchen. I replaced a GFCI outlet, but when I pulled it back out to check the wiring I saw a small spark behind the outlet. I’m comfortable with basic DIY, but I don’t want to risk an electrical fire or make the problem worse. I’m looking for an electrician near me who is thorough, is transparent about pricing, and won’t pressure me into unnecessary work. Give me a few options and explain which one you’d choose for this situation.</blockquote><p>This is a solid example of the kind of urgent, high‑anxiety scenarios where ads could either quietly undermine trust or actually help. To illustrate this further, I’m treating my electrical experience as a small case study, exploring what happens if we replace the “sponsored” tag on a search result with richer promotional features like coupons, adjacent follow-up answers, and a contextual panel that doesn’t distract from the main thread so much.</p><p>So, how might ads be smartly introduced from a prompt like this? Well, maybe there are a few ways. First, imagine a fairly conventional AI response: a ranked list of three electricians with one of them tagged “Sponsored.”</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot mock of an AI chat response listing three electricians in a vertical comparison, with one option marked by a small ‘Sponsored’ tag, illustrating the default search-style ad pattern."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*XRKhqWoRxsWNgaDi0cu_HA.png"" /><figcaption>Conventional AI response: a comparison list of electricians with a tiny “Sponsored” tag.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the default pattern we’ve inherited from search. It technically discloses the ad, but it also quietly introduces doubt for the whole recommendation: am I getting the best fit for my needs or just the company with the highest advertising budget?</p><p>In my actual experience, my AI thread included a local map view with some content cards for each electrical company in my area. Let’s build on that, using content cards as our starting point, and ask a few ‘what ifs’:</p><ul><li>What if the promoted company showed an accurate cost of the exact service I need, based on what other customers actually paid?</li><li>What if there were coupons, discounts, or perks that directly benefit me for choosing that particular business?</li><li>What if some of the “sponsored” content complimented what I was asking about, like payment plans or DIY tutorials?</li></ul><p>Now compare that conventional AI response to one that uses thoughtfully integrated ads: the same electricians but with richer promotional features with a contextual panel that’s noninvasive to the main chat thread.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock AI response showing three electrician cards side by side, each with price, reviews, a short description, and buttons for actions like ‘Read reviews’ and ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ illustrating a richer sponsored card layout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/792/1*Q9WcYea2yv8d2gceOu2M6w.png"" /><figcaption>Smartly integrated ad cards with costs, perks, and follow‑up CTAs.</figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, this card layout is doing a few specific things. First, I kept the familiar basics — company name, review rating, a link to the website, a call-to-action (CTA) to get in touch, and a short description. Second, the information is grouped by kind: company name, description &amp; website link; cost, reviews, and a link to the full verbatims; and, promotional perk with a CTA for the next step in the user journey.</p><figure><img alt=""Close-up of a single electrician card showing company name, star rating, description, price, cost explanation, and action buttons stacked together, demonstrating information grouping within the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4f2VaxhBFG_jZ60QMbJ-cA.png"" /><figcaption>Electrician card layout with grouped details for one company.</figcaption></figure><p>Where it begins to differ is in the cost row: instead of a vague price range, the card shows the specific amount customers reported paying for the service I’m asking about, plus a link to the reviews that mention the prices. That turns the “ad” element into a reasonable expectation, not just a badge.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of the price section on an electrician card, with a bold dollar amount and a line explaining that the cost is based on similar customer reviews, plus a link to detailed reviews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_Mi_H53mh0PEXi-WeGfj2g.png"" /><figcaption>Cost row highlighting typical customer‑reported price and linked reviews.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also an emphasized coupon or perk label, providing another incentive that directly benefits the user, much like scouting through <em>RetailMeNot</em> or <em>Groupon</em> for a promo code. The difference is the value is surfaced in context, before you ever hit a checkout page.</p><figure><img alt=""Zoomed-in view of an electrician card showing a ‘Free inspection coupon’ badge next to the action buttons, representing a user-benefiting promotional perk embedded in the card."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*z1ZPnOWDHTT6AuaSTSmwQg.png"" /><figcaption>Sponsored perk: a clearly labeled coupon for a free inspection.</figcaption></figure><p>Last, sponsored content can come from an information scent by labeling actions in the user’s own language (“Reliable DIY tutorials,” “Electricians with payment plans,” etc.), making them feel like relevant next steps rather than distractions. Together, these tweaks improve the overall signal‑to‑noise ratio by making sure every promotional element either clarifies incentives or opens a relevant, optional path you might actually want to take.</p><figure><img alt=""Mock of three pill-shaped buttons beneath the main electrician recommendation labeled ‘Compare GFCI troubleshooting costs,’ ‘Electricians with payment plans,’ and ‘Reliable DIY tutorials,’ showing opt‑in sub‑search routes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-joPf8gZZKPSZrqVr_lEZA.png"" /><figcaption>Optional CTAs launching focused sub‑threads for costs, payment plans, and DIY.</figcaption></figure><p>Each predetermined CTA launches a focused sub‑thread where the AI can surface related, sponsored resources without hijacking the main topic.

It’s still promotional, but will compliment the user’s thread instead of interrupting the train of thought with noise or other frustration taxes.</p><figure><img alt=""Full-page mockup of an AI chat interface with the conversation on the left and a right-aligned ‘Thread insights’ panel on the right containing electrician cards, costs, and action buttons, demonstrating a dedicated ad space that updates with the thread."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*szASXnWFl8Jdcd3XRWak1w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Contextual right‑hand panel showing electrician cards and insights alongside the main thread.</figcaption></figure><p>Cards with all the ad-types are most likely the ‘maximal’ version for a high‑stakes case, but even one or two of these ideas would give users a real sense of reciprocity &amp; incentive to interact with the advertised perks. Companies willing to pay for ad space could compromise by allowing more transparency by showing the specific average amount customers paid, reciprocity by offering concrete perks &amp; coupons, or autonomy by sponsoring alternative solutions like DIY content for their questions.</p><p>Compared to the tiny “sponsored” tag next to <em>BrightSpark Electrical</em> in the conventional AI response, these cards make the advertising work more for the users. The promoted content is still promotional, but it’s packaged utility in the form of transparent costs, valuable perks, and alternative solutions. Consequently, it’s more likely users will actually engage with it, instead of tuning out the noise or being suspicious of it.</p><h4>Mapping out the new frontier</h4><p>Free‑tier AI platforms with ads don’t have to inherit the same frustration tax we’ve learned from YouTube commercials and sponsored search results. The electrician example is small, but it shows how promotional content can be reshaped into something that actually helps in a stressful, high‑stakes situation.</p><p>Structurally, the move is simple: treat ads as enhancing features, not just paid recommendations. Thoughtfully-integrated ads in content cards, sub-threads offering alternative solutions, and dedicated layouts that compliment the main thread give advertised content visibility while simultaneously benefitting the user. At their best, these patterns also line up with the UX virtues I’ve hinted at earlier &amp; argued for elsewhere: <em>transparent </em>content from promoted businesses, <em>reciprocity</em> in the form of perks &amp; discounts, and preserving user <em>autonomy </em>by allowing the user to choose alternative paths — while also removing frustration taxes.⁶</p><p>As more frontier AI platforms roll out free‑tier plans with ads, the real question isn’t whether to show ads at all, but which patterns we normalize.

<h4>The path to designing for AI is in questioning the fundamentals of what design stands for</h4><figure><img alt=""A designer shedding the past design artifacts and embracing the future of emerging tech"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1020/1*LE0BFPSuq6HxhmN7zt2pAQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: AI Generated Image</figcaption></figure><p>I admire artists and industrial designers who challenge assumptions. Ross Lovegrove is one of them. If you’ve never heard of him, he is one of the most visionary creators in the world, and designs all sorts of devices, including door handles, computers, fragrance bottles, and concept cars.</p><p><a href=""https://www.wallpaper.com/design-interiors/ross-lovegrove-on-working-with-ai""><strong>In an article in the popular design magazine Wallpaper</strong></a>, he claims that the potential of working with AI is utopian. That says a lot coming from someone considered by many as a futurist.</p><p>Lovegrove admits that most people in his generation, including design leaders, are skeptical of AI’s use in design. He doesn’t belong to that group, as he says that “AI is complementary, like having a conversation with a very intelligent friend.” He even built a Carrara marble sculpture in collaboration with a robot!</p><p>After reading Lovegrove’s take on AI, I asked myself: Are design leaders prepared for this new AI era? Or, more precisely, what do they need to unlearn to stay relevant and lead their teams in a world where AI is reshaping how we create?</p><p>Here’s what I’m unlearning, and what I think other design leaders should consider letting go of too.</p><h4>#1. “AI enablement is (just) a tooling decision”</h4><figure><img alt=""Chart showing AI code-generation success rates for novices and experts. Novices show 79% success, while experts show 90% success. Purple represents success and orange represents failure, displayed over a background of a person viewing multiple computer screens."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_B-jLlsLe5dcH5q-4u4JYg.png"" /></figure><p>This might be a hard pill to swallow for some design leaders and any business leaders in general.</p><p>Before we entered what we now call an AI-first world, AI felt like a frontier that was approaching slowly. Leaders could afford to experiment, pilot a few tools, let teams test them out, see what stuck… It was like a free buffet where everyone could try the new shiny thing without much risk.</p><p>The problem now is how your team uses it, because the consequences of this free-for-all approach can be the opposite of what you expect: AI tools expose the talent gap in your team.</p><p>A 2025 study titled<strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""https://arxiv.org/html/2509.21890v1""><strong>Not Everyone Wins with LLMs: Behavioral Patterns and Pedagogical Implications in AI-assisted Data Analysis</strong></a>, sheds some light on this. In it, researchers tracked 36 students as they used an LLM to complete programming and data analysis tasks. Everyone had equal access to the same AI tools.</p><p>The study found that students with strong data &amp; coding foundations used AI to extend their thinking, explore alternatives, and debug more quickly. Those with weaker fundamentals often copy pasted outputs, misread results, or got overwhelmed by verbose explanations.</p><p>Now extrapolate this to your design team. If you just democratize the use of AI without paying attention to core fundamentals like systems thinking, experimentation, and evaluating AI output, your best performers will become even better at their craft, but junior designers may fall behind and become too dependent on AI.</p><p>Choosing the right tools is still and will remain relevant for years to come, but it’s equally important to build capability from the ground up so your team can use AI to extend their thinking. Today, AI enablement is a talent strategy decision.</p><h4>#2. “Designers (only) design interfaces, researchers (only) provide insights”</h4><p>There was a time when a designer had a very specific role, and so did researchers. And it was easy to assign them tasks, goals, and projects because everything worked like a well-oiled machine.</p><p>AI has changed the way we box these positions in. Can we already say we are on the verge of seeing more hybrid roles in design teams? J.M. Downey, Director of Design Strategy &amp; Research at AT&amp;T, thinks so.</p><p>Downey is one of the design leadership voices interviewed in the 2025 report<strong> </strong><a href=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65b848447e935c9f1f8e6ec5/68357bcd7d7740446815dbba_The%20AI%20Shift.pdf""><strong>The AI Shift: Transforming How We Discover, Imagine, and Design</strong></a>, conducted by the Design Executive Council (DXC). He sees his team as design strategists as much as he sees them as researchers. “That’s the future of this discipline,” he claims.</p><p>Most leaders interviewed for DXC’s report agreed that the old boundaries between design and research no longer work. For example, Dave Brown, who leads design for AI services at Amazon Web Services, says, “Design and research now need to look across the whole stack.” He’s talking about understanding how data flows, how models make decisions, and how those decisions show up in the user experience.</p><p>My perspective aligns with what they all say. Design leaders must adapt to what’s coming and upskill their teams for new challenges. Your designer needs to understand what the AI is optimizing for, why it’s making certain recommendations, and how to design friction when users need transparency or control. Your researcher can’t just deliver insights and walk away. They need to shape how those insights get embedded into product decisions, AI training, and business strategy.</p><p>An AI-first world demands strategic builders. Your team needs them, starting with yourself.</p><h4>#3. “Polish, craft, and aesthetics are what make design good”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistics showing 52% of respondents believe design is more important in AI-powered products than in traditional digital products, displayed over a background of a person sketching an interface on a tablet."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cENQNgrjZtPySAfi9nmTKQ.png"" /></figure><p>When you read this headline, it might sound like an oversimplification. I’m not arguing that design leaders have ever cared only about how a product looks, but I do include myself among those who have, at times, over-indexed on polished prototypes, pixel-perfect interfaces, and visual refinement as proxies for quality.</p><p>In AI-powered products, that definition of quality isn’t enough. Designing with AI introduces additional layers of responsibility and complexity. Beyond aesthetics and usability, which remain essential, quality now also includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Trust:</strong> Can users rely on the system’s outputs over time?</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Do users understand why the system made a recommendation or took an action?</li><li><strong>Graceful degradation:</strong> Does the product communicate uncertainty and fail safely when it doesn’t know something, rather than confidently producing wrong results?</li></ul><p>In this context, a visually polished interface can mask deeper issues: unreliable outputs, opaque decision-making, brittle behavior at the edges… Design leaders must therefore stop measuring quality just by surface-level polish and instead treat trust, clarity, and reliability as first-class design outcomes.</p><p>According to <a href=""https://cdn.sanity.io/files/599r6htc/regionalized/d4e0b1140b4d4d32c004e442bdb3e9f136fd3657.pdf""><strong>Figma’s 2025 AI Report</strong></a>, more than half of designers and AI builders believe design has become more important for AI-powered products, precisely because users now depend on design to interpret, evaluate, and trust intelligent systems.</p><p>For the design leaders of the future, great design will be defined by how confidently users can understand a system and rely on it in real-world conditions.</p><h4>#4. “Speed equals progress”</h4><figure><img alt=""Statistic showing 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow, displayed over a background of a computer screen with AI interface windows and connected data elements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HXZAT1UYCqpYw8qJ-Tq4Rg.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve heard many times in my career things like “moving faster is always the right move” or “if we ship faster, we win.” Well, these assumptions may be wrong today. Although I agree that for certain companies, especially startups, speed is a virtue, for the most part, we should stay vigilant when hearing such claims.</p><p>There’s one thing we all love about AI: it makes us faster. It can accelerate good work, there’s no doubt about it, but it can also accelerate mistakes. I recently read an article in <a href=""https://www.cio.com/article/4076280/why-ai-initiatives-fail-the-costly-mistakes-it-leaders-make-and-how-you-can-avoid-them.html""><strong>CIO magazine</strong></a> on why AI initiatives fail, and one of the reasons mentioned was, indeed, ‘rushed pilots.’</p><p>Often, when pressured by stakeholders, business leaders may feel the need to deploy products without clear goals or proper processes, just to release them as quickly as possible. And design teams fall into the trap, mistaking speed and novelty for progress.</p><p>As per the <a href=""https://www.stateofaidesign.com/""><strong>State of AI in Design Report 2025</strong></a>, 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow in some way. Your team may already be benefiting from this. They are more productive, and you get tangible results. Everything works faster, and everyone’s celebrating that. But is the work truly <em>better</em>?</p><p>The best design leaders know when to slow down, validate, and ensure that what they’re building is worth shipping.</p><h4>Closing thoughts</h4><p>One day, not too far away, we won’t talk about an “AI-first world”, just <em>our </em>world, much like we no longer say we’re in an “Internet-driven world”. AI will be embedded in everything, just as the internet is now.</p><p>Until then, design leaders have time to build and, apologies for the redundancy, ‘design’ this new reality. That means unlearning some of the universal truths we all took as sacred, as set in stone.</p><p><strong><em>Want to see how we’re putting these principles into practice?
