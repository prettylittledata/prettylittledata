<h4>When you can build a working prototype in an afternoon, the question is no longer <em>can you make it</em> — it’s <em>should you build it</em>, and <em>what should you build</em>.</h4><figure><img alt=""Central target with four coral hands reaching toward it, connected by teal circuit board lines and technology icons"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ja7QeYOYZ4XrSSk5eA3opw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Most founders and teams struggle with those questions, not because they lack conviction, but because they test that conviction too late. Resources get committed before customer needs are validated. Confirmation bias filters what gets heard. They often fall in love with solutions before fully understanding the problems they need to solve.</p><p>AI-accelerated development affects everyone — from solo founders building alone to small startup teams to larger software organizations at scaleups and enterprises. Whether you’re a team of one or one hundred, the challenge is the same: deciding what deserves to exist.</p><p>The CHAOS Report (Standish Group, 2020) indicates that more than two-thirds of software projects fail to meet their intended outcomes. While execution failures play a role, the problems often begin earlier — in the discovery phase. A focus on delivery velocity has replaced the judgment time needed to uncover what truly matters.</p><h3>Co-Invention: Redesigning Discovery</h3><p>I had spent six weeks conducting discovery and design on an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate product discovery when I came across Ajay Agrawal’s YouTube interview, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhfpHwcrx6c"">The AI Economist: The Skill You Need to Stay Employed in the Age of AI</a>&quot; (Full interview is 1 hour and 5 minutes). I was researching AI capabilities for the toolkit when his insight stopped me in my tracks. In my experience, software teams often skipped proper discovery, claiming they didn’t have time. I saw AI as the solution to a productivity problem: automate tasks, integrate workflows, and make discovery faster so software teams would have fewer excuses not to do it properly.</p><p>In their book <em>Power and Prediction</em>, Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2022) describe what happened when factories first adopted electricity. Manufacturers replaced steam engines with electric motors, but retained the same layout — one large motor, complex belts and pulleys, and machines clustered around a central power source. Productivity barely improved. The breakthrough came when they redesigned around electricity’s potential: machines could go anywhere, organized by workflow rather than power source.</p><p>This is what they call co-invention: the new technology is only part of the solution. The real value lies in inventing complementary systems, processes, and organizational structures that leverage the technology's strengths.</p><p>Today we’re making the same mistake with AI — bolting it onto existing workflows, increasing speed without improving outcomes. An effective AI-human partnership requires co-inventing new systems that leverage the strengths of each. The processes that guide discovery need fundamental redesign, not around speed, but around judgment.</p><p>Speed without judgment means building the wrong things faster.</p><h3>Prediction vs Judgment</h3><p>Agrawal’s deeper insight reframed my thinking. In the human-AI partnership, AI makes predictions radically faster — filling in missing information, recognizing patterns, generating options, and forecasting outcomes. What remains scarce is judgment: the ability to interpret meaning, weigh trade-offs, and decide what’s worth pursuing.</p><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxkhxVv155CAE29w9F2Dal4uOtXrRKFuEZ?si=iZTAjfaqrrJrD4o2""><strong><em>Watch economist Ajay Agrawal explain this distinction</em></strong><em>(1 minute)</em></a></p><p>Decision-making is the interplay of prediction and judgment. AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.</p><blockquote><strong>“AI handles what is likely to happen. Humans decide what should be done about it.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI prediction capabilities (pattern recognition, synthesis, generating options) on the left converging with human judgment capabilities (determining purpose, interpreting meaning, weighing tradeoffs) on the right into decision-making at the center"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*_uav4SS4tk8EzfaiTJkeQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>In discovery, this plays out constantly. AI can analyze customer-interview transcripts and identify patterns across dozens of conversations — that’s prediction. But we must decide whether those patterns represent real problems worth solving or simply interesting noise — that’s judgment.</p><p>AI can forecast which features might increase engagement — that’s prediction. Only humans can decide how well they align with customers’ needs and the product’s vision, purpose and principles — that’s judgment.</p><p>Brandon Harwood (2025) describes this distinction in his framework for AI-powered product design, noting that specific tasks must remain human-centric due to the need for judgment, intuition, and emotional intelligence. What AI accelerates is synthesis; what humans provide is meaning-making.</p><p>Judgment develops by making decisions under uncertainty and owning the consequences. When you pursue an opportunity based on limited evidence, ship it, and learn it was the wrong bet, that failure can grow your judgment. When you kill a beloved idea because evidence doesn’t support it and that decision proves correct, that success strengthens your judgment. Learning comes from the whole cycle: decide → act → observe → reflect.</p><p>Discovery judgment is the practice of developing judgment about what deserves to exist. It’s not a single activity but a set of practices: identifying opportunities, talking to customers about their needs, mapping assumptions about what would make a solution valuable, testing those assumptions with minimal investment, and deciding when evidence is strong enough to commit resources.</p><p>Sinek’s (2009) Golden Circle, explored in <em>Start with Why</em> and his TED Talk <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action"">“How Great Leaders Inspire Action”</a>, provides a valuable lens for understanding why judgment remains a human trait. The Golden Circle shows that inspiring action starts with <em>why</em> — purpose and belief — then moves to <em>how</em>, and finally <em>what</em> you produce. This order is often reversed, starting with what or how to build.</p><p>AI can handle the how and even suggest the what. Only humans can determine the why, which makes it worthwhile to build. Judgment is the capacity to reason about purpose, meaning, and value — capabilities that belong uniquely to us.</p><h3>Cross-Functional Discovery Judgment</h3><p>If discovery judgment is scarce, everyone involved in bringing software to market needs to develop it. Discovery emerges from judgment calls across multiple perspectives — technical feasibility, user needs, market fit, operational constraints, and strategy.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams make all these judgment calls themselves, constantly switching between perspectives. You’re the product person AND the engineer AND the designer — often feeling overwhelmed by the need to think across domains that don’t come naturally.</p><p>Larger teams distribute these perspectives across various roles, including product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and customer success. When these perspectives stay siloed, teams consistently build the wrong things. The “that’s not my job” mindset creates blind spots that AI acceleration only amplifies.</p><p>Tutti Taygerly (2020) learned this at Facebook: true collaboration isn’t about stakeholders handing work to each other — it’s about establishing trust and reasoning together from the start. Whether developing multi-perspective judgment as a solo founder or learning to reason together as a team, the principle is the same: cross-functional discovery judgment determines whether you build the right things.</p><p>For solo builders, this means developing judgment across domains you might not naturally think in — and creating systematic practices to compensate for working alone. For teams, it means different perspectives combining to form a better collective judgment. Over time, this capability compounds — solo founders develop intuition across multiple domains, and teams learn to reason together effectively.</p><p>For organizations, siloed discovery wastes insight and resources. For individuals working alone, a lack of systematic practices wastes time and money. For professionals staying narrow in their function, they become replaceable.</p><h3>Discovery as a Continuous Loop</h3><p>Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice that runs alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop. Whether working solo or in teams, you discover what to build, deliver it, learn from what happens, and feed those insights back into the next round of discovery.</p><blockquote><strong>“Discovery isn’t a pre-build phase — it’s a continuous practice running alongside delivery in an ongoing learning loop.”</strong></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram illustrating the continuous discovery-delivery-learning cycle with arrows showing how builders discover what to build, deliver it, learn from outcomes, and feed insights back into the next discovery cycle"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mgTX7TtZVj4kuIf97UINzQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Discovery requires double-loop learning: not only asking Did this feature succeed? but examining the assumptions and reasoning behind it. Single-loop learning adjusts what you do; double-loop learning improves how you think about what to do.</p><p>Matthew Godfrey (2020) explores this in his work on the critical role of discovery, noting that the best product teams recognize that discovery and delivery should run concurrently and continuously, rather than as separate, sequential phases. This dual-track approach enables teams to address problems as they arise throughout the product development process.</p><p>As builders move through the discovery–delivery–learning loop, they’re not just refining the product — they’re refining their judgment. Each cycle sharpens your sense of what matters, which assumptions to test first, and what evidence is sufficient to act on. For teams, when this capability becomes shared, organizations learn to reason together — and that capacity compounds. For solo founders, systematic practice creates the judgment that teams might develop through diverse perspectives.</p><p>Solo founders often think they can skip systematic practices because “I am the product person AND the engineer AND the designer.” But that’s why the loop matters more — you need systematic practices to compensate for not having diverse perspectives catching your blind spots in real-time.</p><h3>Why This Matters Now</h3><p>When spreadsheets arrived, accounting firms hired fewer accountants — but those who remained became more strategic and better compensated. Arithmetic specialists moved on; judgment-oriented accountants thrived.</p><p>Software builders face the same shift. The ratio of value to people is changing dramatically. Your value isn’t in what AI can generate — code, mock-ups, or transcripts. It’s in developing discovery judgment: framing the right problems, interpreting evidence, weighing trade-offs, and helping others do the same.</p><p>I’ve seen this pattern repeatedly throughout my career. Teams would spend months building technically impressive solutions — only to discover they’d solved problems no customer actually had. The breakthrough came when we started mapping assumptions systematically before building—the same talented people, but different discovery judgment practices.</p><p>The market is splitting: professionals who use AI merely to execute faster versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment. The latter will become increasingly valuable precisely because AI can’t automate judgment. As Teixeira and Braga (2025) document in <em>The State of UX in 2025</em>, algorithms and automated tools are taking over execution tasks, making human judgment about purpose and meaning increasingly valuable.</p><p>For solo founders and small teams, this shift is even more pronounced. You can now build a complete product yourself using AI — but your judgment quality determines whether that product solves a real problem. The democratization of building capability means your competitive advantage is 100% in judgment, not execution speed.</p><p>If this all feels like too much change, that’s natural. AI is rewriting how we work; uncertainty is real; change feels relentless. But you’re already making judgment calls every day — deciding priorities, interpreting feedback, choosing when to proceed or pause. It isn’t new work; it’s becoming deliberate about the work that matters most.</p><blockquote><strong>“Speed and judgment used to be a trade-off. Now they’re both required — and only one can be automated.”</strong></blockquote><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>When AI makes building and delivering software easier, faster and more cost-effective, judgment becomes the scarce resource.</li><li>Judgment develops through decisions under uncertainty and reflection on results.</li><li>Cross-functional discovery judgment is the ability to interpret evidence and decide what deserves to be built and why — whether you’re building solo or as a team.</li><li>Discovery judgment is a continuous, double-loop learning practice, not a phase.</li><li>The software market is segmenting: those who focus on delivering faster versus those who compete on wisdom and strategic value.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Agrawal, A., Gans, J., &amp; Goldfarb, A.

It’s as if the designers didn’t think about how real people would use it. That’s where product thinking comes in. It’s a way of designing that keeps the user at the forefront of the process, ensuring that their needs and challenges are fully understood before any solutions are created. In this post, I will share some of the values of product thinking I have learned over the years and share some tips on how to build good User Experience for the masses.</p><p>It is a process learned through continued learning to stay ahead, develop soft skills, and cultivate empathy for the user. I found following these principles incredibly useful and you can too use them to create products and experiences that truly serve your users.</p><h3>The value of product thinking</h3><p>A cornerstone of product thinking is the <strong>meticulous study of the </strong><a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-genai-changes-creative-work/""><strong>user’s journey</strong></a>. We meticulously map out the steps a user takes to achieve a specific goal, pinpointing their pain points and frustrations. By doing so, we can design products and services that are tailor-made to address these issues, creating a seamless and enjoyable user experience.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XxTRMd6CFuGb_r5kXP1YRA.png"" /><figcaption>Sample user journey map created by author.</figcaption></figure><p>Equally important is the consideration of the product’s value proposition. What unique benefits does the product offer to users? How does it solve their problems or improve their lives? By clearly defining the product’s value proposition, businesses can ensure that their product stands out in the market and that users can easily understand the value they will get from using it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nm4dnjiV9gr47C-LB-pwqg.avif"" /><figcaption>Courtesy:<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/value-proposition-canvas?srsltid=AfmBOoo2qjdc50y_zushQaKFUPTjYFRRp0z2zCcGJjmL_p3FPmwOiUob""> Interaction design Or</a>g</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also important to know that the aspects of Value prop and Mission statement of your product team can be very different. Here’s a clear breakdown of the <strong>differentiators</strong> between a <strong>Value Proposition</strong> and a <strong>Mission Statement</strong>, along with guidance on what kind of <strong>overlap</strong> is ideal and strategically beneficial.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*l1NG1p6czf8xvvxbIEvF4g.png"" /></figure><h3>Ideal Overlap Between the Two</h3><p>While distinct, a <strong>healthy overlap</strong> between the two ensures <strong>strategic alignment</strong> and <strong>authenticity</strong>. Here’s what that looks like:</p><ol><li><strong>Shared Purpose Language:</strong><br /> Both should express a consistent <em>why</em> — the company’s fundamental reason for existing. <br />Example: If the mission is “to simplify global communication,” the value proposition might echo that with “helping teams connect seamlessly across borders.”</li><li><strong>Cohesive Brand Identity:</strong><br /> The value proposition should <strong>flow naturally</strong> from the mission — the mission is <em>why</em> the company exists; the value proposition is <em>how</em> it creates value in the market.</li><li><strong>Emotional + Rational Blend:<br />Mission: evokes emotion and belief (“We exist to improve lives”). <br />Value Proposition</strong>: translates belief into tangible benefit (“We deliver affordable healthcare tools to everyone”).</li><li><strong>Internal and External Alignment:</strong><br /> Employees motivated by the mission are better able to deliver the value proposition authentically. This alignment ensures that marketing promises (value prop) match lived experience (mission).</li></ol><p>Prioritizing features according to user needs and business objectives is another key aspect of product thinking. Not all features are created equal, and it’s essential to allocate resources to those that will deliver the most value to users and align with the strategic goals of the business. Through comprehensive user research and analysis, we can make informed decisions about which features to prioritize and develop.</p><p>Finally, testing and iterating on designs is essential to ensure that products meet user needs. User testing provides valuable feedback that can be used to refine and improve the product. By iterating on designs based on user feedback, businesses can create products that are user-friendly, effective, and enjoyable to use.</p><h3>Building experience for the masses</h3><p>Crafting Inclusive User Experiences for the Masses:</p><p>Creating products and services that meet the needs of a wide range of users is a key part of building UX for everyone. This requires a holistic approach that includes <a href=""https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/what-are-the-wcag-guidelines/"">accessibility</a>, inclusion, cultural sensitivity, and strong user research.</p><p>In the age of<a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/mobile-first-design""> mobile-first technology</a>, it’s crucial to design with mobile in mind. This means creating interfaces that are easy to navigate and interact with on smaller screens. Intuitive touch gestures and clear calls to action are key to a great user experience, and thorough testing across devices and network conditions is essential to ensure your design works for everyone.</p><p>Accessibility and inclusivity are not just buzzwords; they are fundamental to great UX design. Making sure that people with disabilities — whether they have vision impairments, hearing loss, or other challenges — can use your product isn’t just the right thing to do, it’s also good for business. Using clear and simple language, providing text alternatives for non-text content, and making sure your product works with assistive technologies can help you reach a wider audience.</p><p>Cultural sensitivity is another key ingredient in the recipe for successful global UX. Understanding the unique expectations and preferences of diverse cultures is vital to crafting interfaces that resonate with users from different backgrounds. This may involve employing culturally appropriate colors, fonts, and imagery, as well as localizing content to cater to specific languages and cultural norms.</p><p>And finally, ongoing user research and testing are critical to a UX <a href=""https://www.netguru.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-ux-design"">designer’s success</a>. Surveys, interviews, and usability testing can provide valuable insights into what users need, want, and find frustrating. By involving users in the design process, we can create products that are truly user-centered and that provide a positive and inclusive experience for everyone.</p><h3>Keep learning to stay relevant</h3><p>The world of product design and development is always changing, with new technologies, trends, and user needs emerging all the time. To stay relevant and effective in this dynamic landscape, it’s important for designers to embrace a mindset of continuous learning and skill development. This means staying up-to-date with the latest industry knowledge, seeking out new opportunities for growth, and cultivating a diverse skill set that goes beyond technical expertise.</p><p><strong>You can use this GROW framework: </strong><br /> The word <em>GROW</em> captures the essence of continuous learning : it’s active, personal, and forward-looking. It reminds us that development isn’t about perfection; it’s about progress, curiosity, and courage. Each letter represents a mindset that fuels sustained growth in any field.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/713/1*JNMJcJxlBqmYhqAZSdWYfQ.png"" /><figcaption>GROW Framework</figcaption></figure><p>Among the most vital soft skills for UX designers is<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpnNsSyDw-g""> <strong>the art of active listening</strong></a>, the ability to truly hear what users are saying and comprehend their needs. It also involves the capacity to ask the right questions and seek clarity when needed. Empathy is another cornerstone of the UX designer’s skill set, enabling one to step into the user’s world, understand their emotions, and motivations. By cultivating empathy, we can craft products that are not only user-friendly but also a joy to use.</p><p>Effective communication is yet another vital soft skill for UX designers. This encompasses the ability to articulate one’s ideas clearly and concisely, as well as the capacity to listen to feedback and integrate it into one’s work. Time management, too, is of the essence. The skill to plan, prioritize, and meet deadlines is paramount for the successful completion of projects to the highest standard.</p><h3>Building your soft skills</h3><p>Soft skills are the interpersonal and communication abilities that are crucial for success in any job. They encompass active listening, <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/sympathy-vs-empathy-ux/"">empathy</a>, communication, and time management. In UX design, soft skills are indispensable for comprehending the user’s requirements and crafting products that fulfill those needs. By honing your soft skills, you can elevate your standing as a UX designer and enhance your prospects for triumph in the industry.</p><h3>Empathy for the win</h3><p>Empathy is a critical soft skill for UX designers. It allows us to understand the needs and desires of our users on a deeper level. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our users, we can create products and services that are truly user-centric.</p><p>We, as designers, can cultivate empathy through active listening, striving to comprehend the user’s perspective without bias. Engaging in user research, we can observe users in their natural settings, gaining valuable insights into their behaviors, needs, and challenges.</p><h3>This begs larger questions about AI’s impact on creativity</h3><p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in various industries, including design. With the ability to process vast amounts of data and perform complex tasks, AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process and improve the overall <a href=""https://adobe.design/stories/leading-design/designing-for-generative-ai-experiences"">user experience</a>.</p><p>However, as AI continues to evolve and become more integrated into the design process, it raises questions about its impact on creativity. Some argue that AI will replace human designers, making their skills and expertise obsolete. Others believe that AI will simply assist and enhance the work of designers, allowing them to focus on more creative and strategic aspects of the design process.</p><p>One of the main concerns is that AI may limit the diversity and uniqueness of designs. As AI algorithms are based on data and patterns, there is a risk that designs may become too similar and lack originality. This could result in a homogenization of design, stifling creativity and innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, AI has the potential to open up new possibilities and push the boundaries of design. By automating repetitive tasks and providing designers with insights and suggestions, AI can free up time for designers to <a href=""https://generalassemb.ly/blog/global-perspectives-ux-design-in-the-age-of-ai/"">explore new ideas</a> and experiment with different approaches. This can lead to more innovative and unique designs that would not have been possible without AI.</p><p>Another issue to consider is the ethical implications of AI in design. As AI algorithms are trained on existing data, there is a risk of perpetuating biases and discrimination in designs. It is crucial for designers to be aware of these biases and actively work towards creating inclusive and ethical designs.</p><p>In conclusion, the impact of AI on creativity in design is a complex and ongoing discussion. While AI has the potential to greatly enhance the design process, it is essential for designers to approach it with caution and continue to prioritize human creativity and empathy in their work. By understanding and harnessing the capabilities of AI, designers can create truly impactful and meaningful designs for the benefit of users.</p><p>So as you move forward, remember to <strong>SIP, DIP, and FLIP</strong>. <strong>SIP</strong> the world around you to take in its ideas, lessons, and experiences with curiosity. <strong>DIP</strong> into them deeply, let understanding soak through your thoughts, shaping your perspective and intent. And then, <strong>FLIP</strong> — turn insight into impact, thought into motion, and potential into progress. Because wisdom isn’t just about what we take in, but what we <em>do</em> with it.</p><p><strong>Reference Tools: <br /></strong>I am not paid to promote this.

We didn’t have a computer at home at the time so whenever I was around his, I would beg him to let me use it to play with MS Paint.</p><p>I was probably around 7 or 8, and my go-to artwork was a portrait of my him made with the spray tool — perfect to recreate his short, spiky hair and stubble — and I’d make his head ridiculously big and tease him about it. He still has one of these masterpiece in his desktop wallpapers rotation, I’m pretty sure.</p><p>I couldn’t draw much else with the mouse, nothing more complicated than a lopsided house and a tree, so I would ask him, knowing full well he wasn’t the artist in the family, to draw something for me; that day I asked for a dog. He tried his best, but what came up on the canvas was a misshapen thing — a kind of pig-dog hybrid that was so bad it had us laughing for a good while.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bAbEBu0_nMOmt2viK_-_2w.png"" /><figcaption>MS paint GUI circa 1999 (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>I wasn’t always sure why that random ugly dog had stayed with me for so long, but I see now it was a symbol of the connection my dad and I shared that day. This memory has resurfaced a few times now that there’s so much emphasis on AI image generators — these tools that can (sometimes, for now) create breathtaking art effortlessly yet leave me, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vz0oQ0v0W10"">and many others</a>, wondering about their real purpose.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about what it would have been like if instead of just our best intention and some basic tools we would have had at our disposal Midjourney or something else that day, how my request to my dad would have been the same but the result much more different. The quality of the artwork itself is beside the point — the whole interaction and the unexpected moment between us it’s what would have been lost.</p><p>There’s been <a href=""https://philosophynow.org/issues/169/What_Makes_A_Work_Of_Art_Great"">countless debates</a> on what makes art <em>art</em>, why or why not AI outputs can or should be considered the <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/08/is-art-generated-by-artificial-intelligence-real-art/"">same as human ones</a>. Now every month we have a new tool we can use, one of the latest being <a href=""https://openai.com/index/sora-2/"">Sora 2</a>, adding no value to the human experience while claiming to ‘democratise’ creativity — an overused phrase that does nothing, if not mistaking access for meaning.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Zz1vLggJm8LYsGkNulSnAA.png"" /><figcaption>Google Gemini UI (screenshot by author)</figcaption></figure><p>From a UX perspective, the process of AI image generation is as frictionless as it can be: type, click, wait and receive what you’ve asked for, perhaps refine it. As ever, the promise is accessibility by letting anyone create regardless of skill, but I would argue there’s a difference between democratising outcomes and democratising the creative process itself.</p><p>With these tools it’s like we’re giving everyone a printer instead of a paint brush, and by doing that, what we’re losing is the struggle and the lessons that come with it, so much so that creation doesn’t even feel like creating anymore.</p><p>When the outputs are automated we’re stripping away the messy, truly generative, experience where actual creativity lives.</p><p>I can’t deny that, in some cases, these programs can spit out objectively beautiful outputs. But as much as those AI images might look right, there’s always something missing: whether it’s the person behind it trying to communicate something they can’t quite articulate, or the surprise and frustration of actually getting your hands dirty with a tool.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tyxcDKSGvU2XD8QihHyCVA.png"" /><figcaption>Gemini’s image created form the prompt “draw me a dog”.

You’re left to watch dozens of other people’s prompts and outputs stream by, and few will truly experiment since it’s much easier to copy successful formulas when wanting a certain result.</p><p>Or the variation buttons — why struggle with your vision when you can just generate alternatives until one feels “good enough”? I can’t get over how these “creative” tools take away the mess and uncertainty where creativity actually happens, and offload what’s arguably the best part of the process to a randomising algorithm.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nx1xERWbQHABlj3iNGXx4Q.png"" /><figcaption>Midjourney running on Discord (screenshot <a href=""https://aituts.com/adding-midjourney-bot-discord-server/"">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the bigger picture, it’s disheartening how as a society we can go from celebrating paintings made hundreds, even thousands of years ago, studying each stroke, letting them tell us a story and move us, to being satisfied with something so fundamentally different.</p><p>The point of art, no matter the category — I believe — is that it’s inseparable from the artist behind it. To an extent we can see the quirks and struggle in every piece, sometimes a message, or at the very least, the personality of the artist. What draws us to art isn’t only its beauty — it’s the artist’s way of seeing that gets captured by all the tiny decisions made while creating it. And that’s what makes art unique and human.</p><p>I am <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-design-of-shallow-thinking-4627e254a7b3?sk=d121456de089061f1293e7063524e1b4"">by my own admission</a> a bit of romantic when it comes to oldschool software, but if creativity becomes automated we risk losing the very thing that makes art meaningful — the experience of creating something.

Scrolling through options until you find a good one doesn’t really scream creative process.</p><p>Recently I had a conversation with someone comparing AI art to electronic music (along the lines of <em>“new technology disrupts an art form, skeptics resist but creativity adapts”</em>). I’m not a musician myself but I think that when you dig deeper, the two situations are quite different in terms of what technology is doing to the creative process: electronic music gave artists new ways to create, while AI art gives <em>machines</em> new ways to imitate creation.</p><p>We should recognise this distinction especially because we spend our careers thinking about how interfaces guide decisions. We know that removing steps from a process doesn’t just make it faster, but it can change what that process <em>is</em>.</p><p>So I keep thinking about this ugly digital dog from 1999, how it might be the most valuable piece of art in my memory, even though — or especially because — it was not perfect and looked almost nothing like a dog.</p><h4>Further reads/watch</h4><p><a href=""https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-is-not-democratizing-creativity"">AI is not “democratizing creativity.” It’s doing the opposite</a> — Brian Merchant<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Z4cg5Fyu4"">Sora proves the AI bubble is going to burst so hard</a> — Adam Conover<br />Reclaiming Art in the Age of Artifice — J.

<h4>Design doesn’t start with pixels or shapes, but with how the brain perceives color and emotion.</h4><figure><img alt=""A yellow LEGO head with a colorful brain sticking out, against a vertical rainbow-striped background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MTkEF1AH8tRpG1IR5iNxSA.png"" /><figcaption>Some elements were created using AI. The final image was composed by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>As designers, we all understand how deeply psychology shapes our work. After all, everything we create is meant to be used by people and their perception and experience are what truly define our products. We listen to our users and aim to make their interaction with our products as effortless and intuitive as possible.</p><p>My goal with this article isn’t just to share theories, but to start a dialogue within the design community, to exchange perspectives, challenge assumptions, and uncover new ways of thinking about how design truly interacts with the human mind.</p><p>Before we move on to specific practices and theories, I’d like to set the stage for how we’ll be talking about psychology in design.</p><h3>Psychology is a science</h3><p>In short, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology""><em>psychology</em></a><em>,</em> according to Britanica, is the science of human behavior, emotions, and perception. For us as designers, it provides a lens that helps us build hypotheses and create meaningful concepts. But I believe it’s crucial to remember that <em>design</em><strong> </strong>is<strong> </strong>neither a result nor a goal only but a process of solving problems, as Design Council mentions it in <a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/fileadmin/uploads/dc/Documents/DesignCouncil_Design%2520methods%2520for%2520developing%2520services.pdf"">their paper</a>. And this process can integrate methods and theories from many different disciplines.</p><figure><img alt=""A red double diamond diagram representing the design process, with two connected diamonds labeled sequentially: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/936/0*UBFR6q7A4iVOekRE.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/the-double-diamond/"">The Design Council’s</a> visual representation of their Double Diamond design and innovation process.</figcaption></figure><p>No matter how appealing our hypotheses may seem, whether they’re based on cutting-edge research or well-established principles, real value for users emerges only when we listen to them, understand what they actually need, and iterate our solutions accordingly.</p><p>So what we’re discussing here is perfect for building design hypotheses but it should never be mistaken for their final proof. Now, let’s examine these concepts of Color Psychology more closely.</p><h3>How our brain perceives color</h3><p>I think we sometimes underestimate the meaning and importance of color in interfaces and design. Yet I would argue that color is one of the most crucial aspects of design itself. I would like support this interpretation with the findings from two scientific paper <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6673893/""><em>Estimation of the Timing of Human Visual Perception from Magnetoencephalography</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00674/full""><em>Early recurrent feedback facilitates visual object recognition under challenging conditions</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Our perception of color begins the moment light hits the retina and activates the cone cells, each sensitive to different wavelengths. The signal is then sent directly to the limbic system, the part of the brain responsible for emotional responses.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram illustrating the visual pathways in the human brain."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*WS_-cGEcUotrnrQ2"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/science/human-eye/The-nervous-messages"">Britanica</a></figcaption></figure><p>This structure evolved long before the neocortex, which handles rational thought. In other words, our emotional brain reacts to color before our logical brain even gets involved. The limbic system also connects emotions with memory, motivation, and instincts, which explains why color can instantly trigger feelings, associations, and even behavioral responses.</p><p>In other words, our brains have evolved to process color before form or content and, importantly, to do so while bypassing the neocortex, which handles rational thinking.</p><p>This means that before your user even begins to consciously recognize shapes or read text, they’ve already experienced an emotional response to the colors on the screen.</p><p>Of course, in research we’re talking about milliseconds but to me, even a reaction that happens up to four times fasteris a huge difference. It reminds us that color doesn’t just decorate a design; it sets the emotional stage for how users will interpret everything that follows.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. I’ll be showing you a series of illustrative images that serve as analogies for how our brain perceives visual information.</p><h4>Sensory perception of color</h4><p>In the first <strong>0–50 milliseconds</strong> after light hits the retina, the cone cells react to the wavelength — it’s <strong>pure physics</strong>. At this stage, your brain doesn’t yet “know” what happened: <em>the signal has just begun its journey through the visual pathway.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Dark background without content on it."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*566ikSMtMS3wXR8SPB7yQA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Primary color processing</strong></h4><p>Around <strong>80–120 milliseconds</strong> after the stimulus, your brain isolates color as a distinct signal. A pure sensation of color forms, along with an <strong>emotional reaction</strong> — because the information is already being processed in the limbic system. <em>You see red. It’s a strong visual stimulus, which is why my element has already captured your attention.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A blurred circular composition with a dark center, a soft gray halo, and a small red area on the left side"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zWPpuLH8_NWA1lF5n5so6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Analysis of shape, contours, and motion</strong></h4><p>At around <strong>150–200 milliseconds</strong>, the brain begins to <strong>calculate geometry, boundaries, texture, and depth</strong>. At this stage, the information is still fragmented. <em>The brain has simply detected a rectangle and a collection of other visual elements,</em> but hasn’t yet formed a complete picture.</p><figure><img alt=""A blurred rectangular shape with a red circle on the left and several black rectangles arranged in two rows on a light gray background, centered against a dark backdrop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Cygio0MxO1iY0-g_bcZl6g.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Object and context recognition</strong></h4><p>After about <strong>200–300 milliseconds</strong>, the information is integrated in the associative cortex — this is the moment when <strong>we recognize what we’re seeing. </strong><em>This is probably a notification.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A light gray rectangular box centered on a black background, featuring scattered black letters of varying sizes and a red exclamation mark symbol inside a circle on the left side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Msmw53t4mBaJQw1hGEIdQg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><h4>Cognitive evaluation</h4><p>Only after about <strong>300–450 milliseconds</strong> from the moment you look at the button does the rational process begin. The neocortex interprets the meaning. <em>A red banner with the word ‘error’ and a warning icon — that means something went wrong in the system.</em></p><figure><img alt=""A centered rectangular notification box with rounded corners on a black background. Inside, a red exclamation mark icon appears to the left of the bold black text “ERROR,” followed by the smaller phrase “Oops! Something went wrong.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZETQsgl4h4a5pKm9rU_ThA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Shevchenko-Tymchuk.</figcaption></figure><p>So I’d like you to notice something: by the time you already felt a slight sense of alert from seeing the red color, your brain still needed another 200–300 milliseconds to fully decode what was actually happening.</p><p>And now, my dear designers, I invite you to try a little experiment. Take any interface design and increase the duration of all animations by 250 milliseconds. You’ll instantly feel how even such seemingly tiny time differences can dramatically change your perception of what you see.</p><h3>The reality of color</h3><p>The second aspect of color that absolutely fascinates me is its duality, especially when it comes to how we perceive it. On one hand, color is a subjective experience but on the other, it’s something we can measure with extraordinary precision.</p><h4>The immeasurable side of color</h4><p>We know that every person is unique, and we still can’t definitively prove or disprove whether we all see colors in the same way as Prof. Semir Zeki states in his Lecture on Color Perception. What we do know is that perception depends on the cone cells in our eyes and their quantity and ratio can vary from person to person.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href"">https://medium.com/media/319a9b559cd834f86cbc166659569f70/href</a><p>And another mystery remains, how exactly our brain interprets colors, and whether it does so in the same way for everyone. Some people can see more or fewer shades, while others might not distinguish basic colors at all. In very rare cases, some individuals may even experience monochromatic vision, not only due to missing cones, but also as a result of brain damage.</p><h4>The true nature of color</h4><p>Color doesn’t actually exist in nature. Yes, that’s right: leaves aren’t really green, the sky isn’t truly blue, and even an emerald isn’t <em>actually</em> green. All of this is an illusion. Our brain’s interpretation of light according to an article <a href=""https://www.spectroscopyonline.com/view/where-perception-meets-reality-the-science-of-measuring-color""><em>Where Perception Meets Reality: The Science of Measuring Color</em></a>.</p><p>In reality, what we see is not color but light. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the cone receptors in our retina are activated in different ways. The wavelength changes because light reflects off objects and that reflection shifts the wave. What’s fascinating is that this shift is influenced not just by the objects themselves but by their atoms.</p><figure><img alt=""Horizontal gradient from dark purple through green to bright red."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1QxEAuRmQORL5qkn.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4639774"">Gringer</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5207327/"">This principle is used by astrophysicists to determine which elements dominate on distant exoplanets</a>: by calculating how specific atoms interact with light. With ultra-sensitive sensors, we can detect even the slightest variations in wavelength reflected from those planets.</p><p>And here’s the key point the atom, the fundamental building block of all matter, has no color of its own. It merely interacts with photons. So, the matter and objects around us are colorless without light.</p><p>So we’ve now touched on the second side of what makes color so fascinating: it’s a sensory stimulus that can be described quantitatively: wavelength, intensity, saturation.</p><p>Unlike many other aspects of psychology, color is something we can measure with extreme precision, minimizing any margin of error in experimental data and making it one of the most reliable subjects for psychological research. Yet it remains a complex phenomenon because, we still can’t fully measure the brain that perceives it.</p><h4><em>The color model I trust most</em></h4><p>At the end of the 19th century, long before Johannes Itten’s theories, Wilhelm Wundt laid the foundation for the psychological classification of color in his work <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wundt/Physio/intro.htm""><em>Principles of Physiological Psychology</em></a>.</p><p>In my opinion, every designer should be familiar with and understand this framework. Wundt was the first to describe color not merely as a physical property of light, but as a set of psychological parameters of perception forming so called “psychological space of color”, defined by three independent dimensions:</p><ol><li><strong>Hue</strong> — the actual type of color (red, green, blue, etc.)</li><li><strong>Saturation</strong> — the degree of color purity, or how much “gray” is mixed into it</li><li><strong>Brightness</strong> — the perceived lightness or luminance of the color</li></ol><p>This concept became the foundation for the later development of these ideas and the creation of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV""><strong>HSV color model</strong></a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison of HSL and HSV color models showing hue, saturation, and lightness/value relationships in 3D diagrams and gradient slices."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*U-kK5AmTp2noWFGJ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source - <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9445469"">Jacob Rus</a></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I tend to use this model most often in design, as it gives far greater control over the visual outcome compared to the more rigid machine-encoded HEX or the physically-based RGB formats. HSV allows you to work with color in a way that feels more natural and intuitive, while still providing precise control for subtle adjustments in the final result.</p><h3>The influence of color on humans</h3><p>Let’s now move from how we perceive color to how it affects us — and how we interpret it from a scientific point of view.</p><h4>Emotional response to color</h4><p>We’ve already touched on the emotional component earlier, so let’s start there. <strong>Warm colors are known to speed up reactions and increase physiological arousal</strong>. According to the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279871278_Color-in-Context_Theory""><em>Color-in-Context Theory</em></a>, warm colors stimulate the nervous system and enhance motor responses. That’s exactly why shades of red, orange, and yellow are so often used for CTA buttons, alerts, and error messages, anywhere we need to grab attention instantly or create a sense of urgency.</p><p>At the same time, the same study notes that <strong>cool colors help reduce stress and create a sense of stability</strong>. Blue and green hues are shown to lower anxiety levels, slow down breathing, and evoke feelings of trust and safety.<br />That’s why these colors are so commonly used in banking, healthcare, and other sensitive interfaces — wherever calmness, reliability, and reassurance are essential.</p><h4>Cognitive response to color</h4><p>We also know that color influences cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and creativity. In a 2009 study <a href=""https://www.appstate.edu/~steelekm/classes/psy5300/Documents/Mehta%26Zhu2009.pdf""><em>Blue or Red? Exploring the Effect of Color on Cognitive Task Performances</em></a>, researchers found that <strong>blue enhances creative thinking</strong> and promotes exploration of new ideas, while <strong>red improves focus and attention</strong> to detail. This means that through color, we can influence not only the emotional state of our users but also guide their cognitive processes, subtly steering their minds toward the state most aligned with the task at hand.</p><h4>Cultural perception of color</h4><p>It’s important to note that the <strong>psychological response to color is largely universal</strong> among humans, according to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/002202217300400201""><em>A Cross-Cultural Study of the Affective Meanings of Color</em></a>, emotional reactions to a color’s brightness and warmth are not dependent on cultural or social context.</p><p>However, <strong>color can also acquire symbolic meaning</strong> such as associations with mourning, happiness, or pain, which are shaped by socio-cultural factors. For instance:</p><ul><li>White represents purity in Western cultures but mourning in China.</li><li>Red is often seen as danger in the West, yet as a symbol of luck and prosperity in Asia.</li><li>Green generally feels positive and natural to most of us, but in Indonesia, it signifies “forbidden.”</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Traffic light with red, yellow, and blue signals above a Japanese sign against a blue sky and green trees."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*9CILeKbx0ZEaBqIj.jpg"" /><figcaption>Image Source - <a href=""http://www.japantravelplanning.com"">www.japantravelplanning.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>So as designers, we can confidently use color to communicate directly with the limbic system, influencing emotion and attention on a biological level but we must also remain aware of cultural context when using color as a symbol, such as the familiar “traffic light logic” so often applied in interface design. For example, until the 20th century, the Japanese language had no separate word for “green.” All hues between blue and green were described by the same word 青い (aoi), meaning both “blue” and “green”, which has led some lights to be a bluer shade of green.</p><h3>Why every designer should start with color psychology</h3><p>I’m sure these theories form the essential foundation every designer should enter the profession with and keep exploring throughout their career. Because in the end, we are learning to speak emotions with our users, and color is what speaks directly to their emotions.</p><p>In my opinion, many of these principles shouldn’t be treated merely as hypotheses that demand constant validation, but as axioms we can confidently build upon. No matter what you test or how you test it, red will always attract more attention than blue, as I wrote earlier, some things are universal.</p><p>It’s important to remember that unless you plan to conduct research on hundreds, maybe thousands, of participants using brain-scanning equipment, you’re unlikely to reinvent the wheel or to prove, through ordinary user testing, a new universal psychological truth about color that hasn’t already been explored by scientists.</p><p>And yet, that’s exactly where I find beauty in being a designer. Because we work with people, not with algorithms. Our role is to ask, to listen, and to adapt, to consider the socio-cultural context, the personal story, and the environments that shape how your user group perceives both color and design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e5e6556919da"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-color-reflex-psychology-that-fires-before-you-think-e5e6556919da"">The color reflex: Psychology that fires before you think</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Ever tried scoping a real project with AI to simulate developers expertise? I did. Here are the results.</h4><figure><img alt=""A woman sits behind her desk, discussing with an AI named Tim on her computer.

Not that my developers colleagues weren’t helpful. But in a fast paced environment, where delivery is key and discovery is secondary, developers aren’t always available.</p><p>During my thesis research about AIs’ impact on dev/designer collaboration, I interviewed designers that had the same experience. That, or they worked in an environment where developers and designers never interacted: everything went through the Product manager.</p><figure><img alt=""A schema simplifying collaboration dynamics between dev, design and a third party, from no communication to continuous communication."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/773/1*N9Skk1lFu6dDoX_De5zdhQ.png"" /><figcaption>These are examples of the collaboration dynamics between the development and design teams that I encountered during my thesis research. Credit: Anna Lefour</figcaption></figure><p>That’s when I decided to test an idea that wandered in my head for some time: <strong>the synthetic developer</strong>.</p><h3>From synthetic user to synthetic dev</h3><p>The first time I heard about a synthetic user was through <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">a classmate’s article</a>. The idea was simple: instead of interviewing real people, you generate a user with AI and run research on them.</p><p>This simple presentation got me to think: <strong>If we can fake users feedbacks, could we fake colleagues expertise too? </strong>After some research,<strong> </strong>I’ve stumbled across very interesting perspectives on synthetic colleagues, going as far as creating <a href=""https://medium.com/%40popov.anatolii.it/the-synthetic-department-working-with-ai-colleagues-24e77cd2fd1d"">a “synthetic department”</a>.</p><p>Fast forward a few months. I was thrown into a project mid-flight. No kickoff, no discovery, no user research. Only an oral briefing, a vague description of the client’s expectations, and the pressure to deliver.</p><p>Normally, this is when I would turn to developers, to help me clarify what’s feasible, what’s risky, what needs prioritizing. But I used this opportunity to test the value of AI as a substitute: I tried working with a synthetic expert, and created Tim.</p><p>And that’s when you may be wondering: <strong>Is this designer suggesting we replace developers with AI? </strong>The answer is no.<strong> </strong>What I wanted to understand was whether a LLM could<strong> replicate the kind of reasoning developers use</strong> when making trade-offs and spotting risks. Not to take their place, but to help designers explore technical constraints when no human counterpart is immediately available.</p><h3>The experiment: building a synthetic developer</h3><p>Tim was a developer persona powered by ChatGPT, my “synthetic dev”. I chose ChatGPT because:</p><ul><li>It has unlimited use (unlike Claude) which was important at the time for my thesis research.</li><li>It’s the designers most used LLM, according to Designlab’s <a href=""https://designlab.com/blog/the-state-of-ai-in-ux-and-product-design-insights-expertise"">State of AI in UX and Product Design</a>.</li></ul><p>Tim’s job was to act as if he were my colleague, ready to discuss scenarios, constraints, and the structure of the interface.</p><figure><img alt=""A screen capture of the details of the persona called Tim."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption>I built a persona for Tim, my synthetic dev. Credit; Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>I gave Tim a detailed persona (experience level, tech stack expertise, communication style) blending the experience of my two colleagues: one senior engineer, one junior developer. I fed him the project brief, including tech stack, user roles, core CRUD features, and industry-specific constraints. Then I ran a structured design discussion, asking him to help me on:</p><ul><li>Generation of typical use scenarios for the 3 main screens detailed in the briefing</li><li>Specific technical constraints depending on the sector the product will be used</li><li>Hypothetical zoning of screens</li></ul><p>Later, I ran the exact same exercise with the two actual developers from my team. Same questions, same format, same project brief.</p><p>The contrast was striking.</p><h3>What the synthetic dev got right (and wrong)</h3><p>Tim excelled at certain tasks. He helped me structure three Jobs To Be Done when I was struggling to articulate user needs clearly. He proposed a data model that anticipated change logs requirements I hadn’t considered (<em>example 1, see image below</em>). He explained complex technical concepts in designer-friendly language. And he was instantly available. But his limitations became clear when context mattered most.</p><figure><img alt=""A set of three examples that have been made confidential and are drawn from the conversation the writer had with the synthetic developer."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UD3EPe2iiIGS5aBq3oDGsg.png"" /><figcaption>Due to confidentiality, I can’t share the exact details of my conversation with Tim. However, I share here some examples. Credit : Anna Lefour</figcaption></figure><p>He also sounded too generic, too polished, too “ChatGPT” (<em>example 2</em>). At times, the responses felt more like “helpful AI assistant” than “Tim the developer”… Especially when offering solutions rather than asking clarifying questions. The persona worked best when I explicitly framed questions as developer-to-designer exchanges, but would drift toward generic helpfulness otherwise.</p><p>More critically, Tim occasionally hallucinated, most notably when he invented industry-specific project experience to justify his choices about the workflows (<em>example 3</em>). But the real issue wasn’t frequent fabrication; it was premature consensus. Tim would propose technically sound solutions without first questioning whether the underlying problem existed.</p><p>He was working from general developer knowledge, not our team’s knowledge.</p><h3>What real developers brought to the table</h3><p>The real developers brought something Tim couldn’t: <strong>skeptical curiosity</strong>. Where Tim would propose solutions, they’d ask “But have you checked with the client if they actually work this way?” Where Tim suggested optimization patterns, they’d question “Do we even have that problem yet?”</p><p>Users with multiple roles, need of in-app authentication for some features, further development of the product… They pointed out infrastructure context, security concerns, feasibility trade-offs, things Tim simply couldn’t know. They also brought institutional knowledge.</p><p>At times, they went too deep, drifting into implementation details that weren’t immediately relevant, but that richness was what anchored the project in reality.</p><p>The conversation didn’t end with answers. It led to relationship-building. We created a dedicated Slack channel for ongoing design-dev exchanges. The collaboration deepened beyond that single project.</p><h3>The real insight: synthetic as scaffolding, not structure</h3><p>What this test taught me about the nature of collaboration itself: AI can help us simulate collaboration, but not replace it.</p><p>Working with Tim showed me the potential of synthetic colleagues as preparation tools. They can:</p><ul><li>Help structure thinking before human discussions</li><li>Generate first-draft solutions to stress-test</li><li>Provide on-demand expertise when humans aren’t immediately available</li><li>Act as a rehearsal tool for complex conversations</li><li>Help us cover any angles we may have missed</li></ul><p>But they also:</p><ul><li>Miss context-specific constraints</li><li>Hallucinate with confidence</li><li>Can’t build relationships</li><li>Don’t challenge assumptions the way humans do</li><li>Lack the messiness that leads to breakthrough insights</li></ul><p>The real developers gave me more than expertise. They gave me relationship, institutional knowledge, and collaborative momentum that extended far beyond our initial conversation.</p><h3>How to use synthetic developers effectively</h3><p>It’s important to take into consideration that my observations are based on this one test, as I couldn’t replicate it with another LLM or for another project (yet).</p><p>Nonetheless, based on my experiment and broader research, here’s my recommendation: adopt a hybrid approach that leverages AI preparation while protecting human collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""A schema with three blocks connected with arrows, showing a simplified version of the framework to use AI in briefs collaboration."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*14f33NCwtlixaaJYzEhftw.png"" /><figcaption>AI-assisted scoping requires expert validation. The hybrid approach gradually improves both AI outputs and team relationships. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>This framework has three interconnected phases:</h3><h4>Phase 1: preparation with AI</h4><p>Use synthetic developers as thinking partners to structure your approach before human discussions. The biggest limitation? They don’t know what they don’t know. Tim’s hallucinations mostly came from lack of context.</p><p>To make this phase effective:</p><ul><li>Document your project context exhaustively (industry, tech stack, existing architecture)</li><li>Ask a real developer to help you craft that context, they’ll know what details matter</li><li>Use AI to generate edge case scenarios, identify potential constraints, draft initial taxonomies</li><li>Formalize concepts you haven’t articulated clearly (in my experiment, Tim helped me structure Jobs To Be Done that became foundation for richer conversations later)</li></ul><p>Making AI useful requires human collaboration upfront. Treat AI outputs as conversation starters that help you ask better questions.</p><h4>Phase 2: e<strong>xpert validation</strong></h4><p>Always validate and enrich AI outputs with real humans. My test showed that Tim could provide useful initial framing, but the real developers brought context, nuance, and ideas no LLM could generate.</p><p>This isn’t about AI replacing 30 minutes of developer time. It’s about making those 30 minutes exponentially more valuable by arriving prepared with structured questions and preliminary solutions to stress-test.</p><p>Expert validation teaches you how to improve your synthetic colleague. What did the AI miss? What context mattered most? Use these insights to refine your prompts and evolve your persona. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s a framework that improves and adapts with each project.</p><h4>Phase 3: collaborative momentum</h4><p>Here’s the critical part: the ease of AI creates a dangerous temptation. When you can get “good enough” answers instantly, it’s easy to skip the messier, slower human conversation. Especially under deadline pressure.</p><p>That shortcut erodes exactly what makes collaboration valuable: relationship-building, institutional knowledge transfer, creative friction that leads to breakthrough insights.</p><p>Set a rule for yourself: If you use AI for preliminary exploration, commit to following up with humans. Even if AI “worked”.</p><p>The Slack channel that emerged from my real developer conversations became infrastructure for future collaboration and documentation of our progress and choices. No amount of synthetic dev efficiency could create that.</p><h3>Final thought</h3><p>Back to my main question: is a synthetic dev the solo designer’s best friend?</p><p>Well, not really. The designer’s best friends are still <strong>the colleagues who bring the expertise she or he lacks</strong>. But the synthetic dev can help bridge the gap: a facilitator to learn the developers’ language, a thinking partner to explore ideas. This experiment proved to me that synthetic actors (devs, users, PMs) aren’t about replacing, but about filling the gaps where communication or collaboration become harder.</p><p>Still,<strong> scaffolding isn’t a house</strong>. A synthetic dev isn’t a colleague.</p><p><strong>The goal was never to replace developers, but to explore how much of their reasoning AI can truly emulate.</strong> The future of design won’t be about choosing between humans and AI.

<h4><strong>The shift in product design with the advent of AI and a potential generative experiential future</strong></h4><blockquote>This short essay explores how core concepts in AI can reframe how product designers think about feedback, intent, and the future of our role.</blockquote><p>A lot has been written about the evolution of user experience since before I ever sat in a Barnes &amp; Noble for hours, trying to understand what the letters “H, C, and I” even meant. In the twelve years since that moment, the tools we use have matured, the rules for interaction have solidified, and the role of design has expanded. We have become a bridge connecting users, businesses, and the technologies that serve them.</p><p>Now, with artificial intelligence entering the public mainstream, a new question emerges: <em>where do we go from here?</em></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/767/1*l9X1bG4711j9SH6efndG5g.png"" /></figure><p>I am not here to push anyone toward <a href=""https://medium.com/@jacquelynyakira/thoughts-on-the-future-of-product-design-in-an-ai-first-world-621be208bfa5"">vibe coding</a>, <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/figma-make-the-biggest-shift-in-ux-ui-since-sketch-5483e18f76d7"">Figma Mak</a>e, or any particular path. Instead, I want to share an idea that came to me while learning the basics of how large language models work. It is a way to start connecting core concepts across domains and help product designers bridge toward the next era of technology. As we move beyond conversational interfaces, we will need new ways of thinking about how to interact with this emerging intelligence.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/451/1*4Psy0Mc7Nh5fyPS89nz9HA.png"" /></figure><p>At the top, I want to recognize that, for the purposes of this article, the term <em>product design</em> can mean many things. Even <a href=""https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-product-design/"">Figma’s own definition</a> lists responsibilities that extend far beyond “pushing pixels.” Product designers excel when they have a deep understanding of how technology works and how the business measures success. Whether supporting key metrics or shaping strategy, our work brings together different domains.</p><p>To do that well, we already think in systems, frameworks, research, and telemetry to influence metrics and drive better outcomes. If we take that same mindset and apply it to concepts from AI such as <strong>training corpus, loss, gradients, and intent</strong>, we can start to see a future where design is not just about arranging interfaces but about understanding <em>how systems learn</em>. That is the bridge I want to explore.</p><h3><strong>What AI teaches us about feedback and learning</strong></h3><p>In almost every conversation about technology today, one word keeps surfacing: <em>data.</em> It shapes the experiences we design, the decisions businesses make, and the intelligence that powers modern systems. For this section, I want to focus on how data in AI can teach us something about our own design process, specifically how we learn and iterate.</p><figure><img alt=""Generic graph showing points as if plotted on an x- and y-axis."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*5IW-t0Tmhfn0pJTGytGu4w.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s pretend we have a bunch of data at our disposal.</figcaption></figure><p>In user experience, we often work with two types of data: qualitative, which describes what people say, and quantitative, which describes what they do or how often they do it. Let’s focus on the quantitative side for a moment. Imagine plotting the results of a usability study on a simple x and y axis, showing effort versus success rate. Now imagine doing something similar with the data an AI model learns from, what’s called its <strong><em>training corpus</em></strong><em> </em>(<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90916291/what-is-a-corpus-ai-corpora-chatgpt"">FastCompany’s article “What is a ‘corpus’”</a>)<em>.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Sample graphs, showing hypothetical data points along an x- and y-axis, one depicting sample usability data and the other training data for an LLM."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*YWP-fStx1-W9Jfr1rHGFWQ.png"" /><figcaption>Let’s imagine plotting our data, once for a usability study and another for our training data.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, an LLM’s data isn’t really this simple, but as a metaphor it helps. Once both sets of data are visualized, we can imagine drawing a line that represents our average user response on one chart and the AI’s predicted understanding on the other. The distance between those lines represents something that exists in both worlds: the gap between what we <em>expect</em> and what we <em>observe.</em></p><figure><img alt=""Hypothetical graphs with data points and an overlayed line on each showing average user response and the other illustrating an LLM’s prediction understanding from training data."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/823/1*NKc49UaujgiY5KKwqm2xOQ.png"" /><figcaption>Now let’s visualize what, as a green line, the average user response or an LLM’s prediction might look like.</figcaption></figure><p>In design, we call that <em>friction.</em> In AI, it’s called <strong><em>loss</em></strong><em>.</em> Both terms describe the cost of being wrong. When we iterate on a flow or redesign a feature to remove friction, we are, in a sense, minimizing loss. Each round of testing gives us more data to adjust our model of the user’s mental model, just as machine learning systems adjust their internal weights to better predict outcomes (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/loss-function"">IBM: What is Loss Function</a>).</p><figure><img alt=""Two graphs showing difference between average lines and data points, illustrating the connected concept(s) of user friction and loss."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/1*W-btC1pdHsjJgBsaIvK-nA.png"" /><figcaption>Difference between our predictions and reality impact our work exponentially irregardless if it is for an experience or an LLM we are creating.</figcaption></figure><p>Consider an onboarding flow where users repeatedly abandon a form at the “Company Name” field. Once identified, we might re-label the field or make it optional, reducing friction and improving completion rates. That adjustment mirrors how an AI system corrects its parameters after identifying an error.</p><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating data points towards desired average path to highlight how iteration and optimization are key for usability and LLM performance."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*XD_oG9iPScZzYRwO7Vjy7w.png"" /><figcaption>Tweaking an LLM’s parameters, or iterating on an experience, helps us optimize both.</figcaption></figure><p>This is where the concept of <strong><em>gradients</em></strong> comes in. In machine learning, a gradient measures the direction and magnitude of change needed to reduce loss. Think of it like rolling a ball down a landscape toward the lowest point (<a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gradient-descent"">IBM: What is Gradient Descent?</a>). The slope tells the model how to adjust its parameters to improve performance. In product design, we do something similar every time we interpret usability data or customer feedback to decide what to change next. Our gradient is directional insight, the sense of where to move to make the experience smoother.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating a curved line representing a downward slope, a gradient descent, with a data point at the bottom showing zero loss or friction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/563/1*qHoM1I0rStyKAZN37XXCng.png"" /><figcaption>By tweaking parameters, of an LLM or an experience, we should see a reduction of friction and loss until they, ideally, disappear.</figcaption></figure><p>The iterative process that defines good design is, in many ways, a form of gradient descent. We identify where users struggle, adjust our assumptions, and measure again. Over time, our understanding converges toward what users need. It is not perfect, but neither are machine learning models; both are approximations refined through feedback.</p><p>If there’s one takeaway from this parallel, it’s that feedback, whether from people or from data, is not an afterthought. It’s the learning mechanism that keeps systems aligned with reality. And just as models can overfit to their training data, teams can overfit to internal assumptions or stakeholder preferences. In both cases, the cure is the same: structured, ongoing feedback loops that balance exploration with correction.</p><h3>Design as a system of optimization</h3><p>Now that we understand the shared language of feedback and learning between design and AI, it helps to zoom out and look at how these loops exist across every layer of our work. Most senior product designers already know that the interfaces we craft are only one piece of a much larger system. As noted in <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/"">Nielsen Norman’s levels of UX maturity</a>, mature groups and practitioners move beyond pixels to build frameworks, strategic models, and alignment structures. Even at these higher levels, tight loops of feedback and iteration guide what we do.</p><p>If learning and iteration exist at every level, our role is to understand how those levels connect. Each one has its own kind of <em>loss</em> to minimize and its own signals to optimize. We can roughly think of three layers at play:</p><ul><li><strong>Designers optimizing interfaces</strong>: reducing friction and improving micro-interactions (<em>micro Jobs to Be Done</em>).</li><li><strong>Interfaces optimizing user journeys</strong>: helping people complete the key <em>Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)</em> that deliver product value.</li><li><strong>Organizations optimizing outcomes</strong>: aligning those journeys to business metrics such as adoption, retention, and revenue.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Image illustrating three key levels in enterprise product design design and various focuses and example intents."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/582/1*u_7UvtufIi01PV66ZQC8RA.png"" /><figcaption>Product designers working strategically naturally optimize across three key layers in their work. Leveraging key signals across each level, alongside the goals (or intents), lets us understand the loss and how we can iterate to eliminate loss.</figcaption></figure><p>At the first level, designers focus on immediate signals like click rates or error events to reduce friction and guide users toward small but meaningful completions. At the next level, we expand our view to higher-order goals, such as “users complete their profile within thirty days.” These are composite outcomes that indicate whether our product fulfills its promises. Finally, at the organizational level, we zoom out again to see how entire journeys and feature sets contribute to larger KPIs and OKRs. Each level informs the others, forming a continuous loop of optimization from micro-interaction to business strategy.</p><figure><img alt=""Graphic illustrating simplified click-path and sample metrics across three optimization levels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*sjffZcAXhKJXXoqAhS5v7g.png"" /><figcaption>Mapping optimization cycles in traditional experiential design, with accompanying signals, might look something like this.</figcaption></figure><p>As product designers, our work is shifting away from static interfaces and toward orchestrating these systems of <strong><em>intent</em></strong> which I mentally still hold in the same place as a JTBD. With the looming advent of more generative experiences, our influence lies less in deciding where each pixel goes and more in defining the <em>direction</em> a system should learn toward. Our task becomes identifying the goals for each layer, ensuring the feedback flowing through them is meaningful, and guiding the system to reduce its loss at every scale.</p><figure><img alt=""Simple graphic illustrating how a simple set of activities could change with inclusion of generative UI elements and their potential new signals for measurement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*8sMLLbyQ0JBSwfxSUin98g.png"" /><figcaption>Signals become more about accuracy of identifying user needs (intent) and correlating actions an LLM takes towards supporting desired outcomes (such as delivering most impactful copy to encourage someone to purchase a product).</figcaption></figure><p>Doing that requires data and this is where many organizations struggle. In my experience at both small and large enterprise companies, few have mature instrumentation strategies that connect in-product signals to their KPIs or OKRs. The result is a blind spot: teams can’t see how user intent translates to business outcomes, especially in environments increasingly shaped by AI. When instrumentation is thoughtfully designed, those signals become the gradients we follow. They allow us to see where experiences fall short, measure how far off the mark they are, and iteratively align the product, the user, and the business.</p><p>Directionally similar to other schools of thought, such as from Claudia Canales’ <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/beyond-the-model-a-systems-approach-to-ai-product-design-fd9917750993"">Beyond the Model: a systems approach to AI product design</a>, positioning design as a system, I see it as one of optimization and not creating perfect screens. It’s about cultivating feedback systems that learn alongside users. When product designers learn to interpret intent, orchestrate signals, and balance the goals of each layer, we build the foundation for truly adaptive, AI-infused experiences.</p><h3>From control to guidance</h3><p>As product designers, many of us are used to controlling every element of the experience. But as generative systems begin composing parts of the interface for us, our value shifts from crafting the final form to defining the conditions that shape it. We move from being <em>the maker</em> to being <em>the guide</em> — designing how intent, data, and feedback interact to keep the system aligned with human goals.</p><p>Imagine opening your design tool and seeing a generative prototype already built around inferred intent. You don’t redraw components; you evaluate signals: <em>Did the model understand the job correctly? Did the feedback loop close?</em> That shift, from crafting to curating, is one direction our craft might be headed. Our influence doesn’t disappear; it evolves.</p><p>When we see design as a system of optimization, we stop treating AI as a separate discipline, or the latest tool to use, and start seeing it as a mirror. It reflects how we already work: learning, adjusting, and seeking balance between human intent and technical possibility. The next evolution of design isn’t about replacing what we do, but about scaling how we learn.</p><p>In the next article of this series, I’ll explore how instrumentation and <em>Jobs to Be Done</em> can serve as the connective tissue between intent and measurement — the practical levers we can use to steer generative systems toward meaningful outcomes.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1d372707472d"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/from-design-to-direction-bridging-product-design-and-ai-thinking-1d372707472d"">From design to direction: Bridging product design and AI thinking</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
