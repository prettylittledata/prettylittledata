<h4>The question is no longer what AI might take from us, but how quickly we can hand it over.</h4><figure><img alt=""Scrabble tiles on a blue grid spell “FOMO,” emphasizing the sense of urgency and modern anxiety of missing out. Other tiles are scattered around."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MUaqGyzxim_7TGMDJaUMYQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image source: <a href=""https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/"">https://workforceexperience.hp.com/blog/ai-fomo/</a></figcaption></figure><p>Like many professionals thinking about the future of design, I’m closely following the conversations around AI — both in public forums and in my own circles. But while many focus on the technical capabilities, I’m more interested in the broader narrative shaping these discussions. And recently, based on my observations, that narrative is shifting. The early fear that machines might erode the very qualities that make us human is giving way to a different anxiety—FoMO.</p><p><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213000800"">FoMO — fear of missing out — is more than a buzzword</a>. Psychologists define it as the anxious belief that others are gaining opportunities or rewards that we’re excluded from. It’s not a fear of loss, but of being left behind while the world moves ahead.</p><p>It seems like only yesterday we were discussing <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/"">existential risks</a>, automation’s threat to work, and the unsettling possibility that <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creativity itself might be mechanized</a>. Now we talk mostly about how to “<a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/91278500/how-to-make-generative-ai-a-partner-in-your-daily-workflow"">integrate</a>” AI into our workflows, how to “<a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stay-competitive-ai-era-openai-cfo-sarah-friar-2025-8"">stay competitive</a>,” and how not to miss the wave.</p><p>So what changed? Have we given up? Or have we simply convinced ourselves that AI won’t harm humanity. More likely, it’s because the rewards of this technology are immediate and obvious, while the costs are slow and subtle.</p><p>AI provides us speed, convenience, and capability — and it offers them now. But the erosion it causes creeps in quietly, almost imperceptibly. And because of this subtle degradation, we fail to treat it with the urgency it deserves.</p><p>However, out of all the potential consequences such as <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/"">job replacement</a>, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/27/the-intersection-of-ai-and-human-creativity-can-machines-really-be-creative/"">creative outsourcing</a>, and <a href=""https://technologymagazine.com/news/ai-giants-accused-of-the-largest-ip-theft-in-music-history"">intellectual theft</a>, what troubles me most is the silent replacement of human effort with efficiency— a trade that feels harmless in the moment but carries profound consequences over time.</p><p>Take students, for example — a group I see up close. Under the illusion they’re being efficient (or duplicitous in some cases), they utilize AI to generate ideas or complete work, outsourcing the most essential part of learning — the struggle.</p><p>When we skip the messy and difficult decisions that build the foundation of <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">judgment</a>, we never develop the critical skills needed to distinguish strong work from weak.</p><p>Judgment is not something we’re born with, it’s something shaped by repeated trial and error. It takes root in wrestling with constraints, making mistakes, and steadily refining our instincts. Remove the struggle, and the capacity for discernment withers.</p><p>A clear example is someone using AI to build a simple landing page. If they don’t know how to code, they can’t judge whether the output is any good — they have to trust the system. Yet AI still makes errors, even on straightforward tasks like citing accurate sources. The same problem appears in design or writing, where assessing quality is even harder for those without expertise.</p><p>This is a major reason why <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078"">seasoned professionals now hold a greater advantage than ever</a>—they have access to both the tools and the wisdom, while juniors have only the tools — tools that are steadily eroding their ability to gain valuable experience the way pre-AI generations did.</p><p>As individual discernment atrophies, the collective standard drops too. Across disciplines, the more AI fills the space with what many describe as “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop"">AI slop</a>”, the less we train ourselves to recognize what is excellent. Culture becomes saturated with “good enough” work that looks polished but lacks substance. Over time, we lose sight of what depth even is.</p><p>This is why effort matters. We stand in awe of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel"">Sistine Chapel</a> or are moved by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-fFHeTX70Q"">Beethoven</a> not just because of their beauty, but because they embody human striving. They carry the weight of years, mistakes, and relentless pursuit.</p><p>If a machine produced the same artifacts tomorrow, they might be identical, but their meaning would evaporate. Without elements of human labor — physical or psychological — such art is reduced to decoration.</p><figure><img alt=""A person gazes at the Sistine Chapel’s intricate, colorful ceiling and wall frescoes, depicting biblical scenes with vivid figures and dynamic movement."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y6Q8NXeG2OXzz5fxAKOqzg.jpeg"" /><figcaption>AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What frustrates me most is that these aren’t side effects — they’re seismic shifts that demand serious attention. Yet our feeds are flooded with influencers and pseudo-experts insisting that AI is good because it frees us from “tedious” work for “higher-level” tasks. There’s some truth in that — yes, that’s how it <em>should</em> be used — but that’s not how it’s actually being used.</p><p>I know because I catch myself leaning on it for tasks I should be able to do — and do quickly — on my own, especially those that require a touch of humanity, like a sympathetic email to a colleague. Or shaping a big idea that should start with my own vision. It’s an unsettling tendency I’m confident others can relate to.</p><p>But all of these concerns are routinely dismissed as inconvenient footnotes to the next AI product launch. And this is all taking place while a <a href=""https://time.com/7322418/chat-gpt-open-ai-nvidia-tech-monopoly/"">handful of corporations</a> — companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and OpenAI — are consolidating control over the infrastructure of culture itself. And we, as spectators, seem willing to watch as they chip away at what makes us human, all in the name of efficiency and our fixation on the next shiny innovation.</p><p>Maybe the most insidious part of this whole phenomenon is how normalized it’s become. Companies slap “AI-powered” onto products that don’t need it, like “gluten-free” labels on steak, because it’s easier to follow the trend than to ask if the trend makes sense.</p><p>Professionals and students panic that they’ll be unemployable if they don’t master these tools. Creatives worry they’ll be irrelevant if they don’t use them. And so everyone piles in — not out of conviction, but out of fear.</p><p>Conversations about purpose and meaning are being drowned out by the noise. These questions still surface, but they disappear beneath the hype faster than new AI startups can cash in.</p><p>And yet, for all this cynicism, hope isn’t gone. The technology is not destiny. It’s a mirror. It reflects our values back at us. If we allow convenience, speed, and efficiency to be our highest values, AI will amplify those — and hollow out everything else. But if we insist on preserving depth, effort, wisdom, and meaning, AI could become a tool that serves those ends rather than undermines them.</p><p>The choice is still ours, though it grows harder with each passing month. Words like these often echo unheard — and that may be the strongest reason to pause now. The real danger isn’t that machines will surpass us, but that in our desperation not to miss out, we’ll forget that being human means sometimes slowing down and doing things the hard way — because that’s how we grow.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d628aacfb950"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/fear-of-missing-out-on-ai-is-overshadowing-the-fear-of-losing-our-humanity-d628aacfb950"">Fear of missing out on AI is overshadowing the fear of losing our humanity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety.</h4><p>Imagine a neighborhood with no sidewalks or ramps. Someone using a wheelchair or a parent pushing a stroller is immediately forced to drive or rely on others just to run simple errands.</p><p>This planning was intentional: it was designed for cars and against people who need help getting around. Every single choice, from storm drain placement to road approval, was a decision that left people out. Just as poor infrastructure creates physical barriers, unclear language creates digital barriers.</p><figure><img alt=""Minimalist illustration of a suburban street with a light grey asphalt road, a high sidewalk, a streetlamp, and green rolling hills under a light blue sky"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8j6He40LoOSgVN1e5a-8Uw.png"" /><figcaption>An illustration of a grey asphalt road bordered on the right by a high, light-colored sidewalk with a distinct, vertical curb — (Grant Yun).</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve recently become responsible for most of the UX writing on my product team, handling everything from button labels to complex error flows, and I know I’m not alone. In countless organizations, product designers are often the ones filling in the final text. Because this is usually the last step, it’s easy to treat the content as a quick fill-in, something you automate or even turn to AI to quickly generate.</p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that this perspective misses the point. <strong>The writing is the design.</strong> The rise of AI tools only makes this clearer: AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety. When you view every word as a key design element, you move past simple writing and actually create the user’s experience.</p><p>For any designer who feels writing is just an extra task, this article shares a framework. It treats language as a core design function and the essential tool for building products that are usable, useful, and responsible.</p><h3><strong>Writing vs. Designing</strong></h3><p>When approaching a piece of content, most people immediately ask: <em>“How should those words be written?”</em> This is a tough place to start. Before you write anything, you must first think about designing the experience you want your users to have.</p><p>This is the key difference between the two mindsets:</p><ul><li>Writing Mindset asks: <em>How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action?</em></li><li>Design Mindset asks: <em>What problem are we solving? What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next?</em></li></ul><p>Writing is about fitting words together. Designing is about solving problems for your users. You cannot have one without the other; they must work together.</p><p>As Nicole Fenton, coauthor of <em>Nicely Said</em>, puts it: “<em>I use language to solve problems… I use words as material [1].</em>”</p><p>Your words build digital experiences. You are designing interfaces that allow people to pay bills, send emails, or order food. Every word included in those experiences directly shapes the user’s understanding, feeling, and outcome.</p><h3><strong>The usable useful responsible (UUR) framework</strong></h3><p>Designing with words is more than just arranging letters into sentences. To be truly effective, you have to think of your work not as a writing task, but as a design mandate. It demands skills far beyond basic writing.</p><figure><img alt=""The Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework text is shown above a large, yellow, four-stud building block (like a LEGO brick). The brick symbolizes the foundational components of the design framework."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hxr5i39R1NYwKkafChP-_A.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a LEGO block, symbolizing the building block of a designer’s writing: the Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework</figcaption></figure><h4>1. Usable words</h4><p>When a product is usable, people can complete their tasks without needing help or instructions. For designers, creating usability means making sure your words act as a guide. The language itself must be clear so users can quickly finish their task.</p><p>This level of clarity is critical for everyone, but especially for those with cognitive disabilities, those who are stressed, or those using screen readers. As content design expert Sarah Richards says: <strong><em>“Accessibility is usability.”</em></strong> If your words aren’t easy for everyone to use, you’ve made a design choice that prevents some people from using your product [2].</p><p>Consider a simple login screen on a mobile app. The way the error message is written determines if the user can easily proceed:</p><ul><li><strong>Unusable writing (Poor design)</strong></li></ul><p>Login failed (<em>User is confused; they must guess if the email, password, or registration is the problem.</em>) (<em>User is offered no path forward.</em>)</p><ul><li><strong>Usable writing (<em>Good design</em>)</strong></li></ul><p>Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos. (<em>User knows exactly what is wrong: their account doesn’t exist.</em>) (<em>User is offered a clear, actionable solution: register or correct their mistake.</em>)</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two mobile login screens. The screen on the left shows an unclear error: “Login failed.” The screen on the right shows a clear, useful error message under the email field: “Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6ZDivlMQGmS3DVHnwJ5MPg.png"" /><figcaption>A comparison between two different ways a login screen handles an error, illustrating the difference between unuseful and useful feedback.</figcaption></figure><p>This demonstrates how usable writing guides the user by providing clarity (<em>what went wrong</em>) and actionability (<em>what to do next</em>).</p><h4>2. Useful words</h4><p>For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor your users’ intent. Useful writing gives people control and prioritizes their needs, balancing them with business goals. When you respect users, they are motivated to keep giving you their time and attention.</p><p>For example, when a user intends to delete an account, useful writing must provide a clear path to complete that goal. A design that makes this process intentionally difficult through deceptive language is a classic example of making a product unuseful.</p><p><strong>Unuseful writing (User-hostile design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Hold On! Are You Sure You Want to Deactivate Your Profile and Lose Your Benefits?”</blockquote><p>Uses emotionally charged language, focusing on loss, to dissuade the user from their clear intent. Buttons: Cancel (Prominently styled, primary color) and Deactivate Later (Small, secondary color).</p><p>The issue here is it offers “Deactivate” instead of “Delete” to mislead the user into thinking the account is merely paused, retaining their data for marketing.)</p><p><strong>Useful writing (User-first design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Permanently Delete Your Account?”</blockquote><p>This is direct, unambiguous question honoring the user’s intent. Buttons: Yes, Delete Account (Clear, destructive) and Cancel (Neutral color).</p><p>It gives the user the necessary control and confirms the final, irreversible action.</p><figure><img alt=""A comparison of two account closure screens. The screen on the left, marked with an ‘X’, uses a dark pattern by asking the user to “Deactivate later,” making it difficult to find the option to permanently delete the account. The screen on the right, marked with a checkmark, has a clear title, “Permanently delete your account,” and a prominent red “Yes, Delete account” button."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6Kz54gsU90EUmzkt16HEA.png"" /><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of user interfaces for closing an account, demonstrating good and bad design.</figcaption></figure><p>Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it.</p><h4>3. Responsible words</h4><p>As a designer, you are responsible for what you put into the world. To write responsibly, you have to consider how your words could be used and, crucially, misused.</p><p>Irresponsible writing often weaponizes language. A popular example is “confirm-shaming,” where an interface asks a user for something (like an email) and then forces them to say or think something negative about themselves to decline.</p><figure><img alt=""Website footer featuring a newsletter subscription box that employs Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) text to pressure users into signing up to avoid “paying more” or missing “insider knowledge.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*542HwlftSE_p38Y_YDOlOw.png"" /><figcaption>A footer dark pattern example using fear of missing out (FOMO) and implied punishment (“paying more”) to pressure users into subscribing.</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, in a static footer that asks for an email:</p><ul><li>The headline creates anxiety: <strong><em>“Don’t be the last to know!”</em></strong></li><li>The subtext acts as the shaming mechanism: <strong><em>“If you’re okay with missing out on essential insider knowledge and paying more, just scroll on by.”</em></strong> This forces the user to internally validate that they are “okay with missing out” and “paying more” in order to ignore the field, making the act of declining feel like a financial or intellectual failure.</li></ul><p>As a designer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people. You must ask: <strong>Are they true? Are they kind? Are they inclusive?</strong></p><h3>Aligning your team before you write</h3><p>I’ve spent time with my team and stakeholders debating word choice. For example, should a button say “Buy” or “Purchase”? Stakeholders often look for a “best practice” answer: what does Amazon do? But asking this question is frustrating and distracts from the real issue.</p><figure><img alt=""A side-by-side comparison of two identical product cards for Wireless Headphones priced at ₦45,000. The card on the left uses a clear black button labeled “Buy.” The card on the right uses a black button labeled “Purchase”."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rm4pzevukAWkAjP4zpHePg.png"" /><figcaption>A visual comparison of product card buttons: one uses the clear, direct label “<strong>Buy</strong>,” while the other uses the more verbose label “<strong>Purchase</strong>.”</figcaption></figure><p>The right answer isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about what works for your users and what your team needs to achieve. Before you can choose “Buy” or “Purchase,” you need a clear strategy.</p><blockquote>Strategy simply means getting everyone aligned on a shared focus. It tells the team what to do, and what to ignore.</blockquote><p>A simple strategy statement connects four key elements:</p><ol><li>User Type</li><li>User Need</li><li>Value Provided</li><li>Business Benefit</li></ol><p>For example:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We help budget-conscious buyers easily acquire high-quality audio gear so they can enjoy superior sound immediately, which supports AudioFlow’s goal of increasing first-time conversions and positive word-of-mouth.”</blockquote><p>This statement immediately provides direction. Since the goal is easy acquisition for a wide, budget-conscious audience, choosing the clearest, most conversational word “Buy” over the more formal “Purchase” is the right strategic move.</p><h3>A framework for writing with AI</h3><p>The fundamentals of good writing are clarity, concision, and empathy, and they remain essential even with AI tools. While AI can draft text very quickly, its output often lacks soul. What makes UX writing truly effective is your ability to go beyond that basic text by understanding the user’s context, establishing a consistent brand voice, and skillfully modulating the tone.</p><figure><img alt=""A dark-themed AI chat interface with the text, “What are you working on?” and an input field labeled “+ Ask anything.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFCaD0VnkoHsOfo6poGUtQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays a minimal, dark-themed AI chat interface</figcaption></figure><p>To integrate AI responsibly without compromising your voice, ethics, or craft, adopt a mindset where AI is a co-pilot used for generating options, while you the designer remain the pilot responsible for strategy and empathy.</p><p>Use this three-step strategic filter to integrate AI outputs into your workflow:</p><h4>1. Prompt with strategy</h4><p>Your input to the AI must be dictated by your established voice and tone documentation, not just your immediate need. Instead of a simple request like “<em>Write an error message</em>,” let your prompt provide a clear strategy like:</p><blockquote>“Write a toast notification message for a mobile app. The user just clicked an expired password reset link. Use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone. The message must tell them to request a new link, and it must be concise.”</blockquote><p>This single prompt bundles the following elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Voice &amp; Tone:</strong> “confident, empathetic, and direct tone”</li><li><strong>Constraint:</strong> “toast notification message for a mobile app,” must “be concise,” and must tell them to “request a new link.”</li></ul><p>The resulting AI output, <strong>“</strong><em>Your link has expired. Please request a new link to continue</em><strong>,”</strong> is a direct result of these layered instructions, showing how strategic input creates high-quality, on-brand UX copy right away.</p><figure><img alt=""An AI prompt and response about writing a confident and empathetic toast notification for an expired password reset link. The suggested text is: “Oops! This password reset link has expired. Please request a new one to continue.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*iR2uvwZpb93L_owDW2X_uA.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot displays an AI prompt asking for a concise toast notification about an expired password link, instructing the AI to use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone.</figcaption></figure><h4>2. Filter for empathy (Review)</h4><p>The first and most critical step when reviewing AI output is to filter for the human element and inclusivity. AI outputs often rely on aggregated data that can perpetuate bias, use idioms, or assume an emotional state.</p><ul><li><strong>Check for Exclusion:</strong> Does the output use any terminology (gendered, ableist, or overly colloquial) that might alienate a specific population?</li><li><strong>Check for Assumption:</strong> Does the message assume the user is happy, smart, or calm? (e.g., avoid “Great job!” or “Finally!”)</li><li><strong>Check for Idioms:</strong> Is the language literal and ready for translation, or does it rely on cultural shorthand that an international user or machine translator would miss?</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI simplifying an idiomatic English text for better translatability and clarity. The rewritten text is: “Thank you for signing up! You can now access all our features. We will guide you through how to use them quickly.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/933/1*8P0Dvi1e_uwQTQcPgm_3ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of an AI being instructed to refine copy for translatability and clarity</figcaption></figure><h4>3. Edit for core principles (Output)</h4><p>After the output passes the empathy filter, focus on refining the language to ensure it is clear, concise, and authentically human.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear:</strong> Edit for ambiguity. Ensure the language precisely describes the action and the object. For example, does the button label “Save” mean “Save All” or “Save this section”? This clarity is paramount.</li><li><strong>Concise:</strong> Cut out extra words<strong>.</strong> Look at what the AI wrote and remove anything you don’t need, like long, overly nice phrases or confusing descriptions. These just slow the user down. Your main goal is to get to the point quickly so the user can finish their task fast and easily.</li><li><strong>Human:</strong> Finally, edit for rhythm by reading the final output aloud to check for natural cadence. Does the writing sound like a robot, or does it flow naturally with appropriate contractions and pacing? The human ear is the ultimate tool for catching stilted or forced language, ensuring the final tone is authentic and engaging.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example of an AI successfully applying UX writing principles (Clear, Concise, Human) to rewrite a long, passive sentence into the direct call-to-action: “Click the button below to save your work and keep your changes.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/841/1*wyYZ2s8cL7KKXuCCI19ZzQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a conversation with an AI where the user is successfully using UX writing principles to edit a draft text</figcaption></figure><p>By following this three-step framework of strategic prompting, empathy filtering, and editing for clarity, concision, and human tone, you can use AI to create high-quality UX copy without losing your voice or affecting the user experience.</p><h3>Designing error messages that help users</h3><p>Error messages are often the most visible things we write, and they appear exactly when users are stressed and confused. While the best error is one that never happens, we must treat any error as a chance to help people finish their work.</p><p>When people use a product, they are focused on completing a task, not on figuring out how the app works. Running into an error is a hard stop to their goal. Instead of assuming the user is doing something “wrong,” your job is to design a better experience. <em>As expert Kathy Sierra says, focus on helping your users become “more skillful, more powerful users [3].”</em></p><h4>The problem with generic errors</h4><p>Companies often blame the user for errors as a way to protect their own image. However, error messages that quietly point the finger at the user and make them feel bad actually harm the brand, causing people to stop using the product and decreasing loyalty.</p><p>When the real problem is a technology or design failure, you should be honest. For example, the email service Mailchimp uses its distinct brand voice to be apologetic, transparent, and helpful when an error occurs. This approach shows they’re committed to guiding the user forward, not blocking them.</p><figure><img alt=""An example of transparent customer service communication from Mailchimp Support, acknowledging a server outage and setting expectations for a multi-hour resolution time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/1*uVDnV1xXKW2ACp25PicWdw.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of effective, honest error communication, characteristic of a user-first approach.</figcaption></figure><p>If something goes wrong, do everything you can to make sure your users aren’t taking the blame. Focus on helping them achieve their goal.</p><h4>The designer’s error framework</h4><p>To guide users through or around failures, you must design your language using three principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> The best error message is the one the user never sees. Use visual design and interaction (like autocomplete or automatic formatting) to prevent the error from happening in the first place.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile address search interface showing real-time autocomplete suggestions to help the user find and select a location and avoid typing errors."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Aq6tX3Ha-83mo9V5ho_Vgw.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows an example of the avoid principle in the error framework, using interactions like autocomplete to prevent data entry errors</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Explain:</strong> When an error occurs, clearly and quickly tell the user what went wrong and why (e.g., “Your return date must be after your departure date”). Never leave the user guessing.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Mobile travel booking form showing a date validation error. The return date is incorrectly set before the departure date, and an explicit error message explains the required date order to the user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rHwhSDosSBAzaOZfIyT6SQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for a travel booking app demonstrating the explain principle of the error framework.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Easily the most critical component.

<h4><em>We changed our design mindset. We transitioned from building all the interfaces and prototypes to allowing others to develop their ideas in a safe place, following our design and product rules.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""lego pieces from the internet"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hlqhE85hxbODSNrRSZUXZw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives.</figcaption></figure><h4>Fully immersed in AI dynamics</h4><p>Like almost all technology companies today, we are influenced and affected by AI at our core. Part of this technology adoption has brought new company challenges <em>(ways of work, roles, technical knowledge, etc)</em>. Still, it has also led to many positive developments and ideas, allowing us to transform old problems into new opportunities.</p><p>Once AI was established as the new technology core, we are playing in a new, unknown field full of opportunities but also uncertainties. How do we build products now? How do we design? How do we work under new rules and roles? Those are questions that we don’t have a solid answer to yet, but in time, we will figure it out. The other side of the story is the opportunities AI will uncover if we choose to adopt this new approach with conviction.</p><p>This article explains how we <em>(a Latam HR rising start-up) </em>are innovating from a humble concept, an approach that has been positively adopted and significantly changed the way we work.</p><h4>From embracing AI to innovating with it</h4><p>Due to a company event (a hackathon), the UX team and I decided to build something special to present as pre-work. It was a fully functional chat interface made in Cursor for all teams to use and place their ideas, ensuring that whatever they create will maintain all Design System tokens and components. From this simple idea, something bigger started to grow after the event. We wondered what would happen if we decided to build a fully functional dummy platform where everyone could create, play, and share? That’s how the <strong>Product Playground</strong> was born — a simple tool that has already made us think about how we should work from now on.</p><h4>What’s a Product Playground?</h4><figure><img alt=""Papumba video game"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YadChw-B6H4iGTomC6tYEQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Building mode is a popular feature in video games like Fortnite, Fallout 4, The Sims, Minecraft, and Roblox, among others. It allows players to construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The concept is straightforward yet robust because of the transformations we are experiencing in this new AI field. The concept of having a place where everyone can “build ideas” connects with the spirit of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXFTXsWsBfo"">building mode feature in video games,</a> where users can construct, customize, and manipulate structures and objects within a game world.</p><p>Having a “test or creation environment” in tech companies has, until now, been one that only engineers could use, so enabling everyone to use a test platform to create products easily was disruptive, at least for us.</p><p>The definition goes like this <em>(still in progress)</em>: The Product Playground is a local environment that “simulates” products in a fundamental way, in terms of their structure and composition <em>(gray boxes and text)</em>. The idea is that it can be a place to “play” with quick ideas and functionalities, enabling us to have rapid conversations with teams and users.</p><p>Each PM and designer will have their own Playground, enabling them to share with other teams and internal and external clients, thus receiving faster feedback in an environment closely resembling production reality.</p><p>While creating this new dummy world with my teammate, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-vega-ux/""><strong>David Vega</strong></a>, we realized the potential we could exploit from it, along with the new challenges of protocols and design handoff. To us, those concerns were beautiful problems to tackle if the idea could make an impact, and it did.</p><h4>How does it work?</h4><a href=""https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href"">https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href</a><p>Part of the essence of the Product Playground is to be really friendly to everyone outside the engineering team; therefore, we decided to build this Playground with some UX foundations. To start, there is a “read me first” section where users can understand all the knowledge behind this tool, such as the definition, step-by-step setup, templates, design validator, and tool documentation.</p><p>Once users understand how to operate the tool <em>(it is effortless, though)</em>, they need to pull the repository where the playground lives, and that’s it; you can start to play. We were also cautious in providing some initial prompts to make fundamental changes within the tool, and from there, the imagination is the limit.</p><h4>Scopes and levels of solutions</h4><figure><img alt=""Playground interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lsXnttQ2K2uFwdgSDDF3Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Current Product Playground (home) interface with navigation and functional sections ready to be modified</figcaption></figure><p>We started small, as we always do when building products. So far, we have launched the first version of Product Playground and achieved our primary goal: to spark interest in creating products and sharing ideas among people. We believe this version shouldn’t be the end, so we are planning to evolve the AI tool into something more interesting. Here’s the evolution scope we’re planning:</p><p><strong>Phase one:<br /></strong>Mission: “Play and Share”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Local environments</li><li>Local component library in Cursor (Design System tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase two:<br /></strong>Mission: “Real components, real environments”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>Actual company library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase three:<br /></strong>Mission: “Company Standard Code”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>UBITS library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components) + rules</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li><li>Code reviewed and optimized for engineering.</li></ul><p>We believe that with this AI tool or concept, our way of understanding product building has changed. From our company’s perspective, we see a lot of benefits to highlight, such as:</p><ul><li>Functional designs and ideas that can feel more real in their iterations.</li><li>Speed ​​in idea validation <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/did-ai-kill-the-systems-thinking-skills-in-ux-701f845f18d4""><em>(acceleration stage)</em></a>.</li><li>Shift from the “traditional” mindset that says I must rely on third parties to validate or create something.</li><li>Independence when building product experiences from an idea.</li><li>Engineering inputs; in more advanced phases of the Playground, the components and layouts will be the official ones from the company libraries.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Plagound interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/1*3qzuJFndKCkNLQpSBpwR3A.png"" /><figcaption>Interface exercise with real elements and components of the design system</figcaption></figure><p>We acknowledge that not everything is rainbows and sunshine. With this new way of building products, we anticipate some big questions and challenges, such as the role of a designer as we know it <em>(I’ll explain it in a few paragraphs)</em> and whether the new handoff method will be a Product playground link. What should happen with Figma files? Do we even need it since now we have a new construction platform? The reality is that we’re discovering answers as soon as we move with this idea. I hope to get you an answer in my next article.</p><h4>A new design mindset?</h4><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, we’re experimenting with a possible design mindset shifting process; how do we know? With this new tool, interface design is not just a job for professionals; it’s for everyone. As a result, our design duty may shift to something unfamiliar: the design of systems, or as we’ve started to call it, <strong>Infrastructure design.</strong> We’re not pretending to add another design role to the already confusing list in the industry, but in scenarios like this, naming what we are building gives us ownership of ideas and processes.</p><p>Infrastructure design, as we understand it, involves the planning, design, and maintenance of a large product platform where others can come to build. Our priority right now is to provide all the building blocks <em>(Design system, user experiences, interactions, etc.) </em>to allow others to create. So immediately we launched the Product Playground, a worry started to circle our minds; with this tool, our design job will disappear? This is a valid question due to the significant hysteria in the design community since AI has become a permanent presence. My answer to that is no; there are still many things a designer can do that no one else can. The issue until now is that we have allowed companies to pigeonhole our work as only an interface exercise, and I believe it is more than that.</p><p>At the end of the day, if someone is creating stuff in a Playground, it is the designer who decides if such an invention is easy to use, coherent with user needs, and meets other relevant criteria.</p><p>Along with this “new concept” that only applies to design teams, there is another one with a broader scale that we are adopting, and I’d like to share: <strong>functional design</strong>. This concept refers to the Playground outcome, where ideas are essentially functional and ready to implement. We’ve abandoned static design and limited prototypes for rich interactions and complete flows that can be made in minutes.</p><p>When we talk about design now, we can see things working in a real environment and have more effective conversations with users and stakeholders. The sense of reality is a plus we haven’t had before.</p><p>Another topic we have been navigating and evangelizing within the design team is embracing “designs” from others, especially from those who are not designers. To clarify, the Product Playground is not open to everyone in the company, but only to people in the tech department <em>(PMs, sales, data, engineers, QA, etc). </em>The message is simple on this concern: What was once an insult to us as designers is now real collaboration. We can exchange design and experiences, and also teach them how to do it in the process.</p><h4>The new company’s way of working.</h4><p>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives, especially with the Product Playground in the conversation. It may not be the right or only path to follow in the industry, but for us, it’s been quite a change.</p><p>The most compelling evidence we have to validate our hypothesis is time. Before all these concepts <em>(Acceleration stage, Product Playground, Infrastructure design, and functional design)</em>, building an idea went like this: Ideation → Model → Prototype → Engineering. The cycle was slow, expensive, and discouraged innovation, as typically only one idea was developed. Now, a process that used to take weeks only takes a few hours. Plus, we can test multiple versions of an interface quickly, preventing ideas from falling by the wayside.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=22f64e1bc59a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ai-concept-that-changed-our-companys-way-of-working-22f64e1bc59a"">The AI concept that changed our company’s way of working</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Gregory Bateson and the art of staying in conversation with yourself.</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of an elderly man with light hair swept back, wearing a plaid shirt over a collared shirt. He has a gentle, knowing smile and expressive wrinkles that convey warmth and intelligence. The background is softly blurred, keeping focus on his face and thoughtful expression."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k9P22tQEKIhurkG8V8E1CA.png"" /></figure><p>This week, someone asked me a question that deserves more than a quick answer:</p><blockquote><strong>How can a company get bigger without making the experience worse for the people who already trust it?</strong></blockquote><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 10. Today, we’re talking mergers and acquisitions.</em></p><p><strong>At first, it sounds like a design problem.</strong> Or maybe a customer service one. Add new markets, new systems, new customers, and suddenly the challenge is keeping what was working while trying to understand what the future needs to become.</p><p>But underneath, it’s a question about honesty. What if the kind of growth that stretches empathy and deepens awareness (the kind we expect from people) could guide how organizations grow too? The trouble is, and it’s what I was really being asked, companies don’t usually grow that way. The bigger they get, the more they drift toward dilution. Uniformity starts to look like fairness. A drive for efficiency starts to feel like understanding. And every merger, no matter how strategic, risks erasing the small, specific things that made people trust you in the first place.</p><p>Which brings us to Gregory Bateson, the British anthropologist who spent his life asking how living systems hold together when they grow, collide or change. He called it <a href=""https://batesoninstitute.org/gregory-bateson/""><em>the ecology of mind</em></a>. His insight was simple… aaand difficult:</p><p><strong>Systems survive by staying in conversation with themselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photograph of anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson working at a wooden table in their thatched-roof home near the Sepik River in New Guinea.

Trained as an anthropologist, he moved through biology, psychiatry, cybernetics and communication theory as if they were chapters in a single unfinished book. He studied tribes in New Guinea, mapped communication patterns in families with schizophrenia, and helped define the early vocabulary of systems theory.</p><p>What he was really searching for was what he called the ‘pattern that connects’. Every living system, he argued, survives by registering difference — the small shifts that signal when something in the environment has changed. To Bateson, information was a relationship that needed to be maintained. It wasn’t something you could create and store away.</p><p>He saw life as a constant negotiation between something you are aware of and something you let drift. The moment a system stops sensing its surroundings, it begins to lose the capacity to learn. And what we often call stability is just the early phase of decline. In other words, if you aren’t working toward something, you’re automatically moving away from it.</p><p>That was the core of his thinking. He replaced the language of control with the language of relationship. A forest, an organization, even a mind. Each stays ‘alive’ by keeping the conversation open between its parts.</p><h3>When the conversation breaks</h3><p>Bateson’s ideas make mergers look less like transactions and more like ecological events. Two systems collide, each with its own rhythms, feedback loops and internal grammar. At first, both listen politely. Then they start talking over each other.</p><p>Signals that once made sense begin to distort. Teams over-interpret silence. Customers catch tonal shifts before any official announcement. That doesn’t mean the system is collapsing. What it means is that it’s losing its sense of self.</p><p>Bateson would’ve seen that as a feedback failure, not a leadership flaw. When new information enters a system and the interpretive loops are weak, the signal mutates (it doesn’t go away). Meaning goes looking for somewhere else to live.</p><p><strong>That’s the unseen cost of getting bigger.</strong> Growth multiplies ways to do things faster than it multiplies ways to understand things. And the louder a system gets, the easier it is to confuse agreement with coherence.</p><p>You’re probably thinking what I’m thinking: Every organization faces this… not just in mergers, but technology adoption, strategy, and research.</p><p>We build tools to listen faster, but not always to listen better. Bateson would call that <a href=""https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-gregory-bateson-matters-a8d"">ecological deafness:</a> a feedback loop optimized for speed instead of reflection.</p><h3>Learning from differences</h3><p>Bateson believed that systems stay healthy by adjusting to the relationships between things. Every change, no matter how small, reshapes the conditions for what comes next. As a system receives information, the key isn’t how much it hears, but whether the hearing leads to reflection.</p><p>AI makes that harder. It expands what an organization can sense, but not what it understands. Algorithms pull in more signal, faster… but they don’t know what matters. And often, neither do we.</p><p>We’ve trained ourselves to think that hearing more means knowing more. But without a loop that turns signal into learning, it’s just a whole lot of noise.</p><p>Bateson’s answer would be:<br />- Humility. <br />- Keep the conversation open. <br />- Build systems that reflect before they respond.</p><h3>Staying in conversation with yourself</h3><p>It’s not that organizations fail because they stop collecting feedback. It’s more that they learn how to ignore it.</p><p>Even with dashboards, surveys, sentiment trackers… it’s easy to bend the story in whatever direction feels most comfortable.</p><p>A forest doesn’t get to do that. It doesn’t negotiate with fire, or spin a drought into a branding opportunity. It just responds.</p><p>Bateson’s point was that healthy systems don’t control the narrative.<br /><strong>They stay in conversation with it.</strong></p><p>If you want to grow without losing what made you trustworthy, build that kind of system.</p><p>Then let it tell you the truth. Even when you’d rather not hear it.</p><p><strong>The work is ahead.</strong><br />And Bateson shows us the way.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=631d44184013"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ecology-of-a-merger-631d44184013"">The ecology of a merger</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
