<h4><strong>Three stories of tools that refused to sell out</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dPHcRZF2WJZWuHz_Yc-ERw.png"" /><figcaption>Middle finger coming out of a phone at a big bag of money</figcaption></figure><p>Lately I’ve been writing critically about the current state of tech. So much of it feels infested with ads, deceptive design patterns or erosions of privacy all engineered to squeeze every last drop of engagement out of our already overstimulated grey matter. So as a contrast, I thought it’d be worth remembering that not all technology follows this trajectory.</p><p>At this point, many of us have grown so accustomed to terrible treatment from our tech providers that we mistake it for the natural order of things. I wrote an article last week about <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-evolution-of-youtube-how-every-platform-evolves-into-an-ad-machine-9e6032ff2d20"">YouTube’s slow shift from serving users to serving advertisers</a>, and someone commented: “Sadly, as long as the internet is largely ‘free,’ then there will always be ads. Always 🫠🫠🫠.” And while I get the feeling. Sometimes it really feels like we’re like travellers stuck in an airport terminal, forced to accept whatever fate awaits us, because there’s nowhere else to go. But there are more examples than you’d think of technology that has stayed open, portable, and most importantly put people over profit!</p><p>I’ll be sharing the stories of three of my favourites: Blender, OBS, and Penpot. One uniting thread across all these apps is these tools were built out of necessity, born from frustration, and carried forward by creators who wanted something better for <strong>themselves</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>others</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Blender render with logo overtop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RDRKc_1TAwV2H_tsT5buQQ.png"" /><figcaption>Blender render with logo overtop</figcaption></figure><p>Blender, for those who don’t know, is an open-source 3D modeling and animation tool currently sitting near the tipy top of its category. It’s used by world-class VFX studios all over the world and, as of 2020, had over <a href=""https://www.blender.org/news/blender-by-the-numbers-2020/"">14 million downloads</a>, a number that continues to grow year over year. It’s an incredibly successful project and believe it or not you don’t have to pay the low-price of $12.99 a month to get a subscription to it. There’s no hidden upsell, no temporary trial access, no marketing funnel to trap you in. It is free, fully open source, and wickedly powerful.</p><p><a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/history/"">Blender was originally created in the early ’90s</a> inside a Dutch animation studio called NeoGeo. It began as an internal tool, something practical that made life easier for the artists who worked there. After the studio went belly up, Blender’s creator, Ton Roosendaal, tried to keep the project alive through a startup called Not a Number (NaN). He roped in some investors, made a splash, and then the dot-com bubble popped and evaporated the funding and stopped Blender in its tracks.</p><p>The tool was effectively locked away: trapped in the hands of investors, sitting unnoticed in a folder full of failed acquisitions gathering dust in some corporate archive alongside other abandoned experiments. That very well could’ve been the end of the story, but its creator Ton had seen the impact the tool had on the community. He knew what it meant for artists to have access to something this capable without needing to pay. So he did something wild at the time, he launched a campaign to buy Blender back from corporate limbo. Remember, this is pre kickstarter, grassroots tech funding movements weren’t all the rage. He needed 100,000 euros to reclaim the rights and release it from corporate exile.</p><p>Armed with a mailing list and a landing page he mobilized the community. Artists, hobbyists, students, tinkerers all threw a coin in the hat and in just seven weeks, he raised the entire amount. A regular ol’ Bernie-Sanders-style grassroots fundraiser. Blender was released as fully open-source software under the GNU license, and the <a href=""https://www.blender.org/about/foundation/"">Blender Foundation</a> was born, a nonprofit stewarding a public tool.</p><p>Today, Blender is funded through a donation-driven development fund supported by companies<a href=""https://fund.blender.org/""> like Ubisoft, Meta, NVIDIA</a>, and thousands of individuals who believe in its mission. It remains one of the clearest examples we have of community-driven, people first software.</p><p>Another thing I found, across all these stories is that somewhere at the centre, there’s usually a quietly stubborn technical weirdo holding the line, resisting the gravitational pull of the cash-out. That’s certainly the case with OBS. For those who aren’t familiar, OBS is best-in-class when it comes to live-streaming. If you’ve ever watched a livestream, you’ve almost certainly seen OBS in action. And the “lowly technical saint” who built it goes by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio"">Hugh “Jim” Bailey</a>. His aim wasn’t to create the most widely used tool for streamers, it was to try and build something better for himself so he could stream <em>StarCraft II</em>… That’s it. Just a programmer trying to share a game he loved.</p><figure><img alt=""OBS interface and logo"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HcW7fzPPxfYS1sSP"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://www.downloadsource.net/how-to-reset-the-obs-interface-reset-the-obs-ui/n/23048/"">OBS interface and logo</a></figcaption></figure><p>But that’s what matters, oftentimes we forget that the DNA of the people who build these tools infuses into the technology. There’s a weird Frankenstein effect when it comes to technology. In my opinion, understanding who stitched the monster together often helps you understand how a tool ends up the way it does. I find that this is perfectly illustrated by Spotify. It presents itself as a music company, but its founders <a href=""https://soundiiz.com/blog/who-are-daniel-ek-and-martin-lorentzon-spotifys-founders/""><strong>Daniel Ek</strong>, who sold his ad-tech company <strong>Advertigo</strong> to TradeDoubler, and <strong>Martin Lorentzon</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>TradeDoubler</strong>,</a> one of Europe’s largest online advertising networks. They were not record crate-diggers or historians of music. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnXwkh2Vg54"">They were ad-tech entrepreneurs looking for a scalable payload for programmatic advertising</a>, and music simply happened to be the cheapest, most convenient content vehicle. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify is what you get when you pour ad-tech DNA into a music platform.</a></p><p><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">When Jim Bailey released OBS, he spent the first three years answering every forum post, every bug report, every direct message</a>. He was in the trenches with the people using his tool. He saw the struggles of beginners. He saw the streamers who depended on OBS to earn an income or build a community. And because he was so close to the people using the software, he never once saw them as assets. He saw them as peers.</p><p>So when OBS exploded in popularity and Jim started receiving acquisition offers in the <strong>seven-figure range</strong>, he didn’t acquiesce. He thought about what it means to hand his <strong>peers</strong>, millions of them, to people who probably didn’t care about them the way he did. Jim is not a public figure, so finding quotes from him is rare, but in a podcast he did with <a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">Pete Wilkins on the <em>Gaming Careers</em> show</a>, he put it plainly in two quotes that I love:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“They don’t necessarily want your program — they want the users. And it’s hard to put a price on your users like that.”</a></blockquote><p>and the succinct, but dripping with his ethos:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://gamingcareers.com/podcasts/creating-obs-interview-with-jim/"">“I don’t need a yacht.”</a></blockquote><p>This was clearly not a financially “smart” move. Today, OBS is maintained by a tiny core team and a smattering of volunteer contributors. OBS remained open not because it was easy, but because its creator refused to sell the people who depended on it.</p><p>The last example I want to touch should be near and dear to the heart of every product designer. <a href=""https://penpot.app/"">Penpot</a>! Penpot was created by a company called Kaleidos, a decade-old studio that originally operated as a kind of elite technical/research partner for hire. Their full name <em>Kaleidos Open Source</em> reflected a very real internal philosophy: they only used open-source tools, they built for their clients using open-source tools, and they carved out protected time to create their own open software.</p><figure><img alt=""Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*UIB6QyIvTW2q5snR.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.penpot.app/t/its-time-for-penpot-to-almost-move-away-from-the-dom/6437"">Penpot logo surrounded by UI graphics</a></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Kaleidos was a developer-centric team. They outsourced most of the design work, and that worked fine, until one day they had to hire their first internal designers. That’s when their philosophy came face to face with reality. While developers frolic in an open-source oasis, designers were stuck with a collection of janky, slow, unpolished tools that barely, and I mean <strong>barely</strong> met professional standards. The truth was the design team simply didn’t have open-source equivalents of the quality that developers took for granted. So while the designers loved the ethos, the tools just weren’t good enough and they needed Figma. So Kaleidos conceded. They broke their own rule. But they broke it with a single condition:</p><blockquote><a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">“We’ll use Figma… but while we use it, we’ll build the Figma killer.” Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz</a>, founder of Penpot &amp; Kaleidos</blockquote><p>And that is how <a href=""https://possiblefutures.tech/posts/interview-with-penpot-ceo-pablo-ruiz-muzquiz-on-open-source-design-and-ethical-funding"">Penpot was born</a>! Early versions were rough, but Penpot has come a long way in just a few years. And since its release in February of 2021, Kaleidos fully committed to just working on their own tools and shut down their client-services business entirely!</p><p>They call themselves the Figma Killer because they’re an ambition team. Though maybe not the ambition we think of when we picture ambitious people. Not the Machiavellian business man dressed to the nines, stepping out of some expensive sports car working their way up a corporate ladder to give an inspiring talk at some conference full of suits. This is a different ambition, a moral ambition, which drives companies like Kaleidos to build products that put the power of tools into people’s hands. It’s hard to imagine being in a position of building a tool that you put blood sweat and tears into and not wanting the greatest remuneration possible, but the reason that all three of these founders are able to do it is because their ambition isn’t monetary, it’s about <strong>impact</strong>. They want people to feel like they have autonomy and are empowered.</p><p>When you step back from these stories: Blender, OBS, Penpot all show a pattern. They didn’t become popular because of market positioning or manipulative growth and monetization strategies. They became what they are because the people behind them had values that were strong enough to resist selling out their users.</p><p>Each of these tools carries the fingerprint of its creator’s worldview. Software is not neutral. It inherits the values of the people who make it. We treat platform decay as inevitable. But I think that inevitability story favours the people making the choice of profit over people.</p><p>And that’s why these three examples matter so much. They remind us that it is still possible, even now, even in this tech climate to build software rooted in generosity, openness, and respect. To build tools that don’t treat users like resources to mine and exist because someone cared more about enabling others rather than maximizing returns. We need more of that kind of ambition.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3985d97f3b23"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-software-has-integrity-3985d97f3b23"">When software has integrity</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Great ideas arrive on their own time. The design stroll is an easy framework for capturing them when they do.</h4><figure><img alt=""Two cartoon diamonds walking down a street holding hands"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GSQ6tkvnHslyZNmIzCGbSQ.png"" /><figcaption>Illustration by Liam Oscar Thurston</figcaption></figure><p>Through all the changes I’ve seen in design throughout my career, there has been one constant: Everyone always wants you to go faster. To (maybe) quote Benjamin Franklin, “time is money”. A lot of designers are happy to trot out the old “<a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/the-big-lie-of-good-fast-cheap-fb8905818250"">Good/Fast/Cheap: Choose 2</a>” diagram, bitterly complaining that no one ultimately picks “good” among the options. But failing to keep up is an existential threat. If you can’t design in time, then it’ll be an engineer, or a VP, or an AI agent that will.</p><figure><img alt=""A Venn diagram showing the overlap between good, fast, and cheap"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*AzquVdt_kEV2er75dKFjwg.png"" /><figcaption>I made this diagram quickly and cheaply. As a result, it kind of sucks.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who reacts viscerally to bad design, I tend to lean a tad towards stubborn when it comes to quality. This means I spend altogether too much time thinking about ways to do design, at quality, quickly. It’s part of the reason <a href=""https://medium.com/loblaw-digital/designing-a-design-system-for-loblaw-digital-a-magical-mystery-tour-37d0b9764601"">I like design systems so much</a>. And I’m while I’m the first person to raise an eyebrow at the latest productivity/ creativity/ diet/ life-hack, I’ve come to recognize something about how I work, and how I assume others do too. I’ve found that my next great idea has rarely arrived on time, or on theme, or during set “creative” opportunities. Instead, they’ve come when I’m knee deep in the work, inside those fabled flow states people talk about where you can “see the matrix” or whatever.</p><p>Being in that state, and having the idea, only to just shrug it off seemed ultimately annoying, and it got me thinking about how it might be possible to pause for a moment, and actually chase that idea down. How would you capture it, and manage your commitments? What steps would you take? Taking a page from Albert Hofmann, I decided to experiment on myself, and ran my very own personal “design stroll”, a playbook for designers to switch gears when the metaphorical lightbulb switched on. In the wake of some success, and a real sense of motivation, I sought to formalize the process, and in doing so I learned about exactly why I found it to be so effective.</p><p>It’s occurred to me that inside of every company, there’s probably someone with a great idea, just sitting on it, for lack of time, motivation, or really anything else. They’re the people who understand the problem best, but maybe they’ve never had the chance (or the permission) to solve it.</p><p>So if you’re a leader, a designer, or a leader of designers, this is my gift to you. The <em>design stroll</em> is a way to catch those great ideas, when they come, still keep your teams going, and motivate your best minds to keep bringing their best to the table. No need to thank me. Just mail me a cheque for 10%.</p><h3>Born to… stroll?</h3><p>The design world already has its go-to go-fast technique, the <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint""><em>design sprint</em></a>. It’s a 5-day, all-in workshop that pulls the best ideas a team has, focuses on one good one, and works to produce an artefact that can be tested with users by the sprint’s end. When done right, design sprints are an effective way to solve or ideate around a big decision, or even a new product.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*idYxgMivtwIC48RV1n1BSw.png"" /><figcaption>The Design Sprint, from <a href=""https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint"">TheSprintBook.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Design sprints themselves are carefully designed, building on the principles set out by <a href=""https://designthinking.ideo.com/"">IDEO’s “Design Thinking” process</a>. Significant effort by the architects of the sprint went to mitigating specific drawbacks of open-room brainstorming. Namely, that collective workshops suffer from groupthink, bias consensus, and give preference to the ideas of the most senior person in the room (conspicuously it’s not shocking that leaders like doing them). So the design sprint carves out time for individual ideation, anonymizes voting up ideas, and attempts to put everyone on the same page at the start, something Knapp et al call a “beginner’s mindset”.</p><p>But good intentions often suffer from bad practices. In reality, teams aren’t truly afforded the entire time free from commitments, so people drop in and out, often leaving specific team members with the required expertise (designers and or engineers) to manifest and test the artefacts. Success in articulating and defending ideas still hinge on your communication skills, likability, and role in the organization, and since “beginners” lack the nuance inherent in the problems you’re solving, they tend to favour ambitious solutions that an expert would disregard based on a deeper understanding (this is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, where non-experts tend to rate their expertise as greater than the experts rank themselves, ie: you don’t know what you don’t know).</p><p>Did your sprint come up with an app that would do everything? That means you’ve failed. This was just a team building exercise. <strong>If the design process could operate this quickly, wouldn’t we just sprint all the time?</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A still from the simpsons episode featuring Homer inside the car he designed"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/495/1*J4Z5vva4aMCeFdyxLRRpbw.png"" /><figcaption>The outcome of too many design sprints looks like “the Homer” (Copyright FOX)</figcaption></figure><p>By contrast the d<em>esign stroll</em> (a play on design sprint, if that was not abundantly clear) goes all in on two things; <strong>individual effort</strong>, and <strong>expertise</strong>. A <em>design stroll</em> is conducted by a single expert, and realizes an idea or solution from a single perspective. No compromises. That idea gets a shot at being fully expressed before the weight of the group comes to bear. The designer/solver gets their chance at being an auteur. What’s your <em>Citizen Kane</em>?</p><h3>Stroll this way:</h3><p>You can break the whole process down into a few phases;</p><p>1 Business as usual<br />2. The Lightbulb Moment<br />3. Making it real|<br />4. Show n’ Tell</p><p><strong>Business as usual<br /></strong>Imagine that you’re a designer*, working on any given product, knocking things off a prioritized roadmap, doing your best to meld business needs with customer wants. You spend your days thinking about that product, and you understand it really well. Inevitably, (and maybe regrettably) you find that those thoughts aren’t confined to the 9–5. Your brain’s still working in the background when you’re on transit, grocery shopping, lying in bed at night.</p><p><strong>The Lightbulb Moment</strong><br />Pablo Picasso once said “Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working”. And so here, in the midst of your work, something will inevitably happen. You’ll have an idea. Maybe it’s a solution to a specific problem you’re facing, but it could also be an approach, enhancement, or even something that’s on the periphery of the work you do. It’s up to you to determine whether that idea’s worth pursuing. The best ideas for strolls are what you might call “inside the box” thinking. That doesn’t mean they’re boring, just that they’re constrained. It’s probably not the way to go about re-imagining fundamental value propositions, or blocking out the chapters for your first novel. The best strolls ideas are “what-if” moments that could actually happen.</p><p><strong>Making it Real<br /></strong>Instead of putting this idea into a Notes page you’ll only dig up when you’re trying to think of the name of that restaurant where you had that parmesan ice cream sandwich that one time, you’re going to want to prove out your idea. You might not even know fully how you’ll bring it to life just yet, or all the edge cases that might present themselves, but you won’t know until you try. Herein is the hardest part of the entire <em>design stroll</em>– taking the time needed to flesh out your idea. More on this later.</p><p>You shouldn’t attempt anything you can’t bring to life in a few days. Remember that you’re proving the concept, not shipping it. You’re also working from your lone perspective, the director of your own little film. That doesn’t mean you can’t engage a colleague who’s an ace at prototyping, or a copywriting superstar to help you deliver the best version.</p><p>Your output could be a prototype, a vibe-coded demo, or even a well-structured storyboard. You’re bringing your idea to life so that others can understand it, and that’s really all that’s important.</p><p><strong>Show n’ Tell</strong><br />By now you’ve created something that does the job of demonstrating the general sense of your idea. Now it’s time to get it out into the world. You’ll have to show people not only how it works, but what value it has. A design crit is a great place to start. If the signals are good, find ways to socialize this with your cross functional partners. Get some feedback. Maybe hold off on emailing it to the CEO. The point of the work you’ve done is to start a conversation.</p><p><em>*really you don’t have to be a designer to do this, just anyone deeply involved and invested in your work.</em></p><h3>The Man who Strolled the World</h3><p>If you’re skeptical, you’re paying attention. Not everyone has the luxury of just stopping their work to chase down an idea. Before you go anywhere, you need permission. Timing’s important. So is managing your workload. It’s important to communicate. A stroll conversation should work like this:</p><p><em>Hey ______, I’ve got a great idea to _________________. Can I spend a few days putting something together to show you what I mean? (Then explain the design stroll, or link them to this article.)</em></p><p>That’s essentially how I pitched my very first “stroll” to my design leader at the time. I’d had a revelation about how we might allow our customers to both perceive and obtain value across our e-commerce platforms. Normally this is an idea I’d just shelve and grumble about, but not this time. Across a span of about four days I put my head down, declined any meetings I could, and put together a demo. I didn’t do it alone. I reviewed it with a skilled visual designer, I conscripted another– a prototyping ace– to help me bring things up to a very narrow, polished expression of my solution. I worked through a few takes of a video walkthrough (one which was going perfectly until the fire alarm went off). I sent the video around to a few sympathetic peers, and then sent it up the chain.</p><figure><img alt=""Two screens from an ecommerce app that show how to complete deals in cart"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jSq9OfmieSDZeF9q1IOxuw.png"" /><figcaption>One of a number of screens I produced in my “value vision” stroll. (Copyright Loblaw)</figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, it’s not like the business hit the emergency stop and pivoted to action on my idea. Nor did I expect it to. What it did do was frame important conversations about value initiatives for the year ahead, and helped to illustrate some important ideas and considerations so folks across functions could align. A few quarters have passed, and pulling things from my initial stroll concepts into my work. Better yet, I’m seeing the work referenced by other folks in the organization to bring planning documents to life.</p><h3>Stroll Lotta Love</h3><p>There are a number of real reasons why I think the <em>design stroll</em> is an effective tool. To explore why, you need to know a little bit about how good ideas form.</p><p>It was Thomas Edison who supposedly said “great ideas originate in the muscles”. With 1093 US patents to his name, Edison isn’t some gilded-age Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. He means that good ideas come from doing, and not from passively being struck with inspiration. The mental image of someone deep in thought being struck by inspiration, doesn’t really happen. This is the <em>design stroll’</em>s environment, in the muscles, waist deep in doing. That’s where ideas are found.</p><p>In his not-subtly named book, <a href=""https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/where-good-ideas-come-from-763bb8957069""><em>Where good ideas come from</em></a>, Steven Johnson talks about the concept of the “long hunch”, where a vague idea about something slowly forms in someone’s mind over an extended period of time. Eventually through exposure to the problem itself, or the thoughts of others, those hunches combine into a great idea. For Johnson,</p><blockquote>“Sustaining the slow hunch is less a matter of perspiration than of cultivation. You give the hunch enough nourishment to keep it growing, and plant it in fertile soil, where its roots can make new connections. And then you give it time to bloom.”(78)</blockquote><p>Long hunches feed the <em>design stroll</em>. On the occasion when one hunch crashes into another and makes a good idea, it’s time for the <em>design stroll</em> to begin.</p><p>For Daniel Kahneman, author of <a href=""https://dn790002.ca.archive.org/0/items/DanielKahnemanThinkingFastAndSlow/Daniel%20Kahneman-Thinking%2C%20Fast%20and%20Slow%20%20.pdf""><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em></a>, there are two (metaphorical) systems of thinking. System 1, which is automatic and intuitive, and System 2, which is more effortful and logical. When it comes to ideation, the two systems interact, taking System 1’s creative “aha” moments and putting them into practice in practical ways with System 2. Kahneman also stresses that System 1 thinking often relies on bias, and that fundamentally humans aren’t very good at being right when it comes to intuitive guesses, because we’re so easily swayed by things around us. Fast thinking (System 1) makes it easy for someone to focus on the wrong thing, with Kahneman suggesting that “when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution”. (12)</p><p>Here’s where the stroll shines. A stroll lets you wait for the right time to take action. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve been presented with a problem, and without much thinking, answered it, only to have our response quickly put on the scrap heap. “Yeah. We tried that, and no.” That was your overconfident System 1 talking. The <em>design stroll</em> gives System 1 and 2 time to battle it out, and that means that the solution is much higher quality than the one you’d have if you’d been thrown onto a team during a hackathon, etc.</p><p>Even the creators of the sprint, Jake Knapp &amp; co. acknowledge the facts. In contemplating why (pre-sprint) brainstorming sessions weren’t working, they write:</p><blockquote>“Individuals were still thinking up ideas the same ways they always had– while sitting at their desks, or waiting at a coffee shop, or taking a shower. Those individual ideas were better.” (Sprint, 2)</blockquote><p>The stroll is centred around individual contribution, and it puts individual perspectives to the test before they get shot down. How many times have you had an idea that you just couldn’t communicate well enough to show folks the bigger picture? The stroll is laser-focused on cultivating these ideas so they aren’t lost, missed, or ignored.</p><h3>Stroll with it</h3><p>If you’re a design leader, or really anyone with any influence on process, you’d do well to carve out time for your experts to pounce on an idea when they have it. Someone on your team or in your organization probably has an amazing, well-thought out, money-making/saving, feasible idea that you haven’t heard about. Maybe because you haven’t asked. Make the time and space for ideas to be developed when they strike, and never let another good idea go unspoken again. Not every stroll will be the next big idea. <strong>Some might be small good ones.</strong></p><p>Implementing strolls in your practice is really about making space in two ways, granting permission, and providing a forum to socialize what gets produced. Designers need to know that they can take time to explore solutions that aren’t on a roadmap. They need trust in the use of the time, and their teams need to make space to enable them, or even assist them if they need it. A good idea no one sees is about as loud as a tree falling in the forest with no one around. It’s important to create forums for stroll ideas to be both heard and understood, by those who can facilitate bringing them to life.</p><p>In the absolute worst case, you’ve lost a few productive hours and energized your team creatively. Giving permission to ideate outside of the confines of work, and listening –if nothing else–provides motivation and a sense of meaning in one’s work (in case you haven’t heard, there’s a bit of a <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/a-crisis-of-meaning-in-ux-design-0831b85a3fb5"">crisis of meaning in design at the moment</a>). Better motivation, better satisfaction, better productivity. It’s a win-win-win. So If you want to find good ideas, find those who are in the work, and when solutions come, let them out for a stroll.</p><p><em>Thanks for reading.

<h4><strong>How to build empathy with users you struggle to understand</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""A lemon speaks to a snake that it is wound up in and the snake looks at the lemon, then looks away, creating a loop."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMlACuDGr6GAcynCT1JS5Q.gif"" /><figcaption>All illustrations and animations are originals by Blake Lemons.</figcaption></figure><p>The digital nomad who is designing an app for the atomic midwestern family. The non-gamer who is designing a videogame UI. The sighted person who is building a touch interface for the blind.</p><p>Empathy is foundational to product design. We talk about it constantly: cultivating it, mapping it, building with it. But what happens when empathy doesn’t come naturally? What do we do when we don’t relate to our users, when their behaviors feel foreign or even frustrating?</p><p>I ran into this problem recently while designing a fitness app. I was stuck until I remembered the first time I’d overcome it: writing dialogue for a cartoon snake, of all things.</p><h4><strong>The Snake in the Room</strong></h4><p>In 2012, I joined Nickelodeon’s new flagship show Sanjay and Craig as a storyboard director. It was a catch-all role: writing, storyboarding, shaping jokes and characters. The premise? A boy and his talking pet snake. The tone? Wild, absurd, full of bodily functions. If you watched kids’ TV back then, you might remember it.</p><p>As we started breaking episodes, I hit a wall. Craig Slithers, the talking snake, was one of the main characters <em>and I couldn’t write him</em>. I just didn’t understand who he was.</p><p>Craig was bold, brash, and loved the spotlight. I was second-guessing myself after a rough project before Nick, trying to quietly get back on my feet. He was all noise and confidence. I, though gregarious, was trying not to get noticed.</p><p>Still, I had to write for him. I needed to understand his mindset, his instincts, his voice.</p><p>I tried outlining his traits. Rereading scripts. Mapping his arc. None of it helped. He felt flat, fake.</p><p>Eventually, I gave myself one small challenge: <strong>find one thing I had in common with him.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A snake chases it‘s own tail, trying to reach just one connection."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h3Zok9vKHMsShEqCWMSHdg.gif"" /><figcaption>Though it can feel like this sometimes.</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>A Moment of Product Design Clarity in a Writers’ Room</strong></h4><p>I landed on this line in a script: “Craig was cool. Or, really, he wasn’t, but he believed he was cool.”</p><p>That clicked.</p><p>Not because it was funny. Because I’d been there.</p><p>At different points in my life, I’ve pretended to be cooler, more confident, more capable than I really felt. That little overlap, just a sliver (or slither) of shared emotion, was enough to get me started. Suddenly, I could write Craig. Not because I “got” him completely, but because I understood one emotional truth. From that truth, I could build. I had my “in”.</p><p>This “in” was my opportunity to immerse myself in the user and their needs like how <a href=""https://www.ideo.org/perspective/radical-immersion-for-extreme-empathy"">Julia Benini wrote in her article on IDEO</a>. The process I’d stumbled into is exactly what product designers do every day: observation, questioning assumptions, finding emotional truth, just with real people instead of cartoon ones.</p><h4><strong>Finding Your “In”</strong></h4><p>In UX design, we sometimes treat empathy like a light switch. Either it’s there or it’s not. But real empathy comes in layers. You don’t need to fully understand someone’s life to connect with them, maybe you just need to connect with one emotional truth. An “in”.</p><figure><img alt=""A series of colorful images of the word “in”. This is meant to represent the different ways you might find a connection with you user."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uBxHOH-63utQWxnositdUw.gif"" /></figure><p>That “in” usually comes from research: interviews, fieldwork, usability tests. But even with great data, it can be hard to relate. When users act in ways we don’t expect, we get frustrated. We think they’re confused, irrational, maybe just wrong.</p><p>But they’re not. They’re just not us.</p><p>Instead of asking, “Why are they doing that?” ask, “What truth might explain this?” I didn’t relate to Craig’s confidence. But I did relate to the desire behind it. That was the crack in the door I needed.</p><h4><strong>Staying Curious</strong></h4><p>When you don’t relate to a character or a user, it’s easy to reduce them to a stereotype. Early on, I thought Craig was just chaos. Loud, pushy, needy. But the more I asked questions (what’s he hiding? what’s he afraid of?), the more I started to see the human side underneath the gags. That shift changed how I wrote him. Suddenly he wasn’t just loud. He was trying to seem loud, to cover something up. That made him real.</p><p>Users can be the same. When someone skips onboarding or drops out halfway through a task, it’s tempting to write them off. But those behaviors often come from something relatable: fear, frustration, stress, distraction.</p><p>While designing a fitness app for finding nearby workouts (a freelance project that has yet to see the light of day), I hit my own empathy wall. As someone who prefers solo training and finds social fitness apps like Strava intrusive, I assumed our users would want a clean, private experience focused purely on location and workout type. I designed around that assumption by emphasizing map views and filtering options while intentionally avoiding any social features.</p><p>But user interviews told a completely different story. People didn’t just want to find nearby running trails or hiking spots, they wanted recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>One user told me -</p><figure><img alt=""An image of a word bubble that reads “I’d rather run a mediocre route that my friend loved than discover the perfect trail alone.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RKBKUcMoPjK2o2bOgm1xfQ.gif"" /></figure><p>There was my in. Instead of seeing social features as noise, they saw them as the most reliable filter for quality recommendations from people they trusted.</p><p>That feedback forced me to view my product from a different angle. Instead of building another map-based discovery tool, we pivoted to focus on trusted recommendations from your network. The core insight wasn’t about finding workouts nearby, it was about finding workouts that people like you had actually enjoyed. We redesigned the entire experience around a “recommended by people you know” social feed that surfaced workouts based on your connections’ activities and ratings.</p><p>Good product design comes from staying curious. Instead of fixing users, we ask what matters to them at the moment. We don’t design for quirks. We design for people. And when you find your “in” to empathize with those people, then you can find the best solution.</p><h4><strong>The Emotion(al) Moment</strong></h4><figure><img alt=""An animated illustration of a snake eating a lemon."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zP8NhzbtO-mmqhgkbrX4LQ.gif"" /></figure><p>In creative writing, “voice” isn’t just how a character talks. It’s how they see the world. That lens makes them feel real.</p><p>In product design, we tend to focus on goals and tasks. But great design also reflects how users feel in the very moment they engage with a product.</p><p>Did they miss their coffee? Are they exhausted from their newborn baby? What were they hoping for, and is the product delivering that?</p><p>Users don’t come to our products as blank slates. They bring their full emotional lives with them: stress, distraction, hope, exhaustion. When we find our “in” to that emotional reality, we can design for their actual headspace, not an idealized version of it.</p><p>Empathy should show up in every interaction, not just the text.</p><h4><strong>From Snake Scripts to Product Design Sprints</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/i-make-the-lemonade-3a8070ee9bbd"">As I have previously mentioned</a>, my past experience as a storyteller in animation has shaped some of my UX philosophy. Writing Craig taught me how to understand someone I didn’t instinctively relate to. It forced me to find connection through questions, observation, and emotion.</p><p>This process made the leap with me to product design and it’s what helped draw me into this new path. In animation, you’re constantly thinking about audience engagement: what makes them laugh, when they’ll lose interest, how to keep them watching. I realized that product design is essentially the same thing, but instead of just entertaining an audience and keeping their eyeballs on your product, you’re helping users accomplish real goals that matter to their daily lives and keeping them engaged. Both require understanding psychology and designing experiences that feel intuitive and satisfying, but product design offered something animation couldn’t: the opportunity to make people’s lives genuinely easier, not just more entertaining.</p><p>To accomplish this we don’t have to become our users. We just have to stay open. Curious. Patient. Willing to look past the surface. If we find that one emotional truth to relate to then we have our “In”.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ccf5c61c3f4e"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/empathize-like-they-are-a-cartoon-snake-ccf5c61c3f4e"">Empathizing with a cartoon snake</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h3>Ornament and culture</h3><h4>Interface as social signifier.</h4><figure><img alt=""An image of Loos’ Villa Müller, a stern but pleasing brutalist structure."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*q8mr2nGaRzDOf5x2BSnnjA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Villa Müller in Prague by Adolf Loos, 1928–30.. © Flickr User adamgut, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0</figcaption></figure><p><strong>In 1913</strong>, at the height of the <em>Art Nouveau</em> movement, Adolf Loos, an architect and theorist, was appalled and aghast. Everywhere he looked, ornamentation was spoiling his beloved Vienna.</p><p>Loos was a believer in the future. Inspired by his visit to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition"">Chicago World’s Fair</a>, he became a devotee of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan"">Sullivan</a> mandate of “form follows function”. In Loos’ eyes, the old world, with its dedication to complicated folk art adorning every surface, was dying. The industrial revolution, and the arrival of automated systems and management of humans, promised a new frontier. Gone was the old folkways of handcraft and guilds. Loos, like many intellectuals of his day, saw this as a pivotal evolutionary fulcrum for humans, and he was excited.</p><p>The world at the time was reeling, as the industrial revolution had thrown labor, economics, politics, and yes, even art and design, into a delirium. The value of what it meant to be a human was up for debate. What was the value of a human when these machines could do all the work? What was a craftsperson’s role when industrial factories could make well-designed chairs, shoes, posters at a scale heretofore unheard of?</p><p>Loos took it upon himself to publish a version of a talk he had been giving in salons for years, and he entitled the manifesto, “<a href=""https://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf""><em>Ornament and Crime</em></a>”. It remains one of the most famous nearly-political polemics on architecture and design in the last 100 years, and some credit it with being the foundational text for the <a href=""https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/the-bauhaus-1919-1933"">Bauhaus movement</a>.</p><p>In it, he takes square aim at the idea of ornamentation of <em>any</em> type. To bolster this, Loos presents two main arguments:</p><ol><li>Ornamentation takes too long for workers to make at scale, and gives no real value.</li><li>Ornamentation is strictly the domain of “degenerates”, and much like natural selection smooths a species to only its most essential shape, so too must design prioritize essential function alone.</li></ol><p>Loos takes very little time in the essay to turn his association with artful decoration into racist tropes. (<em>“Are we alone, the people of the nineteenth century, supposed to be unable to do what any Negro, all the races and periods before us have been able to do?”</em>) But putting aside the casual association Loos makes between evolution and eugenics, Loos really reveals himself in this passage:</p><blockquote>“Ornament does not heighten my joy in life or the joy in life of any cultivated person. If I want to eat a piece of gingerbread I choose one that is quite smooth and not a piece representing a heart or a baby or a rider, which is covered all over with ornaments. The man of the fifteenth century won’t understand me. But all modern people will.”</blockquote><p>It is 2025, and Loos’ ideas are again ascendant. If I have one overarching mission in these design essays, it’s to communicate that history doesn’t repeat exactly, but it gets pretty darn close. We cannot know the future, but using the past as a guidepost is usually a decent starting point for figuring out which way to go.</p><figure><img alt=""App store screens of two different apps: one on the right, very plain and minimlists.

Once again, technology has arrived which gives everyone pause. Once again, some welcome this as a utopia ascendant, and some are much less convinced. And just like that period roughly one hundred years ago, we are now struggling again with what it means to be a human in a world of new technology.</p><p>For some, like Loos, the winnowing and removal of ornament is the logical end point of a kind of post-humanist ideal. Into this thought space steps a style labeled digital <em>minimalism,</em> but I would call a kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism"">neo-futurism</a>, as at its base it is not about the removal of distraction, but actually about a removal of the human from the process. The design style is distinctly and <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/synctasks/id6575384261"">intentionally</a> <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pushr-push-up-workouts/id1587610077"">inhuman</a>, and like Loos, it finds unnecessary ornamentation to be appalling and gaudy. The elevation of AI in this design space is paramount, and why not? AI is trained on humans, but it is better, less messy (at least, that’s the promise). And you don’t need to be a statistician to notice who champions this style.</p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, an interface style is emerging that is a total rejection of this philosophy. Heavily influenced by the over-design of video games, it leans very strongly into ornamentation and hand-craft, a modern day <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement"">Arts &amp; Craft movement</a>. In these circles, the simulation of the hand-crafted is the ideal. <a href=""https://tru-tone.com/"">Textures</a>. <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Niki.Cute.Notes.App"">Hand drawn</a> effects and animation. An intentional overwhelm <a href=""https://partiful.com/"">of ornamentation</a>. All of which are microflags for humanity, crying out, “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Kawara"">I’m still here</a>!”. In these circles, AI is denigrated. It is an untrustworthy cash grab by duplicitous companies who don’t want to pay more.</p><p>That these two schools sit in co-ascendance is not a coincidence, I think. (<em>And I should hedge and say that I am not against “minimalism”, per se — there are </em><a href=""https://www.christophniemann.com/""><em>very human versions</em></a><em> of minimalism!</em>) Much like the fraught tension between the futurists and the practitioners of Art Nouveau, so too we see our own versions of these battles, but rather than in intellectual salons around Vienna, the battle is being fought in our pockets.</p><figure><img alt=""A rectangular brutalist concrete sculpture in the desert"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fKFgfK9ovgKXppzCmrXvuA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>One of Donald Judd’s Untitled series, 1980–1984, <em>Wikimedia Commons</em></figcaption></figure><p>There is also another deeper element at play, and one I am reluctant to address, as it seems nearly to rupture any shared understanding of what “design” actually is for. But I would be deeply remiss if I didn’t bring it up.</p><p>Designers like to imagine they’re the spiritual heirs of modernism — rational, progressive, moral. But that’s just a story we tell ourselves.</p><p>For as long as I have been in design, I have been told by my betters that design is not art. And at a surface level, this is correct. Every first-year design student is given Dieter Rams as the ur-designer. They are shown his designs as temples to purpose over appearance. His designs are function over form, with nothing unnecessary cluttering the object. But we mistake taking a position for unassailable truth. Rams’ designs were actually polemics. If you listen to Rams talk, his designs are not meant to be neutral, but meant to be taken as a statement. He believes we as a species are wasteful and foolish. His designs are meant to communicate a point of view. This is not neutral “design thinking”. It is Calvinism by any other name, posing as a calculator.</p><p>Whether we admit it to ourselves or not, design is having a conversation with the user, and having an opinion in that conversation. Much like hack comedians who retreat to the “It was just a joke!” line when called out, I think it’s time product designers stop hiding behind the neutrality qua “we’re just solving problems” stance that has been a fig leaf for far too long.</p><p>I would place any wager that most people spend more time touching and gazing at interfaces on their phones than their loved ones. As such, the items we touch and look at every day are heavy with a point of view of the interface creator. When we build things, we make thousands of micro-decisions, and while our best intentions may cry out for user input, this is not the way humans are built. Our biases, our feelings, our politics will move our hand, as sure as the wind carves a canyon, bit by bit.</p><figure><img alt=""A page from a survey of architecture gothic architecture elements.

Historians can argue the footnotes if they like, but Loos’ work, and the work of like-minded futurists, fertilized the philosophical soil that 1930s fascism took root in. When a design philosophy labels the distinctly human as “degenerate” or “primitive”, it subtly shifts the Overton window on the value of humans themselves. When we try to discard the hand-crafted, we throw out the hand itself.</p><p>We are sadly in a similar moment. The human is being degraded as unnecessary, a thing of the past. Just like one hundred years ago, there are powerful people in this world, with enormous sums of money, who believe this. You must think deeply as a designer, and have a conversation with yourself about what your designs are communicating. Designing in 2025 is making political statements about the future of humanity, whether you wish it were so, or not.</p><p>Design choices are political choices.

<h4>Developing product discovery judgment through psychological safety, collaboration, and systematic practices.</h4><figure><img alt=""Hero image depicting AI-human collaboration: teal circuit board patterns on the left representing AI technology merges with four coral hands reaching from the right representing human teamwork. A lightbulb with leaves and gear at center symbolizes technology and human judgment working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rdR9Hv4HENPwDvX4xZEhiA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>How do you develop the judgment to decide what software is worth building when AI makes building it faster and cheaper?</p><p>This article explores how to systematically strengthen discovery judgment, whether you’re building solo or as a team. For background on why judgment becomes the critical constraint when AI accelerates execution, see my previous article “<a href=""https://medium.com/@gale.robins/it-seems-anyone-can-build-software-now-how-do-you-build-the-right-software-182057dfa122"">When building software became easier with AI, deciding became harder.</a>”</p><p>The answer lies not in better tools or more time, but in three interconnected capabilities: psychological safety that permits genuine learning, cross-functional collaboration that surfaces diverse perspectives, and systematic frameworks that make assumptions explicit and testable. These are the human systems that transform discovery from a sequence of tasks into a continuous learning loop where reasoning itself improves with every cycle.</p><figure><img alt=""Venn diagram with three overlapping circles showing how teams develop discovery judgment through Psychological Safety (permits genuine learning), Cross-Functional Collaboration (surfaces diverse perspectives), and Systematic Frameworks (makes assumptions explicit). The center intersection labeled ‘Judgment Development: Compounds Over Time’ shows these three capabilities working together."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/842/1*wFJsuiR4rL7hYAhP9i4diQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Cross-functional teams, comprising product managers, engineers, designers, user researchers, and others, each bring unique perspectives to the discovery process. However, judgment only develops when these perspectives combine. The challenge isn’t getting better at your own function. It’s learning to reason together.</p><p>Solo founders and small teams face the same challenge from a different angle: you must develop these multiple perspectives within yourself. Product thinking, technical feasibility, design usability, business viability, you’re constantly reasoning across all these domains, continually switching contexts rapidly. The practices that help teams combine perspectives also help solo builders systematically develop multifaceted judgment.</p><blockquote>“Psychological safety isn’t about being nice — it’s about being real.”<br /> — Amy Edmondson, <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019)</blockquote><h3>The Human Side of Discovery</h3><p>Here’s the thing most organizations miss: judgment doesn’t develop through better frameworks. It develops through vulnerability.</p><p>When you admit “I was wrong about this assumption” without fear, when you kill ideas you love because evidence doesn’t support them, when you pivot after publicly committing to a direction — that’s when judgment grows.</p><p>Amy Edmondson’s research in <em>The Fearless Organization</em> (2019) shows that people learn faster when mistakes are treated as data, rather than a deficiency. Without this psychological safety, discovery becomes performative. Interviews occur, but inconvenient findings are often overlooked. Usability tests run, but only feedback that confirms gets heard. Teams cherry-pick evidence that confirms existing beliefs. Research on software teams confirms that psychological safety consistently ranks among the strongest predictors of team performance and innovation because it enables learning behaviours that improve judgment over time (Obasanjo, 2017). AI acceleration exacerbates this issue, amplifying bias rather than wisdom.</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison diagram contrasting Performative Discovery (ignoring inconvenient findings, cherry-picking evidence, hiding mistakes, unsafe environment) versus Genuine Discovery (examining evidence objectively, seeking disconfirming data, treating mistakes as learning). An arrow labeled ‘Psychological Safety Enables the Shift’ shows the transformation between the two approaches."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*3ayfvKhZ0XiAKoAHKYrHkw.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>I learned this the hard way. Early in my career, leading product teams, I created an environment where people said yes to my ideas, not because they were validated, but because challenging authority felt risky. A team member eventually told me privately, ‘We built that feature, but no one felt comfortable saying it didn’t solve the customer’s actual problem.’ I recognized that courage immediately; I’d been the junior person speaking truth to power myself. I took the feedback as a gift. That moment taught me that psychological safety isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s the foundation of sound judgment and decision-making.</p><p>The challenge runs deeper than individual courage. Even in organizations that espouse flat structures, power dynamics shape which voices get heard. When product managers treat discovery ownership as <em>exclusive</em> rather than <em>collaborative</em>, engineers and designers stay silent, assuming ‘that’s the PM’s job.’ Senior voices dominate while junior insights go unheard.</p><p>User researchers face a particular challenge: they’re trained in evidence rigour and bias detection, yet their insights often get filtered through PMs rather than informing decisions directly. When research findings contradict existing plans, psychological safety determines whether teams adjust their approach or rationalize it.</p><p>Real discovery requires cross-functional sense-making. A user researcher observes patterns in how users describe their workflow. A designer notices that users are misunderstanding the navigation flow. An engineer sees users accessing features through indirect paths. A customer success rep recalls multiple support tickets about this workflow. A product manager connects these signals to a strategic question about information architecture. None would have seen the complete picture on their own. This is collaborative judgment, different perspectives combining to form an understanding that no single function could achieve.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing cross-functional discovery with five roles (User Researcher, Designer, Engineer, Customer Success, Product Manager) contributing different observations that converge on a shared insight: Information Architecture needs investigation. Arrows point from each role toward the center, illustrating collaborative judgment that no single function could achieve alone."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QXW1HAAWn5yoSLX2WNtUEQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram created by author using Google Gemini AI text-to-image creator</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, something even more valuable happens. Engineers who participate in discovery with customer success start asking different questions about architecture. Designers who review analytics with engineers propose solutions aligned with observed behaviour patterns. Product managers who examine implementation complexity develop intuition for feasibility. You’re not just contributing expertise, you’re expanding your judgment by exposure to how others think.</p><h3>Expanding Beyond Your Lane</h3><h4>For Solo Founders and Small Teams</h4><p>You might think cross-functional judgment doesn’t apply to you; you’re already wearing all the hats. But that’s precisely the challenge: switching rapidly between perspectives (technical, business, user, design) without systematic practices leads to decision fatigue and blind spots.</p><p>Solo founders often skip discovery practices because “I don’t have time” or “I am the PM and the engineer and the designer.” AI accelerates building, which means you can build the wrong thing faster. Speed without judgment wastes resources at an accelerated pace. The systematic practices below help you develop multi-perspective judgment, compensating for working alone.</p><h4>For Larger Teams</h4><p>Cross-functional discovery can feel uncomfortable.</p><p>As a user researcher, why should you understand technical constraints? As an engineer, why should you sit in customer conversations? As a designer, why should you know about business viability? As a product manager, why is it necessary to understand research methodology?</p><p>Because AI is commoditizing siloed expertise, AI can generate code, create designs, draft requirements, and even synthesize interview transcripts.</p><p>What AI can’t replicate is integrating perspectives across functions to decide what’s worth building. That integration, that judgment, is what makes cross-functional teams valuable.</p><p>This doesn’t mean abandoning your core expertise. It means expanding your contribution beyond your functional lane.</p><p>Start small: Join one discovery conversation outside your usual domain. Ask questions. Listen to how others reason about problems. You’re not abandoning your lane, you’re learning to see the whole road.</p><blockquote>“We can’t let AI seduce us into believing it can do our thinking for us.”<br /> — Brené Brown, <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025)</blockquote><h3>AI as Collaborator, Not Replacement</h3><p>As Brené Brown discusses in her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/live/zdkKNC4gP1Y"">Fast Company interview</a> (38 minutes) and explores in <em>Strong Ground</em> (2025), many organizations are experiencing what she calls a “collective anxiety about AI”, chasing tools without confronting the human work: vulnerability, truth-telling, and courage.</p><p>This is the challenge of discovery in the AI era: not competing with machines, but building human capacities — deep connection, deep thinking, and deep collaboration.</p><p>So what does this mean for discovery practice?</p><p>After Jobs-to-Be-Done interviews, AI can analyze transcripts in minutes: clustering themes, identifying recurring language, spotting emotional intensity, and surfacing contradictions. It can generate comprehensive assumption maps covering desirability, viability, feasibility, usability, and ethics.</p><p>But AI doesn’t know what matters. It can identify patterns but can’t feel the weight of user frustration. It can cluster themes but can’t sense when an interview reveals something genuinely novel. Recent MIT research examining hundreds of human-AI collaborations found that while these partnerships often underperformed on decision-making tasks, they showed significant gains in content creation tasks, such as generating and synthesizing new content, where humans provide contextual judgment that AI cannot replicate (Vaccaro et al., 2024). AI can’t fully contextualize insights against organizational realities, unstated strategic priorities, the team member who’s burned out, the competitive shift that’s not yet reflected in the data, or a coming regulatory change. Most critically, you decide what’s “good enough” when evidence is sufficient to proceed, when to test further, and when to abandon a direction. These threshold judgments require wisdom that can’t be automated.</p><p>A team identifies opportunities based on customer research—AI analyses which align with strategic outcomes and flags contradictory signals. The team reviews: Does this prioritization make sense given our competitive position? Which patterns might be artifacts of the recruitment process? AI has accelerated analysis; humans make meaning from it. They select an opportunity, AI generates an assumption map, and humans evaluate which assumptions are riskiest, then design experiments to test them.</p><p>This continuous loop, where AI synthesizes and suggests, and humans interpret and decide, creates discoveries that are both faster and thoughtful. But this partnership works best when supported by systematic frameworks that make judgment visible and teachable.</p><figure><img alt=""Circular flow diagram showing 5-step AI-human collaboration loop: AI Synthesizes (analyzes patterns), Humans Interpret (determines meaning), AI Generates (creates options), Humans Evaluate (assesses context), Humans Decide (makes judgment call).

Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.</p><blockquote>“Frameworks matter not because they’re rigid processes, but because they create shared language for reasoning together.”</blockquote><p>The principle: your frameworks and tools should force specificity and enable evidence-based reasoning. Jobs-to-Be-Done, for instance, requires what practitioners describe as a fundamental “mindset change,” shifting the focus from product features to the underlying jobs customers are trying to accomplish (Gecis, 2021). Teams can’t hide behind “users want better collaboration.” They must specify: What job are users hiring our product to do? How do they measure progress? What alternatives exist, and why are those inadequate?</p><p>Tools like Opportunity Solution Trees help teams visualize the path from desired outcomes through opportunities to solutions, deliberately slowing teams down to explore the opportunity space rather than jumping immediately to solutions (Corbett, 2023). Similarly, Assumption Mapping forces teams to articulate what would need to be true for their approach to succeed across the dimensions of desirability, viability, and feasibility. Making assumptions explicit surfaces disagreements before they become expensive mistakes, a critical practice given that product teams typically find nine out of ten product assumptions prove false when tested (Podzorska, 2023). Evidence tracking ensures that insights don’t get lost and maintains lineage, clarifying which opportunities are supported by evidence versus speculation.</p><p>Solo founders benefit from these frameworks in different ways. Where teams use frameworks to create shared language, solo builders use them to make implicit thinking explicit — writing down assumptions forces you to examine your own reasoning. Documenting evidence trails helps you catch your own confirmation bias. These aren’t just team collaboration tools; they’re personal judgment development practices.</p><p>What matters isn’t which specific frameworks or tools you adopt, it’s ensuring your discovery process produces the insights and evidence required for sound judgment and decision-making.</p><h3>You Don’t Need Permission to Begin</h3><p>Change doesn’t have to wait for mandates or executive buy-in. It can start with just one person choosing to work differently. Informal leaders, individuals without formal authority, consistently spark real change through a shared vision, reciprocal relationships, and an emphasis on process.</p><p>When your work demonstrates more explicit reasoning and better outcomes, others notice, whether “others” refers to your team, investors, customers, or future collaborators. This isn’t passive “leading by example”, it’s intentional demonstration. Become the person who consistently asks the right questions, who can articulate why a direction is worth pursuing with evidence rather than conviction. As Brené Brown observes, “Courage is contagious.” When you make your reasoning visible, admit when you’re wrong, and kill your own ideas based on evidence, that vulnerability invites others to do the same.</p><p>Here’s why starting now matters: as AI speeds execution up and lowers costs, judgment becomes exponentially more valuable. The talent market is segmenting professionals who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus professionals who use AI to amplify their judgment, competing on wisdom and strategic value. The latter group becomes increasingly valuable precisely because judgment can’t be automated.</p><p>Speed without judgment isn’t progress, it’s expensive failure at scale. When anyone can build anything, competitive advantage shifts to building the right things. The teams that thrive will be those who learn the fastest, make decisions with clarity, and discover unmet needs before their competitors do.</p><p>You can wait for your organization to recognize this shift, or you can start building this capability now, positioning yourself among the judgment-oriented professionals who will thrive in the AI era.</p><p>Start with one small practice:</p><p><strong>If you’re building solo:</strong></p><ul><li>Document assumptions before building — create a simple “What must be true for this to work?” list.</li><li>After customer conversations, capture what surprised you about your own thinking, not just about customers.</li><li>When you pivot, document why — your future self needs to understand your reasoning.</li><li>Use AI to question your thinking: “Here’s what I learned, what am I missing?” However, remember that AI provides pattern-based analysis, while you provide meaning-based judgment.</li></ul><p><strong>If you’re working in a team:</strong></p><ul><li>Document your assumptions before your next sprint, just for yourself, in a simple document.</li><li>In retrospectives, add one question: “What surprised us about our own thinking?”</li><li>Share your reasoning when someone asks why you made a decision, including what you were uncertain about.</li><li>Invite one person from a different function to your next discovery conversation.</li><li>When you pivot based on evidence, quantify what you learned: “This assumption-mapping session revealed a critical usability flaw before we wrote code, which saved us two sprints.”</li></ul><p>Find allies. One person practising this alone is interesting. Three people practising together across functions is a movement.</p><p><strong>Which practice will you start with?</strong> Document assumptions? Add a reflection question to your retro? Invite someone from another function to your next discovery conversation? Drop a comment below.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Psychological safety and cross-functional collaboration are preconditions for the development of discovery judgment; without them, discovery becomes performative.</li><li>AI acts as a collaborator, accelerating synthesis while leaving meaning-making, interpretation, and final judgment to humans.</li><li>Frameworks and tools like Jobs-to-Be-Done and Assumption Mapping make implicit assumptions explicit and testable, creating a shared language for reasoning.</li><li>Individual practice scales into cultural change: one person modelling the required behaviour and validating assumptions can spark team-level learning and systemic improvement.</li><li>The talent market is segmenting: those who use AI to execute faster while thinking the same way, versus those who use AI to amplify their judgment and decision-making.</li></ul><h3>References</h3><p>Brown, B.

<h4>A great time to innovate democracy, while the technology is in place.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/812/1*Z60XLFCjRC8ahtlyGAydCw.png"" /><figcaption>Wireframe illustrating how comments could be rated for clarity, insight, and inclusiveness in real time</figcaption></figure><p>About twenty years ago, just after turning eighteen, I tried to follow politics because I cared about living in a fair society. I wanted everyone to have food, healthcare, safety, education — the basics any decent person wishes for others. But politics felt toxic: shouting, accusations, and no real progress. Even the word began to feel heavy.</p><p>I know I’m not alone; many people feel frustrated or disconnected. Yet politics should be noble — collaboration, empathy, coexistence.</p><p>So I’m writing this to explore how technology and digital design might help us rebuild that connection and make democracy feel human again.</p><h3>The bad side of politics and technology</h3><p>It’s almost impossible to separate politics from technology today. Every major shift in communication has reshaped how we organise, argue, and imagine our future. New tools always begin as freedom — more voices, more access, more possibility — but over time they start shaping us in ways we barely notice. Social media felt like a new democracy at first, until algorithms pushed us into <strong>echo chambers, doom scrolling </strong>and trained us to react instead of <strong>reflect</strong>. Technology can amplify <strong>empathy or anger</strong>, truth or distortion. It depends on <strong>how we design it.</strong> If we build tools that <strong>reward curiosity over conflict,</strong> politics could start to feel human again.</p><p><strong>Propaganda</strong> isn’t new, but technology has made it <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>precise</strong>, and far more <strong>personal</strong>. In the past, newspapers and radio spread broad, one-size-fits-all messages. Today, algorithms whisper tailored narratives to each of us. The Cambridge Analytica scandal highlighted how personal data can influence political persuasion, but similar patterns have also been observed in Europe. Ahead of the 2024 EU elections, researchers uncovered coordinated disinformation networks operating across France, Germany, and Italy, using fake accounts to quietly influence voter perception. This is the new propaganda: subtle, targeted, and often unnoticed — not designed to inform us, but to keep us engaged and predictable.</p><p>If we want more harmonious communities, we must rebuild <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>trust</strong>, and <strong>understanding</strong>. This isn’t just about better apps — it’s about better values. A healthy digital political system rests on a few core principles: a <strong>thirst for truth</strong> over partisanship; <strong>transparency by default</strong> in decisions and algorithms; <strong>effectiveness</strong> in solving real problems; <strong>equal access to voice</strong> regardless of power; and <strong>truth before speed</strong>, prioritising accuracy over virality. It also requires <strong>agility</strong>, allowing nuanced positions; <strong>holism</strong>, showing how issues connect; <strong>simplicity</strong>, making participation approachable; and <strong>decentralised ownership</strong> to prevent concentrated control. These values must guide the technology we design next.</p><h4>Designing a Political Platform That Supports Equilibrium</h4><p>A fictional glimpse of this future appears in <a href=""https://turnerstories.medium.com/the-democr-app-96895f45b680"">N. A. Turner’s short story <em>“The Democr App.”</em></a> In it, society runs on constant digital referendums, with citizens voting directly on everything from climate policy to economic reform. Turner captures the tension at the heart of radical digital democracy through one of his characters:</p><blockquote>Mouse87 still wondered if the majority could decide what is true and just for the entire nation. Could the people govern themselves? He believed they could. He had to. It was part of his design… to unite people, to let democracy shine in its truest form. But he made one mistake. Mouse87 wanted people to become equal, but no two persons are the same, let alone a whole nation.</blockquote><p>This fictional moment reveals a real-world challenge: if technology is going to serve democracy, it must be built for <strong>equilibrium, not engagement</strong> — helping people understand before they react, listen before they judge, and collaborate before they divide.</p><p>Imagine a platform where political discussion doesn’t lead to outrage or exhaustion, but to clarity. Instead of a chaotic feed, citizens move through a guided process that adds context, shows diverse perspectives, and explains how each decision touches real life. Every issue is presented holistically: the problem, public feelings, solutions, supporters, opposers, risks, and consequences. The platform wouldn’t punish disagreement; it would encourage <strong>informed disagreement</strong>.</p><p>The biggest risk to be addressed is that people are emotional thinkers. We rely on shortcuts, familiar ideas, and content that feels good. That makes building a political platform for understanding — not reaction — uniquely challenging. Echo chambers can quietly return. Misinformation spreads fast. Power can be centralised. People get overwhelmed or tune out. Privacy must be protected. Algorithms can inherit cultural bias. And cynicism can make citizens feel their participation doesn’t matter. These risks aren’t technical — they’re human. The goal isn’t perfection but <strong>transparency, safety, and adaptability</strong>, designing for how people actually think while gently helping them grow toward deeper, fairer public understanding.</p><figure><img alt=""Cleisthenes the founder of Athenian democracy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/1*KG9RVtDI285nG1Vwz8De-w.gif"" /><figcaption>Cleisthenes the founder of Athenian democracy (created with Sora)</figcaption></figure><h3>Proposal</h3><p>I propose to build a digital democratic platform designed for civic matters. A space where citizens explore issues through context, clarity, and diverse perspectives. The proposed solution is inspired by a collection of technologies and methodologies that already exist in the market.</p><h4>Modernising the democratic process</h4><p>Modern democracies could learn from how product teams build great systems: through continuous cycles of learning, testing, and improvement. In tech, decisions aren’t final — they’re iterated. After research, prototyping, and alignment, products launch, are monitored, refined, and improved again.</p><p>Our political systems rarely work this way. Voting is treated as the end of the process, not the beginning of a learning loop. Imagine instead a democratic cycle that mirrors product development: <strong>collect facts</strong>, <strong>collect people’s feelings</strong>, <strong>ideate</strong>, <strong>vote</strong>, <strong>enforce and monitor</strong>, then <strong>learn and iterate</strong>. Decisions would become living processes, shaped by data, experience, and citizen feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""Modern Democratic Process contains 5 steps that repeat in a loop"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vg8TQB8kmhEWPoHg3_Ifrg.png"" /><figcaption>Modern Democratic Process</figcaption></figure><p>This concept is not only mine to share; the minister of the digital affairs of Taiwan, Audrey Tang, explained with some major wins in his announcement.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/378431ed5045273f32d50ae23e346c34/href"">https://medium.com/media/378431ed5045273f32d50ae23e346c34/href</a><h4>Modernising democratic roles</h4><p>Modernising democracy also means modernising our <strong>roles</strong> within it.

Across the world, tools from deliberation to fact-checking show how technology can reduce bias, reveal context, and support healthier public dialogue. Below are the key inspirations:</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/287411905cf22ca0843b2f5dbdd50386/href"">https://medium.com/media/287411905cf22ca0843b2f5dbdd50386/href</a><h3>Platform Features</h3><h4>Civilian Contributions</h4><p>This is the heart of the platform — the <strong>civilian contributions</strong>, or what we usually call <em>posts</em>. Every user can contribute something meaningful: an idea, a problem, an opinion, a question, or even an opportunity for improvement. Contributions can be connected to existing topics or open entirely new ones.</p><p>But here, it’s not just <em>what</em> you say that matters — it’s <em>how</em> you say it.<br />The platform’s goal is to <strong>guide users toward expressing ideas in a fair, respectful, and inclusive way</strong>, helping people frame their thoughts with clarity and empathy. The tone should promote understanding, not hostility.</p><p>When creating a post, the system gently assists the user in identifying <strong>who might be affected</strong> — both positively and negatively — and what <strong>risks or consequences</strong> the idea might carry. This helps transform a simple complaint or reaction into a <strong>civic contribution</strong> — a statement grounded in awareness and responsibility.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Post:</strong><br /> <em>“It was about time for an accident. Our roads suck!”</em></li><li><strong>Guided Contribution:</strong><br /> <em>“After the accident last week on James Bond Street, I’ve noticed how poor visibility is around that area. I completely understand the need to illuminate archaeological monuments beautifully, but perhaps we can adjust the lighting design to make the road safer for drivers and pedestrians.”</em></li></ul><h4>Engaging With Contributions</h4><p>Once a post is shared, the conversation truly begins. Engagement on this platform isn’t about collecting likes — it’s about <strong>building knowledge together</strong>. Users can interact with a post by adding <strong>further research</strong>, <strong>supporting documents</strong>, <strong>related ideas</strong>, or <strong>personal experiences</strong> that enrich the discussion. Reactions are not noise; they are part of the learning process. Every contribution adds a layer of understanding to the original idea.</p><p>As discussions grow, the system detects when a post gains meaningful traction — not through volume, but through depth, balance, and constructive participation.</p><p>For example, imagine the earlier post about the <strong>James Bond Street accident</strong>. As others contribute — a local architect sharing a visibility report, a cyclist uploading a nighttime video, a city planner linking to safety regulations — the post evolves into a valuable public thread. The system may then elevate it to the top of the <strong>#Transportation</strong> section, where local authorities, journalists, or experts can see it easily.</p><p>Contributing to engagements becomes a <strong>path to collaboration</strong>, connecting citizens, experts, and decision-makers around the same living issue.</p><h4>Feedback, Evaluation, and Reporting Layer</h4><p>Every contribution can be evaluated by the community through a <strong>structured feedback model</strong>. Instead of quick reactions, users can mark a post as <em>helpful</em>, <em>insightful</em>, <em>unclear</em>, or <em>biased</em>. They can also add short notes explaining why — offering specific, respectful observations rather than emotional responses.</p><p>Take the example of the <strong>James Bond Street accident post</strong>. As the discussion grows, others might respond like this:</p><ul><li><em>“Helpful — this identifies a recurring safety issue and offers context.”</em></li><li><em>“Unclear — it’s not clear who manages street lighting in that zone; can you clarify?”</em></li><li><em>“Insightful — linking the lighting to archaeological site preservation adds an interesting angle.”</em></li></ul><p>This structured feedback system <strong>evaluates quality</strong>, not <strong>popularity</strong>. Thoughtful, diverse responses elevate a post; unclear ones prompt clarification or community notes. Citizens can <strong>flag</strong> <strong>misinformation</strong> or harm, triggering contextual reviews rather than punishment. Over time, this<strong> two-way process</strong> teaches users to communicate better and helps the platform highlight substance over outrage.</p><h4>Enhanced Community Notes</h4><p>Community Notes has proven that <strong>context builds trust</strong>. When users add explanations instead of blunt “misleading” labels, people are more likely to believe the correction and share less misinformation. A study <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/2/taae006/7644305"">published</a> by Oxford University Press found that contextual notes were <em>significantly more trusted</em> than standard misinformation flags.</p><p>A University of California, San Diego <a href=""https://today.ucsd.edu/story/community-notes-accuracy-study"">analysis</a> confirmed that Community Notes were <strong>highly accurate and credible</strong>, especially for vaccine-related posts. Similarly, research on <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00916"">arXiv reported </a>that when a note is attached to a misleading post, engagement drops sharply — reposts by ~45% and likes by ~43%.</p><p>Still, the model struggles with <strong>speed, diversity, and visibility</strong>.<br />Many viral posts never receive notes in time, and a <strong>small group of contributors</strong> writes the majority. This pattern was noted in a large-scale <a href=""https://ddia.org/"">data transparency report</a> and in follow-up analyses on Wikipedia.</p><p>Because the platform isn’t optimised for speed or emotional reactions, each post is first shared with a segment of users who have expertise in that topic. This allows knowledgeable contributors to add early context and Community Notes. If the post begins gaining traction, a <strong>community review mode</strong> activates, inviting a wider and more diverse group of users to contribute additional context before the content spreads further.</p><p>All notes appear directly within the post, with the system’s LLM providing clear, neutral summaries.</p><h4>Algorithm for Understanding</h4><p>Most digital platforms today are built around one metric — <em>engagement</em>. Their algorithms are designed to maximise <strong>emotion, outrage, and addictive scrolling</strong>, because the longer we stay online, the more ads we see, and the more profitable the system becomes.</p><p>Our platform must take the opposite path. Instead of optimising for emotion, it optimises for <strong>understanding</strong>. Instead of amplifying what divides, it surfaces what connects.</p><p>The algorithm’s purpose is to <strong>guide comprehension</strong>. It promotes content that helps people see the full picture, not just the side that fits their bias.</p><p><strong>Algorithm key principles:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Relevance First</strong><br /> Content is served to the people who can meaningfully enrich it: citizens directly affected, experts with relevant insight, and communities equipped to help. This creates deeper engagement, allowing posts to gather context, sources, impacts, and risks — rather than shallow reactions or fragments.</p><p><strong>2. Exposure to Multiple Viewpoints</strong><br /> The system deliberately broadens perspectives. It resurfaces skipped materials, introduces contrasting views, and reduces the blind spots that create echo chambers.</p><p><strong>3. Promote Thoughtful contributions</strong><br />Thoughtful contributions are highlighted above heated or repetitive ones, shifting the culture from reaction to reflection. This slows the rush toward instant opinions and encourages users to pause, explore context, and consider alternative viewpoints before responding.</p><h4>Join Discussion Rooms</h4><p>When a topic gains traction and enough information is gathered, it can evolve into a <strong>virtual discussion room</strong> — an open dialogue space where citizens, experts, and representatives come together to exchange ideas in real time.</p><p>Because these discussions are hosted within the platform, all previously gathered data helps <strong>structure the meeting</strong> through dedicated moderator tools. Insights generated during the session are then fed back into the platform, enriching the topic’s knowledge base and improving the ongoing civic process.</p><p>Each session is moderated by a <strong>certified facilitator</strong> from the platform’s community, whose role is to ensure inclusivity, respect, and focus. After the discussion ends, participants can rate the moderator’s fairness and clarity, creating a transparent feedback loop that strengthens future sessions.</p><h4>Open Source and Transparency</h4><p>At the foundation of this platform lies a commitment to <strong>transparency</strong>. Every major component — from the algorithm that ranks posts to the data that informs decisions — should be <strong>open source</strong> and publicly auditable. People must be able to see how information moves, how visibility is determined, and how their contributions are valued.</p><p>By keeping the code, funding sources, and moderation logic open, the platform earns trust through visibility, not promises. Just as citizens can participate in discussions, they can also participate in improving the system itself — submitting code, suggesting fixes, or analysing biases in real time.</p><p>Openness makes corruption harder and collaboration easier. It turns the system into a <strong>public good</strong>, owned and shaped by the very people it serves.</p><p>And importantly, as highlighted by the <a href=""https://medium.com/@lyakova7?source=post_page---post_author_info--06def9faf439---------------------------------------"">Association Redefine</a>, open source creates <strong>long-term resilience</strong>. Even if a project shuts down, communities can continue developing and maintaining the tools because the code belongs to everyone. Investments don’t vanish — they evolve into a living civic ecosystem that outlives any single platform</p><h3>Visualising Data for Clarity</h3><p>A civic platform can generate thousands of posts, threads, and interactions. To make this complexity understandable, we need simple, smart visualisations that reveal the shape of the conversation at a glance. These visuals help each person see where they stand, how the community thinks, and how decisions evolve.</p><p>We focus on <strong>five key visual tools</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>Profile Map</strong> —helps you understand <em>how</em> you participate in the civic space.</li><li><strong>Press Landscape</strong> — compares how different media sources frame the same issue.</li><li><strong>Community Landscape</strong> — clusters related discussions to reveal priorities and tensions.</li><li><strong>Debate Pathways</strong> — maps the flow of arguments from context to risks.</li><li><strong>Voting Impact Map</strong> — shows how different votes influence outcomes and each other.</li></ol><h4><strong>Profile Map</strong></h4><p>Inspired by the philosophy behind <strong>Readocracy</strong>, it doesn’t measure popularity; it measures <strong>depth, diversity, and quality</strong> of your engagement.</p><p>Your Profile Map reflects things like:</p><ul><li>the topics you explore</li><li>the perspectives you’ve engaged with</li><li>the clarity and helpfulness of your contributions</li><li>your willingness to consider alternative views</li></ul><p>Over time, the Profile Map becomes a visual record of your learning journey — showing how your understanding evolves and where your strengths or blind spots may lie</p><figure><img alt=""A dark dashboard showing “Profile Data” with sections on media bias, news ratio, mood, content tendencies, and professional interests.

Instead of a chaotic comment feed, opinions are grouped into clusters, making patterns visible at a glance.</p><p>You can instantly see:</p><ul><li>areas of broad consensus</li><li>viewpoints gaining traction</li><li>minority positions that add nuance</li><li>topics that need more voices or clarity</li></ul><figure><img alt=""A polling interface displays a statement about requiring passenger liability insurance for riders in private ride-share vehicles, with options to agree or disagree.

Instead of scrolling through emotional, unstructured comments, you follow a simple, logical flow: Context, Problem, Proposed Solution, Supporting Arguments, Counterarguments, Risks and Trade-offs</p><p>Each point branches visually, so you can explore an idea from multiple angles without getting lost. This structure helps users see <em>why</em> people disagree, where the strongest reasoning sits, and what blind spots remain.</p><figure><img alt=""A discussion interface shows a circular chart at the top with red and green segments indicating levels of disagreement and agreement on a statement about allowing 16-year-olds to vote.

Digital platforms have given millions of people a voice, but they have also enabled manipulation, polarisation, and propaganda at a scale that was once unimaginable. Elections, public opinion, and social movements are now influenced not just by policies and ideas, but by algorithms, recommendation feeds, and data-driven emotional triggers.</p><p>If democracy is to survive and evolve, it must adapt to this new reality. And to do that, we must ask a deeper question:</p><blockquote>What makes democracy strong in the first place?</blockquote><p>The answer is not just voting, nor simply participating. The answer is <strong>truth-seeking</strong>.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Democracy is only as strong as the willingness of people to go to the bottom of the “truth”.</em></strong></blockquote><p>If citizens don’t question assumptions, investigate claims, or look beyond the most entertaining narrative, democracy becomes vulnerable — not because people lack intelligence, but because <strong>human nature prefers comfort to complexity and there are not plenty of means to do so</strong>.</p><p>I am proposing a holistic platform that can support civilians to stay active, informed and respectful to their community.</p><p><strong>Thank you for reading!</strong><br />I’d love to connect and hear your views on how we can create the best possible experience for a platform like this.

<h4>In the quiet corners of our technological revolution, there is a crisis no one is naming. We are building systems designed to augment human capability whilst simultaneously dismantling the very expertise needed to govern them. This is not a story about job displacement. It is about a category of work we have not yet learnt to value.</h4><figure><img alt=""Circular diagram showing 7 Critical AI Roles: AI Decision Auditor, Multimodal Interaction Designer, AI Risk Steward, Responsible AI Implementation Strategist, AI Drift and Integrity Analyst, Transparency and Explainability Designer, and Human Accountability Architect, all centered around ‘Knowledge Positions’ emphasizing deep domain expertise and critical systems thinking"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tPZWLnosxOAj3797351SNQ.png"" /></figure><h3>The cake you cannot fix</h3><p>I often explain responsible AI development through baking. If you bake a cake with salt instead of sugar, you cannot fix it afterwards. You have to start over.</p><p>The metaphor lands because everyone understands <em>irreversibility</em>. Yet I keep meeting consulting firms and product teams, many in highly regulated sectors, who assume they can <em>retrofit</em> compliance later. Build fast, they say. Worry about transparency and accountability once the system works.</p><p><strong>They cannot.</strong></p><p>Most AI applications being developed today, especially those built on opaque foundation models with no visibility on data provenance, bias controls, or training processes, cannot be retrofitted to meet regulatory requirements. <a href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206"">The EU AI Act</a> does not allow you to add documentation, traceability, and human oversight as afterthoughts. These must be baked into the architecture from the beginning.</p><p>The salt is already in the mixture. Organisations are only just beginning to taste it.</p><h3>The crisis in plain sight</h3><p>Whilst headlines obsess over which jobs AI will <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07vmllz38jo"">eliminate</a>, something more consequential is happening. We are creating an entire ecosystem of AI systems with no one qualified to govern them: a recent study by <a href=""https://flur.ee/fluree-blog/for-ai-business-transformation-look-beyond-saas/"">Fluree</a> shows that the average enterprise runs an 367 (!) SaaS apps, most of which have AI integrated.</p><p>The issue isn’t that the technology is ungovernable, it’s that we’re not cultivating the expertise required to do the governing.</p><p>Think about what deploying a <a href=""https://www.euaiact.com/blog/high-risk-ai-systems-under-the-eu-ai-act"">high-risk AI</a> system actually requires. You need someone who can question whether the training data reflects reality or bias. Someone who can challenge whether the optimisation function aligns with human values. Someone who can monitor whether a model performing at 95% accuracy today has quietly degraded. Someone who can explain to a regulator, or an affected citizen, why the algorithm made the decision it did.</p><p>These are not technical problems. They are <em>judgement</em> problems.<br />And judgement cannot be automated.</p><p>Here is the paradox. AI has expertise without context. It can process patterns across vast datasets but cannot understand why or when that knowledge matters. It can identify correlations in historical hiring data but cannot tell you whether those correlations reflect meritocracy or structural discrimination. It can optimise for efficiency but cannot weigh the moral implications of sacrificing fairness to do so.</p><p>That gap between machine capability and human judgement is where the most important work of the next decade will happen.</p><h3>The roles we are not creating</h3><p>This crisis is not theoretical. It is already creating demand for a new category of roles. Roles that do not just manage AI, but ensure it serves human values.</p><p>Consider what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory"">Actor-Network Theory</a> has long taught us. AI systems are not neutral tools. They are embedded in networks of human actors, institutional power structures, regulatory frameworks, and social values. Governing AI is not just about managing algorithms. It is about navigating these complex, interconnected systems.</p><p>Seven distinct professional roles are emerging. Not technical positions requiring coding expertise. <em>Knowledge positions </em>requiring deep domain expertise, critical thinking, and systems thinking. The ability to see how changes in one part ripple through the whole.</p><p><strong>1. The AI Decision Auditor</strong> questions and validates AI before implementation. When a hiring algorithm rejects a candidate, someone must verify the logic was not simply reproducing historical discrimination. When a diagnostic tool recommends treatment, someone must ensure it did not hallucinate a correlation. The AI Act’s <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/14/"">Article 14</a> requires human oversight for high-risk systems, but human oversight without the expertise to question is theatre, not governance.</p><p><strong>2. The Human Accountability Architect</strong> designs processes that preserve human responsibility even as systems become more autonomous. As multi-agent AI proliferates, accountability becomes genuinely unclear. Someone must ensure that when things fail, and they will, there is an answer to the regulator’s inevitable question. Who is responsible?</p><p><strong>3. The Multimodal Interaction Designer</strong> orchestrates how multiple AI agents collaborate with human oversight. Modern systems are ecosystems of agents, interfaces, and decision points that must work coherently. <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/13/"">Article 13</a> requires transparency about how AI systems operate, but transparency means nothing if the experience is incomprehensible.</p><p><strong>4. The AI Risk Steward</strong> monitors systems for drift, degradation, and bias emergence. AI does not break loudly. It degrades quietly. Someone must watch for the silent erosion before damage compounds.</p><p><strong>5. The Responsible AI Implementation Strategist</strong> translates between technical teams, who build, and legal teams, who interpret, ensuring compliance is not theatre but embedded practice.</p><p><strong>6. The AI Drift and Integrity Analyst</strong> tracks model performance over time, identifying when systems produce unreliable results before regulatory audits discover the problem. <a href=""https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/72/"">Article </a>72’s post-market monitoring obligations assume someone is actually monitoring. Most organisations are not.</p><p><strong>7. The Transparency and Explainability Designer</strong> translates AI decision-making into understandable explanations. Technical accuracy means nothing if humans cannot comprehend it.</p><p>This roles are innovative in this form, but not new. For instance, most commercial aircraft have sophisticated autopilot systems. They can handle take-off, maintain altitude, navigate routes, even land in certain conditions. Yet no airline would dream of removing the pilots from the cockpit. No passenger would board a flight knowing there was no one able to take the controls.</p><p>Why? Because <em>automation</em> is not the same as <em>autonomy</em>. <br />Because systems fail in unexpected ways. Because edge cases require human judgement. Because someone must remain responsible.</p><p>AI systems are the same. These seven roles are the pilots in the cockpit. They do not fly the plane manually, but they remain essential. Monitoring, overriding when necessary, taking control when the automated systems encounter situations they were not designed to handle.</p><p>These roles all require human judgement to check, guide, and refine AI outputs. They cannot be performed by AI itself. That would be asking the algorithm to audit the algorithm.</p><h3>The illusion of competence</h3><p>But the crisis runs deeper than a lack of roles. It is also about the erosion of expertise, and the dangerous illusion that anyone can govern AI.</p><p>Consider the current enthusiasm for <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-vibe-coding"">vibe coding</a>. The idea that anyone can now build functional applications through natural language prompts, no programming knowledge required.</p><p>There is truth here. Barriers have lowered. But there is also a dangerous <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/vibe-coding-is-the-new-open-source/"">fallacy</a>. We are conflating the ability to generate code with the expertise to evaluate whether that code is <a href=""https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/vibe-coding-2025-risks/29613/"">fit</a> for purpose.</p><p>What happens when the AI <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-hallucinations"">hallucinates</a>? When it generates plausible-looking code with subtle security vulnerabilities? When it optimises for the wrong objective because the prompt was not precise enough?</p><p>The person with no coding expertise cannot spot these failures. They have outsourced not just the manual work of typing code, but the expertise required to recognise when the output is wrong.</p><p>We are creating a generation seduced by the illusion of capability without competence.</p><p>And what happens when the AI models disappear? Not because of some apocalyptic scenario, but simply because a service shuts down, a company pivots, a model becomes obsolete. If we have outsourced expertise to systems we do not understand, what knowledge remains?</p><p>Our <a href=""https://medium.com/swlh/when-deepware-meets-wetware-the-uncomfortable-truth-about-responsible-ai-245842121749"">wetware</a>, our brain, our lived experience, our ability to connect and contextualise knowledge, this is what makes us uniquely suited to ask the right questions for any given situation.</p><p>That cannot be delegated. It can only be cultivated.</p><h3>Two hundred and fifty files</h3><p>Now let me tell you something that should keep every AI executive awake at night.</p><p><a href=""https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison"">Recent research by Anthropic</a>, in partnership with the <a href=""https://www.aisi.gov.uk/"">UK AI Safety Institute</a> and the <a href=""https://www.turing.ac.uk/"">Alan Turing Institute</a>, revealed that just 250 malicious files can compromise even the largest language models. A fraction so small, roughly 0.00016% of the training data, that it is effectively a rounding error.</p><p>Models ranging from 600 million to 13 billion parameters, systems trained on datasets so vast they would take human lifetimes to read, can be poisoned by a rounding error’s worth of corrupted data.</p><p><a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/data-poisoning"">Data poisoning </a>works by injecting malicious inputs, often indistinguishable from legitimate data, into a model’s training set. These inputs create hidden vulnerabilities like backdoors or biased outputs that only activate under specific conditions. A model might perform perfectly during testing, only to produce harmful outputs when it encounters a particular trigger phrase in production. Because the poisoning is subtle and the training datasets are vast, it evades detection until it is too late. By the time you discover the problem, the corruption is already baked into the model’s weights.</p><p>The assumption that bigger model equals safer model has collapsed.</p><p>And <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566"">data poisoning</a> is already happening. Adversarial actors are already exploiting these <a href=""https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-data-poisoning"">weaknesses</a>. And most organisations deploying AI systems have no idea whether their training data has been compromised.</p><p>For every interface your design team polishes, for every user experience your product team optimises, there is an invisible substrate of risk embedded in the data that feeds your AI. You can make the chatbot delightful. You cannot make it trustworthy if the foundation is poisoned.</p><p>Training data hygiene matters far more than sheer computational scale. You can have billions of parameters and state-of-the-art architecture, but if 250 malicious documents made it into your training pipeline, you have built an expensive liability.</p><p>And here is what makes this discovery so devastating for the retrofit compliance later crowd. You cannot audit what you cannot see. You cannot fix what was baked into the model’s weights during training.</p><p>The salt is in the mixture. No amount of post-hoc filtering will extract it.</p><p>This is precisely why the seven roles I have outlined are not optional enhancements. They are the minimum viable governance for responsible deployment. The <em>AI Decision Auditor</em> who can question whether an unexpected output reflects genuine intelligence or a dormant trigger phrase. The <em>Human Accountability Architect</em> who ensures someone can be held responsible when a poisoned model makes harmful decisions. The <em>AI Risk Steward</em> who monitors for the subtle drift that signals data degradation.</p><p>Without these capabilities, you are deploying systems you cannot trust and defending against threats you cannot see.</p><p>Trust, in this context, is earned through design, not assumed by default.</p><h3>The investment we are not making</h3><p>Yet here is the reality. We are not investing in the next generation who will fill these custodial roles.</p><p>Organisations hesitate to hire junior staff because they expect roles to change. But that is precisely <em>why</em> we need them. What makes junior roles sustainable is not teaching people to use today’s tools. It is giving them solid theoretical and analytical grounding so they can adapt as tools evolve, challenge AI outputs with informed scepticism, and bring human judgement into the collaboration.</p><p>And universities? They are still teaching AI ethics as an elective, not a core competency. The ability to audit an algorithm for bias or design an accountability framework should be as fundamental as calculus for engineers, as essential as anatomy for doctors. Or we risk graduating a generation of builders with no guardians. <br />Instead, we are still producing graduates who can train neural networks but cannot explain why a model’s accuracy dropped, or what <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_(machine_learning)"">fair</a> even means in the context of algorithmic decision-making.</p><p>They certainly cannot identify the signs of data poisoning before it is too late.<br />Schools must treat AI governance as a core competency, not an afterthought. Courses should cover:</p><ul><li><strong>How to challenge algorithms, not just build them.</strong> Questioning the assumptions embedded in training data and optimisation functions. Understanding when correlation is not causation, when efficiency creates injustice, when accuracy masks harm.</li><li><strong>How to design accountability frameworks for sociotechnical systems.</strong> Grounded in both regulatory requirements like the AI Act and human-centred design principles.

Shaped by power, policy, and human judgement. Building AI without recognising this is not innovation. It is amnesia.</p><h3>What makes us irreplaceable</h3><p>Historically, physical labour gave way to intellectual work. Intellectual work is now giving way to oversight and accountability. We are becoming the moral anchors of a machine-operated world.</p><p>This pattern is not new. Every technological revolution creates categories of work that did not exist before. Not by eliminating human contribution, but by redefining what makes that contribution irreplaceable.</p><p>Consider <a href=""https://beyondthename.weebly.com/smith-mary.html"">Mary Smith,</a> the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocker-up"">knocker-upper</a> who woke factory workers each morning. The alarm clock eliminated her profession. But it did not eliminate the need for humans in the <em>morning economy</em>. It simply shifted where human judgement mattered.</p><p>AI is following the same path. <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be?source=user_profile_page---------0-------------811a71ad6a5b----------------------"">Machines make outputs. Humans must own outcomes.</a></p><p>That is not poetic language. It is the legal and ethical line the AI Act draws.</p><p>The question is not whether these roles will exist. They are already emerging, driven by regulatory pressure, operational necessity, and the simple reality that 250 poisoned files can compromise billions of parameters.</p><p>The question is whether we will invest in developing the expertise to fill them before systems fail, reputations collapse, or regulators intervene.</p><h3>The choice before us</h3><p>So here we stand, at the intersection of human intelligence and artificial systems, facing a choice that organisations have not yet recognised as urgent.</p><p>Build responsible AI from the ground up, or waste resources building systems that cannot comply with regulation and cannot be trusted with high-stakes decisions. Cultivate the next generation of AI custodians, or outsource our collective future to algorithms with no one qualified to question them.</p><p>The future of responsible AI is not technical. It is <strong><em>human</em></strong>.</p><p>It requires investing in roles that blend deep domain expertise with critical thinking. It requires recognising that governance is not overhead but foundation. It requires remembering what centuries of technological evolution have demonstrated. Machines amplify human choices. They do not render those choices irrelevant. They make them more consequential than ever.</p><p>True innovation requires more than computational power. It demands wisdom.</p><h3>Where to start?</h3><p>If you are leading an organisation deploying AI systems, ask yourself these questions.</p><ul><li>Who in your organisation can challenge an algorithm’s reasoning before it affects real people? Not describe how it works technically, but question whether it should work that way at all.</li><li>Who is responsible when your AI system degrades and no one notices until the damage compounds?</li><li>Who will explain to a regulator, or to a person denied credit, employment, or healthcare, why the algorithm made the decision it did?</li><li>Who can identify whether 250 malicious files have compromised your training data before you have deployed a billion-parameter liability into production?</li></ul><p>If you cannot answer these questions with names and capabilities, you do not have an AI strategy. You have an AI experiment unfolding in production with no one steering it.</p><p>The seven roles outlined here are not future speculation. The AI Act has made them mandatory for high-risk systems. Market reality is making them essential for competitive advantage. And the simple mathematical fact that 0.00016% contamination can compromise the largest models has made them existentially urgent.</p><p>The salt is in the mixture. The only question remaining is whether you will recognise it before you serve the cake, or after your customers taste it.</p><h3>The guardians we choose</h3><p>The future of AI is not just about what machines can do. It is about what humans must <strong>become</strong>. The custodians of context. The challengers of logic. The guardians of <em>outcomes</em>.</p><p>Every algorithm carries within it the echoes of human decision-making. Our challenge is not to fear these technologies, but to consciously shape their ethical foundations. To invest in the people capable of doing that shaping.</p><p>If your organisation is not creating these roles today, you are not just falling behind. You are building a ticking time bomb. Because when systems fail, and they will, no one will ask what the algorithm decided. They will ask <strong><em>who</em></strong> was responsible for letting it decide.</p><p>The question is not whether you can afford to create these positions.</p><p>It is whether you can afford not to.</p><p>Consider the alarm clock that replaced Mary Smith’s profession. Not just a technological replacement, but a metaphor for human <a href=""https://pat-bertini.medium.com/when-machines-make-outputs-humans-must-own-outcomes-a9293109b3be"">adaptability</a>. Each technological shift does not eliminate human potential. It reshapes it.</p><p>Our deepest innovations emerge not from machines, but from the human capacity to reimagine possibility.</p><p>The future of AI will not belong to the coders alone.<br />It will belong to the guardians we choose to train.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8c2664a452a3"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-salt-in-the-ai-cake-seven-emerging-jobs-no-one-is-preparing-for-8c2664a452a3"">The salt in the AI cake: seven emerging jobs no one is preparing for</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
