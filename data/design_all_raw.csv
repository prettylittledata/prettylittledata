On one hand, I see consistent research, data and opinions that most everyone despises chatbots. On the other hand, we’re experiencing an advent of conversational experiences that seem to be ballooning in presence and variation.</p><p>What perplexes me is that nearly every AI thing is interacted with via conversation of some kind. But while some versions of conversational experiences have been disparaged — <em>why are we so willing to accept and try out others? What’s happening right now psychologically where humans are both actively adopting and accepting certain conversational experiences and hating others at the same time?</em></p><p>So I began my journey down the research rabbit hole.</p><figure><img alt=""Marketing image of the Pet Rock product."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/610/1*Nol8M4iuTSU1lN1OZt5F1g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Creator: Al Freni | Credit: The LIFE Images Collection/Getty</figcaption></figure><h3>Willingness: The initial mindset</h3><p>The novelty of something <a href=""https://medium.com/@nickannora/why-people-love-ai-quite-literally-5cdb8e9804c8"">new is exciting for most folks</a> — I get that. And to be fair, Chatbots in their more traditional form have been with us for some time. My assumption here was that <em>traditional Chatbots have notoriously built up a bad reputation over time</em>. But, as with any assumption, I knew I needed to <strong>dig deeper</strong>. I started with attempting to investigate our <strong>willingness</strong>.</p><p>My research began to reveal that humans are generally willing to try AI experiences, and even more broadly — new technology — for a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101925"">combination of reasons</a>, including <strong>perceived usefulness, efficiency, enjoyment</strong>, and a natural human inclination to <strong>experiment with shiny new things</strong>.</p><p>To summarize, here are some of the key reasons and ideas I encountered as to why humans are more likely willing to try newer technologies, especially AI:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty and curiosity: </strong>Humans are often drawn to new technologies and the potential they hold for progress and improvement.</li><li><strong>Social influence: </strong>Observing others adopting and benefiting from AI can encourage further exploration and acceptance.</li><li><strong>Efficiency and automation: </strong>AI can automate mundane and repetitive tasks, freeing up human time and energy for more complex or enjoyable activities.</li><li><strong>Enhanced capabilities: </strong>AI can perform tasks that humans find difficult or time-consuming, such as processing large datasets, identifying complex patterns, and generating new content.</li><li><strong>Improved experiences: </strong>AI can personalize interactions, provide targeted recommendations, and offer convenient, 24/7 support in areas like customer service and digital assistance.</li></ul><p>The concept of <strong>Social influence</strong> makes total sense to me — humans have historically relied on <strong>word-of-mouth</strong> to inform their decision making processes. AI is no different — we’re currently bombarded with personal stories from colleagues, friends and family of how they’re using AI.</p><p>Thinking about additional key concepts, <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>automation</strong> are the big promises of AI. And also where some of the fears stem from — <em>imagine seeing your skillsets automated leaving you effectively redundant</em>.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*QglxnrKk0V_Kre9fFncncA.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot of the “summarize” feature now available within Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>Conceptually, both <strong>Enhanced Capabilities</strong> and <strong>Improved Experiences</strong> are showing up within existing software experiences more and more every day. Things like Google’s AI-enhanced search results or any of the “synthesis” capabilities being folded into nearly every product — <em>“help me write”</em> or <em>“summarize this”</em> types of patterns are quickly becoming commonplace.</p><p>What will be interesting across all of these is <strong>what sticks</strong>. I think many of us would agree we’re currently in a technological bubble. So out of these <strong>enhancements, improvements</strong> and <strong>novelties</strong> — <em>what will become consistently useful?</em></p><p>I believe surviving conversational experiences will continue to fall into either of the following categories. Some of these examples will be more like Latent Needs as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jmspool_driving-innovation-from-your-customers-activity-7363238346925481985-SQbB/"">Jared Spool</a> describes — akin to a heated steering wheel. In other words,</p><blockquote>“I didn’t know I needed this — but now that I have it…”</blockquote><p>Other example solutions will aim to solve existing problems facing human users. And the rest will become a casualty of the bubble as the <strong>novelty wears off</strong> and usefulness doesn’t persist.</p><p>At a high-level, it seems like it’s a suite of potential things that lead us to a place of willingness — <strong>the novelty of something new, the influence that both our peers and media have on us</strong> and of course — <strong>the promise of better</strong>.</p><h3>Acceptance</h3><p>I realize following a meandering path like this can be difficult — so I’ll try to keep us tethered. Remembering where I started at the beginning of this rabbit hole, I asked <em>why might we be willing to use an AI-driven conversational interface as compared to the classic Chatbots many of us distaste</em>. As I dug into the concept of willingness, I often encountered <strong>acceptance</strong> as a nearby, if not similar concept.</p><p>The primary distinction between acceptance and the previous one is that <strong>willingness is a short-term, initial mindset</strong>, while <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">acceptance</a> describes the <strong>sustained, actual use of a product over time</strong>, reflecting <strong>deeper integration</strong> and <strong>satisfaction</strong>. So now that I understand the promise of the new a bit better, <em>what about this sustained relationship?</em></p><blockquote><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587""><strong>Acceptance</strong></a> is primarily defined as the behavioral intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service.</blockquote><p>It is a critical factor for the successful adoption and uptake of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence. Low acceptance can lead to the <strong>disuse of resources, a surplus of unused devices</strong>, and a <strong>slowdown in technological innovation</strong>.</p><p>The research continued to portray how acceptance can be a conscious, personal choice, such as <strong>knowingly purchasing a device that contains AI</strong>, or it can also be an involuntary action, like <strong>unknowingly interacting with an AI chatbot</strong> that presents itself as a human customer service agent.</p><figure><img alt=""A swiss army style pocket knife — meant to highlight aspects of acceptance, such as perceived usefulness."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OMT3e9UHYHGDpiS0B1v_Jw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Photo by<a href=""https://unsplash.com/@vjgalaxy?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Alejandro Piñero Amerio</a> on<a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-and-silver-safety-pin-LHFuqK3KywE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash""> Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>key psychosocial factors </strong>that consistently predict a user’s acceptance of AI across various industries closely resembles willingness but with some variance towards perspective over time:</p><ul><li><strong>Perceived Usefulness / Performance Expectancy:</strong> This is the degree to which a person believes that using a particular technology will help them achieve their goals or be useful in their daily life. It is often the strongest positive predictor of the intention to use a new technology.</li><li><strong>Perceived Ease of Use / Effort Expectancy:</strong> This refers to a user’s perception of how effortless a technology would be to use. Its influence can be weaker than perceived usefulness, especially as users become more familiar with technology in general.</li><li><strong>Attitudes: </strong>A person’s attitude towards a technology is a frequently included variable that positively predicts their behavioral intention to use it.</li><li><strong>Trust:</strong> This is the subjective attitude that allows a person to make a vulnerable decision, believing that a technology will achieve a desired goal. You can really start to see some symbiosis here — <em>Trust in both the AI and its provider is a significant driving factor in acceptance</em>.</li><li><strong>Social Influence / Subjective Norms:</strong> This factor involves a person’s perception that significant others would approve or disapprove of their use of the technology. It is particularly relevant in industries with high levels of social contact.</li></ul><h4>Models for Assessing Acceptance</h4><p>To understand and measure acceptance, I came across several <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001587"">research-theoretical models</a>, and how they’ve been adapted specifically for contexts like AI.</p><ul><li><strong>Technology Acceptance Model</strong>: This is the most frequently used and flexible model for assessing technology acceptance. It posits that Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use are the primary drivers of a user’s intention to use a technology.</li><li><strong>Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology</strong>: This model integrates concepts from eight other theories, including TAM — Technology Acceptance Model. It suggests that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions predict behavioral intentions and usage.</li><li><strong>AI Device Use Acceptance model</strong>: A more recent model developed specifically for AI, the AIDUA model proposes that users appraise AI devices in stages based on factors like social influence, hedonic motivation (perceived pleasure), and anthropomorphism (human-like qualities).</li></ul><p>What I’ve found so far is that these psychological factors all seemingly overlap and interrelate. Willingness correlates to the novelty and promise of something new, while Acceptance speaks to how our expectations are met over time. I can start to see how these pieces fit together in perhaps a larger adoption journey.</p><blockquote>The perceived promise gets folks through the doors and consistent outcomes matching expectations keeps them coming back.</blockquote><p>Whew, here we are in the rabbit hole. I still feel like there’s more to understand about sustained use and what individual facets can help drive acceptance. <em>What is it that makes us hesitant instead of willing as the conversational space in software continues to evolve? What brings us back over and over again?</em></p><figure><img alt=""Modern depiction of Microsoft’s classic virtual assistant — Clippy"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pcYGzNmQglINPNRwxVgYBA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>image credit: Microsoft <a href=""https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/"">https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/aproveite-a-nostalgia-com-os-novos-planos-de-fundo-do-microsoft-teams/</a></figcaption></figure><p>My curiosity led me in <strong>deeper</strong>. My hypothesis at this point was taking shape around this intersection of <strong>humans and how or why they might trust software</strong>. I’ve personally become distrustful of classic Chatbots. If it even looks like the Chatbot of yesterday — seeing something like a Floating Action Button yielding a Clippy-like offering, promising to answer all my questions — <em>I’m immediately prepared to never touch it</em>.</p><h3>Trust… actually Search first</h3><p>Before I head into why and how trust is earned and eroded, I started by investigating perhaps the precursor of today’s conversational experience — <strong>Search.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""A retro screenshot of Google’s homepage from circa 1998"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/502/1*zYMJwuoUOXS0ROQg6-cODw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Google Beta homepage (1998) Source: <a href=""https://www.india.com/buzz/happy-birthday-google-7-things-unheard-about-search-engine-giant-as-it-greets-self-with-doodle-on-16th-anniversary-159143"">India.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>Traditional search experiences are of course now being woven together with AI intelligence. Outside of that, you can still see and sense the same disparity in appreciation of search experiences akin to classic Chatbots and modern Conversational Experiences. Some search experiences are highly utilized and accepted and others are not. Putting allegiances aside, I was curious about how existing with Search as a paradigm and evolving with it all these years <strong>could have potentially influenced us</strong> as we are redirected into more conversational interfaces.</p><p>Through observations with some early conversational interfaces I’ve been working on, I noted that <strong>users are still mostly beginning their conversation with succinctly few words, if not only one word</strong> — <em>why?</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.emerald.com/ajim/article-abstract/73/3/436/50198/The-effects-of-cognitive-load-on-query?redirectedFrom=fulltext"">Research</a> revealed that users may start their searches with one word primarily due to the initial cognitive load and the iterative nature of search. I’d include familiarity as well, since search has been taking shape beside us for years now.</p><p>Explanations include:</p><ul><li><strong>Reducing cognitive load: </strong>Starting with a single term requires little effort. Users can quickly generate results and then adapt their query based on what they see.</li><li><strong>Iterative process: </strong>Search is often exploratory. A single keyword acts as a starting point, giving users something to refine as they go.</li><li><strong>System familiarity: </strong>Decades of exposure to search engines have trained users to trust that even minimal input will trigger auto-suggestions or relevant results.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, while iterative searching does happen, only <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-user-behavior#only-15-of-google-users-modify-their-initial-search-term""><strong>15% of Google searches are refined or modified</strong></a>. This suggests to me that modern search engines are highly performant in that users often find satisfactory answers from their first attempt. Over time, this reliability has created a strong expectation that <em>“search just works,”</em> reinforcing user trust and shaping behavior.</p><blockquote>Subsequently, certain search experiences and approaches have evolved with us and adapted to us to become highly effective.</blockquote><p>In contrast — when currently working with an AI experience, users often <strong>feel as though they’re at fault for not achieving the outcome they’d hoped for</strong>. <em>“It’s my fault I can’t get this AI to do what I want!”</em> We should work to eliminate the returning concept of “User Error”.</p><p>This led me to some new questions:</p><ul><li><em>How does the trust that users have with traditional search transfer (or fail to transfer) to conversational AI?</em></li><li><em>What design patterns might we use to help conversational AI feel as reliable and effortless as traditional search?</em></li></ul><figure><img alt=""Human hand shaking a digital looking hand"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/958/1*nMkfMDMrNPMDzT2akbVo1A.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: Adobe Stock</figcaption></figure><h3>Back to Trust</h3><p>As seen with the evolution of Search — it took time to reach a point where users rely on the pattern, usually without question. I personally feel very confident currently that I can input very little into a Google Search and then with the predictive suggestions, presentation of results and likely summary-answers — <em>I’ll get what I’m looking for quickly and easily.</em></p><p>Unlike usability, which is <strong>immediately noticeable when something feels difficult or frustrating</strong>, <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">trust operates subtly</a> in the background.</p><blockquote>Trust is built in small moments of reassurance and consistency, and it can be lost in a single misstep.</blockquote><p>My journey across this research continued to affirm some things about trust. For example, in UX it isn’t just about security — it’s about <strong>predictability and transparency</strong>. Users trust products that behave in expected ways, where actions lead to anticipated outcomes. But trust doesn’t just matter at the beginning of an interaction; it needs to be <strong>reinforced throughout the user journey</strong>.</p><p>While the conceptual space surrounding how humans develop a trusting relationship with software experience is vast, here are a few notable concepts I can quickly summarize:</p><ul><li>One of the most powerful factors influencing trust is <a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><strong>familiarity bias</strong></a> — the tendency for people to trust what feels familiar.</li><li>Another key principle is <strong>cognitive fluency</strong>, which refers to how easily information is processed.</li><li><strong>First impressions</strong> also shape <a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596"">long-term perceptions</a> of trustworthiness. Research in psychology shows that <strong>people form lasting opinions within milliseconds of encountering a website or app</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>This is where our willingness is gambled away as our anticipated outcomes aren’t realized and we’re left disappointed.</blockquote><ul><li>Another psychological factor is <strong>ambiguity aversion</strong> — the <a href=""https://www.kommunicate.io/blog/ai-chatbot-fears/#:~:text=5.%20Companies%20Not%20Caring%20Another%20common%20concern,a%20cold%20and%20impersonal%20customer%20service%20experience."">natural discomfort people feel when outcomes are unclear</a>. If users aren’t sure what happens when they click a button, whether their payment went through, or how their data will be used, they experience hesitation. This seems like a facet of why many of us have grown negative towards traditional Chatbots — <em>I know personally I’m never sure how versatile or capable they might be.</em></li><li><a href=""https://articles.ux-primer.com/how-ux-design-influences-the-way-users-trust-or-doubt-technology-28e6e8ca3596""><strong>Emotional reassurance</strong></a><strong> </strong>also influences trust. Users feel more confident when an interface acknowledges their concerns, provides timely feedback, and offers clear pathways forward.</li><li><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/how-is-trust-and-credibility-designed-in-ux-fc0ed84a1697""><strong>Social proof</strong></a> is a psychological phenomenon where people conform to the actions of others under the assumption that those actions are indicative of the correct behavior. In UX, social proof can be leveraged to enhance trust through elements like reviews, testimonials, or user counts. Antithesis of this is Dark Patterns. Interestingly, this seems to correlate back to Social Influence in how we might adopt and accept software.</li></ul><p>The answer to my initial question feels like its starting to take shape. Trust is clearly a big reason that some of us humans have become weary of traditional Chatbots and poor search experiences. We’ve been left stuck in ambiguity — <em>“are you able to actually answer my question?”</em> and then we’re subsequently and consistently disappointed with the quality of answer or help we sought.</p><figure><img alt=""A toy robot set in a dark background"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Y4pTs1cuqsd0hICZlSTH9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=""https://unsplash.com/@jochenvw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Jochen van Wylick</a> on <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/yellow-and-black-robot-toy-Y40Ga3oahAs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Novelty, Risk &amp; Familiarity</h3><p>The research so far has shown how novelty can draw users to AI and new technological experiences. I found myself wondering if the <strong>relationship between novelty and willingness in this context were actually balanced</strong>. I quickly dug into how humans perceive risk around something new and novel to try and answer my new question.</p><p>According to my research, instead of a balance between novelty and willingness, <strong>the opposite is often true</strong>: <em>novelty can increase </em><a href=""https://www.psandman.com/col/familiarity.htm#:~:text=The%20basic%20principle%20in%20a,in%20which%20it%20is%20familiar).""><em>perceived risk and trigger risk-averse behavior</em></a>.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li><strong>Uncertainty and lack of information:</strong> Novelty inherently involves uncertainty, as the outcomes and potential risks of something new are not well-known or tested. This lack of information can be perceived as risky, prompting individuals to be cautious or avoid it altogether. This idea tends to be represented by a certain percentage of folks out there — still feeling hesitant or fearful of AI in general.</li><li><strong>Unfamiliarity:</strong> Humans tend to be more wary of the unknown. A lack of familiarity with something new can heighten feelings of vulnerability or potential harm, leading to risk aversion.</li><li><strong>Potential for negative consequences:</strong> Without prior experience, the potential for negative consequences with something new is often emphasized. Individuals tend to weigh potential losses more heavily than potential gains, making them more hesitant to engage with the unknown.</li><li><strong>Lack of fluency:</strong> Things that are difficult to process or are again, unfamiliar, can be perceived as less safe.</li></ul><p>All of this starts to feel like a razor’s edge of achieving sustained adoption. Initial novelty can undermine trust if expectations are unmet. Familiarity, through easy interfaces, builds trust, but repeated negative experiences (“familiarity betrayed”) destroy it, leading to disuse.</p><p>To build familiarity and reinforce trust, conversational interfaces must consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Novelty as an Entry Point:</strong> New AI experiences spark curiosity but risk disappointment if expectations aren’t met.</li><li><strong>Prioritize Clarity and Empathy:</strong> Design for <a href=""https://www.gladly.ai/blog/how-to-listen-to-customers-effectively/"">active listening</a>, clear communication, and acknowledgment of user frustration.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""An example screenshot where a Chatbot enabled human handoff"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*KgY4H3otVIVDM00XjkMp9g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image credit: <a href=""https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff"">https://www.gptbots.ai/blog/chat-bot-to-human-handoff</a></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Continuously Improve and Manage Expectations:</strong> Regularly update AI performance and set realistic expectations for its capabilities. This might be obvious — but if we knew ahead of time that the experience we were about to engage in was limited in certain ways, we might not result in such disappointment.</li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>This research journey has revealed much and of course, left me with even more questions and tangents to continue exploring. <em>(Feel free to check out my collection of resources in this </em><a href=""https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/05bf5d9e-964f-4fb8-b419-ac31abfaac4f""><em>Google Notebook LM</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>However, I think the answer to my original question, <em>Why are we willing to try and use new AI experiences while many of us hold disdain for the previous era of less intelligent Chatbots</em> is this =</p><ul><li>Novelty and the promise of new and better has <strong>enthralled many of us to dispel our own aversions and give emerging AI experiences a shot</strong>.</li><li>The social influence and word of mouth surrounding us at work, in the media, amongst friends and family has reassured <strong>more of us that the risk is worth it</strong>.</li><li>The successful examples we experience and hear about help to contrast the earlier iterations of conversational experiences —<strong> these are not Chatbots</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote>As we all collectively move beyond novelty and into familiarity - our consistently successful experiences that match our expectations will yield trust, leaving us accepting the few remaining products that deliver on all fronts.</blockquote><h3>Next</h3><p>One thing stood out across all this research — is the idea that effective communication practices can foster trust and acceptance. What a beautiful idea that every-day communication skills like Active Listening, Empathy, Clarity and Transparency all will likely embolden trust and drive adoption. That, however — <em>is another rabbit hole</em>.</p><p><em>Have you explored any similar psychological concepts in the AI Conversational space?</em></p><p>I’d love to hear your thoughts!

It’s on </em></strong><a href=""https://www.fadedpage.com/sc/innis.php""><strong><em>Harold Innis</em></strong></a><em> and how his forgotten idea about media bias can help us understand why search has become a negotiation for truth.</em></p><h3>How delivery shapes belief</h3><p>In the mid-1900s, Harold Innis was studying why some forms of knowledge last a long time and others disappear quickly. His answer: <a href=""https://www.newcartographies.com/p/harold-innis-and-our-time"">the way information is delivered carries a bias.</a></p><p>What he called <a href=""https://www.media-studies.ca/articles/innis.htm"">media bias</a> wasn’t what you would think of as being political. Instead, this was structural. Every medium (or delivery method) tilts truth in a particular direction. Innis divided this communication into two types:</p><ul><li><strong>Time-biased media</strong> like stone tablets, clay, and oral tradition: durable, slow to produce, hard to distribute. Designed to preserve memory across generations. <br />They were costly to create, so what made it into stone was meant to last.</li><li><strong>Space-biased media</strong> like paper, newspapers and radio: fast, scalable, and easy to spread. Great for moving information across distance. The tradeoff is that the information is easy to forget.</li></ul><p>Each method has different consequences if you’re wrong. You definitely don’t want to carve a mistake in stone. But you’ll toss an opinion on the radio without much hesitation.</p><p>Innis believed civilizations leans one way or the other. The problem is when they lean too far, things start to crack. For instance, the more a culture chases speed, the more it sacrifices memory.</p><p>That worried him, because when speed becomes the goal, friction disappears. And when friction disappears, belief forms too easily.</p><p>When that happens, people start believing things without remembering why. Information flies everywhere, and everyone believes a little bit of everything, but nothing deeply enough to sustain conviction, trust, or memory.</p><p>Which brings us to the delivery method shaping a lot of decisions today: the <strong>answer engine</strong>.</p><h3>The frictionless answer</h3><p>Innis taught that every medium tilts truth by setting the cost of being wrong (back to the idea that stone carried a level of permanence).</p><p><strong>Answer engines flipped that equation.</strong> They’re fast, free, available and project absolute confidence… while carrying almost zero accountability.</p><p>That’s the bias of the delivery system we live with now: <strong>it produces answers that <em>look </em>like truth but are endlessly changeable.</strong></p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>That mismatch matters. It’s not just a technology problem, and it’s deeply philosophical.</p><h3>Truth as a system</h3><p>Truth has always carried signals about how seriously to take it. I think about how headlines hint at urgency or a broadcast voice carries authority. Even a blog post tells you something about the author behind it.</p><p>Answer engines strip that information away. What’s left is a paragraph that’s floating above information that is constantly shifting around.</p><p>That’s why I think <strong>negotiation</strong> is the right metaphor. We aren’t testing competing claims anymore. We’re reacting to how the system delivers them. If it looks fine, we believe it.</p><p>Innis understood that the way information is delivered is more important than the content. It sets the probability of belief.</p><p>When answers are this easy to generate, its the delivery method that convinces us, not the accuracy of the information. Over time, we stop asking whether something is true and start assuming it must be… because it looked complete when it showed up.</p><h3>The context problem</h3><p>So we arrive at the issue brands are <em>actually</em> facing.</p><p>Brands assume the challenge is volume. Publish more, post more… rank more. But the challenge isn’t content. <strong>It’s context.</strong></p><p>Most brands are still playing an old game… chasing backlinks, tweaking keywords, and pumping out pages to satisfy algorithms that ranked links instead of resolving questions.</p><p>That used to work… when brands controlled the narrative. When it paid to write carefully sanitized copy that sounded official, without saying anything useful. When brands do that now, they don’t look like they’re being careful. They look evasive.</p><p>But now that same content gets torn apart, summarized, and served out of context.</p><p>This is an answer-first world. You can be right and still not be trusted.</p><p>That’s another paradox: <strong>trust now lives even further downstream from your content. It’s perceived by the reader only after they’ve read what the answer engine tore apart.</strong></p><h3>What we build from here</h3><p>If search is now a negotiation, brands can’t keep showing up the old way.</p><p>Publishing more just to publish more doesn’t make brands more believable. (You can look at stats on your content if you don’t believe me.)</p><p>Instead, I think brands need to work on understanding customer friction, offering context, and helping people weigh what to believe… even when the answer isn’t perfect. <strong>That’s how you build trust with your customer.</strong></p><p>Take financial services (where I spend my time).</p><p>Most banks write content to align with their own products and services. But answer engines aren’t asking what helps the brand. They’re asking what helps the reader.</p><p>So if you’re writing a piece called “What should Gen Z do with their tax return?”, and every answer just funnels them toward your checking account, you’ve already lost. Not because your product is bad… but because your answer wasn’t complete.</p><p>I think this will be the difference. Some will try to control the story and shape the narrative, while the winners will help people understand their options — even if one of them doesn’t benefit them directly.</p><p>Harold Innis warned us: When speed becomes the goal, memory becomes a casualty<em>. </em>Answer engines are fast, but if they erase the process of belief-building, trust doesn’t scale with them.</p><p>The organizations that adapt will realize that truth isn’t something you publish once and forget. It’s something you shape, over and over, in the ways your words and products survive being summarized.</p><p>In the long run, what people believe isn’t decided by what ranked. It’s decided by what <em>held up</em>.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ad3ea06886b2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">Negotiating truth</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>Design management is harder (and better) than I thought</h4><figure><img alt=""A hand-drawn diagram of x’s and o’s with lines and arrows pointing out various movements."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wFclA7SgV_V8vIyc0aH4fQ.png"" /></figure><p>I’ve been a design manager since 2022. Like many others in this role, I’ve been slowly shaping and reshaping my management values. This is where I’m at now. I’ll likely update this over time, or do a part 2.</p><p>I was an individual contributor (IC) for over 20 years before moving into management. Even then, I was reluctant to take the job because I enjoyed doing the work so much. So I’m familiar with ICs, how they think, and what sorts of things they think about. Things like craft, product quality, three-month timelines, career development, and recognition.</p><p>Now that I’ve been in management for a while, I also see how leadership thinks too. They’re thinking about strategy, year-long roadmaps, revenue, and the overall health of the organization.</p><p>I have a foot in both worlds, which will be a common thread in this article. I can help ICs think a little more strategically, and I can help leaders stay closer to the work.</p><p>Whether or not “manager” is in my title, I try to be that bridge, and to help everyone around me get just a little bit better.</p><h3>It all starts with team health</h3><p>No one does their best work when they’re stressed, burned out, or afraid to speak up. Great collaboration comes from trust and honest feedback that never feels personal or belittling.</p><p>I try to build that culture:</p><ul><li>Giving people both async and live ways to contribute, so it’s not just the loudest voice or one in an optimal timezone that wins.</li><li>Making it normal to share work early, not just when someone “feels it’s ready for critique.” We’re going to get leadership’s feedback at some point, better to get it early when there’s still time to address it and possibly change direction.</li><li>Being realistic about bandwidth and not overcommitting folks. I sometimes have to talk someone out of saying “yes” to something when they don’t realistically have time for it.</li><li>Encouraging experimentation and making room for failure as folks drift into adjacent roles. Especially now as research, design, product, and engineering move closer together.</li><li>Being vulnerable myself: sharing a past failure with the team, saying “I don’t know the answer”, or admitting when I’m struggling.</li></ul><p>With a healthy team culture, everything else gets easier.</p><h3>Player coach</h3><p>Some managers are comfortable not doing design anymore. Not me. I prefer being a player-coach, coaching the team and still doing some actual design work myself.</p><p>Most of the leaders I respect are close to the craft. Especially now, when AI enables everyone to build more, there’s less room for people who don’t actually do the work. I spend about equal time between people problems and craft problems.</p><p>I need real knowledge of the craft to be a useful thought partner. If I drift too far from the work, I stop speaking the same language as my ICs. I miss the little details that matter. Without that context, my input feels generic and surface-level.</p><p>Being good at the people side helps me move projects forward by unblocking decisions, aligning folks around a goal, and building momentum.</p><p>Getting better at the craft makes meme better at the work itself. The product experience, along with its complexity and details. The thing customers actually experience.</p><p><strong>You need both to lead well.</strong></p><p>That said, I’m mindful not to take on any large or “critical path” projects. My design contributions usually involve things like designing small features, covering a project when a designer is on PTO, bug fixes and polish, taking “busy work” from my ICs, and starting larger vision work to hand off to someone else.</p><p>This keeps me hands-on, but not in the way. That balance is important for me. That balance is important for me.</p><h3>Delegation is a sliding scale</h3><p>Delegation is often treated like a light switch. You either do the work yourself or you hand it off completely. In reality, it’s more of a sliding scale.</p><p>Sometimes you take on the task yourself. Sometimes you work alongside someone. Other times, you let them run with it. The right approach depends on the situation, their experience, and how much I want to check in along the way.</p><p>For example, I stay involved in the day-to-day of important projects. For smaller ones, I might delegate fully and just say, “Let me know how it turns out” or “Holler if you need anything from me.”</p><p>It’s less about rules and more about knowing my team.</p><h3>Avoid becoming a bottleneck</h3><blockquote><em>You may be lying to yourself when you say, “I’m the only one who can do this”. — </em><a href=""https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/how-to-delegate-with-high-standards""><em>Wes Kao</em></a></blockquote><p>Wes’s quote stuck with me because I’ve caught myself doing exactly that. In the past, I’ve been guilty of “hiding” in the work I’m already good at, keeping it from others. I tell myself no one else can do X, but deep down it’s also pride in being the one who does it well.</p><p>It’s important to be honest and call myself out in situations like this.</p><p>There are going to be new things that are ambiguous and uncertain, and it’s going to feel tempting to delay thinking about those and focusing on what I know. There will always be too much on my plate. The job is to decide where I’ll have the most impact, usually not by falling back on what I’m already good at. That might mean passing on a design review I’d normally jump into so I can focus on a hiring decision instead.</p><p>An example is HTML email: Every job I’ve had in the last 10 years, I’ve been known as “the email guy” who knows how to code HTML emails. That may be true when I first join, but I make sure to document what I know so others can help themselves. As an example, I created an email design system during my time at Stack Overflow so each product team could build their own emails without being email experts.</p><p>Another example is design feedback. I can’t review everything in real-time, and I don’t want that to slow my team down. So I documented what I look for: my taste, established UX conventions, our design system, and the comments I repeat most often, and made a custom GPT for my team to use. I even added some of my boss’s feedback style.</p><p>The goal isn’t always to <em>replace</em> me, but to help my team go farther without me.</p><h3>Clearing the path</h3><p>A big part of my job is helping my team <a href=""https://jordivillar.com/blog/becoming-irrelevant"">focus</a> on the work that matters most. That means filtering out noise before it ever reaches them. Not every request deserves their attention. I’d rather say no early than let distractions pile up. Pushing back is not always comfortable, but protecting the team’s focus is part of my role.</p><p>I also spend time clearing fog. Ambiguity slows people down. By sharpening the problem, setting constraints, or filling in missing context, I can help the team move faster and make better decisions.</p><p>And then there’s tension. Between what leadership wants, what the team needs, and what the product should become. I absorb that tension so my team doesn’t have to. That might mean telling leadership we need to slow down, or explaining to the team why priorities just shifted.</p><p>The team gets the clarity. I carry the weight.</p><h3>Just enough process</h3><p>Process helps teams stay on track, but too much of it kills creativity and momentum. When checkpoints and approvals pile up, the work starts to feel like factory output. I’ve seen projects where the design review process added more overhead than the design itself. No bueno.</p><p>My goal is to have enough structure to guide the work, but allows detours along the way for folks to find the right solution. Like prototyping an unexpected idea.</p><p>I teach designers to use their own judgment so they need me less for permission and more for refinement. Figma’s Jonas Downey has <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-a-resilient-design-team/#_5-be-judicious-about-process"">a few great prompts</a> to get designers thinking:</p><ul><li>What would you decide if it was fully up to you?</li><li>How would you explain this to a user?</li><li>How does it support our business?</li><li>How could we simplify it?</li></ul><p>I love using these in design reviews to get the discussion going when the group is quiet, and they always spark better conversations than another checklist would. These nudge people toward clearer, stronger work without adding more process.</p><h3>The manager’s quiet kind of high</h3><p>I’ve made peace with not getting that <a href=""https://jamie.ideasasylum.com/2024/06/21/the-manager-s-unbearable-lack-of-endorphins"">daily high</a> from making something with my own hands. I get satisfaction from watching my team build great stuff and grow personally, and knowing I played a part in it.</p><p>There’s power in those indirect wins:</p><ul><li>Clearing the path so someone can ship something they’re proud of.</li><li>Coaching someone today so their work months from now is stronger.</li><li>Rejecting the urgent-but-low-impact so the team can focus on what matters.</li></ul><p>Like when a designer nails their review with leadership, a coworker compliments one of my reports, or our work moves an important metric.</p><p>These moments aren’t always loud or concrete, so I keep a section for them in <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/why-you-should-have-a-brag-document-eb6cc82ec80a"">my brag document</a> so I don’t forget about my wins as a manager.</p><h3>Don’t forget who you are</h3><p>Design work is tough, even in the best conditions. As a manager, one of the things I enjoy most is finding ways to take pressure off the team when things get especially stressful.</p><p>I still upload unhinged custom emojis to company chat, host silly birthday games over Zoom, and drop funny links in chat.</p><figure><img alt=""A series of smiley face emojis with various expressions, all wearing a cowboy hat."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L3MUzg4miqJ01Y1pNGNffQ.png"" /><figcaption>Cowboy emojis, a tradition started by <a href=""https://www.aaronshekey.com/posts/custom-emojis/"">a former co-worker</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m mindful of what I say publicly because I realize the weight my words and actions carry as a leader in the company. But it’s important to lighten the mood once in a while That spirit finds its way back into the work and helps people feel psychologically safe.</p><h3>Everyday is winding road</h3><p>Like I said earlier, I’m still learning and my thoughts are evolving. I’m not a seasoned pro, but after a few years in management I’ve learned a few things worth sharing.

He and his team had successfully transformed a newspaper into performance art. What seemed like an impossible dream was now reality.</em></p><h3>The Business Results</h3><p>Utko’s extraordinary design work demonstrates that strategic, user-focused design significantly enhances business performance and reader engagement.</p><p>The amount of awards and revenue created by Jacek and his team are inspiring:</p><ul><li><strong>Increased Circulation by Up to 100%:</strong> Utko’s redesigns for newspapers in Eastern Europe, including titles in Poland, Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Latvia, consistently boosted circulation, with some publications seeing increases of up to 100% due to enhanced visual appeal and reader engagement.</li><li><strong>35% Circulation Growth in Poland:</strong> A Polish newspaper Utko redesigned saw a 35% circulation increase over three years, reversing nearly a decade of stagnation, by aligning design with business goals and reader preferences.</li><li><strong>Boosted Ad Revenue: </strong>His redesigns, such as for Bonnier’s business publications, led to increased advertising revenue, often by as much as 100%, by creating visually compelling layouts that attracted advertisers.</li><li><strong>Award-Winning Designs: </strong>Utko’s redesigns won the Society of News Design (SND) “World’s Best Designed Newspaper” award in 2004 and 2007 for Warsaw’s Puls Biznesu, enhancing brand prestige and marketability.</li><li><strong>European Newspaper of the Year Awards: </strong>Three newspapers he redesigned were recognized as European Newspaper of the Year in 2015, 2016, and 2019, driving higher readership and industry recognition.</li><li><strong>Global Impact Across 35 Countries:</strong> Utko’s redesigns for dozens of newspapers and magazines in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa (e.g., Singapore, South Africa) consistently increased readership and revenue, leveraging strategic design.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Beyond the extraordinary business results from McKinsey, Harvard, Forbes, and Adobe, the world can easily see in this simple example that design has the transformative power as a spark for innovation and a driver of business value.</p><p><em>Jacek not only proved that good design can help readers reconnect with newspapers, but he also proved that good design can bring a dying industry back from the edge of extinction.</em></p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/8229a39f9e4605e7d4bc15e0cd1867aa/href"">https://medium.com/media/8229a39f9e4605e7d4bc15e0cd1867aa/href</a><p>And he accomplished this by going beyond just aesthetics by improving the overall product and aligning content and design with a clear strategy. He collaborated with business leaders every step of the way.</p><p>Jacek is now an art director for the Bonnier Business Press, overseeing papers in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, and the work he oversees consistently wins major prizes (including another SND world’s-best in 2007 for Estonia’s <em>Äripäev</em>), despite their small teams and limited resources.</p><figure><img alt=""Jacek Utko quote: Design can change everything in your company; it can turn your company upside down.
