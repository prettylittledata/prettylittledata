<h4>AI can conjure photorealistic faces and dreamy landscapes in seconds, but ask it to write “Happy Birthday” on a cake and things get weird fast. The culprit is how these models learn to read, and the solution is trickier than it seems.</h4><p>Imagine you’ve just prompted your chosen AI image generator to create a stunning fashion advertisement for a major platform. The colours are gorgeous, the composition is beautifully balanced, and the lighting would make any photographer jealous. There’s just one small problem: the text reads “SHOP NUG.” Close, but not quite.</p><figure><img alt=""Four identical fashion ads with increasingly garbled AI-generated text, showing errors like ‘SHUP NOY,’ ‘DISGVER YUR SFYLE,’ and ‘SUMMILER COLLECION’ instead of proper words."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JpH8f3y4pOZpYh5Mlbg1iQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>If this sounds familiar, you’re certainly not alone. Despite remarkable leaps in AI-generated imagery over the past few years, text rendering remains the Achilles’ heel of even the most sophisticated models. And here’s the kicker: whilst generation has been steadily improving, <em>editing</em> that garbled text after the fact is proving to be an even thornier challenge.</p><p>So, what gives?</p><h3><strong>The fundamental mismatch</strong></h3><p>The truth is, AI image generators don’t actually “read” text. At all. When you ask <a href=""https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/"">DALL-E</a> or <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com/"">Midjourney</a> to include words in an image, the model isn’t processing language. It’s simply pattern-matching shapes it has seen before in training data.</p><p>Traditional text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion perceive text as a collection of pixels and visual elements to composite into the scene, not as meaning-conveying strings of characters. The model has seen millions of images containing billboards, book covers, and street signs, but it was never explicitly taught what those squiggles <em>mean</em> or how they follow strict rules of spelling and grammar.</p><p>This creates a fundamental mismatch. Text is precise and unforgiving: one wrong letter changes everything (“STOP” versus “ST0P”, anyone?). Images, by contrast, are fluid and interpretive. A face can be slightly asymmetrical and still look human. A landscape can have unusual lighting and still feel real. But misspell a single word? The illusion shatters.</p><h3><strong>How diffusion actually works (in broad strokes)</strong></h3><p>To understand why text is such a headache, it helps to peek behind the curtain at how these models generate images in the first place.</p><p>Most modern AI image generators use something called <a href=""https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/"">diffusion models</a>. The basic idea is surprisingly elegant. During training, the model learns to gradually add noise to images until they become pure static, then reverses this process by removing noise step-by-step to recover coherent pictures.</p><p>When you type a prompt, it gets processed through a text encoder (typically <a href=""https://openai.com/index/clip/"">CLIP</a>) that converts your words into numerical representations. These embeddings then guide the denoising process, steering the random noise towards something resembling your description.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI image generation workflow in five steps: 1) Prompt (text input), 2) Encode (AI processes text), 3) Denoise (removes visual noise shown as dots), 4) Refine (improves image composition), 5) Output (final image). Illustrated with simple icons connected by arrows flowing left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q2BzL8FhuLaDKns0UbFJ5g.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>The problem? Fine details like individual letters are treated as low-priority during the early denoising steps. Errors get “baked in” early and become <a href=""https://dev.to/tracywhodoesnot/why-ai-struggles-with-text-in-image-generation-n69"">incredibly difficult to correct later in the process</a>. The model is essentially guessing letter shapes with no feedback loop to verify whether its guess makes any linguistic sense.</p><p>There’s also the tokenisation issue. When CLIP processes text, it splits words into tokens, and sometimes those splits break apart the very concepts it’s trying to understand. “Deep focus,” for instance, gets tokenised into separate pieces, losing the photographic meaning entirely. The same fragmentation happens with the text <em>in</em> your images, making coherent words harder to reconstruct.</p><h3><strong>Generation is getting better — editing, not so much</strong></h3><p>Now for some good news: text generation in AI images has improved dramatically. Newer models are making genuine strides, and the gap between “absolutely wrong” and “actually usable” has narrowed considerably over the past year or so.</p><p>The improvement isn’t accidental. Companies have specifically invested in solving this problem, recognising that text accuracy is a dealbreaker for commercial applications. After all, nobody wants to hand a client an otherwise perfect AI-generated mockup with “BSET PRCIES” plastered across it.</p><p><a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a>, a platform built specifically with typography in mind, is said to be achieving now roughly <a href=""https://pxz.ai/blog/ideogram-vs-midjourney-2026"">95% accuracy on text prompts</a>, a remarkable leap compared to Midjourney’s approximately 40%. The company claims its latest model reduces text error rates by <a href=""https://the-decoder.com/ideogram-1-0-outshines-midjourney-and-dall-e-3-with-impressive-text-rendering/"">nearly half compared to DALL-E 3</a>. For designers who need readable words on posters, logos, and social media graphics, this could be genuinely transformative.</p><p>But does it really stand up to scrutiny? In the first example below, I asked it to generate a bookshelf with popular titles on product design, with the text clearly visible. The results showed significant errors (“Don’t Make Me Think” became “DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK,”) and other titles were similarly garbled. Next, I provided a specific list of books and authors. The outcome? Still riddled with text errors, suggesting that Ideogram’s touted 95% accuracy claim falls short in actual use cases that require heavy text generation. It may fare better with simpler, single-text prompts, but complex scenarios remain problematic.</p><figure><img alt=""Two AI-generated images of design book bookshelves side by side. Left image shows books with text errors including ‘DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK’ and garbled versions of titles like ‘The Design of Everyday Things,’ ‘About Face,’ ‘Lean UX,’ and ‘Atomic Design.’ Right image shows even more severely garbled text with ‘DO ON’ OK ME THIK,’ ‘ROOK LE,’ ‘DEUNNEWE UMBI BOULE,’ and ‘LEZCEDR’ demonstrating AI’s failure to render accurate book spine text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ieWpXulhkEfhTa5bjnVPw.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.recraft.ai/blog/comparing-popular-and-high-performing-text-to-image-models-and-providers"">Recraft V3</a>, another newcomer, has also positioned itself as a leader in accurate text rendering, claiming “flawless results with every prompt.” A bold assertion, but the benchmarks suggest it’s not far off.</p><p>So if generation is improving, why is editing still such a mess?</p><h3><strong>The short answer: context preservation</strong></h3><p>When generating an image from scratch, the model has complete creative freedom. It can place text wherever it likes, choose fonts that play nicely with its capabilities, and build the entire composition around what it knows it can render well.</p><p>Editing is a different beast entirely. When you ask an AI to fix garbled text on an existing image (through inpainting or other techniques) the model must preserve everything <em>around</em> the text whilst only modifying the specific region you’ve highlighted. This is where things get complicated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1614608/full"">Research on latent diffusion models for inpainting</a> shows that when applied to large or irregular regions, these models “tend to generate blurry or contextually ambiguous reconstructions.” The model fills in details based on surrounding context and learned patterns, which simply isn’t precise enough for the exact letter shapes that text requires.</p><p>In practical terms? The AI might successfully remove your gibberish text, but when it tries to paint new letters into that space, it struggles to match the exact style, lighting, and perspective of the original image. The result often looks patched rather than seamless.</p><h3><strong>Why you’re not imagining things</strong></h3><p>If editing feels harder than generating, the data backs you up. A <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">2025 benchmark study published in MDPI</a> evaluated multiple AI models across text accuracy metrics and found that all major platforms (including DALL-E 3, Ideogram, and Stable Diffusion) face “significant challenges with text accuracy” across domains like code, chemical diagrams, and multi-line text.</p><p>The scores are telling. For code-related text, Stable Diffusion scored just 1.25 out of 5 for text accuracy. Even Ideogram, the supposed text champion, managed only 1.75 in the same category. When it comes to complex, structured text requiring precise formatting, all models struggle.</p><p>Platform comparisons in 2025 reflect this reality. <a href=""https://apatero.com/blog/image-to-image-ai-transformation-comparison-2025"">Image-to-image tools vary significantly</a>, with Midjourney notably lacking “true inpainting and transformation controls.” For users who do heavy editing work, local Stable Diffusion with ControlNet remains the go-to option. However, that requires technical expertise most casual users might simply not have.</p><h3><strong>The workarounds (for now)</strong></h3><p>Until AI cracks this particular nut, what’s a designer to do? A few strategies have emerged, each with their own trade-offs.</p><p><strong>Use text-first generators.</strong> If you know you’ll need accurate typography, start with <a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a> or similar text-focused tools rather than trying to force words into Midjourney’s artistic outputs. It’s a case of picking the right tool for the job; you wouldn’t edit a feature film in PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Dual monitor setup showing AI workflow: left screen displays AI-generated coffee shop interior without text, right screen shows the same image in Photoshop with ‘Daily Brew Co.’ text overlay being added. Design tool logos (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, Affinity Designer) surround the monitors on the right side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_KEoHpKYJ9mBavQCGm33XA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Generate first, add text later.</strong> Many professionals now create their AI imagery text-free, then overlay typography using traditional design tools like Photoshop, Canva, or Figma. It’s an extra step, but the results are far more reliable. This approach also gives you complete control over font selection, kerning, and placement; things AI still handles clumsily at best.</p><p><strong>Try dedicated fix-it tools.</strong> Platforms like <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-gibberish-text-in-ai-generated-images/"">Storia Lab’s Textify</a> or Canva’s Grab Text tool can identify gibberish text and attempt to replace it. Results vary (patience is required) but for simple corrections, they can save considerable headaches. Just don’t expect miracles with complex multi-line text or heavily stylised typography.</p><p><strong>Embrace the hybrid workflow.</strong> As one industry comparison put it, “many professionals use both platforms,” generating artistic foundations in Midjourney, then handling typography in Ideogram. It’s not elegant, and it requires subscriptions to multiple services, but it works. Think of it as assembling a toolkit rather than searching for a single magic wand.</p><p><strong>Keep expectations realistic.</strong> Perhaps the most important strategy is simply managing client and stakeholder expectations. AI-generated imagery is powerful, but it has clear limitations. Flagging potential text issues upfront saves awkward conversations down the line.</p><h3><strong>What this means for designers and UX professionals</strong></h3><p>Beyond the technical challenges, there’s a broader conversation here about workflow and expectations. As AI tools become more embedded in creative processes, understanding their limitations isn’t just nice-to-have knowledge; it’s essential professional competence.</p><p>For UX writers and content designers, this has particular relevance. If you’re working with teams that use AI-generated imagery, you need to factor text limitations into your content strategy. That punchy headline might look great in a mockup, but will it survive the AI rendering process intact? Sometimes the answer is simply: maybe not.</p><p>And let’s be honest, there’s something almost poetic about AI mastering the creation of human faces whilst fumbling with human writing. It’s a reminder that these tools, however impressive, aren’t magic. They’re sophisticated pattern-matching systems with specific strengths and equally specific blind spots.</p><h3><strong>What’s on the horizon?</strong></h3><p>The research community hasn’t given up. Several promising approaches are in development:</p><ul><li><strong>Hybrid AI systems</strong> that generate a base image through one model, then overlay text using a separate, specialist module designed specifically for accurate placement. Think of it as mimicking how human designers work: creating the visual first, then adding captions as a final step.</li><li><strong>Better training data.</strong> Most current datasets lack properly labelled, structured text within images. Training on annotated text data could help models understand not just where text appears, but what it actually says and how words are properly formed.</li><li><strong>Vector-based rendering.</strong> Some teams are exploring ways to separate text from raster imagery entirely, treating typography as a discrete, editable layer rather than baking it into pixels. This would fundamentally change how text is handled, moving from pattern-matching to something closer to actual typesetting.</li><li><strong>OCR feedback loops.</strong> Imagine a model that generates text, runs optical character recognition to check its own work, and iterates until the spelling is correct. This kind of self-correction mechanism could dramatically reduce errors, though it would add computational overhead.</li></ul><h3><strong>Spelling it out</strong></h3><p>AI image generation has come a long way in a remarkably short time. Photorealistic faces, impossible architecture, dreamlike landscapes — all conjured from a few words typed into a prompt box. But text, that most human of visual elements, remains stubbornly resistant.</p><p>The core issue isn’t laziness or neglect. It’s architectural. Diffusion models were designed to see images holistically, not to parse the precise, rule-bound structures that make written language work. Generation is improving because researchers are training dedicated models for the task. Editing lags behind because preserving context whilst fixing details is a fundamentally harder problem.</p><p>For now, the practical advice is straightforward: plan for text limitations, use the right tool for the job, and don’t be afraid to bring in traditional design software for the finishing touches. AI is brilliant at many things. Fixing spelling errors in images just isn’t one of them… yet.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3><strong>References &amp; Credits:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">(2025).

<h4><em>Why data tables are an accessibility blind-spot (and how WCAG helps)</em></h4><p>Data tables are used in many different products and contexts. They are used in dashboards, product comparisons, or even internal finance reports. They help users make decisions, spot data patterns, and take action where needed.</p><p><strong>But when it comes to accessibility, data tables are often skipped.</strong> They’re assumed to be handled by default HTML or put off until the development stage.</p><p>Visually, the tables look easy to read with clear columns and rows, as well as distinct headers. But for many users (like those using screen readers or keyboard navigation), these tables can become confusing or even unusable.</p><figure><img alt=""Example data tables from IBM Carbon and Salesforce Lightning design systems"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V2pdiWu3IGVeuqcTJI_yRw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Many open-source data tables are available via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-datatable-basic--overview""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--base""><em>Salesforce Lightning</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Just to be clear; WCAG doesn’t prohibit data tables, it just requires that the table’s information, relationships, and functionality are available to all users.</strong> Not only that, you don’t need complex solutions to have both data tables and WCAG-compliant designs.</p><p>Let’s break down why data tables are frequently overlooked, what WCAG requires of them, and how designers and product teams can create accessible data tables.</p><h3>Why are tables an accessibility blind-spot?</h3><p>To be fair, data tables sit in an awkward spot between design and development. They feel too technical to be a pure design problem, but also feel too visual to be treated as just code. As a result, accessibility issues slip through the cracks.</p><p>But what specific issues come from neither design or dev taking full ownership of tables?</p><h4>Tables lack semantic structure</h4><p>Visually, most tables appear easy to scan with aligned column headers and distinguished rows.

There’s no guideline that says “make tables accessible.” Instead, WCAG is more concerned with whether users can perceive relationships, operate functionality, and understand content within the table.</p><p><strong>WCAG provides a framework, but it’s up to designers and teams to meet the expectations.</strong></p><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html#brief"">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</a></h4><p>This criteria asks that all users can understand how headers relate to data cells, regardless of how the table looks visually. When header relationships are missing, assistive technologies can’t provide meaningful context.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Use table markup to present tabular information (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51"">Technique H51</a>)</li><li>Use caption elements to associate the data table’s title or heading with the table (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39"">Technique H39</a>)</li><li>Use the scope attribute to associate header cells with cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H63"">Technique H63</a>)</li><li>Use id and headers attributes to associate cells with header cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H43"">Technique H43</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href"">https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard"">SC 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</a></h4><p>Any interaction included in a table must be operable using only a keyboard. This includes not only navigating the table itself, but also using features like filtering, pagination, and row-level actions.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure keyboard control for all functionality (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202"">Technique G202</a>)</li><li>Provide keyboard-triggered event handlers (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G90"">Technique G90</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order#brief"">SC 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)</a></h4><p>Users navigating with a keyboard need to know where they are at all times. WCAG requires visible focus indicators and clear communication of state changes.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Place the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G59"">Technique G59</a>)</li><li>Make the DOM order match the visual order (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27"">Technique C27</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels"">SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that controls and content have clear, descriptive labels. In data tables, this applies to the table’s title, column headers, and its interactive controls.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide descriptive headings (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130"">Technique G130</a>)</li><li>Provide descriptive labels (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131"">Technique G131</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href"">https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value#brief"">SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that content work reliably with assistive technologies now and in the future. For data tables, this means relying on semantic structure and predictable behavior rather than visually driven solutions.</p><p>Example techniques to pass:</p><ul><li>Use aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA14"">Technique ARIA14</a>)</li><li>Use aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA16"">Technique ARIA16</a>)</li></ul><h3>What designers should do before dev touches code</h3><p>Accessible data tables start with design decisions. Designers are responsible for preventing accessibility issues long before a developer ever starts coding. This includes defining design decisions like table structure, interactions, and data complexity.</p><h4>Use real structure, not just layout</h4><p>Before thinking about visual styling, designers should answer the following:</p><ul><li>What are the rows?</li><li>What are the columns?</li><li>What relationships matter most?</li></ul><p>If these answers aren’t obvious in the design, they won’t be obvious to assistive technologies. You need clear column headers, meaningful row labels, and consistent data structure.</p><h4>Have intentional interactions</h4><p>Not every table needs sorting, filtering, or inline actions. Each interaction adds cognitive load and accessibility complexity. When interactions are necessary, designers should define:</p><ul><li>Which columns are sortable</li><li>What happens when sorting is applied</li><li>How users move between table content and controls</li><li>If actions apply to a row, a cell, or the entire table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Atlassian’s Design System includes interactions when it makes sense with the data relationships"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pplXXuqgTPxTXbCCSO0EqA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atlassian.design/components/dynamic-table/examples#uncontrolled""><em>Atlassian’s Design System</em></a><em> includes interactions, like sorting, when it makes sense with the data relationships</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Design for keyboard users</h4><p>Using a keyboard is a primary input method for many users. Designers need to ensure that tables can be navigated in a logical, predictable order by asking:</p><ul><li>Can every interactive element be reached without a mouse/ trackpad?</li><li>Does keyboard focus move in a way that matches the table’s structure?</li><li>Are hover-only actions also doable via keyboard?</li></ul><h4>Consider various screen sizes</h4><p>Designers need to explicitly define how table structure and relationships are preserved across breakpoints. As the screen size shrinks, it’s simple to collapse and hide content, but designers should document:</p><ul><li>How labels remain associated with their values</li><li>How users can navigate between the data</li><li>How accessible interactions are maintained</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Lightning Design System’s data table responding to mobile screen size"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8s-b_ImlOvrMbOwmyYkvvg.png"" /><figcaption>Data tables need to respond when presented on mobile devices; via <a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--with-sorting"">Lightning Design System</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Document table expectations in Design Systems</h4><p>Data tables scale and remain consistent when they’re a shared standard. Documenting how tables behave is just as important as documenting how they look.</p><p>Helpful documentation includes:</p><ul><li>When to use a table (and when to other components like a list)</li><li>Required semantics with structure, headers, and labels</li><li>Keyboard and interaction behavior (like focus and pagination)</li><li>Interaction states and edge cases (like empty, loading, or error states)</li><li>Any known accessibility considerations or constraints</li></ul><p>Data tables are treated as containers for information, but they’re some of the most complex elements users interact with. Without incorporating accessibility into tables, users lose context, navigation becomes frustrating, and critical data becomes hard to understand.</p><p><strong>Complying with WCAG criteria helps all users no matter their ability.</strong> Accessible tables are easier to scan, more predictable to navigate, and clearly communicate meaning. They benefit screen reader users, keyboard users, and anyone working with dense data. When tables are designed with the same care as any other interface, accessibility follows naturally.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6a13533a6fde"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/data-tables-need-to-be-accessible-too-6a13533a6fde"">Data tables need to be accessible, too</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h3>When design stops asking why and starts asking, “Can AI do it?”</h3><h4>This advice is why designers are quietly losing strategic influence. We optimized AI interfaces for confidence.

Not after strategic intent is clarified. It arrives first.</p><p>And when you slow teams down to ask strategic questions, you’re increasingly seen as friction rather than guidance.</p><p>We built this pattern. Now it’s being used against us.</p><h3>We taught teams that polish means correctness</h3><p>For years, UX designers optimized AI interfaces to hide uncertainty. <a href=""https://medium.com/core-ai/why-ai-sounds-confident-even-when-its-wrong-4c0683a6f61e"">Chatbots</a> that sounded certain even when guessing.

Smooth experiences read as competent. Hesitation feels like failure. As Erika Hall noted in her <a href=""https://picovoice.ai/blog/conversation-design-tips-from-Hall/"">conversation with John Maeda</a>, “the level of visual polish can lead designers and decision-makers to think that the concepts underneath are stronger than they are.”</p><p>The concepts underneath are what matter. But we wrapped them in interfaces that signaled completion rather than exploration.</p><p>Those design decisions didn’t stay contained.

What once took days can now be done in hours, allowing designers to iterate and test more rapidly.” True. But iteration without interrogation isn’t strategic design — it’s production at scale.</p><p><a href=""https://banotes.org/administrative-thinkers/bounded-rationality-satisficing-decision-making-simon/"">Herbert Simon’s research on bounded rationality</a> explains why this matters: under time pressure and cognitive constraints, people accept solutions that appear “good enough” rather than optimal. AI doesn’t create this behavior — it accelerates it by making “good enough” arrive so quickly that deeper evaluation feels wasteful.</p><p>When creation is cheap, <strong>teams learn to mistake speed for strategy</strong>.</p><h3>What actually changed: Decision order flipped</h3><p>Product teams used to follow a sequence: understand user problems → clarify strategic intent → explore solutions → generate artifacts. This ordering wasn’t arbitrary — it created space for judgment.</p><p>AI disrupted that sequence not by replacing designers but by making execution nearly instantaneous. When something can be generated in seconds, the act of creation no longer signals commitment. It signals possibility.</p><p>But teams don’t always treat it that way.</p><p>Once a generated interface exists — even provisionally — it reshapes the conversation. The artifact becomes gravitational. Feedback clusters around it. Critique becomes incremental. The deeper question (<em>why this at all</em>) arrives late, if it arrives at all.</p><p><a href=""https://designintech.report/2024/03/12/design-against-ai-2024/"">John Maeda’s 2024 Design in Tech Report</a> distinguishes between “makers” (designers and developers who create) and “talkers” (product managers who drive revenue). AI made it easier for makers to make. But it made it <em>better</em> for talkers to talk — because AI outputs give them tangible artifacts to discuss without waiting for design judgment.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract architectural forms in teal, gold, and black showing stacked geometric shapes representing organizational hierarchy transformation and power redistribution between different roles"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EivrjbF7gUjc8D0uhCv67Q.png"" /><figcaption>The organizational power shift: When AI made artifacts instant, strategic influence moved from makers to talkers. Generated With Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><p>When stakeholders see “working” prototypes in first meetings, the implicit question becomes: <em>What do we need designers for?</em></p><p>The answer used to be: <strong>Strategic thinking. User advocacy. The discipline to ask why before how.</strong></p><p>But when generation speed becomes the primary value signal, those skills read as obstruction.</p><h3>The confidence problem we created</h3><p>Most AI design tools are optimized for decisiveness. They generate singular recommendations with confident presentation. This makes sense from a UX perspective — confidence reads as competence, smoothness reads as quality. As <a href=""https://www.studioubique.com/ai-ux-design/"">design best practices emphasize</a>, AI interfaces should “set honest expectations” and “show confidence.”</p><p>But between honest expectations and confident presentation, most products chose confidence.</p><p>This creates cascading problems. When AI presents one interface design with high visual polish, teams treat it as <em>the</em> answer rather than <em>an</em> exploration. Alternative approaches aren’t surfaced. Edge cases aren’t flagged. Uncertainty is smoothed over.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Research on automation bias</a> has demonstrated this dynamic for decades: people are significantly more likely to accept system output even when it conflicts with their own judgment, particularly when that output is presented confidently. The effect strengthens as systems appear more capable and authoritative.</p><p><a href=""https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2019/toward-human-centered-ai"">Human-centered AI research</a> has long advocated that systems should “support human judgment rather than replace it” — surfacing uncertainty, presenting multiple options, enabling override. But velocity pressures push teams toward tools that minimize friction, not maximize judgment.</p><p><strong>We designed the experience that trained organizations to trust confident outputs over strategic questioning.</strong></p><h3>What stopped getting asked</h3><p>As generation becomes easier, certain questions surface less often in product discussions:</p><p><strong>Why this approach instead of alternatives?</strong> When AI produces one polished solution quickly, exploring other directions feels wasteful. The existence of a “working” prototype creates psychological commitment before strategic evaluation happens.</p><p><strong>What assumptions are embedded in this output?</strong> AI training data encodes countless decisions about what “good design” looks like, what user problems matter, what solutions are appropriate. These assumptions remain invisible unless teams actively interrogate them.</p><p><strong>Who does this work well for — and who does it exclude?</strong> Rapid generation optimizes for median cases in training data. Edge cases, accessibility considerations, users who don’t match demographic norms get systematically overlooked.</p><p>As <a href=""https://www.muledesign.com/"">Mike Monteiro and Erika Hall have argued</a> for years, design’s ethical responsibility is interrogating these questions <em>before</em> building. But when “Can AI do this?” shows up first, those questions get framed as barriers to velocity rather than essential judgment.</p><h3>The strategic ground designers are losing</h3><p><strong>1 in 3 Figma users shipped an AI-powered product in 2025</strong> — a 50% increase from 2024. Only 9% cited revenue growth as the primary goal. Instead, <strong>35% said ‘experiment with AI’ and 41% said ‘enhance customer experience’</strong> — goals that struggle to define measurable success.</p><figure><img alt=""Fractured architectural platform with city lights glowing on top while ocean waves erode the breaking edges, representing diminishing strategic territory and crumbling foundation beneath ongoing work"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dfkLKul12MDKLvxYSyVw3A.png"" /><figcaption>The strategic erosion: Design work continues on the surface while foundational influence fragments beneath. Generated With Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><p>Translation: teams are building because they can, not because they’ve clarified what problem requires solving.</p><p>This isn’t speculation. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-of-ux-2026/"">Nielsen Norman Group’s State of UX in 2026</a> names the existential tension directly: “Available roles will increasingly demand breadth and judgment, not just artifacts… The practitioners who thrive will be adaptable generalists who treat UX as strategic problem solving, rather than focusing on producing deliverables.”</p><p>But when artifacts arrive instantly via AI, organizations don’t value judgment that questions whether those artifacts should exist. They value judgment that makes those artifacts ship faster.</p><p><a href=""https://maven.com/centercentre/uxai"">Jared Spool notes</a>: “AI gives us an unprecedented ability to anticipate user needs. The challenge is balancing automation with human empathy in design.” The challenge isn’t technical. It’s organizational. When teams measure progress in shipped features rather than solved problems, empathy reads as slowdown.</p><p><strong>68% of developers say AI improves work quality. Only 40% of designers agree.</strong> The gap reveals who’s winning the value argument. Engineers deliver code. Designers deliver questions. In velocity-obsessed cultures, questions don’t ship.</p><h3>What separates successful teams from everyone else</h3><p>Figma’s data on successful versus unsuccessful AI product teams reveals the pattern: <strong>60% of successful teams explored multiple design or technical approaches</strong>, compared to only <strong>39% of unsuccessful ones</strong>.</p><p>The differentiator wasn’t AI capability. It was judgment discipline.</p><blockquote>Successful teams don’t slow down generation. They slow down after generation.</blockquote><p>They treat AI output as a starting point requiring validation, not a conclusion requiring execution. They assume speed increases the risk of unexamined assumptions, not decreases it.</p><p>This aligns with <a href=""https://www.muledesign.com/"">principles Erika Hall has advocated</a> for years: “80% of your job should be talking to people… The concepts underneath are the most important part.” But talking takes time. In cultures optimized for generation speed, time feels expensive.</p><p><a href=""https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/brad-frost"">Brad Frost’s work on design systems</a> emphasizes that sustainable systems require “human relationships” and collaborative judgment, not just component libraries. But when AI can generate components in seconds, the relationship part gets skipped.</p><h3>The uncomfortable truth about design’s complicity</h3><p>Here’s what makes this particularly painful: <strong>UX designers built this problem</strong>.</p><p>We spent years optimizing AI interfaces for confident presentation over calibrated uncertainty. We designed chatbots to sound certain even when guessing. We created loading states that implied thoughtfulness without revealing doubt. We built systems that hid alternatives behind single recommendations.</p><p>We did this because users wanted smooth experiences. Because confident systems get adopted. Because our job was removing friction.</p><p>Those design decisions didn’t stay contained. They taught organizations that <strong>AI outputs deserve trust by default</strong>. That polish equals correctness. That questioning generated work slows teams down.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Alv38Wim_CfOCyWKzwudig.png"" /><figcaption>We optimized for smooth experiences.

We didn’t prepare for how smooth tools would reshape what organizations value about designers.</p><h3>What happens next</h3><p>The real risk isn’t that AI will design for us. AI already designs <em>with</em> us, and that collaboration produces real value when guided by strategic judgment.</p><p>The risk is that organizations will stop rewarding the judgment part.</p><p>When “AI can do this faster” becomes sufficient reason to build something, design stops being about solving meaningful problems and becomes about demonstrating AI capability. User needs become secondary to technical possibility. Strategic clarity becomes friction to be eliminated.</p><p>As noted, teams cite ‘experiment with AI’ and ‘enhance customer experience’ as goals rather than measurable outcomes.

<h4>Why government keeps forcing uncertainty through systems designed for stability — and what an alternative might look like</h4><p>In a previous article, I argued that<a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/p/unfit-for-uncertainty-rethinking""> the UK government is structurally unfit for uncertainty</a> — taking 21st-century challenges, evaluating them with 20th-century tools, and responding within 19th-century institutions — built for a different time, and for different kinds of problems. And, if Labour’s<a href=""https://labour.org.uk/change/mission-driven-government/""> mission-driven government</a> is to mean anything in reality, the civil service needs a new grammar of everyday decision-making: one that treats uncertainty as navigable, frames choices in terms of <em>risk and opportunity</em> rather than cost and control, and builds learning into how problems are defined and acted upon.</p><p>This piece starts where that argument ends, asking what a <em>different architecture for decision-making</em> might look like when uncertainty is high — and stability still matters. To answer it, this article explores why existing innovation efforts repeatedly collapse back into business-as-usual routines, before setting out an alternative, <em>overlaying</em> architecture for decision-making under uncertainty: one built on the premise of strength without weight and dynamic learning at its core.</p><h3>Beyond the waterfall state</h3><p>To be clear, the answer is not to burn everything down and start again. It points in a very different direction from the chainsaw, scorched-earth approach of the Elon Musks of the world. As<a href=""https://apolitical.co/communities/reimagining-public-institutions/8d06fbe0-ceab-11f0-8080-8001537bea73#1cf87f8c-d7ad-408c-a626-0640c5768499""> Andy Knight reminded me</a>, most of what government does is stewardship — and that function is indispensable. It depends on stable, convergent, waterfall prediction policymaking. It is what keeps the lights on. Literally.</p><p>But the architecture that underpins stability is not the architecture that enables transformative change. Keeping the lights on today matters — but so does ensuring they stay on in the future. Missions, systems change, and early-stage sense-making require something different: space for divergent creativity, structured exploration, and collective judgement. This is the foundation for a state that is able to work with uncertainty rather than suppress it — what Kattel, Drechsler, and Karo describe as<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/final_innovation_bureaucracies_20_dec.pdf""> agile stability</a>: the capacity to generate new directions while maintaining long-term institutional coherence.</p><p>The problem is that we continue to run all forms of decision-making — certain <em>and</em> uncertain — through the same architecture inherited from a New Public Management era, an architecture built on the assumption that if you press a button, you know something will happen — as if governing were<a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bounded-rationality/""> a computational task with bounded rationality</a> rather than a socio-technical one. While this logic may work tolerably well for stewarding stable systems, organisations — and the world around them — are not computers. When uncertainty is high and judgement, learning, and creativity matter most, this type of computational “bounded rationality” repeatedly fails (See:<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2024/may/mission-critical-statecraft-21st-century""> Statecraft for the 21st Century</a>) leaving us with a hollowed-out version of what Charles Lindblom once described as<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/policyandsociety/article/30/1/1/6422222""> “muddling through”</a>: not pragmatic adaptation, but institutional drift in the face of uncertainty.</p><p>James Plunkett has suggested that this<a href=""https://medium.com/@jamestplunkett/what-if-government-is-stuck-in-a-local-maximum-b54ad3f9dd0d""> traps government in a kind of “local maximum</a>” able to improve what it can already see, but unable to perceive or reach a wider landscape of possibility. Sophia Parker<a href=""https://sophiaparker-241.medium.com/a-larger-reality-how-governments-can-escape-the-local-maximum-d62018ec3949""> extends this argument</a>, noting that when institutions are caught “between worlds,” the familiar tools of optimisation cannot open up a larger reality — they only make us better at navigating the status quo.</p><blockquote><em>“A local maximum is a place where everything you try seems to make things a bit better, but nothing you try can make things fundamentally different” — James Plunkett</em></blockquote><p>This is precisely why the re-emergence of mission-oriented and responsible approaches to policymaking — used here as an umbrella for systems thinking, futures thinking, user-centred design, agile methods and other exploratory practices — has put the limits of the administrative system in the spotlight. Instead of becoming a routinised way of organising systemic change, missions — and the transformative methods attached to them — repeatedly collapse back into incrementalism and business-as-usual routines when they are forced through an architecture built for stability.</p><blockquote>See<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/mission_oriented_innovation_policies_in_europe_from_normative_to_epistemic_turn.pdf""> Kattel &amp; Mazzucato</a> on why missions struggle to make an epistemic turn within existing bureaucratic logics, Demos Helsinki’s “<a href=""https://demoshelsinki.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missions-for-Governance-Demos-Helsinki.pdf"">Missions for Governance</a>” on how missions constrained by current mechanisms tend to produce only incremental improvements.</blockquote><p>So, if the architecture is the limit, the question becomes not how to replace the existing system (we rely on its stability more than we admit), but how to create an overlaying architecture that can be activated when uncertainty is high and when public value depends on exploration. Geoff Mulgan refers to this type of bureaucracy as having “<a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-158372382"">strength without weight</a>,” the ability to use institutional power without the bureaucratic drag that stifles learning — enabling decision-making supported by intelligence, curiosity and adaptability, rather than the machinery of implementation and control.</p><h3>The capabilities the state needs to work under uncertainty</h3><p>Any discussion of a second, more agile organisational architecture for navigating uncertainty and producing public value must begin with capability. Not whether an organisation has the <em>right structures</em> on paper, but whether it can learn, coordinate, and adjust as conditions change. Working under uncertainty — and delivering any form of transformative, systemic change — requires a different way of thinking about both public value and the organisational capabilities that sustain it.</p><p>First, public value cannot be treated only as an outcome delivered at the end of a policy process, or as a means-to-an-end justified through appraisal. As<a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government""> Mark Moore argues</a>, it is both an outcome and something produced through the policy process itself. Under conditions of uncertainty, the quality of these processes is not incidental;<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-public-design-evidence-review/public-design-evidence-review-literature-review-paper-2-public-value-html#how-to-define-public-value""> it is constitutive of public value</a>, shaped across an organisation’s mission, sources of legitimacy and operational capacity. Treating value as both an outcome and a process provides a practical way to judge whether particular actions are improving a situation and are worth their costs.</p><p>This shifts attention to the dynamic capabilities embedded within public organisations: the capacities that allow institutions to sense change, coordinate across boundaries and deliberately reshape resources and priorities as the environment shifts. These are not specialist innovation skills or isolated tools, but foundational capabilities <a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government"">— central to public value management</a> — that determine whether an alternative decision-making architecture can function at all.</p><p>This aligns closely with work on<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/""> <em>Human Learning Systems</em></a>, which frames outcomes as emergent properties of complex systems and treats learning, adaptation and relationship-building not as phases of reform, but as the core work of public management under complexity.</p><p>This is where the Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose’s<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/publications/2022/mar/dynamic-capabilities-public-sector-towards-new-synthesis""> work on dynamic capabilities</a> is particularly useful. For this discussion, it helps clarify both what decision-making under uncertainty requires and why so many innovation efforts struggle to influence practice. Three dynamic capabilities are especially relevant here:</p><ul><li><strong>Sense-making:</strong> the ability to scan an environment, surface weak signals, and develop shared interpretations of what is happening and why. This is not about better forecasting or more data, but about collective orientation when evidence is partial, contested, or evolving.</li><li><strong>Connecting:</strong> the capacity to coordinate across organisational, disciplinary, and sectoral boundaries. Under uncertainty, no single team or function holds the full picture. Effective decision-making depends on integrating different forms of knowledge and negotiating trade-offs across silos that were never designed to meet.</li><li><strong>Shaping:</strong> the ability to reconfigure priorities, resources, and routines in response to what is being learned. Without this capability, insight accumulates but decisions remain locked in — learning exists, but it has no leverage.</li></ul><p>Taken together, these capabilities frame public value as something produced <em>through</em> decision-making itself (or<a href=""https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/creating-public-value-core-idea-strategic-management-government""> “strategic management”</a> if you would rather). How problems are framed, whose knowledge is included, when commitments are made, and whether learning is allowed to alter direction all shape whether public value is created — or quietly eroded.</p><h3>Why innovation efforts collapse back into business as usual</h3><p>The difficulty is not a lack of innovation activity, it’s where that activity sits relative to how decisions are actually made. Uncertainty demands dynamic capabilities such as sense-making, connecting, and shaping. Yet, most public-sector decision-making architectures are designed to steward stable systems, not to navigate contested, evolving or genuinely new ones. This creates a structural mismatch where even when teams attempt to work differently — through experimentation, design or mission-led approaches — the surrounding architecture pulls decision-making back towards certainty.</p><p>Public Digital’s<a href=""https://public.digital/the-radical-how""> The Radical How</a> illustrates this issue. In the dominant waterfall model of policymaking, the most consequential decisions are made upfront — precisely when uncertainty is highest — while learning arrives later, once direction has already been fixed. The process follows a familiar pattern: <strong><em>Write policy → guess requirements → procure IT systems → Inflict on users at scale → operate indefinitely.</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eFXc3Zpnftr_W-NR.png"" /><figcaption>Waterfall-style programmes start with many risky assumptions (<a href=""https://d1rnadml6vbx0i.cloudfront.net/Public-Digital_The-Radical-How.pdf"">The Radical How</a>, 2024)</figcaption></figure><p>Seen through this lens, learning is systematically pushed downstream, when its capacity to shape outcomes is weakest. Innovation efforts are not failing because they lack ambition or quality, but because they are layered <em>onto</em> an architecture that is structurally hostile to uncertainty.</p><p>This pattern repeats across governments. New methods are introduced, capabilities are developed, and insights are generated — but only <em>after</em> the moments when direction is set, resources committed, and alternatives foreclosed. The result is activity without leverage: innovation that is visible and energetic, but ultimately powerless.</p><p>Three examples help bring this structural mismatch to life.</p><ol><li><strong>Policy Labs</strong></li></ol><p>Policy labs are among the most significant attempts to embed learning into policymaking through user-centred and systems perspectives. They are designed to intercept policy ideas early and improve decision quality (see<a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2021.1883834""> Anna Whicher</a> on the evolution of Policy Labs in the UK). In capability terms, labs are particularly strong at sensemaking in many ways. A large part of my own work is surfacing lived experiences, identifying risks and challenging the assumptions of policy teams while at the same time bringing together multidisciplinary actors who would not normally work together and creating relational infrastructure across policy and delivery siloes.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*n1BImJe4q3SJUECH.png"" /><figcaption>Policy Labs embed agile learning after decisions have been made</figcaption></figure><p>The problem, however, is not <em>what</em> labs do, but <em>when</em> they are able to do it. Within the existing decision-making architecture, the moments when assumptions can genuinely be challenged are tightly constrained. Policy labs rarely control the decision gates where commitments are made, budgets locked in or political capital spent. Their insights enter policy processes already moving toward closure. Learning exists, but it arrives downstream of power.</p><p>As a result, insight is absorbed rather than acted upon — often filed away in the proverbial “policy drawer” while assumptions remain untested. Labs generate understanding, but without authority to reopen decisions, that understanding struggles to shape outcomes.</p><p><strong>2. Technology-centric or challenge-driven funding</strong></p><p>Technology programmes and challenge-driven funds apply shaping pressure differently. They create momentum around emerging technologies and capabilities, directing attention, investment, and experimentation towards what <em>might</em> be possible. In doing so, they generate valuable insight into technical feasibility and future options — often through pilots, prototypes, and partnerships that test new approaches in practice.</p><p>This activity frequently supports sense-making as well — imagining new uses of AI, automation, or data at scale, and expanding the perceived solution space.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KvUr5gH0dFZJEfMh.png"" /><figcaption>Technology and challenge-driven funds struggle to diffuse into the decision-making system</figcaption></figure><p>The problem is not the quality of this learning, but its <strong>position</strong> in the decision-making system and who it involves. Insights generated through challenge funds rarely travel upstream into everyday policy work. Policy teams struggle to access or apply what has been learned — not through resistance or lack of interest, but because there are few institutional pathways for the diffusion of knowledge.</p><p>As a result, innovation happens <em>around</em> the policy system rather than <em>within</em> it — shaping the environment without reshaping the decisions that govern it. Insight accumulates, but without leverage where it matters most (see my note on the frustration of AI pilots<a href=""https://substack.com/@jackstrachan/note/c-164601193""> here</a>).</p><p><strong>3. Generalist training, hackathons and experimentation initiatives</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most compressed illustration of the problem comes from generalist training programmes, hackathons, and short-term experimentation initiatives. These are designed to introduce brief moments of learning and collaboration — short bursts of sense-making and connecting — often framed as ways of normalising experimental decision-making.</p><p>Yet, in practice, they frequently do the opposite. Because these initiatives are time-bound, performative and disconnected from approval, commissioning and resource-allocation processes, their outputs struggle to survive contact with existing governance routines. What is learned rarely reshapes decisions; instead, participants return to an architecture that rewards certainty, compliance, and delivery over adaptation. It is often theatre over substance.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zYFSfCbZgnPcu8j5.png"" /><figcaption>Generalist training, hackathons and sandboxes are often isolated occasions of theatre</figcaption></figure><p>Viewed in isolation, these initiatives can appear valuable. Participants report insight, energy, and motivation. But because they sit outside the moments where commitments are made, they offer no sustained pathway for learning to translate into public value.</p><p>This is not a failure of individuals or intent. It reflects a deeper structural issue. When learning is experienced as an exception rather than a condition of everyday decision-making, it is easily dismissed as “interesting but unrealistic.” Without repeated, consequential exposure to uncertainty — where learning genuinely alters direction — counter-intuitive ways of working struggle to stick.</p><p><strong>Across each of these examples, the same pattern repeats.</strong></p><p>Learning happens, but too late. Insight accumulates, but without leverage. Innovation is active, but powerless.</p><p>Seen through the waterfall architecture, this is not surprising. These mechanisms are attempting to introduce uncertainty, exploration, and adaptation into a system designed to eliminate them as early as possible. This is why mission-oriented approaches, design methods, and experimental practices so often collapse back into incrementalism: they are forced to operate <em>after</em> direction is set, resources committed, and alternatives foreclosed.</p><p>This is not a capability problem. It is an architectural one. Until the conditions exist for sense-making, connecting, and shaping to influence decisions <em>when they matter most</em>, innovation efforts will remain episodic and low-impact. Which leads to the next question: what would an alternative — <em>complementary — </em>decision-making architecture need to look like?</p><h3>An alternative (mission-driven) decision-making architecture</h3><p>Rather than replacing existing policymaking systems, this section sets out an overlaying decision-making architecture designed for moments of uncertainty. Drawing on Vinnova’s<a href=""https://www.vinnova.se/en/publications/mission-oriented-innovation---a-handbook-from-vinnova/""> mission-design framework</a> — and learning from the UK Government Digital Service’s<a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/01/a-year-in-the-making-the-digital-by-default-service-standard/""> agile delivery model for digital services</a> — the model below translates these insights into a participatory decision-making architecture for moments of uncertainty. Its purpose is not to generate <em>better</em> analysis, but to change how <em>direction, commitment, and resourcing decisions are formed</em> by deliberately activating the dynamic capabilities discussed earlier: sense-making, connecting, and shaping.</p><p>Put simply, this architecture embeds learning <em>throughout</em> the policy design and delivery process, rather than treating it as something that arrives after key decisions have already been made.</p><p>This architecture rests on four principles.</p><ol><li><strong>Conditional, not universal: </strong>It is activated only where uncertainty is high and stakes are systemic — not as a default mode of governance.</li><li><strong>Triggered by uncertainty, not default:</strong> It complements, rather than competes with, existing stewardship systems.</li><li><strong>Relational and procedural, not structural:</strong> it works through roles, practices and decision rights, not new hierarchies. This means a focus on making stakeholders active participants of the design process.</li><li><strong>Time-bound and reversible:</strong> Its purpose is to resolve uncertainty, not institutionalise exploration indefinitely. Results matter.</li></ol><p>Critically, it also depends on what Dan Hill describes as<a href=""https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57a""> <em>“soft eyes”</em></a>: the capacity to observe and work with the dark matter of bureaucracy — the informal relationships, tacit norms and interdependencies that sit between teams, directorates and policy domains. Without this, attempts to engage uncertainty are either blocked by premature certainty or absorbed back into business-as-usual routines before they can influence decisions.</p><p>This is not an abstract sensibility either. Variants of this capability have been articulated over the past decade through relational practices such as<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-do-we-mean-relational-services-dennis-vergne-fq9he/?trackingId=ovP%2BQ3INid7UUUDxmYDavQ%3D%3D""> Relational Service Design</a>,<a href=""https://www.humanlearning.systems/""> Human Learning Systems</a>, Dark Matter Lab’s<a href=""https://freight.cargo.site/m/Q2581255008246565147592803666662/Governing-Together-MASTER-DECK-September-2025-v6.pdf""> Governing Together</a>, and the<a href=""https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344""> TEAL movement</a>, which foreground trust, continuity, and institutional relationships as core operating conditions rather than delivery-side effects. The challenge is not their absence, but their marginal position relative to where decisions are actually made.</p><p>What follows sets out how this overlaying architecture works in practice: the stages it moves through, the capabilities it embeds, and how it interfaces with the state’s existing delivery and stewardship machinery.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LSRj1lPPAt4Y84RE.png"" /><figcaption>An overlaying decision-making architecture</figcaption></figure><p>At a high level, the architecture is organised around four overlapping learning loops. These are not phases or stage gates. They are modes of work that structure how learning, judgement, and commitment evolve under uncertainty. What distinguishes this model from familiar innovation or design frameworks is not the loops themselves, but where decision authority and resource commitment sit within them.</p><p>The flow follows Vinnova’s mission-design framework, moving from <strong>Angles → Missions → Prototypes → Demonstrators</strong>, progressively reducing uncertainty while keeping direction open for as long as possible.</p><h3>A. Angles: orienting the system</h3><p>The Angles loop focuses on collectively developing an initial view of the system: identifying where uncertainty lies, what matters, and where intervention might be possible.</p><p>Rather than jumping to solutions, this loop brings a core group together to surface <em>different ways of seeing the problem space</em>. It deliberately draws together a trans-disciplinary team of policy, operational, user, technical, and political perspectives to build a shared orientation to the system as it is experienced, not just described.</p><p>The emphasis here is on sense-making and connecting. The output is not a strategy or recommendation, but a set of <em>plausible directions</em> — angles of intervention worth exploring further.</p><h3>B. Missions: committing to direction</h3><p>The Missions loop translates the most promising angles into statements of intent and design principles. These articulate <em>what kind of change is being pursued and why</em>, without prematurely specifying how it will be delivered. Design principles matter because they act as decision constraints under uncertainty — a function<a href=""https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/12/10/designing-public-services-that-work-for-everyone/""> GDS has long used to align teams</a> without over-specifying solutions.</p><p>At this point, connecting remains central — aligning actors around a shared purpose — while shaping begins to matter more. Missions create directionality by setting boundaries, clarifying intent, and establishing criteria for learning in the next stages.</p><p>Crucially, missions are treated as provisional commitments. They are strong enough to mobilise action, but flexible enough to adapt as learning accumulates. Their role is not to close down debate, but to focus it — similar to<a href=""https://futurestatedesign.co/futurestate-design""> futurestate strategy</a> or<a href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/stakeholder_engagement_for_policy_design_planning.pdf""> strategic foresight practices</a>.</p><h3>C. Prototypes: learning through tangible commitments</h3><p>The Prototypes loop explores missions through a portfolio of concrete experiments — policy, service, regulatory, or organisational — designed to test assumptions and surface consequences.</p><p>Prototypes are decision-shaping commitments: deliberately designed to inform judgement about whether, how, and where to scale. Multiple prototypes ask different questions, reducing uncertainty through comparison rather than consensus. Vinnova’s<a href=""https://arkdes.se/en/projects/street-moves/""> <em>Street Moves</em></a> programme is a good example: place-based experiments used not as pilots, but as learning devices.</p><p>Here, connecting and shaping are tightly coupled. Prototypes act as boundary objects, aligning actors, mobilising resources and enabling learning through doing. The emphasis is not speed for its own sake, but efficiency: learning as much as possible for the least irreversible cost. Or, in Public Digital’s “<a href=""https://d1rnadml6vbx0i.cloudfront.net/Public-Digital_The-Radical-How.pdf"">The Radical How”</a> terms: doing whatever it takes to speed up the loop of testing the things that matter the most and learning from the results.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/966/0*pj4BbouEHOw6rmkz.png"" /><figcaption>Agile learning. The Radical How, 2024.</figcaption></figure><h3>D. Demonstrators: integrating learning at scale</h3><p>The Demonstrators loop brings together insights from multiple prototypes into large-scale system demonstrations. These are not end states; they are decision-shaping devices. Their purpose is to determine whether uncertainty has been reduced <em>enough</em> to re-enter the state’s core delivery and stewardship architecture.</p><p>Here, sense-making resurfaces, alongside continued connecting and shaping, as priorities and resources are adjusted in response to what has been learned. Demonstrators help decision-makers see how interventions interact at scale before irreversible commitments are made. At this point, work can deliberately transition from exploratory modes into more stable delivery pathways — moving from adaptive learning to reliable execution.</p><h3>Switching modes</h3><p>At this point, I want to stress that this proposed second architecture is conditional, not universal. It is activated only when uncertainty is high — when outcomes cannot be reliably predicted, causal pathways are contested, and early lock-in would be costly or irreversible. It’s about introducing a dynamic learning process so that the state can <em>return</em> to its stable delivery architecture once uncertainty has been reduced.</p><p>When activated, several conditions matter:</p><ul><li>decision authority must sit close to the work</li><li>learning must have formal routes into commitment and resourcing</li><li>participation must include those affected, not only those accountable</li><li>exit conditions must be explicit</li></ul><p>The intent is not to weaken the state’s capacity for delivery, but to protect it by ensuring that stability is not achieved at the cost of learning, and that exploration does not become detached from power. In other words, this is not about replacing the machinery that keeps the lights on. It is about creating the conditions under which the state can <em>decide differently when it needs to</em> — and then return, deliberately, to what it already does well.</p><h3>Preparing the ground: agile team models when working under uncertainty</h3><p>Transformative change starts by <em>preparing the ground</em>: creating the conditions for a small, multidisciplinary team to work differently, with political cover, protected space, and the authority to bypass routine constraints long enough to prove what is possible. This was true of the early Government Digital Service in 2011, and it remains true of any attempt to change how the state decides under uncertainty.</p><p>Fundamentally, if we expect teams to sense, connect, and shape under uncertainty, we cannot treat them as interchangeable delivery units. Different phases of decision-making require different, malleable team purposes and archetypes that evolve as uncertainty reduces.</p><p>Kate Tarling’s work on<a href=""https://www.theserviceorg.com/""> service organisations</a> is useful here. Rather than assuming static “agile teams,” she shows how teams shift over time: from exploratory, functional groupings with hand-offs, towards whole teams responsible for delivering and improving joined-up services. She stresses that hand-offs are not inherently problematic but they are often necessary early on — with problems arising when teams are <em>locked</em> into a structure that no longer matches the nature of the work and are forced into incompatible handovers.</p><p>It is therefore more helpful to think in terms of complementary team types, rather than a single ideal form. Drawing loosely on team typologies developed by<a href=""https://teamtopologies.com/book""> Skelton and Pais</a> (and Tarling), a mission-driven architecture typically relies on a portfolio of teams with distinct roles:</p><ul><li><strong>Service teams</strong> are responsible for delivering and improving outcomes for users and operations.</li><li><strong>Depth teams</strong>, which explore complex issues, generate insight and reduce uncertainty on behalf of others.</li><li><strong>Common-capability teams</strong>, which build shared tools, platforms, and processes that make learning and delivery easier.</li><li><strong>Enabling teams</strong>, which unblock, coach, and support other teams to adopt new ways of working.</li><li><strong>Coordinating teams</strong>, which align activity across services or missions when interdependencies are high.</li><li><strong>Operational teams</strong>, which steward stable systems and deliver continuity over time.</li></ul><p>Crucially, these teams do not all operate in the same way, nor at the same time. Early in the lifecycle of a mission — when uncertainty is highest — depth, enabling, and coordinating teams play a larger role in sense-making and connecting. As direction stabilises and uncertainty reduces, service and operational teams take on greater responsibility for shaping and delivery.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Mue1QZS_TrhSJKpp.png"" /><figcaption>Different types of decision-making demand different types of teams</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*12rV9jFOQ7-1YVOL.png"" /><figcaption>Team types, roles and sizes are malleable to the context of the decision</figcaption></figure><p>Seen this way, team models are not an implementation detail, but a core part of the decision-making architecture. Without the right mix of teams — and the ability for them to change as conditions change — even well-designed missions will struggle to move from exploration to impact.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The world is not a machine where, if you pull a policy lever, something will happen. Reconnecting policymaking with this reality means moving beyond top-down, disconnected approaches and towards a decision-making architecture that treats uncertainty as something to be worked with, not engineered away. One that embeds learning, judgement, and adaptation into how direction is set — without sacrificing the stability the state depends on. What’s required is <em>strength without weight.</em> The ability to do the hard things well, while remaining flexible enough to change when conditions demand it.</p><p>I want to be clear about what this piece is — and is not. It’s not a story of pessimism, nor a claim that the government lacks innovation or intent. Quite the opposite. There is a great deal of thoughtful, committed work happening across UK government and beyond (See:<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/pa/article/77/4/837/7729221?login=false""> The state of British policymaking: How can UK government become more effective</a>). This is an attempt to frame those efforts — through theory and lived experience — in a way that surfaces a deeper constraint: not ambition or capability, but the architectures through which decisions are made.</p><p>This article is not <em>the</em> answer either. The critique, and the model that follows it, could easily be read as two-dimensional: one person diagnosing a system and proposing a cleaner alternative. That reading misses the point. The issue is not a shortage of models for change. It’s that institutions <a href=""https://demos.co.uk/research/the-human-handbrake-how-whitehall-culture-holds-back-public-service-reform/"">— Whitehall included</a> — often convince themselves they are uniquely resistant to new ways of doing, while continuing to route uncertainty through systems designed to suppress it.</p><p>This is as much a cultural challenge as a structural one. Work on systems change reminds us that transformation rarely follows linear cause-and-effect pathways. It emerges through overlapping activity, partial learning and shifting coalitions over time. For those of us working inside the government, that means holding multiple perspectives at once: staying curious, working across boundaries, and treating thinking itself as a form of action — something that shapes what becomes possible next.</p><p>Much of what I’ve drawn on here builds on existing ground: the early work of Government Digital Service, mission-oriented innovation frameworks, action-based approaches to social change, and emerging practices around Human Learning Systems and other relational practices. The open questions, for me, are less about invention than application. How do these principles actually reshape decision-making at scale? What role does digital play — not as infrastructure alone, but as an enabler of learning, coordination and judgement? Have we laid the horizontal foundations for a third era of digital governance, or are we still struggling to move beyond enterprise-era assumptions?</p><p>Those are questions for another time.</p><h3>Next steps…</h3><p>As with most of my writing on substack, this is thinking-as-writing rather than a finished argument. It’s an attempt to synthesise lived experience wrestle with the ideas and practices I’ve been immersed in over the past few years, to see whether they hold together. It’s written as self-provocations, loose ends, tensions and partial conclusions — that’s part of the point for me.</p><p>For now though, this thinking is feeding directly into my own work at HM Revenue &amp; Customs where I’m currently leading a review of our internal <em>Budget Policy Starter</em> technology-impacting process by working with policymakers, solution architects, cost engineers and user-centred designers to better bridge stable and agile ways of working — and, in doing so, improve how policy decisions are shaped upstream so they serve citizens more effectively downstream.</p><p><em>This post is part of </em><a href=""https://civicworks.substack.com/""><em>CIVICWORKS</em></a><em>; a publication on (re)thinking civic bureaucracy, institutional reform, dynamic capabilities, policymaking and technology.</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d81fadb93106"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/beyond-the-waterfall-state-why-missions-need-a-different-decision-making-architecture-d81fadb93106"">Beyond the waterfall state: why missions need a different decision-making architecture</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
