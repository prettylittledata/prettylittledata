What if culture is not simply echoed in design, but shaped by it? What if the sterile and hollow interfaces we produce today are not passive reflections of nihilism, but active producers of it?</p><p>This idea has deep philosophical roots. <a href=""https://www.wilde-online.info/the-decay-of-lying-page15.html"">Oscar Wilde once argued that life imitates art</a> far more than art imitates life. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-aesthetics/"">Friedrich Nietzsche believed that aesthetics precede truth,</a> that existence itself is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon. <a href=""https://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/mcluhan.mediummessage.pdf"">Marshall McLuhan declared that the medium is the message,</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/baudrillard/"">Jean Baudrillard pushed it further</a>, claiming that signs and images no longer reflect reality but generate it.</p><p>If this is true, the pattern is unmistakable—design doesn’t just record meaning, it scripts it. And once design withers, culture follows close behind.</p><h4>From story to feed</h4><p>Cultural forms once carried narrative. Cathedrals told stories in stone and glass. Novels and films offered beginnings, middles, and ends that gave coherence to life. Even broadcast television moved within familiar arcs.</p><figure><img alt=""Panoramic view of Paris at sunset, highlighting the golden dome of Les Invalides and the modern Montparnasse Tower amidst historic architecture.

Much can be said about the bland architecture of our cities and the thinning narratives of contemporary movies and novels, but one of the most concerning shifts has been in the evolution of streaming television.</p><p>Television experiences that once delivered episodes with self-contained stories now lean heavily on season-long arcs—<a href=""https://medium.com/a-suburban-prison/why-are-tv-shows-canceled-9b95db46a4a4""> arcs that may never conclude if the series is canceled</a>. Stories hang suspended, deferred, or abandoned, and audiences grow accustomed to living with open loops, each pause just another cue to crave the next dopamine hit that never truly satisfies.</p><p>Nowhere are open loops more pervasive than the internet, especially social media. Here, design has abandoned narrative architecture altogether. Scroll-based feeds deliver hours of endless, unresolved experience. Search itself has become infinite — every query spawning new links, new threads, new rabbit holes without finality. These systems do not merely reflect shortened attention spans—they train us into them.</p><p>What’s lost in this shift is the <a href=""https://medium.com/digital-media-society-spring-2020/the-impact-that-streaming-sites-have-on-society-ef45c37f2efe"">collective experience</a>. Once, cultural scarcity bound people together — shared stories, shared rituals, shared meanings that culminated. Meaning deepened because it was finite, because it felt resolved. Now we chase a superficial sense of significance in the infinite. But infinity never resolves. It offers no closure, only the perpetual lure of what lies just beyond.</p><h4>The myth of neutrality</h4><p>Minimalism and modernism complicate the story further. These movements, and their descendants in today’s flat digital interfaces, often parade as neutral. The grid, the sans serif, the clean white background — all claim to transcend culture, to present the universal. But neutrality is a myth. Every omission is a worldview.</p><p>By removing ornament, context, and symbol, design does not simply clear space for function — it establishes an aesthetic where emptiness itself becomes a virtue. This virtue is not neutral—it is rooted in Western Enlightenment ideals of rationality and order. A stripped-down interface tells us that depth is clutter, that meaning is noise, that efficiency is the highest good.</p><p>This unraveling of layered meaning now reaches even long-form writing. Articles like this, which should invite reflection, are met with readers possessed by the demand for expediency — brevity, punch, imagery. Platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) have trained us to crave immediacy over depth. Pictures replace paragraphs, glances replace grasp, and culture learns to settle for surfaces.</p><h4>Reason without conviction</h4><p>What makes this drift even more insidious is the way design has cloaked itself in the language of reason. Research, usability testing, and A/B experiments all serve as proof that design is objective. Yet philosophy has long shown that reason cannot prove itself.</p><p>As <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/"">Immanual Kant</a> observed, reason always bumps against the limits of what it can justify. <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/"">David Hume</a> warned that no amount of empirical observation can bridge the gap from “is” to “ought.” <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/"">Kurt Gödel</a> demonstrated that even mathematics, the purest structure of reason, contains truths that cannot be proven within its own system. And <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/"">Nietzsche</a> reminded us that what we take as “truth” often conceals underlying values and power.</p><p>When design insists that data is its foundation, it forgets that even data rests on faith — in our senses, our instruments, and our frameworks. What presents itself as objectivity quickly slides into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/"">relativism</a>, guided not by conviction but by whichever metric performs best in an experiment. Meaning evaporates in the process. Usability without story, efficiency without soul — these become the hallmarks of design that has abandoned belief in meaning itself.</p><figure><img alt=""Cartoon of two men analyzing a dashboard with charts.

The danger is not simply their hollowness, but the way they train us to accept hollowness as normal.</p><p>Worse, their conversational mimicry — the illusion of a voice that “understands” — <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/building-trust-in-opaque-systems-ce38cef741b6"">creates trust where none is warranted</a>. We begin to trust the simulation of meaning rather than meaning itself.</p><p>When design can be generated in seconds, we learn to value speed over depth, convenience over conviction. The more we consume forms without substance, the more we adapt to their vacancy.</p><p>AI doesn’t just produce empty surfaces — it trains us to stop expecting meaning at all. And that quiet erosion of expectation is what makes it an accelerant of nihilism.</p><h4>Design as an engine of nihilism</h4><p>In contemporary design the inversion becomes clear. It doesn’t merely display nihilism — it drives it. Infinite feeds manufacture distraction. Minimalist sameness recasts emptiness as elegance. AI systems hint at human replaceability and then condition us to accept it.</p><p>Today’s interfaces aren’t passive reflections of culture. They script the way we see, think, and value. In their hollow repetitions they embed a lesson— nothing lasts, everything is disposable, and meaning is irrelevant.</p><p>Once these forms take hold, culture completes the circuit. Users absorb the cues and stop expecting depth. The less story, symbolism, or conviction design provides, the more indulgent such elements appear when they do surface.</p><p>The loop accelerates until the pursuit of meaning seems archaic. Emptiness is marketed as efficiency, even clarity. And here lies the danger—nihilism does not remain an abstract idea but becomes a lived condition.</p><p>At that point design doesn’t follow culture — it steers it, training us not only to live without meaning but to stop wanting it. That is how nihilism, once a philosophical diagnosis, becomes the default atmosphere of everyday life. And sadly, we are in the midst of such decay.</p><h4>Toward a design of meaning</h4><p>If this diagnosis is right, then design carries more responsibility than we often admit. It is not neutral. It is not merely reactive. It is formative. Which means that if design has played a role in producing nihilism, it can also play a role in resisting it.</p><p>The challenge is not to restore some lost objectivity — that foundation never existed. The challenge is to create values where none are given. Nietzsche saw this as the only way through nihilism — to become creators of meaning rather than its mourners.</p><p><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/"">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, too, understood that escaping despair required more than reason—it demanded a leap of faith, an act of commitment that could not be justified in advance.</p><p>For design, that means reintroducing narrative into interfaces, reclaiming symbolism, and insisting that even in a secular and fragmented modern society, design can be an act of conviction rather than resignation. Meaning doesn’t emerge from an infinite feed of possibilities but from forms that resolve, gestures that culminate, and experiences that cohere.</p><p>Some designs already gesture in this direction. <a href=""https://duolingo-papers.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/Duolingo_whitepaper_duolingo_method_2023.pdf"">Duolingo, for example, transforms small units of repetition into a narrative of progress</a> — each lesson resolves, each milestone carries symbolic weight. It shows that interfaces need not be hollow loops of engagement, but can script arcs of meaning that accumulate over time.</p><figure><img alt=""“Left side: An orange flame and ‘5 day streak’ indicate practice consistency.

Every decision is ethical labyrinth. Every omission shapes culture. Every interface is an argument about how meaning works. If our designs are hollow, they will train us into hollowness. If they carry conviction, they will cultivate conviction.</p><h4>Choosing meaning</h4><p>We like to say design reflects culture, but that’s only half the truth. Culture also reflects design. And the interfaces we are building today don’t just echo nihilism — they embed it, normalize it, and accelerate it. The real question isn’t whether design has agency, but whether designers are willing to own the meanings they create — or the voids they leave behind.</p><p>Part of the work is rhetorical. Designers can <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/rhetorical-triangle/"">learn to reframe meaning</a> as a kind of metric in itself — arguing that coherence builds retention, that conviction breeds loyalty. If the industry only speaks numbers, then one task is to translate values into that language without losing the values themselves.</p><p>If we refuse that responsibility, our interfaces will go on teaching the same lesson, swipe after swipe—that meaning itself is negotiable, optional, disposable. And the more we live inside those lessons, the more we risk losing the very capacity to imagine life beyond the abyss.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4b8617293462"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/contemporary-design-doesnt-just-reflect-nihilism-it-creates-it-4b8617293462"">Contemporary design doesn’t just reflect nihilism, it creates it.</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

In that talk, Fabricant revealed a simple yet powerful insight:</p><blockquote><strong>as designers, what we work with is behavior, shaping it, understanding it, and ultimately impacting lives.</strong></blockquote><p>His words have stayed with me over the years, guiding my journey as a designer and researcher in the fields of HCI and Interaction Design.</p><p>Time has passed. I’ve worked across various companies and projects, yet Fabricant’s phrase, <strong><em>“Behavior is our medium,”</em></strong> resonates now more than ever. Too often, those of us in design are consumed by efficiency metrics, conversions, and growth. You know the acronyms well: CAC, NPS, CSAT, LTV, ARPA, WAU, MAU, the endless race of numbers. It’s easy to get lost designing for what drives revenue or satisfies stakeholders. I understand; this is the reality of capitalism. I don’t view design purely from a ‘romantic’ perspective.</p><p>I believe good design must generate value and revenue, both for people and for the company. But that’s not the point I want to focus on in this article. Stay with me as we explore something deeper.</p><h3>Behavior change</h3><p>Behavior change, or <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">behavior modification (Bandura, 1970)</a>, is a branch of behavioral science that draws on fields such as cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, economics, and other social science disciplines to understand, influence, and alter human actions.</p><p>Defining behavior change is a complex task, as many researchers offer differing definitions. Here, however, I want to propose a different approach: to separate the term “behavior change” into two distinct parts.</p><p>First, we need to clarify what we mean by behavior. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines it as any observable action in response to stimuli, or the way in which something functions.</p><p>The notion of “change,” on the other hand, implies a shift in habits, attitudes, or routines. This definition should help us establish a common ground moving forward.</p><p>Over time, key thinkers such as <a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/operant-conditioning-a2-2794863"">Skinner</a> (1932), <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/Principles_of_Behavior_Modification.html?id=dPRGAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Bandura</a> (1970), <a href=""https://online.yu.edu/wurzweiler/blog/prochaska-and-diclementes-stages-of-change-model-for-social-workers"">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente</a> (1983) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion"">Kahneman &amp; Tversky</a> (1991) <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235413094_NUDGE_Improving_Decisions_About_Health_Wealth_and_Happiness"">Thaler &amp; Sunstein</a> (2009), <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19135907/"">Fjeldsoe</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597820303848"">Duckworth</a> (2016) have shaped the field, highlighting behavior change as a pathway to better outcomes for individuals, society, and the planet.</p><p>Yet, while behavior can be studied objectively, it is inevitably influenced by subjective factors, personal perceptions, internal beliefs, and cultural norms. For instance, changing energy-use habits may depend on how people perceive cost savings (<strong>perception</strong>), why they care about sustainability (<strong>belief</strong>), and the cultural value placed on nature (<strong>context</strong>).</p><p>In HCI/IxD, even if it is not always explicitly acknowledged by practitioners, behavior is central to the user experience. We cannot discuss UX without addressing user behavior. When we design the UI or the information architecture of a digital product, we are inherently shaping behavior.</p><p>Although rooted in longstanding theory, behavior change in HCI and IxD is a relatively recent focus, especially when we consider that the commercial internet only began in the late 1990s, followed by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble"">the dot-com boom</a> of the early 2000s. The application of behavior change in digital products remains an emerging area. As <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603497"">Rapp et al.</a> (2023) point out, it is only in recent years that design has begun to seriously explore how technology can drive behavioral shifts, spurred by digital advances and a growing recognition of human factors in design.</p><p>Today, designers frequently employ behavior change techniques, evidence-based methods grounded in psychology and social science, as key components in interventions aimed at shaping user behavior. Yet, many of these efforts fail to produce meaningful or lasting change.</p><p>For instance, the use of game elements such as leaderboards, stars, points, and visual cues may capture users’ attention temporarily, but these techniques often do not sustain long-term engagement or behavioral impact. I don’t want to discourage designers. Rather, I believe we should embrace behavior change as a vital discipline within design.</p><p>Behavior should be treated as a design material, just as technology once became our material. If we use behavior thoughtfully, we can create better products. More than that, I believe there is a broader and more meaningful opportunity before us: to design for behavior. Not to make people addicted to products, but to help them grow as human beings, better parents, citizens, students, and professionals. Because if behavior is our medium, then design is our tool for empowerment.</p><h3><strong>Behavior as design material</strong></h3><p>Merriam-Webster defines material as the elements, constituents, or substances of which something is composed or can be made, or something (such as data) that may be worked into a more finished form.</p><p>In design, materiality refers to the qualities, affordances, and constraints of the substances or media through which designers give form to ideas. Traditionally, this included wood, metal, fabric, or plastic, tangible materials whose properties shape what is possible.</p><p>In HCI/IxD, materiality extends beyond the physical to include computation, code, data, time, and interaction patterns, each carrying its own “material” characteristics. As Wiberg (2017) explains, a material can be anything, physical or immaterial, that designers can shape to facilitate interaction between the user and the system. Similarly, Norby (2011, p. 4) argues that “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289345018_Between_the_tag_and_the_screen_redesigning_short-range_RFID_as_design_material"">for industrial and interaction designers, computational technology may be seen as materials that can be used to shape designs.</a>” Historically, as Wiberg (2017, p. 6) emphasizes, “<a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037518/the-materiality-of-interaction/"">materiality has always been a central concern in interaction design, influencing how interactions are structured and experienced</a>”.</p><p>A design material is any medium that designers manipulate to create form, meaning, and experience. To function as a design material, it should possess qualities that can be explored and appropriated, impose constraints that guide creativity, and enable expression in interaction. Researchers in HCI have argued that computation and interaction themselves are design materials because they actively shape what design outcomes can emerge.</p><p>From this perspective, materiality is a central component for interaction designers. However, beyond computational materials, there is a growing recognition that behavior itself can be considered a design material. Behavior includes both <strong>system behavior — how a digital or physical system acts and responds</strong>, and <strong>user behavior — how people act within or in response to the system. </strong>As <a href=""https://fall14se.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/alan-cooper-robert-reimann-david-cronin-christopher-noessel-about-face_-the-essentials-of-interaction-design-wiley-2014.pdf"">Cooper</a> (2007) emphasized, systems must respond appropriately to user actions, making behavior a cornerstone of design.</p><p>This is where the materiality of behavior reveals its unique complexity. Unlike wood or code, human behavior is inherently unpredictable and contextual. It carries its own agency, is shaped by emotions, and is influenced by several external factors.</p><p>Designing with behavior, therefore, is a dynamic and relational practice: the designer carefully sculpts the system’s behavior with the intention of influencing, guiding, or facilitating certain user actions, while recognizing that the outcome is always a co-creation, a dialogue between the system’s rules and the user’s unpredictable will.</p><p>Behavior has distinct qualities such as timing, rhythm, predictability, and adaptability. It also constrains what is possible, as the way a system behaves defines which actions become meaningful for the user. Moreover, behavior is expressive: a robot moving slowly and smoothly communicates friendliness, whereas abrupt and jerky movement communicates aggression. Unlike static materials, behavior unfolds over time, meaning designers sculpt temporal patterns as deliberately as physical form.</p><p>A practical example of this dynamic is Duolingo’s “streak.” The designed system behaves as a visual counter that increments daily and resets to zero if a lesson is missed, directly seeking to shape user behavior by fostering a daily learning habit. This visual cue leverages psychological principles such as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176524000399"">loss aversion</a> and the satisfaction of maintaining progress to promote consistency. It exemplifies behavior as a material: the designer is intentionally shaping the properties of human motivation to “sculpt” a desired routine.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the goal-setting calendar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lyeIALmaRQZ8SKyX.gif"" /><figcaption>Streak Goal-Setting Calendar. Source: <a href=""https://dribbble.com/alisale"">Alisa Le</a></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, interaction design is less about static objects and more about how things and people behave toward one another. In this sense, behavior is not a byproduct but the very substance of interaction design. It is a design material because it carries properties, constraints, and expressive potential that designers can intentionally shape, just like wood, metal, or code.</p><h3>The focus should remain on Human</h3><p>Design, technology, and computing are ultimately about people. Design is created by people, for people, and with people, not the other way around. Yet so much of what we build today fails to support what truly matters to individuals. <strong>Why, in an age of intelligent systems and smart computing, are we still primarily designing for task completion and efficiency?</strong> <strong>Why is interaction design so often stuck in a mindset of consumption?</strong></p><p>We should be designing for transformation to make interactions between people and technology smoother, more meaningful, and more human. This could mean creating systems that foster deep focus instead of constant interruption, that support memory augmentation rather than replacement, or that facilitate genuine connection.</p><blockquote>Technology should not be a cage. It should be a set of wings.</blockquote><p>Instead, we too often create systems that trap users in loops of distraction and consumption. Look around: technology has made us faster and more efficient, yes. But it has also made many of us more anxious, disconnected, and dependent. For countless users, hours are lost to social media feeds instead of invested in rich, real-world interaction. We are outsourcing cognition, offloading memory, letting machines think for us. That is not an empowering future; it is a cage.</p><p>As designers, our focus must remain on humans. We carry the responsibility to design for both human needs and business needs, balancing them while always grounding our work in human well-being as a non-negotiable foundation.</p><p>As interaction designers, we have a responsibility to use technology to empower, not to confine. And yet, look at us now: we are becoming trapped, uncertain, drifting. The algorithm is leading; we have forgotten that it is we who must define how the algorithm interacts with humans, not the other way around.</p><h3>Designing for behavior change</h3><p>Although there is a wide range of techniques and methods available for designing behavior change, many designers still lack the skills to apply them effectively. First, when approaching behavioral science in design, or behavior design, designers often encounter significant challenges. For some, behavior change feels “too scientific,” requiring a foundation of knowledge they may not yet possess. Moreover, behavior itself is complex, making it difficult to translate theory into practice.</p><p>Second, many designers rely heavily on pre-defined tools such as cognitive biases or behavior design pattern libraries, but struggle to develop their own understanding or creative approach to behavior change. Finally, despite the existence of influential models such as the <a href=""https://behaviordesign.stanford.edu/resources/fogg-behavior-model"">Fogg Behavior Model</a>, the <a href=""https://www.prodpad.com/glossary/hook-model/"">Hook Model</a>, and the <a href=""https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/organizational-behavior/the-com-b-model-for-behavior-change"">COM-B Model</a>, the field still lacks well-defined heuristics and design techniques that can be consistently applied in practice. As a result, applying these frameworks in real-world projects remains a major challenge for designers.</p><p>Although designing for behavior change is challenging, when we as designers consciously treat behavior as a design material, we open the door to creating a deeper and more lasting impact on both people and the planet. Designing products and services that guide people toward positive outcomes requires a solid understanding of human behavior.</p><p>As Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 10) point out, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">designing for behavior change is not a new concept; it’s well-rooted in design practice.</a>” Since the late 19th century, and throughout the 20th century, thinkers like <a href=""https://monoskop.org/images/f/f8/Papanek_Victor_Design_for_the_Real_World.pdf"">Papanek</a> (1971) and <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/building-better-world-making-people-smile/"">McDonough</a> (2002) have explored how design can influence human choices and actions.</p><p>More recently, this conversation has expanded into the domain of interaction design, where scholars such as <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/764008.763957"">Fogg</a> (2001), <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=908493"">Lockton</a> (2005), <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222616442_Design_for_sustainable_behaviour_strategies_and_perceptions"">Lilley</a> (2009), and <a href=""https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">Niedderer et al.</a> (2018) have advanced the field by exploring how digital products can be intentionally crafted to shape user behavior in meaningful ways.</p><p>Traditionally, design was closely associated with the creation of physical objects or visual communication. From a linguistic perspective, the verb <strong><em>to design</em></strong> implies crafting something with purpose and intention. As McDonough (1992) stated, <a href=""https://mcdonough.com/writings/the-hannover-principles/"">design is the first signal of human intention.</a> <a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f"">Every product we encounter in the world carries with it the intentions, whether conscious or not, of the designer or team that created it (Nzongo, 2022).</a></p><p>As a practitioner, I see design as a powerful and flexible tool that can be approached from multiple angles to support and influence behavior change through thoughtfully crafted products and experiences. Design isn’t just about form or function; it’s about shaping interactions, decisions, and ultimately, outcomes.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 11) capture this well when they state, “<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319329313_Design_for_Behaviour_Change_Theories_and_Practices_of_Designing_for_Change"">The capacity of a designer lies in creating change through design by transforming the existing situation into a preferred one.</a>” In this sense, design becomes a form of intentional intervention, an opportunity to shift the current state of things toward something better, whether that means encouraging more sustainable habits, improving well-being, or supporting meaningful social change.</p><blockquote>Design for behavior change represents the next frontier in design.</blockquote><p>We must adopt a broader perspective, as Norman (1984) did when connecting design to behavior, emphasizing that artifacts are created to facilitate actions through their physical, symbolic, or social functions. From this viewpoint, design inherently drives transformation, shaping attitudes and behaviors.</p><p>Niedderer et al. (2018, p. 9) highlight this transformative power, arguing that design has shaped modern society and continues to influence behavior in profound ways. Forcato (2015, p. 78) reinforces this perspective, noting that “<a href=""https://www.infodesign.org.br/infodesign/article/view/302"">design has always influenced behavior, whether intentionally or not.</a>”</p><p>Designing for behavior change isn’t just an idealistic goal; it’s a necessity. As Fabricant points out, behavior is our medium, and we should be using it to empower individuals and transform our communities. <strong>If behavior is the medium, then design is the tool for shaping it.</strong> <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.destud.2016.10.001"">By applying behavior change techniques and social theory</a>, we have the potential to design digital products that go far beyond surface-level aesthetics. I truly believe we can and should create tools that support deeper, more meaningful change.</p><h3>Designing for fitness habits</h3><p>In this project, I applied principles from social psychology and behavioral science to design a fitness app focused on fostering long-term well-being, not just logging workouts. The goal was to create a system that supports intrinsic motivation and sustainable habit formation.</p><p>The design leverages two interconnected features: progressive self-monitoring and a meaningful achievements system, grounded in a cohesive theoretical framework.</p><h4>Fostering intrinsic motivation through self-monitoring and identity</h4><p>At the core of the design lies the principle of self-monitoring, a key technique in the <a href=""https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol24/iss1/28/"">persuasive systems design</a> (PSD) model. The app enables users to track their performance and compare progress against personal goals.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a training monitoring app interface featuring a progress chart, performance metrics, goal indicators, and an avatar that allows users to visualize their body evolution over time."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oGoPJTBntiwJVefS3vsk4w.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This continuous feedback loop is crucial for sustaining motivation. According to <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), such feedback fosters positive emotions like satisfaction and pride as users observe their own improvement, directly strengthening their sense of competence, a fundamental pillar of intrinsic motivation.</p><p>To strengthen this connection, the app incorporates a 3D avatar as a virtual representation of the user. This feature leverages the <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15554120231202175"">proteus effect</a>, a psychological phenomenon in which individuals unconsciously begin to align their behavior with the identity of their avatar. This “imagined self” acts as a powerful, internalized motivator, reinforcing commitment by allowing users to visualize their future, healthier selves.</p><h4>Reinforcing progress with a theory-driven reward system</h4><p>The motivation generated through self-monitoring is further reinforced by a carefully designed achievements system. While badges act as external rewards, their true power lies in their ability to validate effort and signify mastery. This aligns with <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/254999"">expectancy theory</a> (Behling &amp; Starke, 1973), which suggests that motivation is driven by the belief that effort leads to success — badges make this “success” tangible.</p><p>Additionally, the system operates on the principles of <a href=""https://www.potentialunearthed.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reinforcement-Theory.pdf"">positive reinforcement</a> (Skinner, 1938), where desirable behaviors, such as consistent training, are followed by a rewarding outcome. The ultimate aim, however, is to guide users from external reinforcement toward internal satisfaction. By visualizing achievements, the system strengthens the user’s sense of competence, thereby continuing to support the intrinsic motivation emphasized in <a href=""https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf"">self-determination theory</a> (SDT).</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows the training app interface where users can view the badges they have earned during workouts, which they can share on social media."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DKSW8fYpWVwadh2PMB7soQ.png"" /><figcaption>Designed by: Filipe Nzongo (2024)</figcaption></figure><p>This project exemplifies how interaction designers can move beyond surface-level aesthetics to create products that facilitate meaningful, positive change.

This approach is becoming outdated. It’s time to look toward a new horizon and embrace behavior as a design material.</p><p>As intelligent systems (AI) become increasingly prevalent, understanding human behavior is no longer optional; it is essential. Our responsibility as practitioners grows: we are not only shaping how these systems behave, but also influencing the behaviors humans develop when interacting with them. As designers, we must acknowledge this impact.</p><p>Every screen, every system, and every micro-interaction represents an opportunity to shape behavior. In essence, we are already designing behavior. The critical question, then, is not whether we influence behavior, but what kind of behavior we are enabling and with what intention.</p><p>Designing for behavior change is not about control; it is about care. It requires using our tools, research, empathy, theory, and craft to act responsibly and intentionally. As we move further into an age of AI and autonomous systems, the choices we make today will shape the habits, values, and actions of tomorrow.</p><p>Let’s choose to design for good. Let’s choose to design for change. Because when we design for behavior, we’re not just designing experiences — we’re shaping futures.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6d143562c909"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/behavior-is-our-medium-6d143562c909"">Behavior is our medium</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",

<h4>What I learned about AI in design-dev collaboration through hands-on experiments and a 3-month thesis project, and why it led me to DesignOps.</h4><figure><img alt=""A seated woman, viewed from behind, working at a desk with multiple screens"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*H3j5Ozk4BOTHFd6ca_D9JA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>As the only designer on the team, seeing my developer colleagues deliver quickly thanks to AI made me consider ways to adapt. However, my thesis research led me in a different direction… <em>Credit: Unsplash.</em></figcaption></figure><p>“UX is dead.”</p><p>As a UX designer with a background in front-end development, I was struck by this phrase that kept popping up on LinkedIn. It also worried me a little for my future. But who exactly had killed UX?</p><p>The culprit seemed obvious: generative AI. Developers were embracing it faster than designers (or so <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7328018930592034816/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7328018930592034816%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29"">I read</a>). I realised that I used AI a lot when I was coding but barely touched it in my design work. Meanwhile, my developer colleague, an AI power user, was releasing features faster than ever.</p><p>This observation led me to a question that became the starting point of my thesis at <em>Les Gobelins Paris</em>: <strong>How could I, as the only designer on my team, keep pace and stay relevant in this changing environment?</strong></p><h3>The research that changed my mind</h3><p>I spent three months, from June to August 2025, actively investigating this question through my thesis. Many resources have shaped my understanding of AI and collaboration, from books such as <a href=""https://www.thedesignconductors.com/"">The Design Conductors</a> to articles like <a href=""https://blog.prototypr.io/dev-designer-collaboration-framework-bdef12799513"">Dev-Design Collaboration Framework</a> or <a href=""https://medium.com/%40INI8labs/how-ai-tools-are-bridging-the-gap-between-product-thinking-and-frontend-code-059896c8c858"">How AI Tools Are Bridging the Gap Between Product Thinking and Frontend Code</a>.</p><p>Building on these foundations, my approach was deliberately comprehensive. For internal research at my company, I conducted AI experiments, tried various tools, and led three field tests at three crucial collaboration stages: scoping, prototyping and handoff. For external validation, I ran an online survey to which 28 designers answered, and conducted 6 interviews with designers and developers.</p><p>But the results surprised me. I expected to confirm my fears, developers racing ahead while designers fell behind. However, this observation wasn’t validated. That’s when I thought: <strong>Do designers really need to be faster and more productive?</strong></p><p>I understood that before finding ways to adapt, I needed to understand what AI really had changed between designers and developers. I refined my angle to a more relevant one: <strong>How is generative AI reshaping collaboration between designers and developers, from the scoping phase to the handoff?</strong></p><p>This reflection ultimately led me to view AI less as an isolated tool and more as an organizational topic (DesignOps).</p><h3>What I discovered</h3><p>Allow me to introduce the three members of the ‘product trio’ that will assist me in presenting my results:</p><ul><li>Marie, a passionate designer who is curious about AI</li><li>Tony, an astute developer who’s also an absolute fan of AI</li><li>John, Product Manager, who loves collaborating with his team</li></ul><h3>1. AI makes individuals faster, not teams better</h3><p>Marie represents 77% of designers using AI in my survey who reported speed gains since adopting it. She uses ChatGPT for interview guides and Figma Make for rapid prototyping. In one test, I reduced my prototyping time from two days to two hours using AI.</p><figure><img alt=""A graph showing the survey percentages of answers to How AI has changed Work Pratices"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V38YLBlYyWPu4kk0OKuJcg.png"" /><figcaption>Credit: Anna Lefour, with ClaudeAI.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What I found interesting:</strong> Marie’s relationship with Tony didn’t change at all. Both my data and interviews confirmed this pattern. AI frees up individual time, but teams rarely reinvest those savings into better collaboration. It’s rather used to focus on tasks that are seen as more valuable, like understanding users’ needs or developing strategic thinking.</p><h3>2. AI augments rather than replaces (for now)</h3><p>When Marie tried AI prototyping, she hit walls quickly. The tool sometimes ignored parts of her design system, created visual inconsistencies, and missed her design intentions. Tony experienced similar frustrations with AI-generated code that was more difficult to understand and failed to meet the company’s or his own quality standards.</p><p>In my handoff experiment, I tested how a developer approached a traditional Figma file versus one created with Figma MCP + Cursor. The developer I worked with found the traditional approach clearer and easier to interpret.</p><p><strong>What became clear</strong>, though, was AI’s potential as a thinking partner. For the scoping phase, I conducted a “synthetic developer” test (an idea based on the <a href=""https://medium.com/@lwowa.creator/synthetic-users-a-tool-for-progress-or-a-step-too-far-2db4e95ebb4c"">synthetic user</a> experimentations), using ChatGPT to simulate developer feedback during scoping sessions. While it couldn’t match my real colleagues’ depth, it helped me prepare better questions and spot blind spots I’d missed.</p><figure><img alt=""A persona description in french that has been used in the writers’ synthetic dev test"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9KjqsGBGoFuUbT1E9LIkew.png"" /><figcaption><em>My ‘synthetic developer’ persona was called Tim and was created to simulate developer feedback during the scoping process. I asked ChatGPT to embody Tim. I created a persona that matched the expertise level of the real developers. </em>Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><p>John, our PM, found similar value in AI prototyping. Even imperfect prototypes helped our ‘product trio’ to iterate and align more quickly, as well as develop a shared language around complex ideas.</p><h3>3. Adoption is prevalent, but lacks strategy</h3><p>Marie isn’t unique. Only 2 of 28 survey respondents said they don’t use AI at all. But adoption is happening in an exploratory phase mostly without global strategy:</p><ul><li>Some designers <strong>feel pressured to use tools</strong> that clash with their values</li></ul><blockquote>“I’d say it’s more pressure. I’ve been a bit resistant to AI because I don’t find that the efficiency outweighs the environmental cost at the end of the day. But I’m slowly changing my mind and I’m trying to use it for very specific things.” <br /><em>— 7th participant to user interviews (Product Designer)</em></blockquote><ul><li>Others received <strong>conflicting instructions on how to use AI</strong>, with designers being banned from using it and developers being encouraged to use it, and vice versa</li><li>Others describe frequent discussions about AI and tools, but <strong>no capitalisation on what was learnt</strong> through individual experimentation</li></ul><p>Companies are aware this is a key issue but <strong>implement solutions piecemeal. </strong>The result is fragmented practices, missed learning opportunities, and unequal access across teams.</p><h3>A different perspective on change</h3><p>What struck me most during this research is that <strong>AI isn’t fundamentally changing collaboration: it makes existing collaborative fundamentals even more crucial.</strong></p><p>Good collaborators can leverage AI more effectively. Teams with poor communication don’t magically improve just because they can prototype faster. Establishing frameworks that make designer-developer partnerships work becomes more important, not obsolete. The framework designed by Alicia Calderón González (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0BJAf0b3OY&amp;t=167s"">communication, collaboration, alignment</a>), Lead Design Strategist at Miyagami, which I discovered later in my research, seems even more relevant today.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration describing the three main steps in Alicia Calderòns’ collaboration framework: communication, collaboration, alignment"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wjvC7HN0A86u21zO06n9fA.png"" /><figcaption>The ‘Unlocking Collaboration’ framework created by Alicia Calderón González is even more relevant today.

You’ll find under some examples. The key insight: we need to evolve from individual AI adoption to team-wide transformation.</p><p><strong>Governance:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Audit existing employee practices</strong>: Individual practices have already evolved to include AI, but in silos. Understanding current usage patterns helps identify where AI has already penetrated processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Process:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Create an AI usage charter</strong>: A shared framework helps align practices between designers, developers, and across the entire company.</li><li><strong>Establish guided experimentation</strong>: Create sandbox environments for testing AI in collaboration without impacting critical deliverables. Tools that bridge both professions offer particularly interesting opportunities for joint designer-developer experiments.</li></ul><p><strong>Operational Support:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Invest in shared training</strong>: Provide designers and developers with common foundations in prompting, technical basics, and chosen tools to create shared language and collective skill development.</li><li><strong>Enable effective documentation</strong>: Document what works and what doesn’t to define and evolve AI workflows based on experimental results.</li></ul><p>Bear in mind that AI is still in the exploratory stage and prone to instability. My goal here is not to offer an absolute framework of how things should be, but rather to provide actionable recommendations that will help to move beyond individual or silo adoption. The aim is to use AI to facilitate collaboration.</p><figure><img alt=""An illustration of collaboration with AI, with a robot head on top connected to a woman and two men by lines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/999/1*oVACV_9xaKCe4kuePkgMjQ.png"" /><figcaption>My recommendations aim to encourage the adoption of AI across different departments and establish shared practices between designers like Marie, developers like Tony, and product managers like John. Credit: Anna Lefour.</figcaption></figure><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>This research had its limitations (small survey sample, context-specific tests, timing constraints), but comparing my findings with larger studies like <a href=""https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/reports/designer-developer-trends/"">Figma’s State of the Designer 2025</a> revealed consistent patterns across different contexts.</p><p>What I’ve observed is that teams are currently in an exploratory phase with AI, often lacking strategic coordination. <strong>The teams that will benefit most aren’t necessarily those who adopt AI fastest, but those who think most carefully about how it fits into their collaborative practices</strong>.</p><p>AI won’t replace design or development roles, but it is creating new opportunities for teams willing to experiment thoughtfully with how they work together.</p><p><strong>What’s your experience with AI in product teams? Have you seen it improve or complicate collaboration?</strong></p><p><em>Many thanks to all who contributed their time and insights to this research.

<h4>What Genie taught us about customer-centric innovation — and how those lessons still shape great products today</h4><figure><img alt=""Two early mobile phones, Nortel Orbitor and Nokia 7110, displayed on either side of a white Genie Internet mug, symbolising the pioneering era of mobile internet innovation in the late 1990s."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JTf1Dgh1CU79G8F3Bm4-ow.png"" /><figcaption>The tools of a mobile revolution — early handsets and the original Genie Internet brand that helped shape the first era of mobile experiences.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Long before apps and app stores, this is how a small team out-paced global giants to design one of the world’s first mobile internet portals — and shape the future of connected experiences.</em></p><p>In the late 1990s, the global giants of tech and telco bet billions on mobile internet architecture. We anchored ourselves to a single principle: that the future of the internet would be <em>personal, mobile, and woven into every moment</em>. This is the story of how our small team, Genie, out-paced those giants with $100 million less — by starting with the experience, not the platform. And crucially, we weren’t just thinking differently — we were moving faster.</p><p>Even more remarkable, Genie’s first public alpha launched as early as 1997, more than three years before Vodafone and Vivendi unveiled Vizzavi in June 2000. When it came to WAP — the technology that made mobile web experiences possible — Genie’s services went live in January 2000, a full six months before Vodafone entered the market. By the point Vizzavi was preparing for launch, Genie already had 900,000 registered users. While much of the industry was still debating what “mobile internet” meant, BT Cellnet had already shipped a working prototype — so innovative that <em>The Guardian</em> noted that “BT Cellnet has been an innovator and launched the mobile [WAP] version of its Genie web portal in January.” That early advantage — measured in years, not months — shaped how we approached every decision that followed.</p><p>This core conviction led to the creation of Genie, one of the UK’s first mobile internet portals. It also set us directly against the largest corporate forces in Europe. While incumbent telco giants spent hundreds of millions trying to force massive, integrated platforms onto the market — such as the Vodafone/Vivendi Vizzavi joint venture — our small team had to achieve more with roughly 1/20th of the capital.</p><p>This case study compares those two radically different innovation strategies: the Architecture-first approach of the incumbent and our Experience-first approach. It is a story about how sequencing — starting with the customer experience and working backwards to the technology — transformed an idea into market impact, and why those same lessons still define the gap between product failure and breakthrough success today.</p><h3>When the internet learned to move</h3><p>Having worked on some of the world’s earliest smartphone prototypes at BT Cellnet — including Nortel’s pioneering Orbitor/Europa concept — I went on to co-found Genie, the UK’s first mobile internet portal and one of the first anywhere in the world. I served as head of music, games and entertainment, receiving a BT Recognition Award as a co-founder.</p><p>This is the story of what we built, how we did it, and what it taught us about designing products and services that people genuinely want. It’s also a reflection on the choices that made the difference—the strategic calls, cultural decisions and customer-centred design principles that transformed ideas into impact.</p><p>Most importantly, it’s a story about <em>how strategy really works</em> when technology, experience and organisational change collide, and why those same lessons still matter for startups and product teams today.</p><h3>The set-up: two very different bets on the “mobile internet”</h3><p>This case study compares two radically different approaches to innovation during the first mobile-internet wave — Genie<strong> </strong>(BT Cellnet/BT) and Vizzavi (Vodafone + Vivendi) — and distils what those choices mean for two audiences:</p><ol><li>Early-stage startups searching for product-market fit.</li><li>Large organisations trying to think and ship like startups.</li></ol><p>My aim is to show, with evidence, how decisions around strategy, business-model innovation and value-proposition design can either accelerate ideas into reality, or quietly stop them from ever getting there. This is because in my role today mentoring startups, I still see the same patterns we lived through repeating themselves today.</p><h3>Personal context (1996–1997)</h3><p>I joined BT Cellnet in 1996 as Business Development Manager for smartphones, coming from a user-centred design and customer-experience background inside BT. Even before the word “smartphone” existed, we were already proving how mobile devices could deliver real services, not just calls and texts.</p><figure><img alt=""A BT Cellnet Alcatel mobile phone from the mid-1990s featuring a dedicated “B” button for checking Barclaycard balances, an early example of integrated mobile services before smartphones."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/718/1*6mXcu9NM7BbE6XUG_LVn2A.png"" /><figcaption>A BT Cellnet handset launched in partnership with Barclaycard in the mid-1990s, offering customers 20 % off calls and a dedicated “B” button to check credit card balances — a pioneering example of mobile services before the smartphone era.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was a collaboration with Alcatel and Barclaycard on a handset that offered customers 20 % off their call costs and included a dedicated “B” button to check credit card balances, all powered by over-the-air menu updates (SOAP). The strength of the idea lay in its simplicity, and usability was intentionally built in from the beginning. My role was to help shape the vision into something tangible: defining the user experience, scoping how the service would work, and building the partnerships needed to bring it to life. That experience deeply shaped my thinking when we went on to build Genie, showing how a clear value proposition and seamless experience could change customer behaviour at scale.</p><p>By 1997 we were already building client–server mobile services. BT Cellnet was among the most innovative operators in Europe at the time, and handset manufacturers selected us as their development-partner network, giving our small team hands-on experience with device–service integration long before it was mainstream.</p><p>Even at this early stage, we were exploring bold visions of what a connected, mobile future might look like. As Business Development Manager for smartphones, my role was to identify these emerging opportunities and translate them into real partnerships, prototypes and product concepts.</p><figure><img alt=""A 1995 Nortel concept illustration showing a person holding an early smartphone prototype with a headset device, representing one of the first visions of mobile internet interaction."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*geKCuQShABLh75VFRjlD_w.jpeg"" /><figcaption>A Nortel concept image from 1995 imagining the future of mobile communication — an early vision of the smartphone era that inspired the Orbitor/Europa prototype and informed Genie’s design approac</figcaption></figure><p>That background gave us an edge over Vodafone. We treated design as strategy, embedding user experience, service design and customer insight into product and partnership choices, rather than relying on traditional corporate levers like mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures. This was design thinking in its original sense: putting the customer and the end-to-end experience <em>inside</em> strategy, not simply layering it on top.</p><p>(For context, 1997 was also the year Steve Jobs famously contrasted Java’s “cross-platform” vision with Apple’s integrated approach — a debate that shaped how we thought about platforms and apps.)</p><h3>Experience-first vs. architecture-first</h3><p>Jobs also argued that you must “start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology.” That principle became our north star. We began with the end-to-end experience and the value proposition we wanted to deliver, then built the enabling stack and partnerships around it.</p><p>By contrast, Vodafone and Vivendi started with <strong>a </strong>joint-venture architecture, trying to reconcile brands, organisations, technology and content <em>before</em> they had a clear, validated customer experience. That difference in sequencing shaped everything that followed.</p><p>The contrast in sequencing also reflected a profound difference in risk appetite. Genie’s approach embraced the calculated risk of rapid iteration and low-cost failure — shipping simple services quickly and learning from real user behavior within the constraints of the technology. By contrast, Vizzavi chose the traditional corporate risk: massive capital outlay and structural integration <em>before</em> validating a clear customer value proposition. This structural difference determined not only their speed but their ultimate financial viability.</p><p>Genie’s playbook emphasised shipping services that people could actually use on 2G/WAP; making them network-agnostic to maximise audience; pricing them to encourage exploration rather than meter usage; and iterating fast with content partners. The public record shows key Genie milestones: the UK’s first free-access mobile ISP, the first commercial pre-pay WAP service, and later the UK’s first unmetered 24/7 mobile internet service for £20/month.</p><p>Vizzavi’s playbook, meanwhile, focused on building one pan-European portal and brand, backed by heavy investment and exclusive content. The joint venture ultimately cost hundreds of millions, struggled operationally (including a botched email-platform upgrade), and was folded into Vodafone live! by late 2002, having spent £500 million building the brand.</p><p>The outcomes highlight the failure of the architecture-first approach. Vizzavi focused on consolidating assets and capital, but the platform was never truly designed around solving a fundamental customer job-to-be-done. In contrast, Genie’s success proved that agile execution and genuine customer value beat billions in misaligned capital — a lesson that remains universally true for any startup facing large incumbents.</p><h3>What a mobile internet portal was (and where WAP fits)</h3><p>In the late 1990s, a “portal” meant a curated front door to online services. AOL and CompuServe served as dial-up destinations on PCs — but there was no equivalent on mobile. Genie was created to fill that gap, set up as an Internet Service Provider, a web portal and a suite of mobile information services, initially delivered via SMS to build habitual use before WAP was ready. On handsets, we were starting from scratch: tiny screens, 2G bandwidth, high latency, limited memory and a brand-new software stack.</p><figure><img alt=""Vintage BT Cellnet Pay &amp; Go phone bundle with Genie software CD — an early example of how mobile internet services were distributed before app stores existed."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/730/1*kNvmRpzy-fLK5jXJQOtdNg.png"" /><figcaption>In the pre-app era, Genie distributed its mobile internet software via CDs and bundled services directly with BT Cellnet handsets — transforming phones into a channel for innovation.</figcaption></figure><p>Distribution was equally experimental. Before app stores existed, we shipped our software on physical CDs and partnered with BT Cellnet to bundle services directly through pre-pay phones. Handsets weren’t just devices; they became a channel to market — a way to deliver the mobile internet experience directly into users’ hands.</p><p>Long before software updates were a tap away, distribution was part of the design challenge. By bundling our services with physical devices and using CDs as delivery mechanisms, we weren’t just marketing a product , we were shaping the entire user journey from the moment someone unboxed their phone. It taught us that when the platform doesn’t yet exist, you have to build the ecosystem around it yourself. Designing not just the product, but the pathway it travels is a mindset that still applies today in emerging technologies, from spatial computing to AI-driven services.</p><h4>WAP’s role</h4><p>As part of BT’s delegation, I was a member of the WAP Forum, where we helped define the early standards that made mobile web experiences possible on constrained devices. WAP provided a shared way to render simple pages and trigger actions (like messaging and look-ups) on phones — a pragmatic bridge between the open web and the real-world limitations of mobile hardware.</p><h4>Genie alpha: from web-to-SMS to information services</h4><p>Our first public experiment was a simple Genie alpha site that allowed anyone to register for free and send an SMS from a web page to a mobile device. It was the first such service in the UK, and arguably the first commercial, public web-to-SMS service globally, launched in beta in 1998, before the official Genie Internet launch in March 1999.</p><p>As BBC coverage at the time noted, Genie already had thousands of text-message users before the official launch. Initially, it operated as a BT Cellnet web portal and value-added service. We then layered on basic information services — football scores, weather updates, news headlines — because they aligned with people’s daily habits.</p><h4>Device partnerships shaped the portal</h4><p>The client–server work we had begun with Nortel, Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson fed directly into our service ideas. We weren’t simply publishing WAP pages; we were designing interactions that devices could realistically deliver and aligning with manufacturers’ roadmaps wherever possible.</p><h3>Speed to market mattered</h3><p>Genie launched in beta in 1998, with the official launch in March 1999 — well ahead of Vodafone and Vivendi’s Vizzavi, which wasn’t announced until May 2000. Shipping something simple rather than waiting for perfect gave us a head-start and helped us build an early-adopter base. As the audience grew, major content brands (MTV, EMI, Dotmusic, Ministry of Sound) and gaming partners approached us to develop their first mobile services.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/1c7568ab2485ac932e3afd9b70c41358/href"">https://medium.com/media/1c7568ab2485ac932e3afd9b70c41358/href</a><p>The UK’s first WAP advert, created by BT Cellnet together with Genie, showing how we first introduced the idea of mobile internet to the public in the late 1990s.</p><h3>What we Shipped (and why it mattered)</h3><h4>1. Network-agnostic content (before micropayments)</h4><p>We deliberately made services accessible on any UK network, not just BT Cellnet. That widened our reach and created a powerful acquisition loop: customers who discovered Genie elsewhere often returned to BT Cellnet for better pricing, devices or support. The press at the time explicitly noted that <em>Big Brother</em> mobile services were available across all networks.</p><figure><img alt=""Presentation of Genie’s early mobile internet service for Channel 4 in the late 1990s, with a demonstrator showing how mobile devices could access online content on screen."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ayGXkayw0kkZ3BxX-myooQ.png"" /><figcaption>Demonstration for Channel 4 of Genie’s pioneering mobile internet service in the late 1990s, showing early content services for mobile phones during a product presentation.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Without mature billing rails inside the portal, attention and habit were the currency. Openness grew usage, and usage reduced churn for the host network.</p><h4>2. Pricing that Unlocked Behavior: The Customer R&amp;D Model</h4><p>In November 2000, Genie launched the UK’s first unmetered mobile internet plan at £20 per month — a bold move designed to drive mass adoption and exploration.</p><p>This pricing decision was, in effect, a subsidy for customer research and development. At the time, mobile internet was universally billed on a terrifying per-minute or per-kilobyte basis, which paralyzed users with “fear of the bill” and prevented experimentation. The metered approach actively killed the very behavior we needed to discover.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: People cannot discover what a new medium is <em>for</em> under a metered plan. The flat-rate, “all-you-can-eat” model was a strategic call to remove that financial barrier, letting users experiment, fail, and develop sticky habitswithout punishment. For product builders today, the lesson is simple: your monetization model must encourage the desired user behavior, not restrict it.</p><h4>3. G Live Music — Reimagining How Fans and Artists Connect</h4><p>By the late 1990s, the music industry was waking up to the fact that the internet would radically change how artists reached their audiences, and that mobile could become the most important channel of all. Major labels were already experimenting: Danny van Emden returned to Virgin Records to establish the UK’s first New Media department, ensuring that every artist had an online presence and launching <em>The Raft</em>, one of the earliest label websites. EMI, Virgin’s parent company, quickly followed suit, with Fergal Gara and Eric Winbolt leading a dedicated new media team.</p><p>What they understood, and what many others missed, was that the next generation of fans might never experience the web primarily through a computer. Mobile, not desktop, was going to be the dominant way they discovered, consumed, and interacted with music. That made Genie a natural partner.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/a6c0323b4c475f694d22d7da6c8f06a8/href"">https://medium.com/media/a6c0323b4c475f694d22d7da6c8f06a8/href</a><p><em>At the top of the BT Tower, G Live Music launched with artists like Atomic Kitten on hand — marking a breakthrough moment when record labels, artists and Genie teamed up to connect directly with fans through their phones, long before the era of Twitter and streaming.</em></p><p>BT Retail had already been exploring voice-based services, while Genie was leading the market for SMS. The breakthrough idea was to combine the two into a hybrid experience, G Live Music<strong>, </strong>where EMI could send text alerts to fans that included not only headlines and updates, but also a phone number they could call to hear more.</p><p>To make the service engaging, I designed four distinct channels — <em>Stars</em>, <em>Guitars</em>, <em>Heartbeats</em> and <em>Breakbeats</em> — covering rock, indie, pop and dance music. Virgin hired BBC Radio 1’s Jo Wiley as the voice of the service, and record labels including Virgin, EMI, Chrysalis and Parlophone arranged for the artists themselves to record exclusive personal messages. This was more than a content feed . It was a direct line from band to fan, offering the kind of personalised access that would only become mainstream a decade later with platforms like Twitter.</p><p>G Live Music launched with major publicity at the top of the BT Tower, signalling a new direction for how artists and audiences could connect. It was an early example of how mobile services could go beyond delivering information — they could build <em>relationships</em>, turning devices into channels for authentic, human connection.</p><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Personalisation and proximity are powerful drivers of engagement. When artists’ voices reached fans directly — literally in their pockets — the emotional connection was far stronger than any banner ad or website visit. The project showed that successful mobile experiences are not just about content delivery, but about creating <em>intimacy</em> and <em>community</em> at scale.</p><h4>4. Interactive Formats at Scale — From Big Brother to a Global Games Platform</h4><p>One of the most powerful proofs of Genie’s approach came through our work on interactive entertainment, not just as content, but as a new category of mobile experience.</p><p>The <em>Big Brother: Lifestylers</em> project is often remembered as one of the first large-scale interactive mobile games in Europe, giving users the chance to shape virtual characters and influence outcomes on their phones. But the real story wasn’t the gameplay itself. It was the platform behind it.</p><p>When BT decided not to build a dedicated gaming platform in-house, the consultant I had been working with, Kevin Bradshaw, founded a startup to take the idea forward. That company — Digital Bridges — would go on to become one of the world’s top three mobile multiplayer gaming platforms, powering many of the early titles that defined the mobile games industry in the early 2000s.</p><p>By integrating the Digital Bridges platform into Genie, we were able to scale quickly and support a new wave of interactive formats. <em>Big Brother: Lifestylers</em> alone generated around 2.5 million play-minutes from roughly 60,000 players in just five weeks — a clear sign that people were willing to invest time and attention in mobile experiences when they were designed for the medium. And crucially, the service was available on all UK networks, reflecting Genie’s belief that reach and behaviour-building were more valuable than short-term exclusivity.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Genie’s Big Brother: Lifestylers WAP game, an early mobile entertainment service built on the Digital Bridges platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8vZeuZSCUL31swang_pJig.png"" /></figure><p><em>The Big Brother: Lifestylers WAP game, launched by Genie in partnership with Picofun and Channel 4, showcased the potential of interactive entertainment on mobile and helped accelerate the rise of Digital Bridges, which became one of the world’s leading multiplayer gaming platforms.</em></p><p>This phase of Genie’s evolution wasn’t just about a single hit. It was about building the infrastructure and partnerships that made new kinds of engagement possible. The success of Digital Bridges proved that mobile could support complex, multi-player, interactive formats long before app stores existed, and that those experiences could play a central role in shaping customer habits and expectations.</p><h4>5. Device-level ambition (and why we pulled back): Nortel “Orbitor”</h4><p>We explored integrating Genie-style services into Nortel’s Orbitor — a touchscreen, voice-recognition smartphone concept (1998).</p><figure><img alt=""Close-up of an early Nortel Orbitor smartphone prototype showing a stylus-based interface and contact list, illustrating one of the first Java-powered attempts to combine voice, messaging, touchscreen and internet services on a single mobile device."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oxT6hwXA94-W7B7Efkh6Sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>An early prototype of the Nortel “Orbitor” smartphone concept from the late 1990s — a bold attempt to integrate voice, touchscreen and internet services using Java, years before such functionality became standard.</figcaption></figure><p>The idea was right, but the technology was too early. Public museum records document both the ambition and the limitations of the device.</p><p>Working on Orbitor reinforced a lesson that would guide us throughout Genie’s development: visionary ideas are only as powerful as the technology that enables them. The device itself was remarkable — it combined voice, messaging, touchscreen navigation and over-the-air services, all running on Java long before that was standard in mobile environments. Even though the hardware and networks weren’t yet ready to support such ambitions at scale, the experience we were aiming for became a north star — shaping how we approached service design, interfaces and the broader future of mobile interaction.</p><p><strong>What we learned:</strong> Vision needs timing. A decade later, iPhone-class hardware and OSs finally caught up with the idea.</p><h4>6. GenieMobile — Extending the Portal Beyond the Phone</h4><p>Genie Internet was also one of the earliest examples of what we would now call a virtual mobile operator. It operated entirely digitally, with no physical retail presence, building its brand, acquiring customers and delivering services exclusively online. That approach, radical for its time, allowed us to move quickly, experiment with new propositions and scale without the overhead of traditional mobile infrastructure.</p><p>While Genie was conceived as a mobile-first service, we knew from the start that the experience couldn’t end at the handset. Most users were still accessing the web from desktop computers, and they needed a simple way to manage their accounts, discover services and prepare content before going mobile. That insight led to GenieMobile, a companion desktop application designed to extend the value of the portal far beyond the small screen.</p><figure><img alt=""Promotional advert for GenieMobile showing a free Nokia 3330 mobile internet phone offer from BT Cellnet’s Genie service."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/120/1*RrzXCvEKqksTMk64sufb6Q.gif"" /><figcaption>Promotional campaign for GenieMobile offering a free Nokia 3330 internet-ready handset to new users.</figcaption></figure><p>GenieMobile allowed users to manage and personalise their mobile internet experience before they even picked up their phone. Among its most popular features were:</p><ul><li>SMS alerts, delivering breaking information directly to a user’s handset as it happened.</li><li>Email on WAP, providing free access to services like BT Internet, Talk21, Freeserve and Genie email accounts from anywhere in the UK.</li><li>A personalised WAP menu, letting users select favourites on the Genie website and have them appear automatically on their phone for easier navigation.</li><li>GenieOne, a unified inbox that brought together emails, faxes and voice messages in one place, accessible from either a PC or a mobile device.</li></ul><p>At a time when over-the-air delivery was expensive and limited, GenieMobile acted as a seamless bridge between desktop and handset. It was one of the earliest attempts to synchronise services and preferences across devices, paving the way for the companion app model that would later become standard in the smartphone era.</p><p>GenieMobile’s web-to-handset portal liberated users from the nightmare of GenieMobile’s web-to-handset portal freed users from the hassle of configuring finicky ISP settings on clunky Nokia or Ericsson phones, enabling seamless SMS forwarding and address book management from any browser — a proto-cloud lifeline for professionals juggling work PCs and early mobiles. By cutting setup friction, it doubled daily engagement for power users, cementing loyalty and outpacing rivals stuck in mobile-only complexity. This experience-first innovation, despite primitive network limits, laid groundwork for the cloud era before 3G arrived</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: A great mobile experience doesn’t start on the phone — it starts wherever the user is. GenieMobile showed that extending the journey across devices could deepen engagement and reduce friction, years before companion apps became the norm.</p><h3>Building for a 3G Future — and Inventing the Cloud Before It Had a Name</h3><p>That shift in perception created the foundation for what came next — a move beyond 2G services toward a future shaped by 3G networks, cloud storage, and entirely new kinds of mobile experiences.</p><p>While much of Genie’s early innovation focused on creating compelling services within the limits of 2G — like short-form entertainment, mobile radio, and interactive formats — we were already thinking well beyond those constraints. Inside the team, our discussions and prototypes increasingly centred on what would be possible once 3G networks, Java-enabled devices, and always-on connectivity became the norm.</p><p>The ambition was bold: to create a fully integrated content ecosystem that could support music, games, messaging, ringtones, and even personal media — all underpinned by payment infrastructure, digital rights management (DRM), and a personal digital locker. We wanted people to be able to download content directly to their devices, store it in the cloud (though we didn’t yet use that word), and access it seamlessly across multiple touchpoints: phones, PDAs, and even desktop browsers.</p><p>Central to this vision was the idea of openness and interoperability. The platform would expose APIs that allowed third-party developers and content providers — including early partners like Digital Bridges, mp3.com, Vitaminic and Club Nokia — to plug their services directly into Genie’s ecosystem. This was a radical idea for its time: instead of a closed, operator-controlled platform, Genie aimed to become a value store — a distribution hub where customers could browse, purchase, and manage all their digital experiences from a single interface.</p><p>The diagram below, taken from one of our internal architecture documents, shows how advanced this thinking already was. It envisioned a system capable of provisioning content, handling payments, and enforcing usage permissions, in other words, a blueprint for the modern app store and cloud service model.</p><figure><img alt=""A flow diagram showing Genie’s proposed content management and payment system for games, music and MP3 downloads, including third-party integrations, an API interface, and early plans for cloud-style storage and delivery."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/950/1*EHSHtVEvq0N8bwWV1-r-1w.png"" /><figcaption><em>An internal Genie architecture diagram from the early 2000s outlining one of the first end-to-end visions for cloud-based content delivery — integrating payments, digital rights management, and third-party media into a unified mobile experience.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even with the concept fully mapped out, one major challenge stood in the way: rights management and legal complexity. Delivering music, games and other premium content required navigating a labyrinth of contracts, distribution deals and licensing agreements. For a startup-scale venture inside BT — even one as ambitious as Genie — that proved difficult to resolve.</p><p>It’s telling that Vodafone, despite its scale and its deep partnership with Vivendi, ran into similar roadblocks. The ecosystem was simply too fragmented, and the legal and commercial incentives too misaligned, for anyone to solve the problem within the constraints of early-2000s mobile infrastructure. In the end, it took Apple’s vertically integrated approach — hardware, software, content, payments and rights all controlled under one roof — and the launch of the iPhone in 2007 to finally make the seamless mobile content model viable.</p><p>But even if we couldn’t deliver it at scale, the vision itself was prophetic. Genie’s platform work was one of the earliest serious attempts to combine content distribution, DRM, payment, storage, and developer integration into a single, customer-centric service. Seen with hindsight, it was a glimpse of the future, one that would eventually define the smartphone era.</p><h3>Taking WAP to the Mainstream — and Telling a New Story</h3><p>For all the innovation we were doing inside Genie, none of it would matter if people didn’t actually use it. The late 1990s mobile landscape was still defined by calls and texts, and the idea of browsing the internet on a phone was, for most people, more science fiction than reality. To succeed, we had to make the concept not only technically possible but emotionally compelling — and that meant changing the story around what a mobile phone <em>was for</em>.</p><p>One of the most significant milestones was the launch of the UK’s first pre-pay WAP phones, developed by Genie in partnership with BT Cellnet. This was the moment when mobile internet shifted from being an expensive, niche add-on to something anyone could access for under £100. The service connected people directly to news, music, sport, and entertainment — and, crucially, to a growing ecosystem of content partners such as EMI, BSkyB, Freeserve and The Guardian.</p><p>The launch was headline news. Sky News covered it as a turning point for mobile technology, highlighting how consumers could now go online without a computer for the first time. As Peter Erskine, Managing Director of BT Cellnet, explained in the report: <em>“Suddenly, instead of buying a thousand-pound computer, people can access the internet just by buying a £99 phone. So suddenly people want the content that they can get.”</em></p><p>I followed by describing how quickly user behaviour would change once richer content became available: <em>“People have a mobile phone and a Sony Walkman. By next year, people will just have their mobile phone and will be listening to their music on their mobile phone. They won’t need two cumbersome devices.”</em></p><p>This shift wasn’t just about hardware, it was about behaviour. Once people experienced the convenience of checking headlines, sending messages, or browsing music on a device they carried everywhere, the mental model of what a phone could do changed forever. And once that shift happened, the demand for more sophisticated services—richer media, better usability, deeper integration — accelerated dramatically.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/a0eedc8be53180bb40916e6239012f7b/href"">https://medium.com/media/a0eedc8be53180bb40916e6239012f7b/href</a><p><em>Sky News report on the launch of the UK’s first pre-pay WAP phones, with commentary from Simon Robinson and BT Cellnet MD Peter Erskine on how mobile content and services were about to change consumer behaviour.</em></p><p>Looking back, this was more than a launch event; it marked a decisive turning point in customer perception. It showed that adoption depends as much on storytelling and value proposition as on technology, a lesson that would shape our thinking throughout Genie’s evolution.</p><h3>How the market likely valued Genie (1999–2001)</h3><p>In the dot-com era, portals and mobile data platforms were valued primarily for their <strong>strategic option value</strong> rather than present-day profits. Genie sat inside BT Cellnet as the face of future data revenue, with millions of registered users and nine-figure monthly WAP page views by mid-2001, and it was already expanding internationally across parts of Europe and Asia.</p><h3>Comparables to anchor the range</h3><ul><li><strong>Vizzavi (Vodafone + Vivendi, 2000–2001):</strong> Launched with an investment plan of ~€1.6 bn, later described as worth £2.5 bn+ at its peak narrative (and higher in some analyst commentary). This shows that credible, pan-European mobile portals attracted billion-scale valuations on strategy alone.</li><li><strong>mmO2 flotation (Nov 2001):</strong> On demerger from BT, mmO2, which absorbed Genie’s assets into O2 Online/O2 Active, opened with a market cap between £6.5 bn and £7.3 bn, depending on the reference price. Genie was not listed separately, but its users, services and brand equity were part of that story.</li></ul><h3>A cautious, internal-style valuation</h3><ul><li><strong>Conservative (“cost-plus + scarcity”):</strong> £0.5 bn–£1.0 bn — reflecting accumulated build and marketing cost for a functioning, growing portal, plus a scarcity premium in a pre-3G market with few credible assets.</li><li><strong>Strategic (“option value vs. Vizzavi”):</strong> £1.0 bn–£2.0 bn — benchmarked against Vizzavi’s billion-euro scale and the idea that Genie could become a primary gateway for messaging, entertainment and games across BT’s European footprint.</li></ul><p>There is no public filing that states “Genie was worth £X.” These figures synthesise comparable valuations, mmO2’s flotation, and Genie’s strategic role within BT Cellnet/BT — a realistic view of how a strategic finance team in 2000–2001 might have valued Genie internally.</p><h3>Results that moved the needles</h3><ul><li><strong>Engagement &amp; growth:</strong> By June 2001 Genie reported ~5.5 million registered users and ~103 million monthly WAP page impressions (BT listing documents).</li><li><strong>Lower churn / higher spend:</strong> In December 1999, BT Cellnet MD Peter Erskine told <em>The Independent</em> that Genie users spent more, were less likely to disconnect, and were expected to grow significantly.</li><li><strong>Industry recognition:</strong> <em>Campaign</em>’s 2001 Marketing Awards (Connections) named Genie <em>Best Use of Mobile Phones/WAP</em>.</li></ul><p>None of this meant we had it all figured out — we didn’t. But the metrics suggested we were pulling the right levers for that era’s constraints.</p><h3>Meanwhile at Vizzavi: brand scale without customer clarity</h3><p>Vizzavi launched as a high-stakes Vodafone–Vivendi joint venture to unify web and mobile portals across Europe, combining Vivendi’s content (music, film, games) with Vodafone’s distribution. The bet: centralise the platform, push a premium brand, and own the customer front door. And their marketing budget was many times higher than Genie’s.</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/33c94f6e1c1c808e7f284c972af8b9e3/href"">https://medium.com/media/33c94f6e1c1c808e7f284c972af8b9e3/href</a><p><em>The sales film that was played in Vodafone stores across the UK. Directed and produced by David Goodwin, it featured The Beatles’ Day in the Life with altered lyrics</em></p><p>Here’s how it played out:</p><ul><li><strong>Operational fragility:</strong> A widely reported email outage during a core upgrade in December 2000 eroded user trust.</li><li><strong>Economic misalignment:</strong> Vivendi’s model relied on selling content; Vodafone bundled access, leaning toward “free to users” to drive network adoption — undercutting content margins.</li><li><strong>Strategic endgame:</strong> By August 2002 Vodafone bought out Vivendi’s stake, dropped the Vizzavi brand, and folded services into Vodafone live! (launched October 2002).</li></ul><p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Scale is not a strategy. Without a clear customer job, a mega-portal becomes a cost centre looking for a purpose.</p><h3>Side-by-side: the two playbooks</h3><p>It’s easier to see the underlying patterns when you compare them directly. The table below shows how Genie and Vizzavi diverged across six critical dimensions — and how those choices determined their success or failure.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rfbp3Bm3BKX4_DKclp2dYQ.png"" /></figure><p><em>Figure 1 — A side-by-side comparison of Genie and Vizzavi across six strategic dimensions.</em></p><h3>A brief postscript: the giffgaff echo</h3><p>Years later, giffgaff would demonstrate a similar mindset: community-centred, online-only, and operating with a lean, agile model (launched in 2009 as an MVNO on O2). It was a different era, but the same bias toward simplicity and direct customer connection.</p><h3>Seeing Genie Through the Lens of Customer Centricity</h3><p>To understand why Genie succeeded where others stumbled, it helps to view the story through the structure of the <a href=""https://medium.com/@srerobinson/a-new-framework-to-elevate-customer-centric-strategy-9e8dc8f99627"">Customer Centricity Strategy Framework</a> — a way of thinking developed by Maria Moraes Robinson and I that grew directly out of this work.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram of the Customer Centricity Strategy Framework, showing how organisations can align vision, value propositions, design, and delivery around the customer lifecycle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tmi5KrZpN8G5_8y0naDi-g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The Customer Centricity Strategy Framework — a model born from Genie’s approach to building products, services and experiences around the customer lifecycle.</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, we didn’t set out to “create a framework.” We were simply trying to build something that mattered to people. But over time, the logic behind those decisions became clear: we were designing intentionally around the <em>customer lifecycle</em> — not treating it as a marketing funnel, but as the central driver of strategy.</p><p>Every choice we made — from the earliest prototypes to our pricing model — was aimed at influencing that lifecycle: attracting users, building habits, deepening engagement, reducing churn and extending lifetime value.</p><h4>1. Scanning future horizons</h4><p>Genie’s origins lay in horizon-scanning. Even before the portal existed, we were exploring prototypes and scenarios for early smartphones, anticipating how connectivity, devices and user expectations would evolve. The goal was not to predict the future but to <em>prepare for it</em>.</p><h4>2. Crafting a clear value proposition</h4><p>Our value proposition was unambiguous: mobile phones were changing. They were no longer just for calls or texts — now, you could <em>surf the BT Cellnet</em>. This wasn’t about listing features; it was about reframing what a mobile phone <em>was</em>and what it <em>could do</em>.</p><h4>3. Leading organisational change</h4><p>Transformation is never purely technical — it’s organisational and cultural too. We faced significant tensionstransitioning from a small team inside BT Cellnet to an independent startup. Our solution was deliberate: wemoved to our own office in Richmond-upon-Thames, a strategic firewall against head-office politics andcorporate bureaucracy. While the Vodafone-Vivendi joint venture slowed under the weight of reconciling brands,budgets, and bureaucracy, Genie operated with the velocity of a startup, maintaining a rapid, agile decision cycle — the essential prerequisite for breakthrough innovation. In today’s tech race, this same agility drives customer-centric wins. For example, it means aligning teams to prioritise user-friendly AI outputs over model complexity — think Grok’s conversational clarity over raw compute.</p><h4>4. Designing strategy across people, processes and partners</h4><p>We didn’t just set product targets — we mapped our strategy holistically across <em>people</em>, <em>processes</em>, <em>marketing</em> and <em>partnerships</em>. We built agile development cycles to release updates rapidly. We forged pioneering partnerships, such as the XY Network, that brought cultural relevance and fresh content. And we designed marketing around behaviours we wanted to encourage — not just around campaigns.</p><h4>5. Putting experience before technology</h4><p>Perhaps the most important principle was sequencing. We started with the experience we wanted to create and worked backwards to the technology required to deliver it. Vizzavi did the reverse — building a platform first and then searching for a purpose. That difference shaped everything: culture, speed, adoption and, ultimately, outcomes.</p><h3>Practical Takeaways for Today’s Builders</h3><p>The story of Genie offers enduring lessons that apply far beyond the mobile industry. These principles, drawn from what we learned two decades ago, are just as relevant whether you’re designing an AI-driven service, launching a SaaS product, or leading change inside a large organisation.</p><ul><li><strong>Mindset Trumps Money: Capital is not Strategy.</strong> Don’t be intimidated by the war chests of large incumbents. Genie achieved superior results with roughly 1/20th of the funding Vizzavi commanded, proving that agility, a superior experience model, and focus on customer habit are far more valuable than a massive, misdirected investment.</li><li><strong>Make it Open by Default.</strong> Openness maximizes your surface area for learning, feedback, and growth — long before a final monetization model is ready. Don’t build walls unless they are essential for your core value proposition.</li><li><strong>Price to Encourage Exploration.</strong> Just as we used flat-rate plans to encourage mobile browsing, your pricing model should act as customer R&amp;D, revealing real jobs-to-be-done rather than punishing early experimentation or metered usage.</li><li><strong>Program the Medium, Not Your Aspirations.</strong> Design services that work <em>with</em> the fundamental constraints of the underlying technology, not against them. In the age of Generative AI, this means recognizing an LLM’s propensity to hallucinate and designing the customer experience to manage verification, rather than forcing the model to act as a perfect, verifiable knowledge base.</li><li><strong>Ship Habits, Not Platforms.</strong> Focus on delivering ten real, sticky user behaviors quickly. This iterative approach creates more cumulative value than waiting years to launch one grand, perfect platform vision.</li><li><strong>Treat Timing as a Feature.</strong> If the enabling technology or market is not ready for the full vision, don’t kill the idea — change the plan. Adapt your scope and scale until technology adoption or infrastructure can catch up to the original vision.</li><li><strong>Align Incentives in Partnerships.</strong> Misaligned business models or conflicting partner incentives will tear even the best product apart. Ensure every partner — and every internal team — is motivated by the same measure of customer success.</li><li><strong>Let Results Speak for You.</strong> In a saturated market, adoption metrics, behavioral data, and organic growth speak louder than marketing adjectives. Focus on building something so valuable that the usage itself proves the strategy.</li><li><strong>Design for Real Behavior, Not Assumed Demand.</strong> Usage data and observed real-world customer actions must be the ultimate guide for your roadmap. Internal assumptions about what customers <em>should</em> want are the fastest path to irrelevance.</li></ul><h3>Looking Forward — Lessons That Still Matter</h3><p>The story of Genie isn’t just a piece of telecoms history — it’s a blueprint for how transformative innovation happens. Every major technological shift — from mobile to cloud to AI — begins with a change in how we think about customers, value and organisational agility. We were experimenting with behaviours that hadn’t yet formed, building services for devices that didn’t quite exist, and designing for a future that was only just becoming possible.</p><p>That mindset — exploratory, adaptive and deeply customer-centred — remains the key to navigating today’s most complex innovation challenges. As the next wave of transformation unfolds, from AI-driven services to spatial interfaces, the opportunity is the same: to build not just technology, but meaningful experiences that people truly care about.</p><p>The future is never invented in theory. It’s built step by step — through experimentation, iteration and a relentless focus on real human needs. And it’s shaped not by technology itself, but by the experiences we design around it.</p><p><strong>So the challenge for today’s builders is this:</strong> don’t just launch products — shape possibilities.

<h4>What two forgotten thinkers can teach us about voice, intent and AI-assisted work.</h4><figure><img alt=""A 19th-century oil painting shows a young apprentice painter standing beside a senior artist, carefully copying the master’s work onto his own canvas. The studio is dimly lit but detailed, with wooden floors, high windows, and art supplies scattered around. The apprentice appears focused, while the master, seated nearby, observes with quiet authority. The scene captures the traditional method of learning through imitation and side-by-side practice."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fxMgjDsG3Ym1H1RevBFf2Q.png"" /><figcaption>Image created by author</figcaption></figure><p>In 18th-century Europe, aspiring painters learned to paint by copying other artists.</p><p>They spent years in studios reproducing sketches and practicing technique. The point was to learn through repetition, and copying helped these aspiring artists understand what good looked like. Imitation was just part of the process.</p><p>Only after years of apprenticeship did painters begin to branch off.</p><p>Today, we’re talking about voice and style — something we used to develop through practice and feedback. Now that we have tools that help us produce faster than ever, we’ve failed to teach what good work looks like along the way.</p><p>When something feels like it was produced with AI, we discount its quality. We often blame the tool, or worse, we blame the person using it.</p><p>To bring some clarity, we’re bringing back two forgotten thinkers: <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anna-Laetitia-Barbauld"">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a> and <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Bentley"">Richard Bentley</a>. Together, they offer a path forward.</p><p>I’m <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/"">Nate Sowder</a>, and this is <strong>unquoted, installment 8</strong>,<strong> </strong>a series about the people behind the ideas we can’t afford to forget.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white engraved portrait of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, shown in profile facing left.

The shading is soft and sketch-like, giving the image a delicate, textured quality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*i4OUBAAlj7v2fbgDo0hzDw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Engraving of Anna Laetitia Barbauld by Henry Hoppner Meyer, 1822. (Public Domain)</figcaption></figure><h3>Barbauld and the practice of imitation</h3><p>In the late 1700s, Anna Laetitia Barbauld was writing poems and essays. She also was teaching at a time when few women had access to formal intellectual training.</p><p>She taught at Warrington Academy, a progressive school in England that served students excluded from elite institutions. Many of her pupils had never been taught how to write with structure or style.</p><p>Her method was simple: Start by copying existing essays and poems. Over time, that helped students develop a sense of their own style by first understanding others’.</p><blockquote>“The mind must be fed by imitation before it can create.”</blockquote><p>To Barbauld, imitation was the path to originality.</p><figure><img alt=""Engraved portrait of Richard Bentley, an 18th-century English classical scholar. He is shown seated, facing slightly to the left, with long curly hair, wearing clerical robes and a white collar. His right hand rests on a closed book, which he holds at the bottom edge. The background is plain and shaded, emphasizing his face and attire."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HDZRDgC3rKubmS3_gneIqA.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Bentley, Richard (1662–1742) (Public Domain)</figcaption></figure><h3>Bentley and the structure of style</h3><p>While Barbauld was helping students find their voices, Richard Bentley was working to detect where voice had gone missing.</p><p>Bentley was a classical scholar in the early 1700s who built a reputation on his ability to <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/textual-criticism"">spot forgery</a>. His most famous takedown was <em>The Letters of Phalaris</em>, a widely admired collection of ancient Greek writings once believed to be authentic. Bentley read them and disagreed.</p><p>When the syntax didn’t match, he realized the voice of the piece was all wrong. The references were off and the structure lacked consistency with the rest of the canon. Bentley could hear when something didn’t belong. He didn’t need proof in reference materials and records. Instead, he looked for a pattern he could follow.</p><p>He treated style as evidence and voice as something you could trace.</p><h3>Why it matters</h3><p>When you replace the process of developing expertise with productivity tools, you stop teaching people how to build their voice. Instead, you hand them Mad Libs, templates and mandates like “use AI” but never define how, how much or to what end.</p><p>And then, when the work feels too clean or too unlike the person who wrote it, we don’t ask what the person was trying to say.</p><p>We ask if they cheated.</p><p>That kind of suspicion kills growth. It tells people: Try this, but only in exactly the right way (whatever that means). And when they get it wrong, they don’t get coached. They get judged.</p><p>If AI becomes a source of shame, I think a lot of people will stop using it. They’ll avoid new opportunities, hide their process and aim for ‘safe and small’ outcomes.</p><h3>What to do instead</h3><p>This problem doesn’t fix itself. If we want people to use AI well, we have to define what that means, not just urge adoption and <em>hope</em> for the best. That means setting clear boundaries, offering real feedback and helping people grow into a voice that’s theirs (which can’t happen in a vacuum).</p><p><strong>Barbauld gave us a blueprint for that kind of growth.</strong><br />She showed that imitation, when guided, builds fluency. It helps people understand how ideas flow, how style works and how meaning holds together.</p><p><strong>Bentley gave us the tools to listen.</strong><br />He showed that voice isn’t invisible. It leaves a trail that can be studied, taught and refined (if we care enough to notice it).</p><p>Together, their teaching offers something AI tools can’t:<br /><strong>A path for learning how to sound like yourself.</strong></p><p>We need less suspicion and more systems that help people build toward authorship.</p><p>Voice and style matter. Put in the work to develop your own.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fc145f3f3a31"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/is-imitation-theft-or-apprenticeship-fc145f3f3a31"">Is imitation theft or apprenticeship?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>",
