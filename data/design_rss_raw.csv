<h4>AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety.</h4><p>Imagine a neighborhood with no sidewalks or ramps. Someone using a wheelchair or a parent pushing a stroller is immediately forced to drive or rely on others just to run simple errands.</p><p>This planning was intentional: it was designed for cars and against people who need help getting around. Every single choice, from storm drain placement to road approval, was a decision that left people out. Just as poor infrastructure creates physical barriers, unclear language creates digital barriers.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8j6He40LoOSgVN1e5a-8Uw.png"" /><figcaption>An illustration of a grey asphalt road bordered on the right by a high, light-colored sidewalk with a distinct, vertical curb.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve recently become responsible for most of the UX writing on my product team, handling everything from button labels to complex error flows, and I know I’m not alone. In countless organizations, product designers are often the ones filling in the final text. Because this is usually the last step, it’s easy to treat the content as a quick fill-in, something you automate or even turn to AI to quickly generate.</p><p>Over time, I’ve realized that this perspective misses the point. <strong>The writing is the design.</strong> The rise of AI tools only makes this clearer: AI can generate text, but only a designer can generate strategy, empathy, and safety. When you view every word as a key design element, you move past simple writing and actually create the user’s experience.</p><p>For any designer who feels writing is just an extra task, this article shares a framework. It treats language as a core design function and the essential tool for building products that are usable, useful, and responsible.</p><h3><strong>Writing vs. Designing</strong></h3><p>When approaching a piece of content, most people immediately ask: <em>“How should those words be written?”</em> This is a tough place to start. Before you write anything, you must first think about designing the experience you want your users to have.</p><p>This is the key difference between the two mindsets:</p><ul><li>Writing Mindset asks: <em>How many words will fit here? How should I describe this action?</em></li><li>Design Mindset asks: <em>What problem are we solving? What terms are our users familiar with? What happens next?</em></li></ul><p>Writing is about fitting words together. Designing is about solving problems for your users. You cannot have one without the other; they must work together.</p><p>As Nicole Fenton, coauthor of <em>Nicely Said</em>, puts it: “<em>I use language to solve problems… I use words as material [1].</em>”</p><p>Your words build digital experiences. You are designing interfaces that allow people to pay bills, send emails, or order food. Every word included in those experiences directly shapes the user’s understanding, feeling, and outcome.</p><h3><strong>The usable useful responsible (UUR) framework</strong></h3><p>Designing with words is more than just arranging letters into sentences. To be truly effective, you have to think of your work not as a writing task, but as a design mandate. It demands skills far beyond basic writing.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hxr5i39R1NYwKkafChP-_A.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a LEGO block, symbolizing the building block of a designer’s writing: the Usable, Useful, Responsible Framework</figcaption></figure><h4>1. Usable words</h4><p>When a product is usable, people can complete their tasks without needing help or instructions. For designers, creating usability means making sure your words act as a guide. The language itself must be clear so users can quickly finish their task.</p><p>This level of clarity is critical for everyone, but especially for those with cognitive disabilities, those who are stressed, or those using screen readers. As content design expert Sarah Richards says: <strong><em>“Accessibility is usability.”</em></strong> If your words aren’t easy for everyone to use, you’ve made a design choice that prevents some people from using your product [2].</p><p>Consider a simple login screen on a mobile app. The way the error message is written determines if the user can easily proceed:</p><ul><li><strong>Unusable writing (Poor design)</strong></li></ul><p>Login failed (<em>User is confused; they must guess if the email, password, or registration is the problem.</em>) (<em>User is offered no path forward.</em>)</p><ul><li><strong>Usable writing (<em>Good design</em>)</strong></li></ul><p>Email not registered. Sign up or check for typos. (<em>User knows exactly what is wrong: their account doesn’t exist.</em>) (<em>User is offered a clear, actionable solution: register or correct their mistake.</em>)</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6ZDivlMQGmS3DVHnwJ5MPg.png"" /><figcaption>A comparison between two different ways a login screen handles an error, illustrating the difference between unuseful and useful feedback.</figcaption></figure><p>This demonstrates how usable writing guides the user by providing clarity (<em>what went wrong</em>) and actionability (<em>what to do next</em>).</p><h4>2. Useful words</h4><p>For your words to be useful, you need to understand and honor your users’ intent. Useful writing gives people control and prioritizes their needs, balancing them with business goals. When you respect users, they are motivated to keep giving you their time and attention.</p><p>For example, when a user intends to delete an account, useful writing must provide a clear path to complete that goal. A design that makes this process intentionally difficult through deceptive language is a classic example of making a product unuseful.</p><p><strong>Unuseful writing (User-hostile design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Hold On! Are You Sure You Want to Deactivate Your Profile and Lose Your Benefits?”</blockquote><p>Uses emotionally charged language, focusing on loss, to dissuade the user from their clear intent. Buttons: Cancel (Prominently styled, primary color) and Deactivate Later (Small, secondary color).</p><p>The issue here is it offers “Deactivate” instead of “Delete” to mislead the user into thinking the account is merely paused, retaining their data for marketing.)</p><p><strong>Useful writing (User-first design)</strong></p><blockquote>“Permanently Delete Your Account?”</blockquote><p>This is direct, unambiguous question honoring the user’s intent. Buttons: Yes, Delete Account (Clear, destructive) and Cancel (Neutral color).</p><p>It gives the user the necessary control and confirms the final, irreversible action.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*S6Kz54gsU90EUmzkt16HEA.png"" /><figcaption>A side-by-side comparison of user interfaces for closing an account, demonstrating good and bad design.</figcaption></figure><p>Useful writing focuses on what people want from your product or service and asks how you can balance that with business goals, rather than focusing purely on what the business can get out of it.</p><h4>3. Responsible words</h4><p>As a designer, you are responsible for what you put into the world. To write responsibly, you have to consider how your words could be used and, crucially, misused.</p><p>Irresponsible writing often weaponizes language. A popular example is “confirm-shaming,” where an interface asks a user for something (like an email) and then forces them to say or think something negative about themselves to decline.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*542HwlftSE_p38Y_YDOlOw.png"" /><figcaption>A footer dark pattern example using fear of missing out (FOMO) and implied punishment (“paying more”) to pressure users into subscribing.</figcaption></figure><p>For instance, in a static footer that asks for an email:</p><ul><li>The headline creates anxiety: <strong><em>“Don’t be the last to know!”</em></strong></li><li>The subtext acts as the shaming mechanism: <strong><em>“If you’re okay with missing out on essential insider knowledge and paying more, just scroll on by.”</em></strong> This forces the user to internally validate that they are “okay with missing out” and “paying more” in order to ignore the field, making the act of declining feel like a financial or intellectual failure.</li></ul><p>As a designer, it’s your responsibility to consider not just how your writing will be used, but also how it could be misused, whether by an algorithm, others in your company, or malicious people. You must ask: <strong>Are they true? Are they kind? Are they inclusive?</strong></p><h3>Aligning your team before you write</h3><p>I’ve spent time with my team and stakeholders debating word choice. For example, should a button say “Buy” or “Purchase”? Stakeholders often look for a “best practice” answer: what does Amazon do? But asking this question is frustrating and distracts from the real issue.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rm4pzevukAWkAjP4zpHePg.png"" /><figcaption>A visual comparison of product card buttons: one uses the clear, direct label “<strong>Buy</strong>,” while the other uses the more verbose label “<strong>Purchase</strong>.”</figcaption></figure><p>The right answer isn’t about being right or wrong. It’s about what works for your users and what your team needs to achieve. Before you can choose “Buy” or “Purchase,” you need a clear strategy.</p><blockquote>Strategy simply means getting everyone aligned on a shared focus. It tells the team what to do, and what to ignore.</blockquote><p>A simple strategy statement connects four key elements:</p><ol><li>User Type</li><li>User Need</li><li>Value Provided</li><li>Business Benefit</li></ol><p>For example:</p><blockquote><em>“</em>We help budget-conscious buyers easily acquire high-quality audio gear so they can enjoy superior sound immediately, which supports AudioFlow’s goal of increasing first-time conversions and positive word-of-mouth.”</blockquote><p>This statement immediately provides direction. Since the goal is easy acquisition for a wide, budget-conscious audience, choosing the clearest, most conversational word “Buy” over the more formal “Purchase” is the right strategic move.</p><h3>A framework for writing with AI</h3><p>The fundamentals of good writing are clarity, concision, and empathy, and they remain essential even with AI tools. While AI can draft text very quickly, its output often lacks soul. What makes UX writing truly effective is your ability to go beyond that basic text by understanding the user’s context, establishing a consistent brand voice, and skillfully modulating the tone.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iFCaD0VnkoHsOfo6poGUtQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays a minimal, dark-themed AI chat interface</figcaption></figure><p>To integrate AI responsibly without compromising your voice, ethics, or craft, adopt a mindset where AI is a co-pilot used for generating options, while you the designer remain the pilot responsible for strategy and empathy.</p><p>Use this three-step strategic filter to integrate AI outputs into your workflow:</p><h4>1. Prompt with strategy</h4><p>Your input to the AI must be dictated by your established voice and tone documentation, not just your immediate need. Instead of a simple request like “<em>Write an error message</em>,” let your prompt provide a clear strategy like:</p><blockquote>“Write a toast notification message for a mobile app. The user just clicked an expired password reset link. Use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone. The message must tell them to request a new link, and it must be concise.”</blockquote><p>This single prompt bundles the following elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Voice &amp; Tone:</strong> “confident, empathetic, and direct tone”</li><li><strong>Constraint:</strong> “toast notification message for a mobile app,” must “be concise,” and must tell them to “request a new link.”</li></ul><p>The resulting AI output, <strong>“</strong><em>Your link has expired. Please request a new link to continue</em><strong>,”</strong> is a direct result of these layered instructions, showing how strategic input creates high-quality, on-brand UX copy right away.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/937/1*iR2uvwZpb93L_owDW2X_uA.png"" /><figcaption>A screenshot displays an AI prompt asking for a concise toast notification about an expired password link, instructing the AI to use a confident, empathetic, and direct tone.</figcaption></figure><h4>2. Filter for empathy (Review)</h4><p>The first and most critical step when reviewing AI output is to filter for the human element and inclusivity. AI outputs often rely on aggregated data that can perpetuate bias, use idioms, or assume an emotional state.</p><ul><li><strong>Check for Exclusion:</strong> Does the output use any terminology (gendered, ableist, or overly colloquial) that might alienate a specific population?</li><li><strong>Check for Assumption:</strong> Does the message assume the user is happy, smart, or calm? (e.g., avoid “Great job!” or “Finally!”)</li><li><strong>Check for Idioms:</strong> Is the language literal and ready for translation, or does it rely on cultural shorthand that an international user or machine translator would miss?</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/933/1*8P0Dvi1e_uwQTQcPgm_3ZQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of an AI being instructed to refine copy for translatability and clarity</figcaption></figure><h4>3. Edit for core principles (Output)</h4><p>After the output passes the empathy filter, focus on refining the language to ensure it is clear, concise, and authentically human.</p><ul><li><strong>Clear:</strong> Edit for ambiguity. Ensure the language precisely describes the action and the object. For example, does the button label “Save” mean “Save All” or “Save this section”? This clarity is paramount.</li><li><strong>Concise:</strong> Cut out extra words<strong>.</strong> Look at what the AI wrote and remove anything you don’t need, like long, overly nice phrases or confusing descriptions. These just slow the user down. Your main goal is to get to the point quickly so the user can finish their task fast and easily.</li><li><strong>Human:</strong> Finally, edit for rhythm by reading the final output aloud to check for natural cadence. Does the writing sound like a robot, or does it flow naturally with appropriate contractions and pacing? The human ear is the ultimate tool for catching stilted or forced language, ensuring the final tone is authentic and engaging.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/841/1*wyYZ2s8cL7KKXuCCI19ZzQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a conversation with an AI where the user is successfully using UX writing principles to edit a draft text</figcaption></figure><p>By following this three-step framework of strategic prompting, empathy filtering, and editing for clarity, concision, and human tone, you can use AI to create high-quality UX copy without losing your voice or affecting the user experience.</p><h3>Designing error messages that help users</h3><p>Error messages are often the most visible things we write, and they appear exactly when users are stressed and confused. While the best error is one that never happens, we must treat any error as a chance to help people finish their work.</p><p>When people use a product, they are focused on completing a task, not on figuring out how the app works. Running into an error is a hard stop to their goal. Instead of assuming the user is doing something “wrong,” your job is to design a better experience. <em>As expert Kathy Sierra says, focus on helping your users become “more skillful, more powerful users [3].”</em></p><h4>The problem with generic errors</h4><p>Companies often blame the user for errors as a way to protect their own image. However, error messages that quietly point the finger at the user and make them feel bad actually harm the brand, causing people to stop using the product and decreasing loyalty.</p><p>When the real problem is a technology or design failure, you should be honest. For example, the email service Mailchimp uses its distinct brand voice to be apologetic, transparent, and helpful when an error occurs. This approach shows they’re committed to guiding the user forward, not blocking them.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/426/1*uVDnV1xXKW2ACp25PicWdw.png"" /><figcaption>The image displays an example of effective, honest error communication, characteristic of a user-first approach.</figcaption></figure><p>If something goes wrong, do everything you can to make sure your users aren’t taking the blame. Focus on helping them achieve their goal.</p><h4>The designer’s error framework</h4><p>To guide users through or around failures, you must design your language using three principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> The best error message is the one the user never sees. Use visual design and interaction (like autocomplete or automatic formatting) to prevent the error from happening in the first place.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Aq6tX3Ha-83mo9V5ho_Vgw.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows an example of the avoid principle in the error framework, using interactions like autocomplete to prevent data entry errors</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Explain:</strong> When an error occurs, clearly and quickly tell the user what went wrong and why (e.g., “Your return date must be after your departure date”). Never leave the user guessing.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rHwhSDosSBAzaOZfIyT6SQ.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for a travel booking app demonstrating the explain principle of the error framework.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> Easily the most critical component. Always provide a clear next step. Don’t just say “File too large”; say, “This file exceeds the 10MB limit. Try compressing the file or uploading a smaller version.”</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YRsg5H0dsboz3UNop3agrg.png"" /><figcaption>The image shows a mobile screen for uploading a document with an error, demonstrating the Resolve principle of the error framework</figcaption></figure><p>Your final task is to ensure the user is supported, not stalled, as they move toward their goal.</p><p>You’re now equipped to expose product flaws, justify your language choices with data, and ensure your product is usable, useful, and responsible.</p><p>AI will generate text faster than you can, but it cannot deliver empathy, define your brand’s ethics, or apply the strategic filter needed to build user trust. That level of intention remains your non-negotiable human power.</p><p>Embrace the words, embrace the strategy, and own your role as the ultimate experience designer.</p><h3>References</h3><p>[1] https://www.nicolefenton.com/words-as-material/</p><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nle2HbYTJU</a></p><p>[3] <a href=""https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96"">https://medium.com/building-winning-products/kathy-sierra-on-designing-for-badass-ba92cd5fad96</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a8ccde162d35"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-writing-is-the-design-a8ccde162d35"">The writing is the design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4><em>We changed our design mindset.

Part of this technology adoption has brought new company challenges <em>(ways of work, roles, technical knowledge, etc)</em>. Still, it has also led to many positive developments and ideas, allowing us to transform old problems into new opportunities.</p><p>Once AI was established as the new technology core, we are playing in a new, unknown field full of opportunities but also uncertainties. How do we build products now? How do we design? How do we work under new rules and roles? Those are questions that we don’t have a solid answer to yet, but in time, we will figure it out. The other side of the story is the opportunities AI will uncover if we choose to adopt this new approach with conviction.</p><p>This article explains how we <em>(a Latam HR rising start-up) </em>are innovating from a humble concept, an approach that has been positively adopted and significantly changed the way we work.</p><h4>From embracing AI to innovating with it</h4><p>Due to a company event (a hackathon), the UX team and I decided to build something special to present as pre-work. It was a fully functional chat interface made in Cursor for all teams to use and place their ideas, ensuring that whatever they create will maintain all Design System tokens and components. From this simple idea, something bigger started to grow after the event. We wondered what would happen if we decided to build a fully functional dummy platform where everyone could create, play, and share? That’s how the <strong>Product Playground</strong> was born — a simple tool that has already made us think about how we should work from now on.</p><h4>What’s a Product Playground?</h4><figure><img alt=""Papumba video game"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YadChw-B6H4iGTomC6tYEQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Building mode is a popular feature in video games like Fortnite, Fallout 4, The Sims, Minecraft, and Roblox, among others.

The idea is that it can be a place to “play” with quick ideas and functionalities, enabling us to have rapid conversations with teams and users.</p><p>Each PM and designer will have their own Playground, enabling them to share with other teams and internal and external clients, thus receiving faster feedback in an environment closely resembling production reality.</p><p>While creating this new dummy world with my teammate, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-vega-ux/""><strong>David Vega</strong></a>, we realized the potential we could exploit from it, along with the new challenges of protocols and design handoff. To us, those concerns were beautiful problems to tackle if the idea could make an impact, and it did.</p><h4>How does it work?</h4><a href=""https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href"">https://medium.com/media/74d837ecfd7676b18af2583ebf6cf610/href</a><p>Part of the essence of the Product Playground is to be really friendly to everyone outside the engineering team; therefore, we decided to build this Playground with some UX foundations. To start, there is a “read me first” section where users can understand all the knowledge behind this tool, such as the definition, step-by-step setup, templates, design validator, and tool documentation.</p><p>Once users understand how to operate the tool <em>(it is effortless, though)</em>, they need to pull the repository where the playground lives, and that’s it; you can start to play. We were also cautious in providing some initial prompts to make fundamental changes within the tool, and from there, the imagination is the limit.</p><h4>Scopes and levels of solutions</h4><figure><img alt=""Playground interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lsXnttQ2K2uFwdgSDDF3Gw.png"" /><figcaption>Current Product Playground (home) interface with navigation and functional sections ready to be modified</figcaption></figure><p>We started small, as we always do when building products. So far, we have launched the first version of Product Playground and achieved our primary goal: to spark interest in creating products and sharing ideas among people. We believe this version shouldn’t be the end, so we are planning to evolve the AI tool into something more interesting. Here’s the evolution scope we’re planning:</p><p><strong>Phase one:<br /></strong>Mission: “Play and Share”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>Local environments</li><li>Local component library in Cursor (Design System tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase two:<br /></strong>Mission: “Real components, real environments”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>Actual company library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components)</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li></ul><p><strong>Phase three:<br /></strong>Mission: “Company Standard Code”<br />Contains the following features:</p><ul><li>React environments (Collaborator + Admin)</li><li>UBITS library (MCP: Figma + tokens + components) + rules</li><li>Playground publishing</li><li>100% responsive</li><li>Code reviewed and optimized for engineering.</li></ul><p>We believe that with this AI tool or concept, our way of understanding product building has changed. From our company’s perspective, we see a lot of benefits to highlight, such as:</p><ul><li>Functional designs and ideas that can feel more real in their iterations.</li><li>Speed ​​in idea validation <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/did-ai-kill-the-systems-thinking-skills-in-ux-701f845f18d4""><em>(acceleration stage)</em></a>.</li><li>Shift from the “traditional” mindset that says I must rely on third parties to validate or create something.</li><li>Independence when building product experiences from an idea.</li><li>Engineering inputs; in more advanced phases of the Playground, the components and layouts will be the official ones from the company libraries.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Plagound interface"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/853/1*3qzuJFndKCkNLQpSBpwR3A.png"" /><figcaption>Interface exercise with real elements and components of the design system</figcaption></figure><p>We acknowledge that not everything is rainbows and sunshine. With this new way of building products, we anticipate some big questions and challenges, such as the role of a designer as we know it <em>(I’ll explain it in a few paragraphs)</em> and whether the new handoff method will be a Product playground link. What should happen with Figma files? Do we even need it since now we have a new construction platform? The reality is that we’re discovering answers as soon as we move with this idea. I hope to get you an answer in my next article.</p><h4>A new design mindset?</h4><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, we’re experimenting with a possible design mindset shifting process; how do we know? With this new tool, interface design is not just a job for professionals; it’s for everyone. As a result, our design duty may shift to something unfamiliar: the design of systems, or as we’ve started to call it, <strong>Infrastructure design.</strong> We’re not pretending to add another design role to the already confusing list in the industry, but in scenarios like this, naming what we are building gives us ownership of ideas and processes.</p><p>Infrastructure design, as we understand it, involves the planning, design, and maintenance of a large product platform where others can come to build. Our priority right now is to provide all the building blocks <em>(Design system, user experiences, interactions, etc.) </em>to allow others to create. So immediately we launched the Product Playground, a worry started to circle our minds; with this tool, our design job will disappear? This is a valid question due to the significant hysteria in the design community since AI has become a permanent presence. My answer to that is no; there are still many things a designer can do that no one else can. The issue until now is that we have allowed companies to pigeonhole our work as only an interface exercise, and I believe it is more than that.</p><p>At the end of the day, if someone is creating stuff in a Playground, it is the designer who decides if such an invention is easy to use, coherent with user needs, and meets other relevant criteria.</p><p>Along with this “new concept” that only applies to design teams, there is another one with a broader scale that we are adopting, and I’d like to share: <strong>functional design</strong>. This concept refers to the Playground outcome, where ideas are essentially functional and ready to implement. We’ve abandoned static design and limited prototypes for rich interactions and complete flows that can be made in minutes.</p><p>When we talk about design now, we can see things working in a real environment and have more effective conversations with users and stakeholders. The sense of reality is a plus we haven’t had before.</p><p>Another topic we have been navigating and evangelizing within the design team is embracing “designs” from others, especially from those who are not designers. To clarify, the Product Playground is not open to everyone in the company, but only to people in the tech department <em>(PMs, sales, data, engineers, QA, etc). </em>The message is simple on this concern: What was once an insult to us as designers is now real collaboration. We can exchange design and experiences, and also teach them how to do it in the process.</p><h4>The new company’s way of working.</h4><p>Since we started embracing the “production acceleration stage” in the company, we see product design with fresh perspectives, especially with the Product Playground in the conversation. It may not be the right or only path to follow in the industry, but for us, it’s been quite a change.</p><p>The most compelling evidence we have to validate our hypothesis is time. Before all these concepts <em>(Acceleration stage, Product Playground, Infrastructure design, and functional design)</em>, building an idea went like this: Ideation → Model → Prototype → Engineering. The cycle was slow, expensive, and discouraged innovation, as typically only one idea was developed. Now, a process that used to take weeks only takes a few hours. Plus, we can test multiple versions of an interface quickly, preventing ideas from falling by the wayside.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=22f64e1bc59a"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ai-concept-that-changed-our-companys-way-of-working-22f64e1bc59a"">The AI concept that changed our company’s way of working</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>Gregory Bateson and the art of staying in conversation with yourself.</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of an elderly man with light hair swept back, wearing a plaid shirt over a collared shirt. He has a gentle, knowing smile and expressive wrinkles that convey warmth and intelligence. The background is softly blurred, keeping focus on his face and thoughtful expression."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k9P22tQEKIhurkG8V8E1CA.png"" /></figure><p>This week, someone asked me a question that deserves more than a quick answer:</p><blockquote><strong>How can a company get bigger without making the experience worse for the people who already trust it?</strong></blockquote><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 10. Today, we’re talking mergers and acquisitions.</em></p><p><strong>At first, it sounds like a design problem.</strong> Or maybe a customer service one. Add new markets, new systems, new customers, and suddenly the challenge is keeping what was working while trying to understand what the future needs to become.</p><p>But underneath, it’s a question about honesty. What if the kind of growth that stretches empathy and deepens awareness (the kind we expect from people) could guide how organizations grow too? The trouble is, and it’s what I was really being asked, companies don’t usually grow that way. The bigger they get, the more they drift toward dilution. Uniformity starts to look like fairness. A drive for efficiency starts to feel like understanding. And every merger, no matter how strategic, risks erasing the small, specific things that made people trust you in the first place.</p><p>Which brings us to Gregory Bateson, the British anthropologist who spent his life asking how living systems hold together when they grow, collide or change. He called it <a href=""https://batesoninstitute.org/gregory-bateson/""><em>the ecology of mind</em></a>. His insight was simple… aaand difficult:</p><p><strong>Systems survive by staying in conversation with themselves.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photograph of anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson working at a wooden table in their thatched-roof home near the Sepik River in New Guinea.

Trained as an anthropologist, he moved through biology, psychiatry, cybernetics and communication theory as if they were chapters in a single unfinished book. He studied tribes in New Guinea, mapped communication patterns in families with schizophrenia, and helped define the early vocabulary of systems theory.</p><p>What he was really searching for was what he called the ‘pattern that connects’. Every living system, he argued, survives by registering difference — the small shifts that signal when something in the environment has changed. To Bateson, information was a relationship that needed to be maintained. It wasn’t something you could create and store away.</p><p>He saw life as a constant negotiation between something you are aware of and something you let drift. The moment a system stops sensing its surroundings, it begins to lose the capacity to learn. And what we often call stability is just the early phase of decline. In other words, if you aren’t working toward something, you’re automatically moving away from it.</p><p>That was the core of his thinking. He replaced the language of control with the language of relationship. A forest, an organization, even a mind. Each stays ‘alive’ by keeping the conversation open between its parts.</p><h3>When the conversation breaks</h3><p>Bateson’s ideas make mergers look less like transactions and more like ecological events. Two systems collide, each with its own rhythms, feedback loops and internal grammar. At first, both listen politely. Then they start talking over each other.</p><p>Signals that once made sense begin to distort. Teams over-interpret silence. Customers catch tonal shifts before any official announcement. That doesn’t mean the system is collapsing. What it means is that it’s losing its sense of self.</p><p>Bateson would’ve seen that as a feedback failure, not a leadership flaw. When new information enters a system and the interpretive loops are weak, the signal mutates (it doesn’t go away). Meaning goes looking for somewhere else to live.</p><p><strong>That’s the unseen cost of getting bigger.</strong> Growth multiplies ways to do things faster than it multiplies ways to understand things. And the louder a system gets, the easier it is to confuse agreement with coherence.</p><p>You’re probably thinking what I’m thinking: Every organization faces this… not just in mergers, but technology adoption, strategy, and research.</p><p>We build tools to listen faster, but not always to listen better. Bateson would call that <a href=""https://www.honest-broker.com/p/why-gregory-bateson-matters-a8d"">ecological deafness:</a> a feedback loop optimized for speed instead of reflection.</p><h3>Learning from differences</h3><p>Bateson believed that systems stay healthy by adjusting to the relationships between things. Every change, no matter how small, reshapes the conditions for what comes next. As a system receives information, the key isn’t how much it hears, but whether the hearing leads to reflection.</p><p>AI makes that harder. It expands what an organization can sense, but not what it understands. Algorithms pull in more signal, faster… but they don’t know what matters. And often, neither do we.</p><p>We’ve trained ourselves to think that hearing more means knowing more. But without a loop that turns signal into learning, it’s just a whole lot of noise.</p><p>Bateson’s answer would be:<br />- Humility. <br />- Keep the conversation open. <br />- Build systems that reflect before they respond.</p><h3>Staying in conversation with yourself</h3><p>It’s not that organizations fail because they stop collecting feedback. It’s more that they learn how to ignore it.</p><p>Even with dashboards, surveys, sentiment trackers… it’s easy to bend the story in whatever direction feels most comfortable.</p><p>A forest doesn’t get to do that. It doesn’t negotiate with fire, or spin a drought into a branding opportunity. It just responds.</p><p>Bateson’s point was that healthy systems don’t control the narrative.<br /><strong>They stay in conversation with it.</strong></p><p>If you want to grow without losing what made you trustworthy, build that kind of system.</p><p>Then let it tell you the truth. Even when you’d rather not hear it.</p><p><strong>The work is ahead.</strong><br />And Bateson shows us the way.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=631d44184013"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-ecology-of-a-merger-631d44184013"">The ecology of a merger</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>How designers create true alignment with visual thinking</h4><p>I want to tell you about my favorite apple. It’s incredible. It’s hands down the most delicious apple of all time! When you see it hanging on a tree, its color invites you to come closer and take a bite. When it’s ripe, the flavor is amazing, complemented with a delightfully pleasing texture. It’s a fantastic fruit that fills you with delight.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw picture of an apple shape with questions around it"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dfRMi0iyg9vrfJYA.jpg"" /><figcaption>What kind of apple are you imagining?</figcaption></figure><p>Now, what kind of apple did you imagine? Was it red, green, or yellow? Was the taste tart, sweet, or mild? Where did you imagine that tree…in a field, backyard, or in an orchard? Every person reading this description has a different kind of apple in mind. Yet, we’re all speaking the same language, using the same terms to talk about the same apple. The language is the same, but the ideas in our heads are different.</p><p>This is what I call the “illusion of alignment,” and it doesn’t just happen with apples. It happens all the time in meetings, design reviews, planning sessions, emails, strategy documents and more.</p><h3>The Illusion in Action</h3><p>Imagine a product team spends weeks planning a major feature redesign. Everyone attends the kickoff meeting. The product manager presents the strategy doc. It’s thorough. It’s well-written. It covers all the bases. Heads nod around the room. Engineering gives a thumbs up. Architecture gives green lights. UX flashes a smile. The scope is clear. The goals are documented. Everyone agrees this is the right direction.</p><p>You take notes, ask a few clarifying questions, and get to work. Over the next several weeks, you explore concepts, refine the direction, and build out the solution. It feels good. It feels aligned. The check-ins go smoothly. Then comes the first design review…</p><p>The designer presents their work…the culmination of weeks of thinking, exploring, and refining. And the room… erupts. Not with excitement. With confusion. With concern. With frustration.</p><blockquote>“Wait, I thought we agreed on something simpler?”</blockquote><blockquote>“This isn’t what I had in mind at all.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Why did you go in this direction?”</blockquote><p>Everyone feels blindsided. The designer is confused because they followed the strategy, they asked questions, they thought everyone was aligned. The product manager is frustrated at the designer…clearly they didn’t read the brief. The leaders are worried…we’ve lost weeks, and now we have to start over. Engineers are annoyed since they’ve been planning their work around a completely different approach.</p><p>What happened? Everyone was using the same words the whole time. Everyone read the same document. Everyone nodded in the same meetings. But nobody was actually imagining the same thing.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Dyx0umta-Pm9z48R.jpg"" /><figcaption>Words are not the same as meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Words Are Squishier Than We Think</h3><p>Words are not concrete. As much as we want words to have specific, concrete, absolute meaning…they don’t. They’re abstractions that our brains automatically fill in based on our backgrounds, expertise, and experiences. Two people can use identical terms and mean completely different things. Two people can use wildly different terms and mean the <em>exact </em>same thing.</p><p>This shows up in a few different ways. Here are three examples:</p><p>The problem gets worse with documentation. We write things down and feel confident. Look, it’s right there on the page. It’s clear. It’s specific. But even detailed specifications get interpreted through different mental models. Your brain reads those words and instantly constructs an image based on what you know, what you’ve seen before, and what makes sense to you. Our brains make assumptions about the words and between the words to make sense of what we’re reading.</p><p>This isn’t because people are stupid or careless. This is human nature. It’s just how our minds work. It’s how we engage with and understand the world. We can’t help but fill in gaps with our own understanding.</p><h3>The Division It Breeds</h3><p>Before that design review, everything feels fine. There’s harmony in meetings. People are nodding. Documents are approved. Progress is being made. High fives all around. But underneath, an invisible gap is slowly widening. Everyone is building on different assumptions, creating different mental models, imagining different end states, and digging a deeper gulf between each other.</p><p>Then the designer shows their work and suddenly the gap becomes visible. What felt like alignment evaporates like a vapor. That alignment was simply an illusion.</p><p>Trust erodes. The designer feels like the goal posts just moved. The product manager feels ignored. Developers feel annoyed. Everyone questions everyone else’s competence. What was a collaborative team suddenly feels like a war zone.</p><p>We don’t just have a project setback, we have a relationship problem. People start documenting everything defensively. Politics emerge. Finger-pointing begins. The project screeches to a halt as everyone grasps for control of the situation.</p><p>This is what survival looks like. Everyone is genuinely trying to do the right thing. The division wasn’t intentional, it was invisible…until the pictures showed up.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vYbB6DOAo9yKRECo.jpg"" /><figcaption>Pictures get closer to meaning.</figcaption></figure><h3>Designers as Bridge Builders</h3><p>The pictures. That’s where clarity started to emerge. This is where designers have a unique opportunity. We think visually (or at least we should). We externalize ideas in renderings to make sense of them. We don’t just imagine solutions in our heads, we sketch them, analyze them, erase them, trash them, and sketch some more. We refine them, prototype them, and make them feel more real. We make the invisible visible.</p><p>This puts us in a very opportunistic position. We can expose misalignment before division deepens. We can build bridges between abstract language and concrete forms. We have a chance to drive direction and clarity. We don’t need special authority or permission. We don’t need a “seat at the table”. We just need to do what comes naturally to us: draw.</p><p>A designer with a marker and a napkin can create more alignment in 1 minute than weeks of documented strategy. Not because the strategy is bad, but because the drawing makes everyone’s different mental pictures visible. It forces the misalignment to the surface early, when it’s still easy to correct. It grounds us in what could be, to drive the question of what should be.</p><p>This isn’t about gatekeeping or controlling the conversation. It’s about getting people to talk. It’s about helping everyone see the different pictures in each other’s heads so we can get really get aligned before we waste time, money, and relationships building the wrong things.</p><h3>Tactics for Creating Real Alignment</h3><p>This should be second nature for designers. But, it’s easy to get sucked into the practices and thinking of non-designers around us.</p><p>If this is new to you, or you’re looking for some helpful approaches, here are practical ways designers can use visual thinking to build bridges across different scenarios:</p><p>The goal of these isn’t to finalize decisions. It’s to avoid hidden assumptions and misalignment that will paint you into a corner later and undermine the value you’re delivering to users.</p><h3>Just Draw a Picture</h3><p>Remember our favorite apple from the beginning? The one we imagined differently even though we used the same language? It looks like we’re aligned because we’re talking about an apple. Even if we start talking about details, we still appear to be aligned. It’s not until concrete renderings are introduced that the true state of alignment is shown. This is where the practice of design shines. Every strategy session. Every kickoff. Everyone’s got a different apple in their head. We can help draw it out.</p><figure><img alt=""Hand draw illustration of a marker"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TYuQ0iT4r6EzcFQP.jpg"" /><figcaption>Grab a marker and just draw a picture for clarity.</figcaption></figure><p>This doesn’t require process overhaul, you can do it any time. It doesn’t need expensive tools, you just need a pencil. It doesn’t require anyone’s permission, just some courage on your part. We need to do what comes naturally to designers: think visually. Make ideas concrete. Turn words into form. Show, don’t just tell.</p><p>There’s been a lot of talk over the years about designers needing a seat at the table. I don’t believe you need to be at the table to influence the people at the table. You need to create artifacts that create shared understanding, and show the path forward. You need to be the one who makes what’s invisible visible before the division breeds and relationships fracture. If everyone at the table is aligned going in, you don’t have to be there to try and align them.</p><p>We’re surrounded by a world addicted to speed and productivity. Some may think drawing is a waste of time, or inappropriate for “serious business discussions,” or something you do later in the “design phase.” They won’t naturally reach for a marker. But we will. Because we’re the ones who instinctively know that pictures are worth 1,000 strategy documents, and pictures create the concrete to help us understand the wicked problems we’re asked to solve.</p><p>Next meeting, bring a sketch. Even a crude one. Spend 5–10 minutes thinking with your pencil and be ready to share. Be the bridge builder. Be the one who weeds out hidden assumptions by creating alignment.</p><p>Pickup your pencil, and get after it!</p><h3>One More Thing…</h3><p>You may get really frustrated when you spend time and energy understanding the problem and proposing a solution only to have it ripped apart over and over again. Or you may work hard on identifying and rendering the best solution and people tell you all the reasons why it’s wrong. You may get frustrated after months into a project and things suddenly go sideways and your project partners decide that it’s the “wrong” direction.</p><p>It’s a horrible feeling and one of incredible frustration. It might feel like you can never get anything right. But I want you to know: as a designer that’s your job. It’s our job to propose and work through solutions and constantly be searching and rendering our thinking. We make the intangible tangible so people can understand it. You make the intangible tangible so we can build it if that’s the agreed path. If you propose a solution, or many solutions, and people disagree, you’ve done your job. Consider it a success if you draw a picture or prototype and people disagree with it. That’s your opportunity to find alignment and find the path forward.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4d8f661e63f0"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-illusion-of-alignment-4d8f661e63f0"">The illusion of alignment</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>Reasons to be optimistic</h4><p>Advancements in AI continue to generate excitement for those in tech and product-focused fields. Coming along for the ride with that excitement is proportionate <a href=""https://www.reach3insights.com/blog/ai-anxiety"">anxiety for many</a>, especially those in UX. New AI advancements and employer expectations raise various concerns that tend to fall under the larger banner of something like “will AI reduce the need for UX designers and researchers?”. <a href=""https://substack.com/home/post/p-162155396"">Thomas Stokes at Drill Bit Labs reports</a> a year-over-year increase of almost 7% in UX job postings mentioning AI. Are User Experience and related fields like Human Factors and Human-Computer Interaction in the early phases of being relegated to the sidelines? While I understand and empathize with this concern, I also believe it is often misplaced. Fundamental economic principles and recent historical patterns suggest something more nuanced and optimistic. The UX workforce is more likely to see its daily job responsibilities and overall market positioning transform and evolve than become outdated and marginalized.</p><p>My goal for this post is simply to offer a few thoughts on the future of UX based on proven economic principles and historical examples I hope will inspire optimism.</p><h3>Foundational economic principles</h3><p>Taking a look at recent economic history, technological advancements have consistently transformed rather than eliminated human work. I will briefly highlight two relevant economic principles to this transformation: Ricardo’s Comparative Advantage and Kremer’s O-ring Theory.</p><p>Comparative Advantage: In 1817 renowned economist David Ricardo demonstrated that even when one side of an economic trade has an <em>absolute</em> advantage in everything they produce, both sides will benefit when each specializes in what they do <em>comparatively</em> better. In other words, even in the extreme hypothetical that an AI agent was better at every UX task than its human counterpart, it would still be more efficient to utilize the AI for <em>only</em> the tasks it has the largest <em>comparative</em> advantage in (and likewise for the human UXer). This principle helps us see how, even as AI capabilities increase, economic forces will create a division of labor between AI and humans rooted in their respective strengths (even in the unlikely, doom-and-gloom scenario in which AI has become absolutely better at <em>everything</em>). Common examples of tasks which AI (particularly GenAI) holds comparative advantage in are structured, repetitive, routine tasks (think spreadsheet math, responding to emails, and the like).</p><figure><img alt=""Picture: Illustrative diagram of Ricardo’s theory of Comparative Advantage"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*W6KRmtzQjk-wr1szDbtmnw.png"" /><figcaption>Generated with Gemini 2.5 (Nano Banana)</figcaption></figure><p>O-ring Theory: Nobel Memorial Prize winning economist Michael Kremer proposed the <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/551/1881767"">O-ring theory of economic development in 1993</a>. Using the Challenger space shuttle disaster of 1986 as a prime example, O-ring theory shows how a single point of inefficiency in a product team can dramatically impact the success of the end product. For example, even if 9 out of 10 team members do their job with incredible efficiency, a single team member working inefficiently can cause the otherwise high performing team to produce a mediocre product. Applied to our AI and UX context, Kremer’s theory demonstrates that even <em>if</em> we were to efficiently outsource 90% of UX tasks to AI, the relative impact of the human UX designer or researcher would not decrease, but actually increase!</p><p>Takeaway: Comparative Advantage and O-ring theory provide two economic rationales to believe there will always be considerable value to be gained from human UXers, even in the event humanity reaches sci-fi levels of AI capabilities.</p><h3>Historical examples of role transformation</h3><p>Theories and principles are helpful, but let’s turn for a quick look at some historical examples showing what happens when technology automates human tasks.</p><ol><li>Automation and mechanization in manufacturing is a familiar example. When mechanized task automation became the standard manufacturing it did not simply eliminate jobs, but instead bifurcated the market. Yes, mass production was automated and job roles were lost as a result. However, this simultaneously created new demand for artisanal and specialty manufacturing roles. <a href=""https://teamstage.io/jobs-lost-to-automation-statistics/"">It is estimated</a> that in the past 25 years roughly 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost due to automation. However, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">it is also estimated</a> that 133 million new jobs (some, not all, in manufacturing) will be created, many of which will shift from low-skills and low-pay to higher-skilled and higher-paid manufacturing positions.</li><li>The banking industry gives us one of my favorite examples of transformation over elimination. When ATMs became widespread in the 90’s many spoke of the impending doom of the bank teller. The number of ATMs sharply rose from zero to over 400,000 in the course of just a few years, bolstering fears of job loss. Instead, <a href=""https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/813/"">as documented by economist James Bessen</a>, the number of bank tellers in the United States <em>increased</em> at a rate higher than that of the average workforce. ATMs reduced the cost of operating a bank branch, allowing banks to open more branches. Teller responsibilities transformed from handling cash to relationship management and more complex financial services. These were high-value responsibilities that ATMs could not perform at the level of a human or in which humans held the <em>comparative advantage</em>.</li></ol><p>Bessen concludes</p><p><em>“Many people suppose that if technology automates tasks . . . then widespread computer automation must be associated with major job losses. But this view fundamentally misunderstands what has been happening. The evidence shows that computer automation of an occupation is associated with increased demand for that occupation . . . The net result is that computer use is associated with a small increase in employment on average, not major job losses.” (pp.29–30)</em></p><figure><img alt=""A black and white image of an early ATM prototype"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/910/0*EZyolmi_Bz-aWFBP.png"" /></figure><p>3. When thinking of large-scale automation in North America, the agricultural revolution is one of the most dramatic historical examples. Agricultural employment fell from roughly 41% of the U.S. workforce in 1900 to less than 2% today, <a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299194"">due in large part to technological advances in automation</a>. The end of humans working in agriculture, right? Not quite, as both <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2019/beyond-bls/changes-in-the-us-occupational-mix-from-1860-to-2015.htm"">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> and economist <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">David Autor</a> note that while traditional agricultural jobs did experience decline, new jobs and responsibilities were created focusing less on physical labor and more on higher-order thinking[8,7]. This is not to mention the significant rise of new jobs and skill sets in other sectors as a result of this market shift.</p><p>4. Lastly, a historical example more directly applicable to what we see happening is UX is the transformation of accounting. As standard bookkeeping has become increasingly automated, <a href=""https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Why%20Are%20there%20Still%20So%20Many%20Jobs_0.pdf"">accountants have evolved </a>into new and sometimes different, or more highly skilled, roles such as strategists, analytics, and advisors. The <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/accountants-and-auditors.htm"">Bureau of Labor Statistics reports</a> employment among accountants has grown and is expected to continue to grow at an above average rate despite automation of many daily tasks. Traditionally trained accountants are increasingly focused on higher-order responsibilities like interpretation, strategy, and personalized financial advice. It is not difficult to see how a similar strategic shift could happen in UX.</p><p>These historical patterns suggest UX may begin to bifurcate into AI-driven standard solutions (e.g., AI generated reports, automated design reviews) and value-add, human-crafted experiences (e.g., strategic research, deep problem solving exercises). This would follow the economic principle of comparative advantage that has a proven track record through many technological revolutions.</p><h3>The current state of AI in UX</h3><p>Today’s AI tools are capable of performing, at varying degrees of effectiveness, different core UX tasks like generating wireframes and prototypes, sketching design concepts, creating synthetic users, moderating 1-on-1 interview sessions, mapping user journeys from qualitative data inputs, drafting moderator guides, analyzing quantitative data, creating research reports, ideating new design directions, and the list goes on.</p><p>However, as we stand today, AI struggles with many other aspects of UX like unique design challenges, cultural and contextual nuance, novel user behaviors, and ethical considerations. <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/ai-can-cannot-do-ux"">Jakob Nielsen comments</a> on some of the current limitations in AI in UX Research,</p><blockquote>“The reason we conduct user research instead of relying solely on the 10 heuristics and other usability guidelines is that humans always have unexpected behaviors. How do we know what people want, need, or prefer? This cannot be predicted, any more than we can predict the future.”</blockquote><p>Perhaps these limitations reflect Ricardo’s principle of comparative advantage at work. AI handles routine tasks along with some creative tasks while humans retain the advantage in other areas of higher-order thinking. I try to avoid making specific predictions about the future, but this seems like a reasonable possibility given what we have seen happen in other technological revolutions.</p><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>I will end by offering a few parting considerations for looking at AI transformation in UX moving forward. UX professionals navigating current advances in AI should consider adopting the lens of tried and true economic principles for guidance. Focus on developing skills where humans maintain <em>comparative</em> advantage. Do not become fixated on the absolute advantages of AI. Focus on core UX skills that make you part of the O-ring of production to multiply your impact on the end product. Focus your energy not solely on displacement, but also on newly created opportunities.</p><p>As bank tellers and accountants embraced evolution in their roles through a changing technological environment, we UX professionals should too — with optimism.</p><p><em>Originally posted on the </em><a href=""https://triuxpa.org/blog/13502155""><em>Triangle UXPA blog</em></a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5f9d334aad05"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-economics-of-ai-in-ux-5f9d334aad05"">The economics of AI in UX</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4><em>Today, too many images are little more than filler and bait.</em></h4><p>It feels like almost all text published online today <em>needs </em>an image with it. White paper, blog post, social post, news article: these things must have an image with them to <em>survive — </em>how do you expect your writing to reach people by throwing away all the <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/photos-generate-engagement-research/"">engagement that images give you</a>?</p><p>But, obviously it wasn’t always like this. See below an image of the cover of the <em>New York Times</em> on armistice day 1918:</p><figure><img alt=""An photograph of the front page of the New York Times, featuring no images, only text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zXtVyVNl99j8jZisckx5uw.jpeg"" /></figure><p>And a screenshot from CNN from today, October 11 2025:*1</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the CNN homepage, featuring a large number of very colorful images."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZTMClsXCpIhaAvYz9uHSnQ.png"" /></figure><p>It wasn’t always like this, and we apparently managed to get information before. It wasn’t perfect, but we managed.</p><h3>What are accessory images?</h3><p>You might be thinking, “But I, or someone I know, sometimes finds these images useful.” Indeed: my disagreement is primarily with images whose nature is not to give you information in themselves, but which act as bait or filler.</p><p>So what are accessory images? Here’s a test: let’s say that an article you have written is being recognized in some way — such as receiving an award, being used for training, etc. Under what circumstances would you include the accompanying image?</p><p>For instance, if your article was about hacking and your editor had added a stock photograph of an unidentified man in a hoodie on a computer, would you submit that image along with the article for recognition by a prize? Or as a materially important part of the article for training purposes?</p><p>Such images — often stock or AI slop (all of which I shall discuss below) — are an insult to the visual crafts like photography and painting. These images don’t matter in themselves; rather they are just there to fill space or draw people to something actually important (or profitable). They are an accessory to the crime of clickbait.</p><p>They thus distort our networks and our information environment:</p><ol><li>The article most read should be the most interesting one, not the one with the most distracting image.</li><li>Conversely, our social networks are today brain-addling filler images whose only characteristic is existing.</li></ol><p>Any medium can be an accessory: images are special to me because they are the normal accessory to my primary medium, text. But so can text be an accessory, as can music: see “stock music” or (trade name) Musak.</p><h3>Careless taste</h3><p>Where are all these images coming from? Apparently, at least one person asked the question: “Now we can easily deliver images over the Internet, where can we put them? Why not have an image with every article on our website, and every preview in our article listing page, and every preview on our social network feed.”</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t long before you need your thing to have a preview/featured image for it to go anywhere online: anything without a featured image will be at disadvantage. Now, images are for the most part <em>compulsory.</em></p><p>This has led to two overlapping phenomena:</p><h4>Slock</h4><p>Slock images are created to fill the gap, they’re usually either stock photography (iStock, Getty, etc.) or AI-generated (slop) — hence “slock.” These images are most popular among stressed-out content managers, writers, and people trying to get somewhere on LinkedIn.</p><p>These people are told — explicitly by managers, or implicitly by the networks, that every piece of writing needs an image. Then begins the panicked process of finding one: note that for any writer paid by the article (not the hour) this wasted time is quite painful.</p><p>This brings forth a rogue’s gallery of trash:</p><p>We have of course the corporate-looking stock, like this mysterious person who pops up everywhere:</p><figure><img alt=""A stock photograph, featuring a person dressed in a suit reading a newspaper, whose title is “Business.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xUf5404HX_-DzQfwHjnTuw.png"" /></figure><p>Then the figures:</p><figure><img alt=""An uncanny-valley figure, a misshapen humanoid with an oversized expressionless head and overly-defined hands, seemingly made from grey plastic."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/621/1*WJB97hrG3RK8OX280z-o1A.png"" /></figure><p>And of course the recent AI slop:</p><figure><img alt=""An AI slop cartoon, featuring animals dressed in suits apparently performing business, and saying nonsensical things."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/700/1*MurCiXczBjpVcHcZqGMY4g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Please note that images of the grade shown above are common on LinkedIn, despite the gibberish.</figcaption></figure><p>Slop is more insidious than stock. Now that people can create images quickly with AI, the problem of finding something relevant is solved, superficially.</p><p>For example, a colleague of mine wrote a good article on “Excel Hell” — Copilot dutifully made him an image of a man standing in a burning room surrounded by floating tables in Excel-brand green.</p><p>Relevant? From the perspective of someone with no concept of a spreadsheet (and therefore of Excel Hell), yes.</p><p>Useful, clarifying, aesthetically pleasing? No, and so lacking in these qualities that it threatens to tear the mind to shreds.</p><p>This comes with uncountable problems, including:</p><ol><li>The disturbing nature of the pictures, and their universally crass and/or cheesy persona</li><li>The environmental impact immense power required to create them (remember that the vast majority of these images are pointless)</li><li>The overproduction of real-enough looking images such that it’s becoming hard to know what’s real</li></ol><h4>Bait</h4><p>As I suggested above, the overabundance of images has turned our media from places where we read and explore and decide what we wish to learn more about, to places where we scroll — barely consciously — browsing until something jolts us enough to pause or click.</p><p>We used to explore, now we doomscroll. In this environment, people obviously use images as a tool to snap people out of it — or deeper into it, depending on your perspective.</p><p>This of course gives us the shock face:</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of a YouTube preview, with the host exhibiting the common “shock” face."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*e6dXlY3vQGRSKHjZVckNPw.png"" /></figure><p>And, with the medium curling back on itself, the fake quote, usually shop sign or imagined book:</p><figure><img alt=""A fabricated quote, made to look as though it were written in a book then highlighted: “Everything in your life is a reflection of a choice you have made. If you want a different result, make a different choice.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/736/1*ijva-XnO3OWqzkKEenjB_w.jpeg"" /></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a lot of overlap between slock and bait.</p><p>We must demand to know, in all these cases, what we the readers/listeners/watchers gain from this. Were the images and hence gasping faces absent — leaving just the title, account ID and a description — would we all say, “all this needs is someone faking surprise”?</p><h3>Proposals</h3><p>So, what do we do about it? Here are some ideas:</p><h4><strong>Text-only mode (perhaps by default in some cases)</strong></h4><ol><li>All hypertext systems that have a text mode, and should provide a facility for the user to use that mode only, i.e. show text only.</li><li>Users should be able to suppress images <em>ad hoc</em>, or everywhere, at particular times, on particular Internet domains, etc. Ideally, online media would be made to look good without the images.</li><li>One might build, for instance, a text-only social media platform, where images are never shown unless one accesses the particular post where they’re found.</li><li>These settings would be organized as a fractal, with any entity at any level of abstraction capable of setting this parameter.</li><li>For instance, the moderators of a given community on a given social network could set the default setting for the visibility of images, but individual users always have final control.</li></ol><h4><strong>One, the other, or both</strong></h4><ol><li>To dam the production of slock images, publications or we could create a rule something like the following: a post can be previewed either as text (showing the title, author and a snippet) or as image (showing a the title, author, and a thumbnail).</li><li>This way any writer, photographer and publication must make the hard choice: does this image stand alone, or is it merely bait or wallpaper for the accompanying text?</li></ol><p>There is of course the question of what to do with media that has both a legitimate text and image component. I say we create the category, e.g. multimedia feature/comic-book and in such cases preview with an image. This type might have to be prohibited or creatively governed in many freely accessible social media, because it presents the opportunity for skullduggery.</p><p>Accessory media (and particularly images) are a disease of luxury. It’s only because our computers are this powerful and our networks fast that it is even possible. It was different not so long ago, and it changed without, apparently, giving us enough time to built norms to deal with it.</p><p>You might be saying, “But accessory images are a result of human nature/the market, it’s out of our hands.”</p><p>True about human nature and the market, but this fact means we know how to change things. A market is a system — one might say — which determines outcomes via profit and loss. We need to make it pay to build networks that encourage people to be honest with their images.</p><p>We should, therefore:</p><ol><li>Seek out, patronize and build social networks with more sensible policies around images.</li><li>Remind people that images of the sort above are <em>in poor taste.</em></li><li>Never click on a link with an accessory image.</li><li>Never voluntarily use an accessory image.</li></ol><p>Let’s shake off the ennui of learned helplessness and take back our media. Slock-bait is deranging, depressing and distracting: let’s get rid of it. Contrary to popular (usually subconscious) belief, the nature of technological culture is not <em>just the way it is </em>but a function of our decisions, norms and tastes. Let’s quit, therefore, while we still have some control left.</p><p>1 I’m not claiming that this is an exact comparison, only that CNN is widely used and representative of our obsession with images.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=92f43b0d45e9"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/against-images-as-accessories-92f43b0d45e9"">Against images as accessories</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

They behave based on their design. As a result, many systems, even those found in nature, exhibit frequent, common behaviors. Moreover, these behaviors will typically manifest the same problems and issues, so much so that we may even name and categorize them. These are <a href=""https://ctl.mit.edu/sites/ctl.mit.edu/files/attachments/tab%204c%20Pacheco%20-%20system%20archetypes.pdf"">sometimes called archetypes</a>, but I prefer to call them familiar system mechanisms. For designers they are important to know, recognize, and avoid.</p><p><strong>Why Feedback Matters</strong></p><p><a href=""https://deming.org/systems-thinking-feedback-loops/"">Feedback</a> refers to the way systems communicate with individuals. By providing information about the system state and its performance, feedback enables the individual to make decisions (or evaluate system recommendations). It is perhaps one of the most important aspects of systems design.</p><p>Feedback is critical for building system resilience; when errors occur, a system should give feedback about the error and allow for an immediate response to correct the error.</p><p>Think about the simple act of adjusting your shower water temperature. You turn the handle, stick your hand in the water stream, and receive immediate feedback about whether you need to adjust further. This feedback loop — action, measurement, adjustment — is fundamental to how we interact with systems.</p><figure><img alt=""A feedback diagram representing how feedback influences decisions for shower water temperature."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*HR27BtltXVpGjhVn"" /><figcaption>A feedback diagram for adjusting water temperature Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>But not all feedback is immediate. And that’s where things get interesting.</p><p><strong>The Power of Recognizing Familiar System Mechanisms</strong></p><p>Recognizing familiar system mechanisms (FSMs) is important for several reasons:</p><p>First, by recognizing them, you can quickly and accurately predict how the system will act. This knowledge enables you to situate yourself in the position of <a href=""https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/"">highest leverage</a> to alter or improve the output of the system, or to use it to your greatest advantage.</p><p>Second, when FSMs fail, they typically fail in a common and familiar way. This particular way is called <a href=""https://asq.org/quality-resources/fmea?srsltid=AfmBOopzD-3sRK4wAdAfwmwwOXuUiXJp_-2VaxrLpbR-RkCUBgF2PEEA"">a failure mode</a>. Correctly recognizing and categorizing an FSM will enable you to prevent and guard against the most common failure modes quickly and with little effort.</p><p>Third, FSMs provide clarity and agency in the face of complexity. Many problems found in life and business are different manifestations of similar system mechanisms. To recognize this is to empower yourself. As Peter Senge writes in “<a href=""https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChsSEwiGlPWI0JSQAxUzU38AHRSkLCAYACICCAEQABoCb2E&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyNSZA9FSkzRSfU8oAEkhgyHIC3oYPpCLned0Lsgkmns-hk7TN0RO0aApuIEALw_wcB&amp;cid=CAASN-Ro7p02t7zrIE99lr3KKPQTsiEMmszea3aV6W-dh_yCGmIKxIuUYCampmvLlX_PqknYuAXUK9E&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_33&amp;sig=AOD64_3gk13R_6gaoEyz9g4bDPS0YncTxg&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjypu-I0JSQAxX34ckDHXLUOU4Q0Qx6BAgVEAE""><em>The Fifth Discipline</em></a>:”</p><blockquote><em>“Systems archetypes [FSMs] reveal an elegant simplicity underlying the complexity of management issues.

If they are not aware that the system has a feedback delay, or misjudges the delay, they will over or under adjust the controls, or become discouraged from lack of change in the controls.</p><p>A shower provides a great example for this. We all know that the controls of the shower are not instantaneous and that the shower has a startup time associated with getting hot water to the showerhead. Because of experience we allow some time for the system (shower controls, plumbing, hand) to register a change before making further adjustments. And yet despite ample experience, we’ve all been surprised by an icy or excessively hot stream of water as we’ve mistakenly adjusted the controls.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture of a man adjusting the shower with a feedback diagram superimposed on top"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*CHgxWUHBUzeN2W44"" /><figcaption>Source: Author</figcaption></figure><p>The lesson to be learned from this type of scenario is that aggressiveness increases risk and volatility. Stock market bubbles are a macro-level phenomenon of the same mechanism at play. Investors see delayed feedback from their actions, panic, and over-correct, creating wild swings in valuation.</p><p>This mechanism shows up everywhere:</p><ul><li>Dieting and weight loss (results take weeks to show)</li><li>Learning new skills (improvement feels slow initially)</li><li>Economic policy (effects take months or years to materialize)</li><li>Exercise routines (strength gains and muscle growth have delayed feedback)</li></ul><p><em>Mechanism #2: Limits to Growth</em></p><p>In this system mechanism, (of which a famous, <a href=""https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/"">1972 paper was written</a>) the system grows organically, but eventually encounters a limit to continued growth. Actors within the system may be tempted to ignore early signs of the limit to growth or discount it as trivial because of the current success. As the limit goes unaddressed, growth continues to slow. The way for the system to continue to grow is to remove the limit.</p><p>In the NBC sitcom, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/"">The Office</a>, Michael Scott starts his own paper company to compete against his former employer, Dunder Mifflin. By undercutting prices, he steals away Dunder Mifflin’s customers, but as he looks to expand his business, he’s confronted by a startling reality: the prices that are making him successful are also putting him out of business.</p><figure><img alt=""A picture from the NBC sitcom the office, featuring Michael Scott, Pam, and Ryan"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/0*OzCQzbnur4hIZLrP"" /><figcaption>The Michael Scott Paper Company, in it’s heyday.

<h4><em>It’s not taste that will set designers apart from AI. It’s judgment.</em></h4><figure><img alt=""A photo-realistic image of an art studio wall with about a dozen charcoal drawings of figures and drapery pinned for critique, lit by moody fluorescent light with soft shadows."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SCdoTVV0fHpJ6XgbMV1OgA.png"" /><figcaption>Composite AI-created image by author</figcaption></figure><p>There’s that word again. Taste.</p><p>Listen to a few podcasts with designer A talking to designer B in echo chamber C, and you’ll likely hear it a few more times.</p><p><a href=""https://carlbarenbrug.com/taste-matters?ref=sidebar"">We’re talking about taste </a>like it’s the thing that will keep the cyber robots from stealing away our jobs.</p><p>It’s not that I disagree. But I think once again we’ve rushed out of our way to promote <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/the-broken-rhetoric-of-ai-f3a24165899d"">exactly the wrong word</a> to convey what we really mean.</p><h3>Where do I start?</h3><p>When I hear the word <em>taste</em>, I often think about fashion.</p><p>Somebody who dresses well is often considered to have great taste, but what does that really mean? Is it something born within us, or is it developed over time?</p><p>Despite deep respect for people with good fashion sense, there’s a truth that often floats above the mystique of someone’s innate ability to look sharp:</p><blockquote>To dress well is to dress appropriately.</blockquote><p>In other words, forethought to context (e.g. an incoming rainstorm) often plays a part in the senses people see in us.</p><p>When we talk about having taste during our collective AI <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development"">storming and norming</a> phase <em>(to borrow from Tuckman’s group development model)</em>, I know we’re talking about something similar.</p><p>But it also takes time, which leads to experience, which leads to judgment and arbitration — the real words we mean when we talk about taste in this context.</p><h3>Fade to gray</h3><p>When I was in art school, we used to have some bang-out critiques — some real barn burners, if you want to know. Unlike my business-credit-taking dorm buddies, fine art studio sessions were often three-hour jams that culminated in everyone hanging up their work for stark and uncomfortable examination.</p><p>We learned techniques from <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/standing-in-the-shadow-of-giotto-43d0133cfea2"">the old masters</a> to create wonderful studies of light and shadow on objects, scenes, and eventually the human figure, culminating with ourselves in portrait.</p><p>We used sandpaper to sprinkle charcoal dust on heavy paper, creating a mid-tone canvas for adding light with a chamois and a series of erasers. Then darkening with more charcoal, finding and building our tolerance for shape, mood, and eventually meaning.</p><p><em>Pro tip: The secret to finding shadows is simply squinting your eyes.</em></p><p>Regardless of the subject, there was always a time requirement. We were expected to put an hour into our first take-home assignments. Then two. Then three. Then eventually six.</p><p>Six!? Everyone outside of the art program scoffed at this labor-intensive task.</p><p>Once the work was ready to present, my professor — a perky and passionate painter with a Texas drawl — would start at the far left of the wall and make her way across, pointing and smiling at each piece before a word was even spoken.</p><p>She always, without fail, asked the same question starting each student’s critique.</p><h3><em>How many hours?</em></h3><p><em>How many hours? How many hours? How many hours, y’all?</em></p><p>We’d all wait until a fellow student chimed in, giving a rough estimate based on the work in front of us.</p><p><em>Looks more like one to me.</em></p><p>Invariably, the artist would cave — admit to an all-nighter at Blue House or some downtown bar, then finding only a spare 20 minutes over a hungover weekend to throw together a passable representation.</p><p>This admission was necessary because it was always obvious in contrast to the other work. The output always told the story.</p><p>Time is evident in craft. What we put into it is usually what we get out of it.</p><p>What I learned in those classes informs me to this day.</p><p>Quality isn’t automatic. It’s nurtured through time, technique, and feedback from others who are willing to tell us what they see in our own work.</p><p>It’s a process of discovering and defining <a href=""https://articles.centercentre.com/driving-product-teams-to-become-more-design-mature/"">what <em>good</em> looks like</a>. And it comes over time, which is necessary for knowing how our work is received relative to the unforgiving forum of mass perception.</p><p>Compare this with today’s AI slop and the absurd notion of “Look what I did with X number of prompts” — it starts to feel like an oxymoron.</p><p>The idea that <em>taste</em> is the antidote to bad AI decisions simplifies a much more <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/design-is-a-conversation-2af15b555c80"">nuanced conversation</a>.</p><p>And that’s why I think <em>taste</em> isn’t the right word. It’s too foofy.</p><p>Not to mention that in 25 years of doing UX and product design, I’ve never heard a user express any appreciation for the <em>taste</em> of a particular design— let alone the designer. Seldom are products elevated at the surface level that word immediately conjures.</p><h3>In other words</h3><p>What we’re really reaching for isn’t taste. It’s a strong <a href=""https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/taste-is-a-dead-end"">point of view</a>, shaped by memory, practice, and a willingness to stay in the work long enough to know what matters.</p><p>That’s our goal. And it hasn’t really changed.</p><p>Businesses will always want output that’s better, faster, and cheaper.</p><p>But generative AI? I see it more like the charcoal and the eraser — not the finished piece.</p><p>It can help us block in the basics. It might even suggest a direction or tease out a shape we hadn’t seen before. But <em>we</em> should be the ones squinting to see what’s there. AI can’t choose what to leave out, or where to press harder. It doesn’t know when to stop, when to share, or when to start over.</p><p>That’s not subjective taste. That’s practiced judgment.</p><p>And judgment only comes from showing up again and again — building tolerance for ambiguity, seeking critique, and developing the context to make decisions with intent.</p><p>So maybe the next time we reach for “taste” as the thing that separates us from the machine, we take a beat.</p><p>What we really mean is more nuanced.</p><p>What we’re trying to say is: <em>I’ve been here before. I know what good looks like. And I know what to do next — because I’ve put in the hours.</em></p><p>It’s not taste that makes the difference.</p><p>It’s time well spent.</p><h3>Keep in touch</h3><p>If this resonated with you, <a href=""https://medium.com/@mschindler"">follow me</a> on <strong>Medium</strong> for more stories about staying grounded in today’s design culture.</p><p>Find me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschindler"">LinkedIn</a> or my personal website, <a href=""http://mschindler.com/"">mschindler.com</a>.</p><p>Related reading:</p><p><a href=""https://www.doc.cc/syntax/taste"">Taste</a></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b5caacddbec4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-importance-of-taste-and-other-lies-we-tell-ourselves-b5caacddbec4"">The importance of taste, and other lies we tell ourselves</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"
