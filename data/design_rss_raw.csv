Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><p>Being a designer has always been synonymous with being creative, transforming abstract and complex ideas into concrete solutions. However, in recent years, many professionals have been losing this creative spark, and with it, the very essence of the profession. We’ve witnessed an exponential growth of artificial intelligence tools within the creative industry. This, in itself, isn’t a problem; the real risk lies in becoming dependent on these tools.</p><p>Abandoning your own creative capacity and relying on AI to generate design concepts or evaluate solutions is a mistake that can compromise your professional autonomy and creative confidence.</p><p>In this article, I want to discuss why you shouldn’t rely solely on artificial intelligence tools, but instead focus on building your intellectual foundation as a designer. This foundation develops through both theoretical study and consistent practice in real projects; over time, it becomes the cornerstone of your <a href=""https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51038-1_36"">repertoire and professional competence</a>.</p><h3>How to build knowledge in design</h3><p>Before discussing knowledge in design, it’s important to first understand what knowledge actually is. According to the dictionary, knowledge is the act of knowing or the state of being aware of something, whether through reason or experience. This definition highlights three central elements that deserve attention:</p><ul><li><strong>Act of knowing:</strong> understanding a phenomenon — knowing what it is, how it works, and why it works in a certain way.</li><li><strong>Through reason:</strong> acquiring knowledge through reflection, study, and theory.</li><li><strong>Through experience:</strong> referring to tacit knowledge, which is built over time through practice and observation of reality.</li></ul><p>When we bring this definition into the field of design, <a href=""https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2267&amp;context=drs-conference-papers"">knowledge in design</a> means mastering the principles, philosophies, methods, and practices that help us to solve problems in a structured and creative way.</p><blockquote>In the context of interaction design or digital product design, the nature of this knowledge is particularly complex. There is no universal list of skills that defines a good designer.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/u/68e9c90252b3"">André Grilo, Ph.D.</a> (2023), addresses this issue in his <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379221346_Competencias_em_Experiencia_do_Usuario_no_Design_de_Produto_Digital"">doctoral thesis</a> when discussing the competencies of digital product designers. According to Grilo, the field still lacks consensus on which knowledge is essential, precisely because the discipline continues to evolve.</p><p>Even so, companies set expectations, anticipating that designers will perform certain activities and deliver specific results, which is often mistaken for actual professional knowledge.</p><p>This is where we need to be careful: a job description is not synonymous with knowledge. A job description talks about tasks; knowledge concerns the judgment, understanding, and autonomy required to execute those tasks with insight. As Grilo (2023, p.94) points out:</p><blockquote><strong>“There are some epistemological issues in UX Design (UXD) that, in my view, are unavoidable in this theoretical discussion. The first concerns the scope of UX Design, due to its wide range of responsibilities. The second revolves around the relationship of UX with diffuse problems. The third relates to the specificity of User Experience as a construct within the theory of Digital Product Design.”</strong></blockquote><p>Several authors have attempted to define what interaction design and UX are, as well as how the discipline is organized, including Garrett (2001), Saffer (2006), and Six (2010). However, most focus on describing the discipline and its connections with other fields, without clearly specifying the types of knowledge a UX designer must master to excel in their practice.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the famous diagram by <a href=""https://medium.com/u/534e55e898c0"">Dan Saffer</a> (2008). While it is useful for visualizing the intersections and scope of the discipline, the diagram by itself does not reveal anything about the types of knowledge and competencies required for the practice of an interaction designer or a UX designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the disciplines and interdisciplinary connections within UX design"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lPHCuGVD-NU8jxal.jpg"" /><figcaption>Disciplines and Interdisciplinarity in UX. Source: Dan Saffer (2008)</figcaption></figure><p>It is common for designers to feel confused when it comes to professional competencies and skills. The question often arises: Should I know everything about visual design? human factors or usability engineering? This confusion is natural when there is no clear competency model to guide professional development in the field.</p><p>Sometimes, designers wonder which skills are truly necessary to work as an interaction designer or UX designer. There was a time when mastering tools like Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and Flash was enough to be considered a competent interaction designer or web designer. That period produced many excellent software operators, but not all of them were truly designers.</p><p>When many of these professionals were questioned about their design decisions, there was often surprise or even responses like: “Why do you want to know how I did it?” There has always been a certain mystery surrounding designers’ decisions. I believe this is, in part, one of the reasons why our relationship with other professionals, such as developers, has historically been complicated.</p><p>Being unable to justify a design decision is as incoherent as hearing a surgeon, when questioned about a decision during surgery, say that they don’t know or cannot explain. Yet, it is still common to find designers who cannot articulate the reasoning behind their actions, a clear sign of a lack of reflection and professional maturity.</p><p>Being a designer goes beyond knowing how to use tools. The new generation needs to be careful not to fall into the same trap, now fueled by the use of artificial intelligence. The risk is producing professionals who master prompt engineering but do not truly understand the problems they are solving.</p><p>Building knowledge in design requires practice, reflection, and purpose. I personally developed my competence by working directly in the discipline, learning from projects, mistakes, and discoveries, rather than relying on tools. A designer needs to know how to do something and, above all, know why they are doing it that way.</p><p>Every design decision needs to be intentional, never vague or accidental. Design is, by nature, an act of choice, and every choice reveals an intention, whether conscious or not. As I discussed in my article <strong>“</strong><a href=""https://brasil.uxdesign.cc/quando-a-intencao-orienta-o-design-3c603728254f""><strong>When intention drives design</strong></a><strong>”</strong>, designing without intention is like navigating without a compass: you may reach somewhere, but it is unlikely to be the right destination.</p><blockquote>Intentionality is what distinguishes the designer as an author from the designer as an operator. The former creates meaning; the latter merely executes commands.</blockquote><p>Therefore, to build knowledge in design, designers need to understand which competencies they need to develop. Theory can be useful for this, helping to cultivate what Schön calls <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection-in-action</a>, <a href=""https://libguides.hull.ac.uk/reflectivewriting/schon"">reflection on action</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">knowledge-in-action.</a></p><p>However, designers must not forget to apply their knowledge in practice, as this is the ground where understanding is validated and transformed. It is through practice that new theories emerge, new solutions are tested, and the designer truly becomes a reflective practitioner and creator of knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Types of knowledge in design</strong></h3><p>The types of knowledge in design vary greatly, depending on the professional’s experience and the context in which they work. For instance, a digital product designer working in the finance sector will have different competencies from someone working in healthcare, dealing with domain-specific challenges, regulations, and user expectations.</p><p>In the finance sector, there are mandatory trainings related to anti-money laundering, as well as regulations from the central bank, that drive the development of financial software, knowledge that a designer in the healthcare sector may not possess or need. Additionally, the design standards and UX practices applied in each sector are also completely distinct.</p><p>If we analyze the <a href=""https://elizabethbacon.com/the-ux-sundial-model-iterated-now-including-a-0/"">UX competencies</a> proposed by Elizabeth Bacon (2009), we notice a generalization that does not always reflect the reality of the designer. What the professional should know to move beyond tool proficiency and build true intellectual and creative depth.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the field of User Experience (UX)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/0*pUzMClic7_e2daTC.png"" /><figcaption>Field of User Experience. Source: Elizabeth Bacon (2009)</figcaption></figure><p>In the model, disciplines such as information architecture, service design, and interaction design are treated collectively, as if they shared the same set of knowledge. In practice, each of these areas has distinct philosophies, principles, and methods. Evaluating a designer’s knowledge based on such a generalized model can be problematic.</p><p>This reflection reinforces the need for each designer to build their own repertoire and develop critical judgment, adapting their knowledge to the real demands of the context in which they work, rather than relying solely on theoretical models. What will differentiate you from the majority is not following generic standards, but the unique knowledge that only you possess.</p><p>To explore this topic further, I recommend reading my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/becoming-good-at-something-619c1a61e924""><strong><em>“Becoming Good at Something”</em>.</strong></a></p><h3>The knowledge development model</h3><p>Considering the complexity involved in defining the types of knowledge a designer should possess, I propose that knowledge development in design should be structured into three levels: <strong>declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and reflective knowledge.</strong></p><p>This approach applies regardless of whether the professional works as an interaction designer, service designer, or industrial designer.</p><figure><img alt=""The image illustrates the knowledge model proposed by Filipe Nzongo."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AkNv8j4DyEYLAmw5Yyz9Sg.png"" /><figcaption>Knowledge model. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2025)</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Declarative knowledge (knowing what)</strong></h3><p>Declarative knowledge refers to the factual information an individual possesses, including both general and specific knowledge about their environment. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43546-022-00402-3"">Ahmet Demir <em>et al.</em> (2022)</a> explain that declarative knowledge relates to an individual’s understanding and intentions, which are crucial for problem-solving and decision-making.</p><blockquote>In other words, declarative knowledge is connected to the process of learning and recalling information that one already knows.</blockquote><p>Wikipedia provides a broader definition:</p><blockquote><strong>“Declarative knowledge is the awareness of facts that can be expressed through declarative sentences. It is also called theoretical knowledge, descriptive knowledge, propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. It is not restricted to a specific use or purpose and can be stored in books or computers.”</strong></blockquote><p>In my model, I start with declarative knowledge because it establishes the foundation upon which all other learning in design is built. If you want to work as an interaction designer, service designer, or information designer, it is essential to understand the fundamental principles of the discipline, such as typography, visual hierarchy, information architecture, usability heuristics, user-centered design, and so on.</p><p>This type of knowledge is crucial because it enables designers to understand the foundations of their discipline before advancing to specific skills, such as prototyping techniques or the use of generative AI tools. Without this foundation, any practice or decision risks being superficial or disconnected from the critical reasoning necessary to solve complex design problems.</p><p>In declarative knowledge, the focus is on understanding theory. For example, knowing that Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich created the 10 usability heuristics in 1990 for evaluating interactive products, or understanding what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/two-ux-gulfs-evaluation-execution/"">gulfs of execution and evaluation</a> are and their purpose in interface evaluation.</p><p>Furthermore, declarative knowledge serves as a reference for procedural knowledge (knowing how to perform tasks) and reflective knowledge (understanding why a design decision works or fails). It is the starting point for building repertoire and autonomy: knowing what allows the designer to understand the rules of the game before playing it creatively and strategically.</p><h3><strong>Procedural knowledge (Knowing how)</strong></h3><p>Procedural refers to knowledge that depends on a process, rules, or steps. According to <a href=""https://books.google.no/books/about/The_First_person_Point_of_View.html?id=-s7eoQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"">Wolfgang Carl (2014)</a>, procedural knowledge, also called know-how or practical knowledge, is the type of knowledge that manifests in the ability to perform actions effectively, sometimes referred to as imperative or performative knowledge.</p><blockquote><strong>This is the second level of knowledge a designer needs to develop. The model is flexible and can be adapted to any design discipline, serving as a guide to structure learning, practice, and professional development.</strong></blockquote><p>In interaction design or digital product design, this knowledge is reflected in a designer’s ability to carry out concrete tasks, such as conducting a heuristic evaluation, designing user interfaces, prototyping, or organizing navigation flows. In other words, it is not enough to know the theory; one must know how to apply it in practice and demonstrate tangible results.</p><p>There is a fusion between knowing what (declarative knowledge) and knowing how (procedural knowledge), and it is precisely this combination that makes all the difference in a designer’s career. A professional who only masters the theory may understand concepts but will not be able to transform that knowledge into concrete solutions.</p><p>Let’s observe the sketch below, which I created as a simple concept to illustrate the importance of having both declarative and procedural knowledge. When a designer receives a sketch like this from a product manager or design director, they must be able to translate the conceptual idea into a real, functional design.</p><p>However, this transformation requires the designer to have strong declarative knowledge, in other words, a solid grasp of the theory that guides the design process. Being able to translate this sketch into a coherent, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing interface is what separates a professional from an amateur.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept sketch for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iov5AtXIeY6CeXz8u0KeWQ.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, procedural knowledge complements this process by enabling the designer to execute the translation effectively, choosing the right <a href=""https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples"">visual hierarchy, layout structure</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design_pattern"">interaction patterns</a>, and <a href=""https://improvement.stanford.edu/resources/usability-principles"">usability principles</a> to bring the concept to life. It’s not only about knowing what should be done, but also how to do it in a way that preserves both functionality and aesthetic integrity.</p><p>In practice, this means understanding how each design decision affects user perception and behavior, for instance, where to place primary actions or how to balance visual weight. These are not random choices; they emerge from a deep understanding of <a href=""https://dovetail.com/product-development/human-computer-interaction/"">HCI principles</a> and accumulated experience through continuous reflection and iteration.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability to move from concept to execution, grounded in both theoretical and practical knowledge, is what defines true design mastery.</p><figure><img alt=""The image shows a user interface concept for an e-commerce checkout."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_o7AlwYIRI_V0cgklhWvxw.png"" /><figcaption>User Interface concept for E-commerce. Source: Filipe Nzongo (2018)</figcaption></figure><p>The concept above encapsulates several design principles, such as <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/"">chunking</a>, where information is divided into clear, logical sections; <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOoqWJmStmoUZ-85rWbwVkVpfVIiBBSNFcbYNlrIr0FqiSThc9iOV"">Gestalt principles</a>, where related elements are positioned close to one another; and contrast, achieved through the use of <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-hierarchy-ux-definition/"">visual hierarchy</a> to guide the user’s eye. I also applied alignment to create order and readability, and <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space?srsltid=AfmBOophvmeT4OhmzUA4AXQ7OPiDZioAFQb3h6bbLcgHlm8YZ7vdEiCI"">white space to reduce visual clutter, improve legibility</a>, and allow the eyes to rest during scanning.</p><p>Additionally, the design adheres to good practices from Nielsen’s usability heuristics, such as prioritizing <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/recognition-and-recall/"">recognition over<em> recall</em></a>. For instance, using logos (“FedEx,” “UPS,” “Sedex” etc.) instead of plain text makes it easier for users to recognize and select an option quickly.</p><blockquote>An interface is never just a simple arrangement of elements; it embodies a series of reflections and intentional decisions made by the designer to make it what it is.</blockquote><p>Through this example, I aim to demonstrate that being a designer extends far beyond knowing how to operate tools; it’s about understanding the rationale behind every design decision and the purpose of the proposed solution.</p><h3><strong>Reflective knowledge (Knowing why)</strong></h3><p>Reflective knowledge is the ability to understand why we are approaching a design problem in a certain way. It goes beyond knowing what (declarative) and knowing how (procedural); it involves understanding the reasons behind choices, anticipating consequences, and adjusting decisions based on context and experience.</p><p>Donald Schön calls this <a href=""https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&amp;context=eandc"">reflection-in-action</a>, which is real-time thinking during the execution of a task, when the designer observes, adjusts, and decides while acting on the problem. He also describes reflection-on-action, which is the retrospective analysis of what happened after the action, allowing one to learn from experience and improve future design decisions.</p><p>In the design context, professionals are constantly alternating between these two modes of reflection. When testing an interface, for example, a designer immediately evaluates the impact of a change (reflection-in-action) and later revisits the process to understand what worked or didn’t, and why (reflection-on-action).</p><p>This continuous cycle builds repertoire, strengthens critical judgment, and enables designers to make informed decisions without relying exclusively on external tools, such as AI.</p><h3><strong>AI is an ally, not a substitute</strong></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence has become a widely discussed topic among designers. Yet, the question that arises most often is: <strong>Will we be replaced?</strong> It’s still too early to give a definitive answer.</p><p>Although the exponential growth of generative AI worries many designers, it’s important to emphasize that it is an ally, not a replacement for human competence. We still master our craft. This isn’t the first time designers have faced new technologies, and adaptation has always been part of the discipline’s natural evolution.</p><p>When I say AI is an ally, I mean it can be great for accelerating repetitive tasks, organizing information, or generating initial design alternatives — but it doesn’t guarantee creativity or critical judgment.</p><blockquote>A designer’s judgment is grounded in declarative, procedural, and reflective knowledge — the foundation of their professional repertoire.</blockquote><p>This repertoire enables designers to perceive nuances, prioritize problems, and propose appropriate interventions. AI, no matter how advanced, lacks this repertoire: it doesn’t <em>see</em> the interface the way you do, nor does it understand the intention behind your design choices.</p><p>In my article <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-can-humans-and-intelligent-computers-work-together-d349328ce270""><strong>How can humans and computers work together</strong></a>, I discuss how our relationship with intelligent machines should be one of mutual support, not dependence.</p><p>What new-generation designers must be careful about is becoming overly dependent on AI. My appeal to designers is this: let’s not outsource our cognitive capacity. <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6"">Research shows that excessive reliance on AI can lead to dependency and a reduction in cognitive ability.</a> Moderation is always essential.</p><p>In the past, when I worked as a graphic designer, even though there were plenty of websites offering graphic bundles and mockups, I made a point of creating my own. For a simple reason: knowing how to make something is better than just using something ready-made. Moreover, creating your own assets helps you stand out; it’s what builds repertoire, practical skills, and professional identity.</p><p>For digital product designers, for example, AI can generate a list of applicable heuristics, but it’s up to you, the designer, to actually evaluate the interface: to identify which heuristics have been violated, which have not been met, and from there, propose solutions to address the interface’s problems.</p><p>Without the kinds of knowledge I described earlier, you won’t be able to spot flaws, let alone suggest improvements, much like trying to judge a case without knowing the laws that govern it.</p><p>Learn to evaluate an interface like a specialist. That’s what allows you to grow as a professional and develop practical, <a href=""https://design-instability.com/tacit-knowledge-and-skills"">tacit knowledge</a>. A designer must be capable of tackling the problem in front of them, not through external tools, but through the knowledge developed over years of study and practice.</p><p>Your intellectual repertoire grows through practice, study, and reflection. Every interface you evaluate, every prototype you test, every design decision you discuss with peers, all of it contributes to building your judgment. This accumulation of experience is what turns information into applicable knowledge, not just data that can be fed into a machine.</p><p>A designer cannot expect AI to do everything for them. They must build their knowledge through study and hands-on experience — collaborating with other professionals, both more and less experienced. Use AI as your creative ally, not your crutch.</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>To conclude, the message I want to leave for designers is that, in the age of AI, what will truly set you apart in an increasingly competitive market is your intellectual capacity. Building knowledge is more important than mastering tools. New technologies come and go, but knowledge remains. Knowing how to create, thinking critically, and reflecting on your own work are values no one can take away from you.</p><p>What distinguishes an excellent designer from an amateur is not the speed of delivery, but the ability to create projects aligned with both user and business goals, combined with solid technical mastery.</p><p>That’s why you should prioritize building knowledge in design: study, practice, and talk to people who know more than you. Mastering a tool doesn’t make you a designer. Next, learn to identify what you don’t know yet, map your knowledge gaps, and work to fill them with new skills that will drive your professional growth.</p><p>Finally, understand that AI is an ally, not a substitute for human competence. Use it as support, but maintain your ability to think, create, and decide for yourself. Developing creative autonomy is what will ensure you remain relevant, with or without the tools of the moment.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=aaec674d5532"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hey-designer-do-you-know-what-you-are-doing-aaec674d5532"">Hey designer, do you know what you are doing?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

It’s as if I’m sitting at the bedside of a dying loved one, dreading the moment they’ll no longer be with us.</p><p>Design isn’t a person, per se, but for many of us it is — or was — a meaningful part of our lives. And the notion that design, as we know it, may wither feels almost certain.</p><p>My main prediction has been that AI will become so ubiquitous and efficient it will absorb nearly every experience that once required traditional design as a mediator.</p><p>This isn’t a doom-and-gloom prediction — it’s a <a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">rational conclusion</a> drawn from the current trajectory of the industry and what highly respected professionals have also expressed.</p><blockquote>I am becoming more convinced that this [the shift toward users interacting with their agents rather than websites] will mark the end of user interface design as we know it.</blockquote><blockquote>—<a href=""https://jakobnielsenphd.substack.com/p/no-more-ui"">Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of Nielsen Norman Group</a></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this does not bode well for those just entering the design field. Especially for designers with hopes of creating and building in the same way many of us were once fortunate to be part of.</p><p>However, despite all the negative commentary and predictions surrounding AI, I often witness a naïve optimism among students and junior designers — a kind of defense mechanism that shields them from the harsher realities of the field.</p><p>And maybe that’s exactly why new designers are so vital right now. Their hope is born of ignorance — and I don’t mean that negatively. I mean ignorance in the way that fosters curiosity and openness to possibility. And that’s precisely what the industry needs.</p><p>Maybe people like me are too cynical, too rational, too caught up in how the world works today to see a different path. But if there’s one truth about humans it’s that we’re anything but rational creatures.</p><p>In fact, a disregard for conventional wisdom — especially in young minds — can open a doorway to new ideas.</p><p>They say <a href=""https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/nickskillicorn/2023/06/evidence-that-children-are-more-creative-than-adults-and-the-opposite/"">children are more creative than adults</a> because they are not tethered by rules and restraints. Even in <a href=""https://updevelopment.org/3-metamorphoses-nietzsches-map-human-growth/"">Nietzsche’s metamorphosis</a>, the final stage of transformation is to a child—representing the ability to experience the world with fresh eyes — unchained by the cultural “thou shalt” directives we’re fed.</p><p>So perhaps there is hope for design, and by extension, designers.</p><p>Perhaps I’m too jaded, too overconfident in believing that if someone like me cannot see the path, then no path exists.</p><p>Maybe instead of thinking it is the end of design, we have faith that those who still dream will pave the way for something new — design that transcends anything we can imagine now.</p><p>It’s time we — I — stop pretending to predict and instead encourage those who will shape a future we want to live in, in ways we have yet to imagine.</p><p>And it begins with humility — with accepting our limitations. And continues with freeing design from the confines of the digital or physical canvas, giving future generations something greater — a cultural canvas, a medium free from the technical restrictions of their forebears.</p><p>Because neither big tech, industry, nor professionals like myself should define the boundaries of creativity and the future of humanity.</p><p><strong><em>Don’t miss out! </em></strong><a href=""https://micbuckcreative.medium.com/subscribe""><strong><em>Join my email list</em></strong></a><strong><em> and receive the latest content.</em></strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9c41a4a51c14"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-rests-on-childlike-ignorance-9c41a4a51c14"">The future of design rests on childlike ignorance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

It’s the craft of shaping written language into a visual experience — how words look, breathe, and interact on a page or screen. Good typography quietly guides the reader, while poor typography shouts for attention in all the wrong ways. Every detail — from letter spacing to line height — affects how users read, feel, and engage. Let’s unpack the essentials.</p><p>Every letter has a structure, and understanding it helps you design with precision. Terms like <em>ascender</em>, <em>descender</em>, <em>baseline</em>, and <em>x-height</em> describe the invisible skeleton that keeps type coherent. The x-height, for instance, determines how big a typeface feels even at the same point size.</p><p>Serif and sans-serif typefaces differ in tone partly because of these structures: serifs guide the eye along lines of text, while sans-serifs often feel cleaner and more modern. Knowing anatomy allows you to mix typefaces consciously rather than by vibe alone.</p><h3>Typographic Anatomy</h3><figure><img alt=""A large black uppercase ‘X’ is shown with orange dashed lines illustrating its body width and x-height.

In UI design, type must perform at small sizes and varying screens. In print, it must hold character at high resolutions and long durations.</p><p>Display type can afford drama; body text should feel invisible. Understanding how context shapes your typographic decisions is what separates art from noise.</p><figure><img alt=""The heading ‘Lining numbers’ with subtitle ‘some fonts have numbers that are all the same height’ appears above two rows of numerals from 1 to 0.

Once you see how subtle its impact is, you start noticing type everywhere: on screens, in streets, on receipts. Every font choice tells a story. The more fluently you speak the language of type, the more precisely you can design experiences that speak back.</p><p>Typography has a strange power: it’s both invisible and unforgettable. The best type never demands your attention, yet it defines how every word feels. A letter’s curve can suggest warmth or precision, while spacing can create calm or urgency. This is why typography sits at the heart of design — connecting language with emotion.</p><p>So when we adjust a line height or choose between Helvetica and Garamond, we’re not just picking styles; we’re shaping how people interpret meaning. Typography is the quiet storyteller behind every interface, poster, and page.

There was no need to open menus, switch applications, or decide which interface to use next. Every option that could have slowed him down was already resolved for him, so his attention stayed on the task itself.</p><figure><img alt=""A still from Iron Man 2 showing J.A.R.V.I.S. (voiced by Paul Bettany) providing a translucent holographic iron-man suit interface on the workbench while Tony Stark looks on, illustrating how he seamlessly issues voice-commands to assemble and control different modules."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fbBY5ezgbkRINKZo3mvJ1g.jpeg"" /><figcaption>The scene captures J.A.R.V.I.S.’ natural-language interface giving Tony instant access to multiple suit configurations and diagnostics with a single command.</figcaption></figure><p>That kind of experience is exactly what OpenAI is now reaching for. In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I"">Brad Lightcap’s recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, he shared a vision where third-party apps could work together seamlessly inside ChatGPT. Users would never have to leave a conversation to get something done.</p><blockquote>“It’s the contextual aspect of ‘I’m doing X’ or ‘I need Y’ — I’m on a road trip and I want to know what playlist would go well with this… — that allows you to use ChatGPT to solve higher-level tasks and integrate apps contextually,” <em>said </em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY2HVBIZ6I""><em>Brad Lightcap in a Bloomberg interview.</em></a></blockquote><p>For designers, the real challenge lies in understanding what this shift implies. When conversations become the new interface and tools can appear contextually, how should we design the flow, timing, and handoff between chat and visual elements?</p><h3>Evolution from plugins, MCP, to SDK</h3><p>To understand what this shift truly means for design, we first need to look at how the system evolved.</p><p>In the early days of plugins, tools lived in separate spaces. Users had to switch between apps, browser extensions, or new tabs to complete even the simplest task.</p><p>Then came the Model Context Protocol, or MCP. It created a standard way for ChatGPT to talk with external tools and data sources. MCP allowed the model to call a tool and pass structured information through a single, consistent channel. It was an invisible bridge between the model and the outside world.</p><p>Building on that foundation, OpenAI introduced the <strong>Apps Software Development Kit (SDK),</strong> a toolkit that makes this bridge visible and interactive. It determines <em>when</em> a tool appears, <em>how</em> it looks, and <em>how</em> people can interact with it directly inside the chat. With the SDK, users can engage directly with apps through buttons, cards, or widgets without leaving the conversation.</p><figure><img alt=""A preview of multiple mobile screens showing third-party apps like Tunedrop, Brick &amp; Basil, and BeatBot running inside ChatGPT’s interface, where users can browse maps, playlists, and restaurant cards directly within the chat window."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hej5hziRSjflrud8yVOxhw.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how integrated apps visually coexist within ChatGPT’s conversation interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>How the apps SDK boosts efficiency and product growth</h3><p>At this point, designers can probably already imagine how the Apps SDK begins to reshape the user experience. In essence, the SDK embodies the logic behind <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>: it reduces the visual noise that slows decision-making and shortens the physical distance between intention and completion.</p><p>Take Coursera for example. Previously, a learner exploring UX courses might spend minutes choosing which platform to open, typing “UX design” into a search bar, scrolling through long lists, and clicking in and out of pages to check ratings or instructors. Every choice added a moment of hesitation, fragmenting attention and stretching the time it took to act.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Coursera’s University of Michigan portal showing search results for “UX design,” with multiple course cards, filters for subjects and skills, and sorting options that make the interface visually dense and choice-heavy."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Vl6K_9wrgCzci7iXZ_LfcA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from Coursera’s page illustrating how users face a complex, multi-step interface when searching for UX design courses. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/programs/university-of-michigan-mrofm/browse?authProvider=umich&amp;query=ux+design&amp;source=search""><em>Coursera — University of Michigan UX Design Search</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>However, Coursera’s integration with ChatGPT illustrates a successful application of Hick’s Law principles, significantly reducing decision complexity. A learner can simply ask a question with natural language inside ChatGPT’s text field. A video preview of relevant courses then appears directly within the chat, reducing the number of immediate choices presented to the learner. Learners no longer needs to spend time filtering or comparing endless options in a long, scrolling list, thereby simplifying the selection process and dramatically decreasing the reaction time required to commit to a course.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a Coursera video playing directly inside ChatGPT, where a user naturally asks follow-up questions about UX design concepts through text conversation, demonstrating seamless course discovery and learning."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Tqh-N6IQS_bT0pK2BbtbLw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image illustrating how users can search for and explore UX design courses on Coursera directly within ChatGPT using natural language prompts. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Some in-house designers might wonder what is the impact on their products. If users can complete tasks entirely inside ChatGPT, would they still visit the original app?</p><p>This concern is reasonable because the SDK might reduce users’ page-level engagement within the native environment. Yet the same decreased friction of opening the app can also widen the app’s reach. By allowing users to call the app directly within ChatGPT, the SDK raises visit frequency among existing members and opens the door for non-members to try it for the first time.</p><p>The experience no longer depends on downloading, logging in, or navigating to a separate website. Each interaction inside ChatGPT becomes an entry point that can lead to higher engagement and new conversions, expanding the app’s reach without adding extra steps.</p><h3>Designing experiences that belong in a conversation</h3><p>After understanding the broader impact of the Apps SDK, designers can start thinking about how to shape these experiences in practice.</p><p>Designing for the SDK means clearly defining who the users are, what their goals look like in context, and which parts of their workflow feel most natural to complete through conversation. The task must be specific enough for ChatGPT to assist, yet simple enough to avoid overwhelming the interaction.</p><p>OpenAI offers several guiding questions to help designers identify good use cases, each of which can also be viewed through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s Law</a>, showing how the SDK minimizes the number of decisions users need to make. Ask yourself:</p><ul><li><em>How do your user task fit naturally into a conversation? (for example, booking, ordering, scheduling, quick lookups)</em></li><li><em>Is it time-bound or action-oriented? (short or medium duration tasks with a clear start and end)</em></li><li><em>Is the information valuable in the moment? (users can act on it right away or get a concise preview before diving deeper)</em></li><li><em>Can it be summarized visually and simply? (one card, a few key details, a clear CTA)</em></li><li><em>Does it extend ChatGPT in a way that feels additive or differentiated?</em></li></ul><p>Designers should also avoid designing interfaces that:</p><ul><li><em>Display long-form or static content better suited for a website or app.</em></li><li><em>Require complex multi-step workflows that exceed the inline or fullscreen display modes.</em></li><li><em>Use the space for ads, upsells, or irrelevant messaging.</em></li><li><em>Surface sensitive or private information directly in a card where others might see it.</em></li><li><em>Duplicate ChatGPT’s system functions (for example, recreating the input composer).</em></li></ul><p>From most of these principles, we can notice that OpenAI encourages designers to <strong>avoid tasks that involve too many steps</strong>, or think about what <strong>information is valuable</strong> to show on the interface.</p><p>Take Figma SDK for example. The workflows like converting a short piece of text into a user flow represents a much stronger use case. It is easier for users to describe with natural language, and this information can immediate be summarized into visual feedback that users can act on right away.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot showing a user asking ChatGPT to convert a hand-drawn user-flow sketch into a digital diagram using the Figma app, with the finished flowchart displayed directly within the chat interface."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2LIxFdzjGAmW0XgFWsv2ew.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Image demonstrating how users can generate a complete user-flow diagram in Figma through a simple natural-language request and sketches inside ChatGPT. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/""><em>OpenAI — Introducing Apps in ChatGPT</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>In contrast, designing a complex design system with ChatGPT may not be a good user case. Because it require both users and computers to access complicate information on multiple design pages, and users have to constantly make fragmented decisions and repeatedly step in to guide the AI, which interrupts the flow of interaction and increases the overall time to complete a task.</p><p>For designers, building for the Apps SDK starts with defining a clear, focused task. ChatGPT favors apps that serve a single, well-scoped purpose, something users can complete in one short interaction. <strong>Try to describe your user’s key goal in plain language, outline its input and output, and make sure it fits naturally into a conversation.</strong></p><h3>Designing Interfaces that belong in a conversation</h3><p>OpenAI also provides a set of UI guidelines that can be examined through the lens of <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/hick-s-law-making-the-choice-easier-for-users"">Hick’s</a> and <a href=""https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/B9780128182024000131"">Fitts’s Law</a>.</p><p>For example, designers should display <strong>only the most relevant information</strong> and present it in a simple visual form, such as a clean card with a short list of three key items.</p><p>The guidelines also suggest limiting each card to a maximum of two primary actions: one main call to action and one optional secondary choice. These approach helps users <strong>find what they need without navigating through layers of menus or dense tables</strong>, allowing them to act more quickly.</p><figure><img alt=""Illustration showing four examples of poor interface patterns for ChatGPT Apps SDK — multiple views, deep navigation, redundant features, and vertical scrolling — each marked with a red “X” to highlight unnecessary complexity."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*di-MpBfsMeBYsiC1lUbCeA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines emphasizing that ChatGPT app interfaces should avoid complex navigation and redundant elements. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Primary actions are usually placed at the bottom of the card, effectively <strong>reducing the distance the thumb-pointer must travel</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing labeled interface elements within ChatGPT Apps SDK cards, including titles, edit controls, expandable maps, item lists, and primary action buttons like “Directions,” demonstrating structured layout design."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XzRY1Kz1PJX62MTAYGBbuA.png"" /><figcaption>Image from OpenAI’s Apps SDK Design Guidelines illustrating how different UI components are organized consistently within ChatGPT’s in-chat interface. <em>Source: </em><a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines""><em>OpenAI — Apps SDK Design Guidelines</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>When a card contains richer media such as images, maps, or interactive diagrams, the expand option can open a fullscreen view.

The focus moves <strong>toward designing flows, contexts, and systems</strong> that help users think clearly and act confidently. Designers must learn to define how an AI communicates, makes decisions, and aligns with human goals.</p><p>Yet no matter how advanced the system becomes, there will always be a need to clarify what people truly need, and bringing that clarity to complexity to just simple interactions.</p><h3>References:</h3><p>Bloomberg Originals.

<h4>Beneath Spotify’s algorithmic charm lies a growing problem: a platform flooded with songs made by no one.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zfXa_RV7wghv9shRcO7ycw.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a robot singing and playing Guitar</figcaption></figure><p>Music has always been important in my household. I have fond and vivid memories of mornings starting off the day with my dad playing Ottis Redding’s Sitting on the Dock of the Bay on the record player. Music was how we connected. So over the years, he’d send me Spotify recommendations, mostly stuck in the ’60s, oftentimes some repetitive blues songs, I’d happily listen, grateful for that small bridge between generations and to connect with my dad.</p><p>Then one morning, that bridge cracked.</p><h3>The fake artist incident</h3><p>My dad texted me: <em>“Have you heard of Mel McCoy from the Country Bayou Blues Band?”</em> Attached was a Spotify link and an image of a haggard old blues man in a cowboy hat. While my knowledge of wrinkly blues men ain’t bad, I hadn’t heard of him…because well, he didn’t exist. The song was AI-generated, a synthetic blues track wrapped in a fake persona.</p><p>That small exchange, sent a jolt through me. It made me realize how quickly the ground beneath us was shifting. Spotify was now quietly filling with music made by absolutely no one at all.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/630/0*55WU9Pc0Fb0iBzXT.jpg"" /><figcaption>AI image of blue man named Mel McCoy</figcaption></figure><h3>Spotify’s AI crackdown (the numbers that don’t add up)</h3><p>Recently, Spotify announced that it had removed more than <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-09-25/spotify-strengthens-ai-protections/""><strong>75 million “spammy” AI-generated tracks</strong></a> from the platform. Hard to believe as they purport to have just over <a href=""https://newsroom.spotify.com/company-info/"">100 million tracks in total</a>, which would mean more than half of its entire catalogue was removed if taken at face value. The company framed it as a victory for authenticity, but the scale strains belief and it its true that nearly two-thirds of their music was AI generated, then that is a grave proposition.</p><p>If there were truly that many synthetic songs circulating, then AI-generated music isn’t some fringe experiment, it’s a massive part of the musical ecosystem. And if the number is inflated, then Spotify is trying to control the narrative rather than the problem. Either way, the message is clear: AI music is no longer a nightmare of Spotify’s future. It’s the present.</p><p>In some ways, it feels like Spotify has been preparing us for this shift for years. Its earliest “AI” features felt benign verging on kinda fun! Personalized recommendations, <em>Discover Weekly</em>, and shared “Blend” playlists that merged two people’s tastes to create a musical mutant baby. Then came <em>Daylists</em>, those weirdly specific playlists titled things like <em>spaced out international wednesday afternoon</em>. Note by note, Spotify has moved from being a place to explore music to a place where music finds you.</p><p>I admit, these features are annoyingly convenient. But they beg a deeper question: what problem is Spotify really trying to solve?</p><p>Unfortunately the answer is obvious, like every platform these days, its engagement. Keep you listening for as long as possible. That’s why songs automatically roll into “radio” mode after they end, and why playlists refresh endlessly.</p><p>At first, I loved it. It felt like I had a tiny DJ whose only job was to find me music to listen to. But eventually I realized that those recommendations don’t actually mirror how I used to discover music. I used to discover music through friends, conversations, cafés, record stores, or god forbid, even the radio!</p><p>It might sound quaint or cheugy, but discovery used to be an act of active participation. Music discovery was something you <em>got to do</em>, not something that was done <em>for</em> you.</p><p>Music is a deeply personal experience, which is very different from a deeply <strong>personalized</strong> one. And because we don’t understand how Spotify’s algorithms steer us, it’s hard to know whose interests they really serve. Maybe they’re agnostic, maybe they just wanna be like an enthusiastic record store employee (I know it’s an oxymoron) but more likely, their purpose isn’t sharing art that they care about, it’s retention!</p><h3>The quiet rise of AI music</h3><p>Over the past year, AI-generated music on Spotify has exploded. Despite public statements about regulation and moderation, the company’s behavior suggests a more grey relationship with synthetic sound.</p><p>In 2024, <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/legal/end-user-agreement/"">Spotify updated its <strong>User Agreemen</strong></a><strong>t</strong> to give itself broad, perpetual rights over anything users upload or create. Many artists feared that language could allow the company to train AI systems on their recordings or generate derivative tracks, a concern Spotify dismissed but never fully clarified.</p><p>The fear is obvious, Spotify could use its vast dataset, every stream, skip, and playlist to generate music that sounds “good enough” to replace the real thing. By leveraging artists’ work, it could create AI versions of them, cut out the original creators, and pocket the difference. It sounds dystopian, but economically, it makes sense. Spotify’s business model rewards quantity over quality. AI-generated music offers infinite supply at almost no cost.</p><p>You might think, well, I would never listen and fully enjoy AI music but I know from experience that more and more you won’t know. A lot of people, myself included have become passive participants in this weird musical system. When we pick playlists “for vibes” Chill Jazz, Study Lo-Fi, Relaxing Guitar, we rarely check who made the tracks. And those playlists are rife with artists that are aliases for production collectives or outright AI projects. The music is serviceable, mood-fitting, and free of friction. But every AI track streamed is a quiet rehearsal for a world where human artistry might become optional.</p><p>My mom, for example, listens to AI music happily. She finds it catchy and harmless. She doesn’t go to concerts, so why does it matter who made the song? My dad, meanwhile, has become paranoid. He now messages me links, asking, “Is this one real?”</p><p>Between them lies the cultural crossroads we’re all standing at: comfort on one side, paranoia on the other.</p><h3>Follow the incentives</h3><p>For Spotify, the math is hard to ignore: AI-generated songs mean no royalties, no scheduling conflicts, no egos. Just endless, on-brand audio that never sleeps. For musicians, that means competing not with each other but with tailor made algorithms that can make a million forgettable songs overnight.</p><p>We’re already seeing this battle spill into court. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/25/record-labels-sue-ai-song-generator-apps-copyright-infringement-lawsuit""><strong>Universal Music Group</strong> and the <strong>RIAA</strong> have sued AI startups like <strong>Suno</strong> and <strong>Udio</strong></a> for training on copyrighted works without permission. Those cases will define whether training an AI on music constitutes infringement and the outcome will determine how far platforms like Spotify can go before crossing a legal line.</p><p>If those lawsuits fail, the floodgates open.</p><p>In my opinion, Spotify isn’t resisting AI, it’s refining it. The company’s policies and incentives point toward a future where the platform doesn’t just <em>curate</em> music but <em>creates</em> it. Probably a bit paranoid, but in this age of AI where everything seems to quickly get gobbled up and regurgitated by LLM’s its not an unreasonable paranoia. I hope for a future where we could simply filter out AI generated music. <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-07-31/spotifys-ceo-owns-an-ai-weapons-company-some-musicians-say-its-time-to-leave"">Spotify doesn’t seem to mind so far and their morally grey track record makes me worry.</a> I hope things don’t go in this direction, because for me, music without a maker isn’t music at all.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=a4d6729c715b"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/spotify-has-an-ai-problem-a4d6729c715b"">Spotify has an AI problem</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>Prioritise meaning over features.</h4><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*djntMZYajhgtJ0eDUHS_Sw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Apple’s Think Different narrative ad, © Apple Inc</figcaption></figure><p>We, human beings, are fundamentally narrative creatures. We all need a story to live, our brains are wired to make sense of our world and ourselves through stories. Friedrich Nietzsche said, “<em>He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”</em>. Stories attempt to answer our why questions.</p><p>Earliest cave paintings and the latest Pixar movie are a testament to our enduring fascination with stories. We will continue to be captivated by them even through the times of AI.</p><h4><strong>Why narrative matters</strong></h4><p>Jordan Peterson says, “<em>It is the near-simultaneous discovery by literary critics, researchers into robotics and artificial intelligence, cognitive scientists and neuropsychologists alike that we do and even must perceive reality through a story. Or more accurately, they discovered that a story is a portrayal of the structure through which we perceive reality.”</em></p><p>Our world is too complex to navigate without direction and purpose. To help us make sense of our reality, we create narratives that help filter and focus on what matters.</p><p>The real-life stories that inspire us, the fictional stories that stretch our imagination, business stories that motivate us, and ideological stories that unite or divide us evolve into overarching meta-narratives we inhabit, whether we are aware of it or not. Surprisingly, we are often drawn to the ones that help us cope with our struggles and the wounds we carry. They attempt to provide answers to our deeper human need for identity, belonging, significance, purpose, and transcendence.</p><p>For example, “<em>The American Dream</em>” is a popular cultural meta-narrative in which the story of prosperity and success is attainable through hard work, grit, and determination. “<em>Rags to Riches</em>” is another story archetype of a journey from poverty or obscurity to a position of great wealth, success, or fame. Many such meta-narratives exist. They could be of a political, cultural, ethnic, historical, or religious nature.</p><p>It is essential to recognise that we all inhabit such meta-narratives, and they hold utmost importance personally. Whatever doesn’t fit one’s narrative often fails to register as meaningful or important.</p><p>When a business wants to be successful, the narratives its customers inhabit, shaped by the challenges they face, the emotions they experience, and the aspirations they strive for, must be at the heart of the company’s story.</p><h4><strong>Understanding story design</strong></h4><p>Steve Jobs, the great business storyteller, said, “<em>The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come.”</em></p><p>However, in 1983, when he launched Lisa, he released a nine-page ad in the New York Times, explaining all its technical features, which nobody outside of NASA was interested in. The computer failed. But after he left Apple, his experience at Pixar or Nike’s <em>‘Just do it’ </em>campaign may have convinced him of the power of story. That’s why when he returned, his understanding of the business changed. He focused on the emotions, frustrations, and aspirations of their customers who felt they were the crazy ones, misfits and rebels. Then he said to them, “<em>Think different”</em></p><p>Earlier, Apple’s story was all about itself. Its new story is its customer’s story. “<em>(1) It identified what their customers wanted (to be seen and heard), (2) idefined their customers’ challenges (that people did not recognise their hidden genius), and (3) offered their customers a tool they could use to express themselves emotionally (computers and smartphones).</em>”</p><p>While facilitating <em>Kintsugi Story</em> workshops at <em>Mountain Retreat</em>, I am slowly coming to learn how different circumstances draw us to particular narratives. They could be our existential needs, psychological wounds, childhood formation, past experiences, social status, and so on.</p><p>In a story, what the character wants and aspires to become is often perceived as a cure for the fears/trauma the character encountered in the past.</p><p>In fiction writing, they call it a character’s ghost; it is something in your character’s past that haunts him in the present. Every person carries their past wounds and struggles. Our perception of our world is shaped by the wounds and fears that our past experiences have created. These may not always be very traumatic incidents; they could be small feelings of neglect, inability or instability, etc., during childhood. Fortunately for some, those wounds heal, leaving scars nevertheless.</p><p>Apple’s core audience for its personal computer was artists, designers, and students, who often felt like outsiders in the technology space. They felt people did not recognise their hidden genius; they felt neglected. Apple echoed their emotions and praised their perceived identity as the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels. The <em>Think Different</em> narrative resonated with these people because Apple cared about their frustrations and told a transformative story.</p><p>I want to call Steve Jobs a great business story-thinker, not just a storyteller, because he designed his business around his customers’ narrative. He created products and services that showed a better future. This created a lasting impact on his customers because he empathised with their emotional needs and the fears they carried.</p><p>It is debatable whether Apple’s products truly created a positive impact on our generation. That is a different topic for another day. Nevertheless, the influence was deeper. Story thinking is a powerful skill to either positively transform people or manipulate them. People in power always use it for the latter goal.</p><p>Most people are often ignorant of the narratives we inhabit. But, when someone articulates the story they’re living, it creates a moment of recognition — <em>‘Yes, that’s exactly how I feel.’ </em>Rene Girard said, <em>“Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.”</em></p><p>Our desires and our narratives are mediated through others, especially our models. Models are those who we are captivated by, those with lofty aims, and we wish, if we are brave, we could be possessed by their spirit. We not only desire the things that they desire, but we also desire to become like them. <em>“All desire is a desire for being.” </em>― Rene Girard.</p><p>If businesses need to make sense to their customers, they need to articulate their story through their models. When people buy Apple products, they are buying into Steve Jobs’ narrative that misfits, creatives, and rebels can become geniuses just like him.</p><p>Apple doesn’t sell computers; they sell “<em>think different</em>”. It’s a narrative about creativity, rebellion against conformity, and belonging to an elite tribe of geniuses.</p><p>Nike doesn’t sell shoes; they sell “<em>the athlete in you</em>”. It’s a ‘hero’s journey’ narrative about overcoming obstacles and achieving one’s potential.</p><p>However, narratives are not just the stories we tell our customers. First, it is the customer’s story we tell ourselves, and then let it inform us in creating products that meet their needs.</p><p>Donald Miller says, “<em>What most brands miss, however, is that there are three levels of problems a customer encounters. In stories, heroes encounter external, internal and philosophical problems. Why? Because these are the same three-level problems human beings face in their everyday lives.</em>” To put it simply, an external problem, which is often tangible, causes our customers to experience an internal frustration, which is philosophically wrong!</p><p>In an era of abundance, great products don’t just solve surface-level problems — they help us become who we want to be. The more brands address the deeper needs for identity, belonging, significance, purpose and transcendence, the more they connect with customers and the broader industry and culture. Mere utility-centred products can be quickly replaced.</p><p>Does it make sense only for multi-billion-dollar companies? No, even a mom-and-pop shop that is empathetic to customers’ needs, fears, and aspirations can become successful.</p><p>Moreover, narrative design is not just for the MVP stage; it is a continuous effort, as narratives must evolve in tandem with cultures.</p><h4><strong>Designing narrative products</strong></h4><p>To build the right narrative for our customers, we need to strengthen our right-hemisphere thinking in our organisations. Unfortunately, most product design and development is dominated by left-hemisphere thinking.</p><p>McGilchrist, in his book ‘<em>The master and his emissary’</em>, argues that the two hemispheres don’t divide tasks by type (logical vs. creative), but rather by how they attend to the world. The left hemisphere offers narrow, focused attention — it grasps things in isolation, categorises, and manipulates. It sees the world as static, knowable, and mechanical. We end up building what we can measure, not what matters. However, the right hemisphere provides broad, sustained attention — it perceives context, relationships, and the whole. It remains open to what is new, ambiguous, and alive.</p><p>He uses the bird foraging for food while watching out for predators as a central analogy for the two hemispheres’ different and often competing modes of attention.</p><p>Narratives are fundamentally right-hemisphere phenomena. You can’t understand a story by dissecting it into data points or features. Narrative dead products may work efficiently, but they lack significance on a deeper level. A more efficient product could easily replace them.</p><p>For example, here is what a pure left-hemisphere restaurant (let’s call it OptimalBite) owner may say, <em>“Our Q3 data shows table turnover averaging 47 minutes. Competitors are at 42. We’re losing 10.6% revenue per seat per day.”</em> Whereas a dominant right-hemisphere owner (let’s call it Nonna’s Kitchen) may say, <em>“Our customers — they’re exhausted. Overworked. Disconnected. They’re hungry for belonging. I want them to feel that they have come to their grandmother’s kitchen in Tuscany. To feel they are home. They belong.”</em></p><p>But when you ask customers from the former restaurant? <em>“It’s fine. It’s convenient. The food is… okay.” </em>What will the customers from the latter restaurant say? <em>“We’ve been coming here for five years. The chef remembered my husband died last year and gave us a special toast in his memory.”</em></p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking involves seeing the whole before the parts, which means capturing context, emotions, and behaviour — that is, understanding products within the customer’s life narrative. This involves asking questions like, How do products fit into the actual lived context of people’s lives? What are the larger cultural/meta narratives at play? What fears and frustrations do they carry?</p><p>Understand which archetypal narrative resonates with your customers. For example, the ‘hero’s journey’, the ‘mastery story’, etc. Which narrative rings true emotionally? What kind of person does this product encourage users to become?</p><p>Ask how your product intersects with customers’ lives. Grasp what the product <em>means </em>metaphorically and philosophically, understanding human connections and their identity formation and see products as part of a journey, not isolated moments or features.</p><p>Right-hemisphere thinking prioritises synthesis over analysis. It fosters ecosystem thinking, allowing for ambiguity and narrative evolution, and remains open to new and unexpected possibilities.</p><p>Story-first businesses begin by studying their customers, the stories they are living, capturing their emotions, frustrations and aspirations. Field trips, contextual enquiries, day-in-the-life immersions, story workshops, model mapping, story pattern mapping, among others.</p><p>Airbnb started as a great story-first company; it was revolutionary. However, today it has drifted to standardisation, efficiency, and algorithms. Now it is like any other hospitality business.</p><p>The key is that right-hemisphere practices don’t replace left-hemisphere rigour — they inform it. Both are necessary. But the right must lead.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zIiGEf8tFvAoP478yBQLpQ.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Nike’s “Just Do It” narrative ad, 1988 © Nike</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>The ethics of narrative design</strong></h4><p>Narrative design is also a powerful tool for manipulation because it exploits some of the fundamental human emotions and needs.</p><p>In any good story, the protagonist begins believing a lie — a flawed narrative in Act 1 — but is very convinced. However, at the midpoint of Act 2, a crisis point in the story, the protagonist has been struggling under the burden of his lie. At this moment, he finally sees the Truth. When he chooses to accept it (which will cost him a lot, even his life), transformation begins. It leads to a new, wholesome narrative with renewed aspirations.</p><p>Good stories are about people facing challenges that test them. Transformation is the evidence that the test mattered — that going through the fire either forged something stronger or revealed what was already there. Without transformation, we’re left wondering: what was the point of this story?</p><p>People are drawn to narratives that take them from a state of lack to a more complete and fulfilled one, as they perceive it, inspired by their models. Apple iPhone customers may discover that they have become more creative or better storytellers, just like their model Steve Jobs himself.</p><p>Most of the compelling narratives promise transformation. It’s often what separates a good story from a manipulative one. Or a good product from a poor one. A good product is like a wise guide that enables customers’ transformation.</p><p>Customer transformation should be at the heart of a great product narrative, not manipulation, because transformation is valued higher than instant gratification. For example, social media platforms hijack our need for belonging and significance, creating narratives where we’re constantly performing for validation. Manipulative narratives do thrive, but not for long.</p><p>The right hemisphere has a unique capacity to perceive inherent value and meaning. Iain McGilchrist refers to it as valueception. Philosopher Max Scheler originally introduced the concept in his ‘<em>Hierarchy of Values’</em>. He classifies values into a four-rank pyramid, from the lowest to the highest. At the lowest, he places pleasure values, then vital values, and finally spiritual values, such as truth, goodness, and beauty. At the top, he places the sacred values.</p><p>Scheler argued that the <em>depth</em> and <em>quality</em> of the satisfaction we feel is directly tied to the <em>rank</em> of the value it corresponds to. Therefore, products that embody higher-order values such as integrity, honesty, truth, and beauty, in contrast with mere utility value, offer sustained and deeper satisfaction.</p><p>For example, Nonna’s kitchen, which fostered genuine community (spiritual value), is highly valued over Optimalbite, which cared for convenience (pleasure value).</p><p>A transformative story sets the character on a journey to the sacred, whereas a manipulative story takes the character in the opposite direction.</p><p><em>“When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure” — Viktor Frankl</em>.</p><p>This may sound great now, but does it hold in an Agentic future?</p><h4><strong>Narrative products in Agentic future</strong></h4><p>In a speculative future where we set goals for AI systems to make decisions and act on our behalf, this suggests that customers may not interact with brands directly in that digital space.</p><p>In the Agentic AI paradigm, if customers interact only with AI agents, which in turn interact with multiple brands and systems based on the criteria that are configured, then it appears that brand narratives may lose their power and break the mimetic desire loop, as most products become mere commodities for a narrative agnostic agent.</p><p>If the future unfolds in this way, brand narratives will become even more crucial for products to make sense to customers, or face the fate of extinction in the algorithmic optimisation. Narrative dead products or services will become commodities or mere tasks in a curated algorithmic world.</p><p>However, we humans do not always seek optimal solutions in everything; everyone wants a narrative to live for.</p><p>When agents will have to become the narrative mediators, brands will have to create their narrative agents, and digital products need to become agentic.</p><p>Regardless, physical, embodied experiences will remain crucial because certain narrative elements resist digital mediation — such as community rituals and sensory experiences. Brands need to foster real-world community experiences to strengthen the narrative to meet our deeper need for belonging.</p><p>On the negative side, as social media intensified narratives and their memetic processes exponentially, in the marketplace of Agentic AI, people can be trapped in a narrative echo chamber curated by AI agents. Even worse, governments or institutions can enforce their agents for compliance or control, and kill other narratives. This can be catastrophic for human flourishing.
