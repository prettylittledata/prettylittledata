In CSS, we can create “stacking contexts” where elements are visually placed one on top of the next in a three-dimensional sense that creates the perception of depth. Stacking contexts are incredibly useful, but they’re also widely misunderstood and often mistakenly created, leading to a slew of layout issues that can be tricky to solve."

<h4>AI can conjure photorealistic faces and dreamy landscapes in seconds, but ask it to write “Happy Birthday” on a cake and things get weird fast. The culprit is how these models learn to read, and the solution is trickier than it seems.</h4><p>Imagine you’ve just prompted your chosen AI image generator to create a stunning fashion advertisement for a major platform. The colours are gorgeous, the composition is beautifully balanced, and the lighting would make any photographer jealous. There’s just one small problem: the text reads “SHOP NUG.” Close, but not quite.</p><figure><img alt=""Four identical fashion ads with increasingly garbled AI-generated text, showing errors like ‘SHUP NOY,’ ‘DISGVER YUR SFYLE,’ and ‘SUMMILER COLLECION’ instead of proper words."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JpH8f3y4pOZpYh5Mlbg1iQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>If this sounds familiar, you’re certainly not alone. Despite remarkable leaps in AI-generated imagery over the past few years, text rendering remains the Achilles’ heel of even the most sophisticated models. And here’s the kicker: whilst generation has been steadily improving, <em>editing</em> that garbled text after the fact is proving to be an even thornier challenge.</p><p>So, what gives?</p><h3><strong>The fundamental mismatch</strong></h3><p>The truth is, AI image generators don’t actually “read” text. At all. When you ask <a href=""https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/"">DALL-E</a> or <a href=""https://www.midjourney.com/"">Midjourney</a> to include words in an image, the model isn’t processing language. It’s simply pattern-matching shapes it has seen before in training data.</p><p>Traditional text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion perceive text as a collection of pixels and visual elements to composite into the scene, not as meaning-conveying strings of characters. The model has seen millions of images containing billboards, book covers, and street signs, but it was never explicitly taught what those squiggles <em>mean</em> or how they follow strict rules of spelling and grammar.</p><p>This creates a fundamental mismatch. Text is precise and unforgiving: one wrong letter changes everything (“STOP” versus “ST0P”, anyone?). Images, by contrast, are fluid and interpretive. A face can be slightly asymmetrical and still look human. A landscape can have unusual lighting and still feel real. But misspell a single word? The illusion shatters.</p><h3><strong>How diffusion actually works (in broad strokes)</strong></h3><p>To understand why text is such a headache, it helps to peek behind the curtain at how these models generate images in the first place.</p><p>Most modern AI image generators use something called <a href=""https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-stable-diffusion-work/"">diffusion models</a>. The basic idea is surprisingly elegant. During training, the model learns to gradually add noise to images until they become pure static, then reverses this process by removing noise step-by-step to recover coherent pictures.</p><p>When you type a prompt, it gets processed through a text encoder (typically <a href=""https://openai.com/index/clip/"">CLIP</a>) that converts your words into numerical representations. These embeddings then guide the denoising process, steering the random noise towards something resembling your description.</p><figure><img alt=""Diagram showing AI image generation workflow in five steps: 1) Prompt (text input), 2) Encode (AI processes text), 3) Denoise (removes visual noise shown as dots), 4) Refine (improves image composition), 5) Output (final image). Illustrated with simple icons connected by arrows flowing left to right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Q2BzL8FhuLaDKns0UbFJ5g.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>The problem? Fine details like individual letters are treated as low-priority during the early denoising steps. Errors get “baked in” early and become <a href=""https://dev.to/tracywhodoesnot/why-ai-struggles-with-text-in-image-generation-n69"">incredibly difficult to correct later in the process</a>. The model is essentially guessing letter shapes with no feedback loop to verify whether its guess makes any linguistic sense.</p><p>There’s also the tokenisation issue. When CLIP processes text, it splits words into tokens, and sometimes those splits break apart the very concepts it’s trying to understand. “Deep focus,” for instance, gets tokenised into separate pieces, losing the photographic meaning entirely. The same fragmentation happens with the text <em>in</em> your images, making coherent words harder to reconstruct.</p><h3><strong>Generation is getting better — editing, not so much</strong></h3><p>Now for some good news: text generation in AI images has improved dramatically. Newer models are making genuine strides, and the gap between “absolutely wrong” and “actually usable” has narrowed considerably over the past year or so.</p><p>The improvement isn’t accidental. Companies have specifically invested in solving this problem, recognising that text accuracy is a dealbreaker for commercial applications. After all, nobody wants to hand a client an otherwise perfect AI-generated mockup with “BSET PRCIES” plastered across it.</p><p><a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a>, a platform built specifically with typography in mind, is said to be achieving now roughly <a href=""https://pxz.ai/blog/ideogram-vs-midjourney-2026"">95% accuracy on text prompts</a>, a remarkable leap compared to Midjourney’s approximately 40%. The company claims its latest model reduces text error rates by <a href=""https://the-decoder.com/ideogram-1-0-outshines-midjourney-and-dall-e-3-with-impressive-text-rendering/"">nearly half compared to DALL-E 3</a>. For designers who need readable words on posters, logos, and social media graphics, this could be genuinely transformative.</p><p>But does it really stand up to scrutiny? In the first example below, I asked it to generate a bookshelf with popular titles on product design, with the text clearly visible. The results showed significant errors (“Don’t Make Me Think” became “DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK,”) and other titles were similarly garbled. Next, I provided a specific list of books and authors. The outcome? Still riddled with text errors, suggesting that Ideogram’s touted 95% accuracy claim falls short in actual use cases that require heavy text generation. It may fare better with simpler, single-text prompts, but complex scenarios remain problematic.</p><figure><img alt=""Two AI-generated images of design book bookshelves side by side. Left image shows books with text errors including ‘DON’T MAKE ME M THINK THINK’ and garbled versions of titles like ‘The Design of Everyday Things,’ ‘About Face,’ ‘Lean UX,’ and ‘Atomic Design.’ Right image shows even more severely garbled text with ‘DO ON’ OK ME THIK,’ ‘ROOK LE,’ ‘DEUNNEWE UMBI BOULE,’ and ‘LEZCEDR’ demonstrating AI’s failure to render accurate book spine text."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_ieWpXulhkEfhTa5bjnVPw.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://www.recraft.ai/blog/comparing-popular-and-high-performing-text-to-image-models-and-providers"">Recraft V3</a>, another newcomer, has also positioned itself as a leader in accurate text rendering, claiming “flawless results with every prompt.” A bold assertion, but the benchmarks suggest it’s not far off.</p><p>So if generation is improving, why is editing still such a mess?</p><h3><strong>The short answer: context preservation</strong></h3><p>When generating an image from scratch, the model has complete creative freedom. It can place text wherever it likes, choose fonts that play nicely with its capabilities, and build the entire composition around what it knows it can render well.</p><p>Editing is a different beast entirely. When you ask an AI to fix garbled text on an existing image (through inpainting or other techniques) the model must preserve everything <em>around</em> the text whilst only modifying the specific region you’ve highlighted. This is where things get complicated.</p><p><a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1614608/full"">Research on latent diffusion models for inpainting</a> shows that when applied to large or irregular regions, these models “tend to generate blurry or contextually ambiguous reconstructions.” The model fills in details based on surrounding context and learned patterns, which simply isn’t precise enough for the exact letter shapes that text requires.</p><p>In practical terms? The AI might successfully remove your gibberish text, but when it tries to paint new letters into that space, it struggles to match the exact style, lighting, and perspective of the original image. The result often looks patched rather than seamless.</p><h3><strong>Why you’re not imagining things</strong></h3><p>If editing feels harder than generating, the data backs you up. A <a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">2025 benchmark study published in MDPI</a> evaluated multiple AI models across text accuracy metrics and found that all major platforms (including DALL-E 3, Ideogram, and Stable Diffusion) face “significant challenges with text accuracy” across domains like code, chemical diagrams, and multi-line text.</p><p>The scores are telling. For code-related text, Stable Diffusion scored just 1.25 out of 5 for text accuracy. Even Ideogram, the supposed text champion, managed only 1.75 in the same category. When it comes to complex, structured text requiring precise formatting, all models struggle.</p><p>Platform comparisons in 2025 reflect this reality. <a href=""https://apatero.com/blog/image-to-image-ai-transformation-comparison-2025"">Image-to-image tools vary significantly</a>, with Midjourney notably lacking “true inpainting and transformation controls.” For users who do heavy editing work, local Stable Diffusion with ControlNet remains the go-to option. However, that requires technical expertise most casual users might simply not have.</p><h3><strong>The workarounds (for now)</strong></h3><p>Until AI cracks this particular nut, what’s a designer to do? A few strategies have emerged, each with their own trade-offs.</p><p><strong>Use text-first generators.</strong> If you know you’ll need accurate typography, start with <a href=""https://ideogram.ai/"">Ideogram</a> or similar text-focused tools rather than trying to force words into Midjourney’s artistic outputs. It’s a case of picking the right tool for the job; you wouldn’t edit a feature film in PowerPoint.</p><figure><img alt=""Dual monitor setup showing AI workflow: left screen displays AI-generated coffee shop interior without text, right screen shows the same image in Photoshop with ‘Daily Brew Co.’ text overlay being added. Design tool logos (Photoshop, Figma, Canva, Affinity Designer) surround the monitors on the right side."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_KEoHpKYJ9mBavQCGm33XA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by author</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Generate first, add text later.</strong> Many professionals now create their AI imagery text-free, then overlay typography using traditional design tools like Photoshop, Canva, or Figma. It’s an extra step, but the results are far more reliable. This approach also gives you complete control over font selection, kerning, and placement; things AI still handles clumsily at best.</p><p><strong>Try dedicated fix-it tools.</strong> Platforms like <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-gibberish-text-in-ai-generated-images/"">Storia Lab’s Textify</a> or Canva’s Grab Text tool can identify gibberish text and attempt to replace it. Results vary (patience is required) but for simple corrections, they can save considerable headaches. Just don’t expect miracles with complex multi-line text or heavily stylised typography.</p><p><strong>Embrace the hybrid workflow.</strong> As one industry comparison put it, “many professionals use both platforms,” generating artistic foundations in Midjourney, then handling typography in Ideogram. It’s not elegant, and it requires subscriptions to multiple services, but it works. Think of it as assembling a toolkit rather than searching for a single magic wand.</p><p><strong>Keep expectations realistic.</strong> Perhaps the most important strategy is simply managing client and stakeholder expectations. AI-generated imagery is powerful, but it has clear limitations. Flagging potential text issues upfront saves awkward conversations down the line.</p><h3><strong>What this means for designers and UX professionals</strong></h3><p>Beyond the technical challenges, there’s a broader conversation here about workflow and expectations. As AI tools become more embedded in creative processes, understanding their limitations isn’t just nice-to-have knowledge; it’s essential professional competence.</p><p>For UX writers and content designers, this has particular relevance. If you’re working with teams that use AI-generated imagery, you need to factor text limitations into your content strategy. That punchy headline might look great in a mockup, but will it survive the AI rendering process intact? Sometimes the answer is simply: maybe not.</p><p>And let’s be honest, there’s something almost poetic about AI mastering the creation of human faces whilst fumbling with human writing. It’s a reminder that these tools, however impressive, aren’t magic. They’re sophisticated pattern-matching systems with specific strengths and equally specific blind spots.</p><h3><strong>What’s on the horizon?</strong></h3><p>The research community hasn’t given up. Several promising approaches are in development:</p><ul><li><strong>Hybrid AI systems</strong> that generate a base image through one model, then overlay text using a separate, specialist module designed specifically for accurate placement. Think of it as mimicking how human designers work: creating the visual first, then adding captions as a final step.</li><li><strong>Better training data.</strong> Most current datasets lack properly labelled, structured text within images. Training on annotated text data could help models understand not just where text appears, but what it actually says and how words are properly formed.</li><li><strong>Vector-based rendering.</strong> Some teams are exploring ways to separate text from raster imagery entirely, treating typography as a discrete, editable layer rather than baking it into pixels. This would fundamentally change how text is handled, moving from pattern-matching to something closer to actual typesetting.</li><li><strong>OCR feedback loops.</strong> Imagine a model that generates text, runs optical character recognition to check its own work, and iterates until the spelling is correct. This kind of self-correction mechanism could dramatically reduce errors, though it would add computational overhead.</li></ul><h3><strong>Spelling it out</strong></h3><p>AI image generation has come a long way in a remarkably short time. Photorealistic faces, impossible architecture, dreamlike landscapes — all conjured from a few words typed into a prompt box. But text, that most human of visual elements, remains stubbornly resistant.</p><p>The core issue isn’t laziness or neglect. It’s architectural. Diffusion models were designed to see images holistically, not to parse the precise, rule-bound structures that make written language work. Generation is improving because researchers are training dedicated models for the task. Editing lags behind because preserving context whilst fixing details is a fundamentally harder problem.</p><p>For now, the practical advice is straightforward: plan for text limitations, use the right tool for the job, and don’t be afraid to bring in traditional design software for the finishing touches. AI is brilliant at many things. Fixing spelling errors in images just isn’t one of them… yet.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Thanks for reading! 📖</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote><em>If you liked this post, </em><a href=""https://medium.com/@doracee""><em>follow me on Medium</em></a><em> for more!</em></blockquote><h3><strong>References &amp; Credits:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2274"">(2025).

<h4><em>Why data tables are an accessibility blind-spot (and how WCAG helps)</em></h4><p>Data tables are used in many different products and contexts. They are used in dashboards, product comparisons, or even internal finance reports. They help users make decisions, spot data patterns, and take action where needed.</p><p><strong>But when it comes to accessibility, data tables are often skipped.</strong> They’re assumed to be handled by default HTML or put off until the development stage.</p><p>Visually, the tables look easy to read with clear columns and rows, as well as distinct headers. But for many users (like those using screen readers or keyboard navigation), these tables can become confusing or even unusable.</p><figure><img alt=""Example data tables from IBM Carbon and Salesforce Lightning design systems"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V2pdiWu3IGVeuqcTJI_yRw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Many open-source data tables are available via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-datatable-basic--overview""><em>IBM Carbon</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--base""><em>Salesforce Lightning</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Just to be clear; WCAG doesn’t prohibit data tables, it just requires that the table’s information, relationships, and functionality are available to all users.</strong> Not only that, you don’t need complex solutions to have both data tables and WCAG-compliant designs.</p><p>Let’s break down why data tables are frequently overlooked, what WCAG requires of them, and how designers and product teams can create accessible data tables.</p><h3>Why are tables an accessibility blind-spot?</h3><p>To be fair, data tables sit in an awkward spot between design and development. They feel too technical to be a pure design problem, but also feel too visual to be treated as just code. As a result, accessibility issues slip through the cracks.</p><p>But what specific issues come from neither design or dev taking full ownership of tables?</p><h4>Tables lack semantic structure</h4><p>Visually, most tables appear easy to scan with aligned column headers and distinguished rows. But when this same structure isn’t communicated properly in the code, assistive technologies lose the context that sighted users get visually.</p><p><strong>Without proper header associations, a screen reader (like Voiceover or NVDA) may announce a value without indicating which column or row it belongs to.</strong></p><p>For instance, let’s say there is a data table depicting the concerts you attended last year. A sighted user can easily understand when and where each concert was, but a screen reader announces “12 February” without the associated concert it corresponds to.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table example with header cells named Date, Event, Venue in the top row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m6eIsbk0X6ngwuwkpiQeAQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table example with header cells in the top row via </em><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/one-header/#table-with-header-cells-in-the-top-row-only""><em>W3 WAI tutorials</em></a></figcaption></figure><pre>&lt;table&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Event&lt;/th&gt;<br />    &lt;th&gt;Venue&lt;/th&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  &lt;tr&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;12 February&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Waltz with Strauss&lt;/td&gt;<br />    &lt;td&gt;Main Hall&lt;/td&gt;<br />  &lt;/tr&gt;<br />  […]<br />&lt;/table&gt;</pre><h4>Design Systems with information gaps</h4><p><strong>Many Design Systems include a table component, but sometimes they don’t clarify how the component should be used in the wild.</strong> The guidance leaves open questions about accessibility, like:</p><ul><li>When should a table be used instead of a list?</li><li>How should sorting behave?</li><li>What happens when data is empty, truncated, or loading?</li></ul><p>Without explicit standards, tables used by different teams behave differently, and accessibility becomes inconsistent.</p><h4>Added interactions without accessibility</h4><p>Modern tables are typically dynamic with sortable columns, selectable rows, and inline actions. But these interaction patterns are layered on top of the table without clear guidance on keyboard behavior, focus order, or screen reader announcements.</p><p><strong>When accessibility is addressed late in development, teams might add impromptu ARIA attributes instead of designing inclusively from the start.</strong> This results in a table that “functions,” but feels unpredictable or exhausting to navigate with only a keyboard.</p><figure><img alt=""Data table with batch actions as an example from IBM Carbon Storybook"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gxIqfbG4PyAO04wG_Sk3WA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Data table with batch actions via </em><a href=""https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable-batch-actions--default""><em>IBM Carbon Storybook</em></a></figcaption></figure><h3>Anatomy of an accessible data table</h3><h4>Overall structure</h4><ul><li>Rows and columns reflect the data’s relationships (not just visual alignment)</li><li>Headers clearly describe the content they correspond to</li><li>Reading order matches how the data is meant to be understood</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Okr49IcRO2jl9hwhoNUSdA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Tables create inherent visual structure using columns and row; via </em><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/""><em>Google Sheets</em></a></figcaption></figure><h4>Data relationships</h4><ul><li>Individual values connect to both their column and their row headers (even in multi-dimensional tables)</li><li>Context is communicated through programmatic associations (not only by visual means like spacing or alignment)</li><li>Users navigate cell by cell and understand the data as a whole</li></ul><h4>Predictable navigation</h4><ul><li>Filters, column headers, and actions have clear labels</li><li>Keyboard focus is always visible on the data table</li><li>Focus (tab) order aligns with the visual and logical layout of the table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Dell’s Design System includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CEFgqCp5UFOJYITDRfLxJg.gif"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://react.delldesignsystem.com/2.21.0/index.html?path=/story/components-table--bulk-actions""><em>Dell’s Design System</em></a><em> includes proper keyboard interactions for their table component</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Proper interactions</h4><ul><li>Interactive tables have clear affordances, accessible labels, and visible states</li><li>Users know when a column is sortable and which direction it’s sorted in</li><li>Users know what happens when they activate a control with a keyboard or mouse</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Note</strong><em>: This anatomy allows assistive technologies to answer basic questions like: What column am I in? What does this value represent? Without it, users are forced to guess.</em></blockquote><h3>WCAG criteria that matter most for data tables</h3><p>WCAG doesn’t treat data tables as a special case. There’s no guideline that says “make tables accessible.” Instead, WCAG is more concerned with whether users can perceive relationships, operate functionality, and understand content within the table.</p><p><strong>WCAG provides a framework, but it’s up to designers and teams to meet the expectations.</strong></p><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships.html#brief"">SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A)</a></h4><p>This criteria asks that all users can understand how headers relate to data cells, regardless of how the table looks visually. When header relationships are missing, assistive technologies can’t provide meaningful context.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Use table markup to present tabular information (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H51"">Technique H51</a>)</li><li>Use caption elements to associate the data table’s title or heading with the table (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39"">Technique H39</a>)</li><li>Use the scope attribute to associate header cells with cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H63"">Technique H63</a>)</li><li>Use id and headers attributes to associate cells with header cells in data tables (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H43"">Technique H43</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href"">https://medium.com/media/338e43f81349ebc2a12841deaf0dd258/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard"">SC 2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)</a></h4><p>Any interaction included in a table must be operable using only a keyboard. This includes not only navigating the table itself, but also using features like filtering, pagination, and row-level actions.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure keyboard control for all functionality (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202"">Technique G202</a>)</li><li>Provide keyboard-triggered event handlers (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G90"">Technique G90</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order#brief"">SC 2.4.3 Focus Order (Level A)</a></h4><p>Users navigating with a keyboard need to know where they are at all times. WCAG requires visible focus indicators and clear communication of state changes.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Place the interactive elements in an order that follows sequences and relationships within the content (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G59"">Technique G59</a>)</li><li>Make the DOM order match the visual order (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27"">Technique C27</a>)</li></ul><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/headings-and-labels"">SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels (Level AA)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that controls and content have clear, descriptive labels. In data tables, this applies to the table’s title, column headers, and its interactive controls.</p><p><strong>Example techniques to pass:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide descriptive headings (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G130"">Technique G130</a>)</li><li>Provide descriptive labels (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G131"">Technique G131</a>)</li></ul><a href=""https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href"">https://medium.com/media/64748825f9b314ce382b355646219ca9/href</a><h4><a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value#brief"">SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)</a></h4><p>WCAG requires that content work reliably with assistive technologies now and in the future. For data tables, this means relying on semantic structure and predictable behavior rather than visually driven solutions.</p><p>Example techniques to pass:</p><ul><li>Use aria-label to provide an accessible name where a visible label cannot be used (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA14"">Technique ARIA14</a>)</li><li>Use aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/aria/ARIA16"">Technique ARIA16</a>)</li></ul><h3>What designers should do before dev touches code</h3><p>Accessible data tables start with design decisions. Designers are responsible for preventing accessibility issues long before a developer ever starts coding. This includes defining design decisions like table structure, interactions, and data complexity.</p><h4>Use real structure, not just layout</h4><p>Before thinking about visual styling, designers should answer the following:</p><ul><li>What are the rows?</li><li>What are the columns?</li><li>What relationships matter most?</li></ul><p>If these answers aren’t obvious in the design, they won’t be obvious to assistive technologies. You need clear column headers, meaningful row labels, and consistent data structure.</p><h4>Have intentional interactions</h4><p>Not every table needs sorting, filtering, or inline actions. Each interaction adds cognitive load and accessibility complexity. When interactions are necessary, designers should define:</p><ul><li>Which columns are sortable</li><li>What happens when sorting is applied</li><li>How users move between table content and controls</li><li>If actions apply to a row, a cell, or the entire table</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Atlassian’s Design System includes interactions when it makes sense with the data relationships"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pplXXuqgTPxTXbCCSO0EqA.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://atlassian.design/components/dynamic-table/examples#uncontrolled""><em>Atlassian’s Design System</em></a><em> includes interactions, like sorting, when it makes sense with the data relationships</em></figcaption></figure><h4>Design for keyboard users</h4><p>Using a keyboard is a primary input method for many users. Designers need to ensure that tables can be navigated in a logical, predictable order by asking:</p><ul><li>Can every interactive element be reached without a mouse/ trackpad?</li><li>Does keyboard focus move in a way that matches the table’s structure?</li><li>Are hover-only actions also doable via keyboard?</li></ul><h4>Consider various screen sizes</h4><p>Designers need to explicitly define how table structure and relationships are preserved across breakpoints. As the screen size shrinks, it’s simple to collapse and hide content, but designers should document:</p><ul><li>How labels remain associated with their values</li><li>How users can navigate between the data</li><li>How accessible interactions are maintained</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Lightning Design System’s data table responding to mobile screen size"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8s-b_ImlOvrMbOwmyYkvvg.png"" /><figcaption>Data tables need to respond when presented on mobile devices; via <a href=""https://sds-site-docs-1fea39e7763a.herokuapp.com/index.html?path=/story/components-data-table--with-sorting"">Lightning Design System</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Document table expectations in Design Systems</h4><p>Data tables scale and remain consistent when they’re a shared standard. Documenting how tables behave is just as important as documenting how they look.</p><p>Helpful documentation includes:</p><ul><li>When to use a table (and when to other components like a list)</li><li>Required semantics with structure, headers, and labels</li><li>Keyboard and interaction behavior (like focus and pagination)</li><li>Interaction states and edge cases (like empty, loading, or error states)</li><li>Any known accessibility considerations or constraints</li></ul><p>Data tables are treated as containers for information, but they’re some of the most complex elements users interact with. Without incorporating accessibility into tables, users lose context, navigation becomes frustrating, and critical data becomes hard to understand.</p><p><strong>Complying with WCAG criteria helps all users no matter their ability.</strong> Accessible tables are easier to scan, more predictable to navigate, and clearly communicate meaning. They benefit screen reader users, keyboard users, and anyone working with dense data. When tables are designed with the same care as any other interface, accessibility follows naturally.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6a13533a6fde"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/data-tables-need-to-be-accessible-too-6a13533a6fde"">Data tables need to be accessible, too</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h3>When design stops asking why and starts asking, “Can AI do it?”</h3><h4>This advice is why designers are quietly losing strategic influence. We optimized AI interfaces for confidence. Organizations learned that confidence replaces judgment.</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a fictional team chat where a product leader pushes for an AI-generated solution to a business problem before design investigation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*oypi566Pl6vxkzJGk69RQw.png"" /><figcaption>Image Credit: Author.</figcaption></figure><p>The question dropped into the Slack channel before the user research summary. Before the problem was clearly defined. Before anyone asked if users actually needed this feature.</p><p>Your product manager already generated three interface options in ChatGPT. Now they’re asking which one to build. Not <em>whether</em> to build. Not <em>why</em> to build. <em>Which.</em></p><p>And when you slow the conversation down to ask those questions, you’re about to discover that strategic thinking now reads as bottleneck behavior.</p><p>This isn’t an accident.

It’s a power shift.</p><p>22% designers now use AI to create first drafts of interfaces. 33% use it to generate design assets. The time from concept to visible prototype collapsed from days to minutes.</p><p>But something shifted that nobody warned you about: <strong>“Can AI do this?” started showing up at the beginning of product discussions.</strong> Not after user needs are validated. Not after strategic intent is clarified. It arrives first.</p><p>And when you slow teams down to ask strategic questions, you’re increasingly seen as friction rather than guidance.</p><p>We built this pattern. Now it’s being used against us.</p><h3>We taught teams that polish means correctness</h3><p>For years, UX designers optimized AI interfaces to hide uncertainty. <a href=""https://medium.com/core-ai/why-ai-sounds-confident-even-when-its-wrong-4c0683a6f61e"">Chatbots</a> that sounded certain even when guessing. Loading states that implied thoughtfulness without revealing computational doubt. Systems that presented single recommendations with high visual confidence rather than surfacing alternatives with calibrated uncertainty.</p><p>We did this because <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">research told us</a> users trust confident systems. Smooth experiences read as competent. Hesitation feels like failure. As Erika Hall noted in her <a href=""https://picovoice.ai/blog/conversation-design-tips-from-Hall/"">conversation with John Maeda</a>, “the level of visual polish can lead designers and decision-makers to think that the concepts underneath are stronger than they are.”</p><p>The concepts underneath are what matter. But we wrapped them in interfaces that signaled completion rather than exploration.</p><p>Those design decisions didn’t stay contained. They taught organizations how to relate to AI outputs: <strong>polish became synonymous with correctness</strong>. Generation became synonymous with judgment. “AI created this” became implicit validation rather than a signal requiring verification.</p><p>We optimized for adoption.

What once took days can now be done in hours, allowing designers to iterate and test more rapidly.” True. But iteration without interrogation isn’t strategic design — it’s production at scale.</p><p><a href=""https://banotes.org/administrative-thinkers/bounded-rationality-satisficing-decision-making-simon/"">Herbert Simon’s research on bounded rationality</a> explains why this matters: under time pressure and cognitive constraints, people accept solutions that appear “good enough” rather than optimal. AI doesn’t create this behavior — it accelerates it by making “good enough” arrive so quickly that deeper evaluation feels wasteful.</p><p>When creation is cheap, <strong>teams learn to mistake speed for strategy</strong>.</p><h3>What actually changed: Decision order flipped</h3><p>Product teams used to follow a sequence: understand user problems → clarify strategic intent → explore solutions → generate artifacts. This ordering wasn’t arbitrary — it created space for judgment.</p><p>AI disrupted that sequence not by replacing designers but by making execution nearly instantaneous. When something can be generated in seconds, the act of creation no longer signals commitment. It signals possibility.</p><p>But teams don’t always treat it that way.</p><p>Once a generated interface exists — even provisionally — it reshapes the conversation. The artifact becomes gravitational. Feedback clusters around it. Critique becomes incremental. The deeper question (<em>why this at all</em>) arrives late, if it arrives at all.</p><p><a href=""https://designintech.report/2024/03/12/design-against-ai-2024/"">John Maeda’s 2024 Design in Tech Report</a> distinguishes between “makers” (designers and developers who create) and “talkers” (product managers who drive revenue). AI made it easier for makers to make. But it made it <em>better</em> for talkers to talk — because AI outputs give them tangible artifacts to discuss without waiting for design judgment.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract architectural forms in teal, gold, and black showing stacked geometric shapes representing organizational hierarchy transformation and power redistribution between different roles"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EivrjbF7gUjc8D0uhCv67Q.png"" /><figcaption>The organizational power shift: When AI made artifacts instant, strategic influence moved from makers to talkers. Generated With Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><p>When stakeholders see “working” prototypes in first meetings, the implicit question becomes: <em>What do we need designers for?</em></p><p>The answer used to be: <strong>Strategic thinking. User advocacy. The discipline to ask why before how.</strong></p><p>But when generation speed becomes the primary value signal, those skills read as obstruction.</p><h3>The confidence problem we created</h3><p>Most AI design tools are optimized for decisiveness. They generate singular recommendations with confident presentation. This makes sense from a UX perspective — confidence reads as competence, smoothness reads as quality. As <a href=""https://www.studioubique.com/ai-ux-design/"">design best practices emphasize</a>, AI interfaces should “set honest expectations” and “show confidence.”</p><p>But between honest expectations and confident presentation, most products chose confidence.</p><p>This creates cascading problems. When AI presents one interface design with high visual polish, teams treat it as <em>the</em> answer rather than <em>an</em> exploration. Alternative approaches aren’t surfaced. Edge cases aren’t flagged. Uncertainty is smoothed over.</p><p><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/"">Research on automation bias</a> has demonstrated this dynamic for decades: people are significantly more likely to accept system output even when it conflicts with their own judgment, particularly when that output is presented confidently. The effect strengthens as systems appear more capable and authoritative.</p><p><a href=""https://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2019/toward-human-centered-ai"">Human-centered AI research</a> has long advocated that systems should “support human judgment rather than replace it” — surfacing uncertainty, presenting multiple options, enabling override. But velocity pressures push teams toward tools that minimize friction, not maximize judgment.</p><p><strong>We designed the experience that trained organizations to trust confident outputs over strategic questioning.</strong></p><h3>What stopped getting asked</h3><p>As generation becomes easier, certain questions surface less often in product discussions:</p><p><strong>Why this approach instead of alternatives?</strong> When AI produces one polished solution quickly, exploring other directions feels wasteful. The existence of a “working” prototype creates psychological commitment before strategic evaluation happens.</p><p><strong>What assumptions are embedded in this output?</strong> AI training data encodes countless decisions about what “good design” looks like, what user problems matter, what solutions are appropriate. These assumptions remain invisible unless teams actively interrogate them.</p><p><strong>Who does this work well for — and who does it exclude?</strong> Rapid generation optimizes for median cases in training data. Edge cases, accessibility considerations, users who don’t match demographic norms get systematically overlooked.</p><p>As <a href=""https://www.muledesign.com/"">Mike Monteiro and Erika Hall have argued</a> for years, design’s ethical responsibility is interrogating these questions <em>before</em> building. But when “Can AI do this?” shows up first, those questions get framed as barriers to velocity rather than essential judgment.</p><h3>The strategic ground designers are losing</h3><p><strong>1 in 3 Figma users shipped an AI-powered product in 2025</strong> — a 50% increase from 2024. Only 9% cited revenue growth as the primary goal. Instead, <strong>35% said ‘experiment with AI’ and 41% said ‘enhance customer experience’</strong> — goals that struggle to define measurable success.</p><figure><img alt=""Fractured architectural platform with city lights glowing on top while ocean waves erode the breaking edges, representing diminishing strategic territory and crumbling foundation beneath ongoing work"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*dfkLKul12MDKLvxYSyVw3A.png"" /><figcaption>The strategic erosion: Design work continues on the surface while foundational influence fragments beneath. Generated With Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><p>Translation: teams are building because they can, not because they’ve clarified what problem requires solving.</p><p>This isn’t speculation. <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/state-of-ux-2026/"">Nielsen Norman Group’s State of UX in 2026</a> names the existential tension directly: “Available roles will increasingly demand breadth and judgment, not just artifacts… The practitioners who thrive will be adaptable generalists who treat UX as strategic problem solving, rather than focusing on producing deliverables.”</p><p>But when artifacts arrive instantly via AI, organizations don’t value judgment that questions whether those artifacts should exist. They value judgment that makes those artifacts ship faster.</p><p><a href=""https://maven.com/centercentre/uxai"">Jared Spool notes</a>: “AI gives us an unprecedented ability to anticipate user needs. The challenge is balancing automation with human empathy in design.” The challenge isn’t technical. It’s organizational. When teams measure progress in shipped features rather than solved problems, empathy reads as slowdown.</p><p><strong>68% of developers say AI improves work quality. Only 40% of designers agree.</strong> The gap reveals who’s winning the value argument. Engineers deliver code. Designers deliver questions. In velocity-obsessed cultures, questions don’t ship.</p><h3>What separates successful teams from everyone else</h3><p>Figma’s data on successful versus unsuccessful AI product teams reveals the pattern: <strong>60% of successful teams explored multiple design or technical approaches</strong>, compared to only <strong>39% of unsuccessful ones</strong>.</p><p>The differentiator wasn’t AI capability. It was judgment discipline.</p><blockquote>Successful teams don’t slow down generation. They slow down after generation.</blockquote><p>They treat AI output as a starting point requiring validation, not a conclusion requiring execution. They assume speed increases the risk of unexamined assumptions, not decreases it.</p><p>This aligns with <a href=""https://www.muledesign.com/"">principles Erika Hall has advocated</a> for years: “80% of your job should be talking to people… The concepts underneath are the most important part.” But talking takes time. In cultures optimized for generation speed, time feels expensive.</p><p><a href=""https://designbetterpodcast.com/p/brad-frost"">Brad Frost’s work on design systems</a> emphasizes that sustainable systems require “human relationships” and collaborative judgment, not just component libraries. But when AI can generate components in seconds, the relationship part gets skipped.</p><h3>The uncomfortable truth about design’s complicity</h3><p>Here’s what makes this particularly painful: <strong>UX designers built this problem</strong>.</p><p>We spent years optimizing AI interfaces for confident presentation over calibrated uncertainty. We designed chatbots to sound certain even when guessing. We created loading states that implied thoughtfulness without revealing doubt. We built systems that hid alternatives behind single recommendations.</p><p>We did this because users wanted smooth experiences. Because confident systems get adopted. Because our job was removing friction.</p><p>Those design decisions didn’t stay contained. They taught organizations that <strong>AI outputs deserve trust by default</strong>. That polish equals correctness. That questioning generated work slows teams down.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Alv38Wim_CfOCyWKzwudig.png"" /><figcaption>We optimized for smooth experiences. We didn’t see what we were hiding underneath. Generated with Midjourney.</figcaption></figure><p>As <a href=""https://johnmaeda.medium.com/autodesigners-on-autopilot-88c5b07609b9"">John Maeda’s 2025 Design in Tech Report</a> notes: “Computational thinking is invaluable… Work transformation is coming FAST.” We focused on making tools smooth. We didn’t prepare for how smooth tools would reshape what organizations value about designers.</p><h3>What happens next</h3><p>The real risk isn’t that AI will design for us. AI already designs <em>with</em> us, and that collaboration produces real value when guided by strategic judgment.</p><p>The risk is that organizations will stop rewarding the judgment part.</p><p>When “AI can do this faster” becomes sufficient reason to build something, design stops being about solving meaningful problems and becomes about demonstrating AI capability. User needs become secondary to technical possibility. Strategic clarity becomes friction to be eliminated.</p><p>As noted, teams cite ‘experiment with AI’ and ‘enhance customer experience’ as goals rather than measurable outcomes. They’re building because they can, iterating because it’s fast, shipping because velocity signals progress — all without the designers who used to ask whether any of this serves anyone beyond the team’s desire to ship AI features.</p><h3>The choice that hasn’t disappeared yet</h3><p>Design has always been about judgment. Not just making things usable or attractive, but deciding what deserves to exist in the first place.</p><p>AI changes how quickly we arrive at form. It doesn’t change the need for intent.</p><p>When creation is cheap, judgment becomes the most valuable part of the process. When generation is instant, the ability to say “this solves the wrong problem” becomes rare enough to be strategically important. When teams can build anything, knowing what <em>not</em> to build becomes the differentiator.</p><figure><img alt=""An image of Speed vs Quality from article Finding the balance: Speed vs Quality."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XaAPOgfsnuGydQH2fiNwqg.png"" /><figcaption>Article Source: <a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/finding-the-balance-speed-vs-quality-1955d42da6bf"">Finding the balance: Speed vs Quality</a></figcaption></figure><p>But Nielsen Norman Group is clear: “Adaptability, strategy, and discernment are the skills that will serve us best in the future… If you’re just slapping together components from a design system, you’re already replaceable by AI.
