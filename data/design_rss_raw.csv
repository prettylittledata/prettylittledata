<h3>How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</h3><h4>Lessons in clarity, confidence and community</h4><p>Nearly <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">1 billion runs</a> were recorded on Strava in 2024.</p><p>Targeting runners is a <em>big</em> market.</p><p>And it’s a market that’s growing — according to <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">Strava</a>, running was the ‘fastest growing sport globally’ with ‘Gen Z turning to running to create community and connection’.</p><p>Which is the <strong>winning strategy</strong> for coaching app <a href=""https://www.runna.com/"">Runna</a>.</p><p>If you run, you’ve probably heard of Runna. The consumer app is<em> all over</em> Instagram, TikTok, and Strava, with 48,000+ ratings at 4.9 stars on the app store. The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">Reddit community</a> alone now has around <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/runna/"">47,000 members</a>.</p><p>Officially launching in March 2022, Runna reached <a href=""https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/strava-acquires-popular-runna-app-b1222946.html"">7,000 paying subscribers</a> a year later and has since helped <a href=""https://www.runna.com/en-gb/strava-acquires-runna"">millions of runners complete their first race</a>.</p><p>In April 2025, Runna was acquired by Stava for an unknown amount. Though <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seb-johnson_strava-runna-crowdfunding-activity-7324024883418382336-xTC2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACEru7kB8-Anzw-Z0Ee3-GIgCyW6sGkmrp0"">estimates</a> are around £150 million, based on a 30X return to early crowdfunding investors, who invested when it was valued at £5 million (30 X £5M = £150M).</p><p>That’s when I decided to see what all the hype was about.</p><p>The acquisition caught my eye, and so did the fact that my friends had just signed me up for a half-marathon 🫠 As a Strava paying subscriber, I got the email about a Strava × Runna bundle, it made sense to give it a go.</p><p>And this is that story: <strong>my journey through Runna’s incredible onboarding.</strong></p><p>We’ll see three big lessons across the onboarding flow, covering:</p><ul><li>Why most product marketing tests fail to have an impact, but Runna’s packs a punch</li><li>Where user-generated content and community can come into onboarding</li><li>How certain industries need a longer onboarding process</li></ul><p>By the end we’ll see that there’s nothing flashy about Runna’s onboarding. It just makes you believe you can actually <strong>do it.</strong></p><p>We’ll also see just how well I ran according to my plan 👀</p><p>Let’s jump straight into lesson one, starting from the first thing we see: a welcome screen carousel.</p><h3>Lesson 1) Show your product clearly</h3><p>Most apps try to look impressive. Runna just tries to make sense.</p><p>When I open the app on my phone for the first time, I see an onboarding carousel which looks slightly old-school, but I love it.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*puktDueirGzA1V4APH4rLw.png"" /></figure><p>The classic saying is that ‘no one reads an onboarding carousel’.</p><p>Which, in my experience is <strong><em>half true.</em></strong></p><p>Studies have shown users don’t have time to read: most people read <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/"">28% of the words on a page; 20% is more likely</a>.</p><p><em>However, </em>I’ve added a carousel before a paywall before and it <em>improved</em> conversion to trial. So there’s something to be said for adding extra context for customers.</p><p>In my view, Runna’s carousel works here. It does three things really well:</p><ul><li>It runs through screens like an Instagram story (no tapping required)</li><li>There’s very few words (max 9 in each headline)</li><li>Imagery does the heavy lifting</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tM4tOfgJx7KE-v_icAgRAw.png"" /></figure><p>The Instagram-style story creates a <strong>variable reward</strong> 🧠 as you don’t know what’s coming next. It also follows a common consumer app <strong>mental model</strong> which works well in this context.</p><p>What stands out here is the <strong>imagery. </strong>From the second carousel screenshot, it’s clear to me what a ‘personalized running plan’ might look like.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*7qWurLh6N8_B45Bv4qJEOA.png"" /></figure><p>As someone who gets injured all the time and has no real game plan for running, this structure, clarity and format made me sigh with relief.</p><p>It created a mini-magic-moment for me early on.</p><p>On the fourth screenshot, my running injuries came to life:</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*VQ2LUfE70GJusdfKNW-u9w.png"" /></figure><p>Runna has used the most common running injury (Achilles Tendinitis) as an example, with micro copy:</p><ul><li>Get back to running quickly and carefully</li><li>Returning to running post-injury</li></ul><p>They know that this is one of the biggest fears, frustrations, or anxieties that holds people back from running. Whether it’s past injuries or future injuries, with these images, Runna is signalling:</p><blockquote>We’ve got you</blockquote><p>Does this impact conversion? Hard to say. My gut says no.</p><p>In my experience, I’ve rarely seen adding imagery into onboarding improve conversion.</p><p>That’s because it’s<strong> really hard to do well.</strong> You need to have excellent image designers and really think about what will make people have a lightbulb moment. Imagery needs to be:</p><ul><li>Easy to scan, easy to see</li><li>Use specific, real examples</li><li>Be able to be understood in a moment’s glance</li></ul><p>That’s a tough order.</p><h3>Lesson 2) Bring your marketing inside your product</h3><p>Runna’s onboarding starts long before download. Its community and content seep straight into the product journey.</p><p>The first obvious thing I noticed is the authentic lifestyle imagery and social proof throughout the flow.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5n9jr3CzhOEc7aiLPyEktQ.png"" /></figure><p>After the carousel, I see a load of smiling women and men I want to be friends with sitting on a park bench.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*DvwkS7kpHdoUDI7J1U0WBg.png"" /></figure><p>Further into onboarding, after I select the run I’m doing, I see 230 other little avatars ready to run with me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1023/1*LOg_JV9KEuFVRq41hmpqPg.png"" /></figure><p>There are little signals of value add here too:</p><ul><li>Date</li><li>Location</li><li>Run type = flat (thank god)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*wm1VAYBXUyTxYs3kAjXI6w.png"" /></figure><p>Before this onboarding flow, I hadn’t checked the run route for the run I’d booked.</p><p>With these details (flat ‘elevation of 34 meters’ &amp; ‘230 others running’), the app has calmed some anxieties around being fit enough for hills and showed me other’s are doing it too. Quietly reassuring me:</p><blockquote>You got this</blockquote><p>And it continues…</p><p>At the end of onboarding, I see more runners 👀</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YYOQw1UL4xBai1_8GeXp5w.png"" /></figure><p>Notice how the human imagery varies:</p><ul><li>Full screen vs. small avatars vs. videos</li><li>Stylised shoots, vs ‘taken on the run’ vibes</li><li>Background gradient fade or spotlight image</li></ul><p>What’s curious is that these touch points are littered throughout. There are 30 screens I see in onboarding before I see my plan on the homepage.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J3X4-NZI_xa3b0Sf1xD3DA.png"" /><figcaption>Too many to show…</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a summary (as I know the above image is too small 🥴):</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4PRtTKhECrLY6nme_4v-BA.png"" /></figure><p>In terms of where the imagery sits, there’s imagery beginning, middle (almost) and end of onboarding. With a big cluster near the paywall.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZAcO9G_OXxNKMnYNtNc8ew.png"" /></figure><p>What I see here: a product direction that<strong> knows community is important.</strong> And an onboarding funnel that matches the acquisition funnel (influencer marketing, user-generated content in ads, reddit communities).</p><p>Whilst hard to execute, I’ve heard of experiments showing that matching ad creative and copy at the top of the funnel to the product journey, from onboarding to homepage, can improve conversion to paid and retention.</p><h3>Lesson 3) Design for confidence, not speed</h3><p>Everyone has fears.</p><p>My fears are around running (and the dark).</p><p>The key doubts on my mind coming into this were:</p><ul><li>Can I run this run I’ve booked?</li><li>Will my old injuries resurface?</li><li>Will I get new injuries?</li><li>Will I get faster? Can I run under 2 hours?</li><li>Can I fit this into my work week?</li><li>Will this app work with my garmin and strava set up?</li></ul><p>By the end of my 12-minute-long onboarding, <strong>I’m clear on all of the above.</strong> And honestly, I felt pretty relaxed about it all.</p><p>The hard part of testing onboarding is balancing two things:</p><ol><li>The macro steps (getting you set up, called ‘set up tasks’)</li><li>The micro details that aren’t crucial, but subconsciously push people along.</li></ol><p>On 1. it’s incredibly hard to prioritise what to put in onboarding. As a rule of thumb, if it positively impacts retention (i.e. when people take [product action] we see they retain better) then AB test it in onboarding to see if it’s a causal relationship, not just a correlation.</p><p>On 2, it’s even harder to make decisions of what small details to add. What micro copy will calm users, what images can help.</p><p>Individual, isolated tests rarely reach significance on these things. And if you’re not close to the customer, you can end up just adding words, steps and noise that get in the way.</p><p>For Runna, the macro steps are:</p><ul><li>Set a goal</li><li>Pick a race</li><li>Self select your running ability</li><li>What days would you like to run?</li><li>Predict your running time</li><li>Pick km/mi</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JjhBVSRr0-X7G7LFa3ho1Q.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I1lhv5RHBbl39pfasKIVXw.png"" /></figure><p>From the copy on these steps, my anxieties around fitting the plan into my week, running a good pace and ‘will I be ready’ for my half marathon are covered.</p><p>Then it’s the micro details that add confidence. If I pick a 5k time that’s too fast, it tells me the app isn’t built for me.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tUtqzyLnTVHxJ331tvHseA.png"" /></figure><p>Which reinforces that I am in the right place, because I cannot run that fast (but I hope to one day).</p><p>The post-onboarding plan introduction takes the level of confidence one step further, with:</p><ul><li>Estimated race times</li><li>A guide to the four run types (with a coach video explainer for each)</li><li>The first of those workouts reflected in my plan (starting with an easy run, yay)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zNKuHeM-Nmnap_J2VBUhTQ.png"" /></figure><p>The estimated times show me what I can achieve with and without the app:</p><ul><li>Without Runna: 1hr 59</li><li>With Runna: 8 minutes faster (1hr 51)</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/499/1*QwN9Bx5EWYFs__WJnbE2vg.png"" /></figure><p>Again imagery being used here to show value at a glance.</p><p>Lastly, the copy on ‘Types of run’ guides is just so simple.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HsjiGLuHHfonj-q2q5hsvQ.png"" /></figure><blockquote>‘The purpose of these runs is to recover and freshen up’</blockquote><p>No jargon, no running-speak. None of that elite language that puts people off.</p><p>Just plain old english. And again, none of it feels optimised. It’s just plain and simple.</p><p>Bish bash bosh.</p><h3>The summary: confidence is what Runna is optimizing for.</h3><p>By the time I finished onboarding, I hadn’t even started training but already felt more confident about the race.</p><p>Thinking back over this flow, the funny thing is that it isn’t particularly <em>sexy</em>. Runna doesn’t try to impress me.</p><p>Instead, every choice — from unhurried pacing to clear copy — signals that this app is serious about getting you to your goal.</p><p>It feels like the restraint on product sexiness or pazazz, and the focus on plain and simple, is what earns trust.</p><p>The irony is that this onboarding doesn’t just onboard you into an app. It onboards you into <strong>believing you can actually run the thing.</strong></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7780ba89c202"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-nail-onboarding-a-case-study-of-runna-7780ba89c202"">How to nail onboarding — a case study of Runna</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

Inset is the little baby redwood tree I planted in my backyard.</figcaption></figure><p>Time is money. Move fast and break things. Crunch time. We hear these idioms repeated, and to many, they become true. You can live your life by these sayings if you like.</p><p>I prefer:</p><blockquote>“Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. — Virginia Woolf”</blockquote><p>Woolf seemed to recognize the spectrum on which time exists — its fluidity. Importantly, that time centers around humanity, because we track it. We frame it in terms of its past, present, and future. We observe its passage.</p><p>My preference doesn’t mean I don’t need a calendar. I desperately do. But some days I wish I didn’t. :) Time is something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit these days. As AI seems to be moving quite quickly, my children have grown into near-adults, and as I age, things seem to be moving faster. They’re not, but they seem to be.</p><p>If you’ve ever been in a car accident, time seems to slow down, while spending time with good friends can seem to move quickly. Temporal perception should feel familiar to everyone. There are numerous papers on this topic; <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196844"">this one</a> provides a good breakdown, but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-H4MKJSRXs"">this video</a> by David Eagleman is less dense. Eagleman experiments with time and proves that time doesn’t slow down, but your memory, triggered by your amygdala, captures the novelty of traumatic events “to attend to the situation at hand.” Memories are created in a kind of second memory system that you may need in the future to avoid or deal with the trauma at hand. So your brain has more memories to draw from, and you perceive time as elongating. Neuroscience is neat. Watch the video; his explanation is better than mine.</p><p>Depending on where you grew up, your cultural understanding of time may also differ.</p><p><em>“In general, Monochronic cultures view time as linear and separable, capable of being divided into units, and therefore emphasize doing ‘one thing at a time’. In contrast, Polychronic cultures view time as naturally recurring, and therefore emphasize doing ‘many things at one time.” Nonis, Teng, Ford 2005</em></p><p>The above definition is based on <em>Edward T. Hall’s 1959 book, The Silent Language. </em>Even though these binary stereotypes aren’t universal, studies support the assertion that place plays a role in how you perceive time, despite the difficulty in measuring these differences and their dependencies on context. (<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273382690_Cross-cultural_Perspectives_on_Time"">Fulmer, Crosby, and Gelfand — 2014)</a></p><p>One context is the work you do. Your job affects your sense of time. I imagine that Paramedics and Quarterbacks likely think in <strong>seconds and minutes</strong>. If a patient goes into cardiac arrest, there seems to be an immediacy of action that other jobs lack.</p><p>The technology people that I’ve spent my career with…Product Managers and Software Developers, think in terms of <strong>weeks, sprints, and quarters.</strong> Our planning cycles contain deadlines, iterations, and launches. Even the CEO’s I’ve worked with often keep their time scales in shorter cycles as the technology can change quickly.</p><p>Urban Planners and Architects think in longer terms — <strong>years and decades.</strong> The scale of the work they do requires more time, and therefore, they have longer-term perspectives. The new Eastern span of the Bay Bridge in the SF Bay area took over a decade to complete and several years in planning since the impetus was the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.</p><p>Few people think in <strong>centuries or millennia</strong>, but among them are Historians, Archaeologists, and Climate Scientists. Problems like the Climate Crisis, which affect us all, suggest that humanity has to step away from the numerous constructs that have affected the way we think about time and collectively shift to thinking more long-term. <br /> <br />This conclusion led me to wonder how many people I knew take a long-term view, and the answer was very few. Then I thought of Alexander Rose, who has spent his career thinking about the long-term.</p><p>I met Rose at Burning Man in 1999. His part of our camp was called Antarctica. He’d brought an 18-wheeler freezer truck out to the desert, and the idea was to crank up the air conditioning, have a DJ play music, and serve hot chocolate in this mobile club. It was delightful. He’d joined the Long Now Foundation in 1997 and worked there till 2024. He’s Director Emeritus at the Foundation and continues to consult on the Clock project, but he’s currently the Director of Long-term Futures at <a href=""https://automattic.com/"">Automattic</a>. That’s almost 30 years where his efforts had been focused entirely on long-term thinking, AND doing so by engaging in or starting <a href=""https://longnow.org/projects/"">numerous projects</a>. The <strong>Rosetta Project,</strong> for instance, is a global collaboration of language specialists and native speakers working to build a publicly accessible digital library of human languages. <strong>The Manual for Civilization</strong> is a set of 3500 books that would help restart civilization (in case things go awry). I’ve attended numerous talks at the events they set up, and visited the Interval, a lovely bar they built that serves as both a place for drinks and a community space.</p><p>All of these projects are impressive individually, but together they form a collective to support the idea that we humans need to think about the long-term.</p><p>Among these projects is <strong>The Clock of the Long Now</strong>. What is that? Well, it’s a clock designed to function for 10,000 years (or more) that is, “An immense mechanical monument, installed in a mountain, designed to keep accurate time for the next ten millennia. The 10,000-year clock is hundreds of feet tall, engineered to require minimal maintenance, and powered by mechanical energy harvested from sunlight.” Its purpose? The official answer is: “The Clock provides a rare invitation to think and engineer at the timescale of civilization. It offers an enduring symbol of our personal connection to the distant future.”</p><figure><img alt=""This is the face of the Clock of the Long-Now.

Not all things, of course, but for those things that require long-term thinking, the clock<em> </em>is a persistent reminder that some things take a long time. Like the Redwoods I planted in my backyard — inset pictured above.</p><p>Also, it’s arguably the equivalent in terms of human achievement to Stonehenge or the Pyramids. <strong>Wow!</strong> <br /> <br /> I reached out and had a lovely conversation with Rose.</p><p><strong>Dave: </strong>Tell me about your background.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I grew up on the Sausalito waterfront in what was literally a junkyard with a bunch of hippies and artists. I grew up building things and basically wanted to be an inventor, but inventor schools don’t exist, so I thought Architecture was the way to go. I realized it wasn’t for me, and found Industrial Design at Carnegie Mellon. It’s one of the oldest programs in the country, and when I joined, I was very much looking forward to it being hands-on. When I started, they’d hired a new Dean who was very much into rhetoric, so after arguing with him on a relatively constant basis, he bumped me forward a year, and my degree took three years. I graduated in 1994. Afterwards, I moved back to the Bay Area and worked for LucasArts and Chrysler.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Me too. I also have an Industrial Design degree, but started working on web stuff when I moved to the Bay Area. What got you into the Long Now work?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I had been through a few cycles of the game development, and the days were long, but then we’d ship, and then nothing. They don’t need you at all, like a movie production. So I reached out to Stewart Brand, whom I knew growing up, and he told me about the conversations he was having around Long-term Thinking. That we’re living in a world that has long-term consequences like climate change, hunger, education…you name it…but our mechanisms aren’t set up to handle them. Strangely, benevolent dictators do this better, but those are few and far between.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Super few of those on the benevolent front, yeah. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yes, and Democracy, with its four-year election cycle, is particularly bad at this. How do you incentivize lawmakers to care about something 20 years from now when they won’t get the credit for it? Stewart introduced me to Danny Hillis, who started Thinking Machines…</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I worked for Brewster Kahle, who worked for Danny!</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right, so that’s how you ended up with our mutual friend at Burning Man in ‘99.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s right. :)</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> So Danny Hillis is a computer scientist out of MIT, and he wrote an article for Wired in 1995. In it, he outlined his <a href=""https://www.wired.com/1995/12/the-millennium-clock/"">idea for the clock</a>. He and a number of people had been cooking up the Long Now Foundation through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Business_Network"">Global Business Network</a>. Steward set me up with several interviews, one that eventually led to the game company Blizzard, and the other was with his own newly founded project, Long Now. Even though the gaming industry offered more money, I really liked the idea of a 10000-year clock. I joined in 1997.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I know the Long Now Foundation has worked on a bunch of things, and not just the clock, but can you give me a brief background on the clock?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We built the first prototype that we took to TED. It debuted on New Year’s Eve 2000 in the Presidio at the Internet Archive offices, and then we shipped it to the <a href=""https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co531554/first-prototype-of-the-clock-of-the-long-now-1999"">Science Museum in London</a>. Then we built two more, one at the Interval in San Francisco and one for Nathan Myhrvold. I’d met Jeff Bezos at TED after he funded another one of our projects called Long Bets in 2001, and then he and Danny became friends. He was scouting sites for Blue Origin and came to our Nevada site for the clock, and we hiked together, and we all became friends. Bezos offered to fund the full-scale clock at a site he had in Texas, as the site we were looking to use in Nevada had several environmental challenges around access and elevation. Concurrently, many other projects were happening at Long Now. The Rosetta project, The Interval I mentioned, all the talks we’ve had. So now, we’re close to finishing many aspects of the clock, and I realized I didn’t want to administer a non-profit or raise money for the rest of my life. So I started doing research into how to hand off this first generation of work and create something multi-generational.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I read the <a href=""https://longnow.org/clock/faq/"">2024 Hillis FAQ</a> on the Clock. Where are you now?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Well, everything is installed. The clock is made up of modules stacked up 500 feet high, and while each module worked, we hadn’t had the whole thing assembled, so that’s what’s happening now. There are still some details to be dealt with, which we will hopefully be able to talk about soon.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Hillis mentions in the FAQs that it’s a work in progress.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Yeah. There are a couple of things that will be left undone on purpose, but we’ve provided a kind of API, as it were. There are these anniversary chambers that are driven by the clock…an annual, a decade, a century, a millennium, and a ten-millennium one. The first has been commissioned, and we will hopefully do the decade one, but we’ll leave the others for future generations.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s really interesting. I read recently that the best way to think about the future is to establish institutions that will address the future, and yet our current regime is trying to dismantle the future as fast as it can.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The pendulum of justice usually swings in the right direction. :)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> The moral arc of the universe…</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We have these times that are tough to live through for sure, and they can take a very long time, but we hope that’s not the case. We might lose some stuff along the way, and then we’ll have to recreate those things.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> A super smart Designer I know, Bob Baxley says, “Look, they’ll destroy and the younger generation will build,” so he’s got a really hopeful view.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> If there’s one lesson that I got out of Long Now and studying long-term thinking, it’s that the very best way to think long-term is to give more optionality to the future. That you’re trusting the future to have more information on their present than you could project onto them from the past. They are going to make better decisions unless you have taken away their ability to make a decision. If you chop down all the old-growth redwoods, no one ever gets to decide about old-growth redwoods again for a thousand years. This is why the Pace Layers diagram is really good. If you’re chopping down these Redwoods and you’re doing it on the commercial layer. In that case, you’ve skipped Governance and Culture (and of course Nature — SIDE NOTE: If you’re unfamiliar with <a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">Pace Layers</a>, go check it out. Rose drew the diagram we’re all familiar with as an expression of Brands and many others’ thinking.)</p><figure><img alt=""Pace Layers is a diagram that depicts a series of curved lines vertically oriented (almost like a closeup cross -section) with a series of labels from top to bottom showing Fashion (with an additional squiggly line), Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, and Nature — each with an arrow moving off to the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IiD6hj6_X7FaD7mYaLUcNA.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of Pace Layers</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/"">https://longnow.org/ideas/pace-layers/</a></p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Does trust play a role here?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Absolutely. It’s about trusting the future, but it’s not what’s happening in our legislature right now. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the US Constitution) is excellent because they’re short. They’re principles to follow, rather than the 1000 pages of laws that no one reads.</p><p>(for example, the First Amendment — Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.)</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> They’re almost memetic representations. It’s a shame that some folks have boiled down the Second Amendment to “Don’t take my guns,” and it’s an easy thing to repeat.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> It’s a good example because they (the founders) should have left it more open to the principle and not about the object — the people should be allowed to defend themselves and leave that open to interpretation because what they didn’t know is that there’d be, you know, ICBMs and tanks. A lot fewer people would be dead.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> That’s true, and that mentality just seems so hopeless. You touched on this a moment ago, but do you think Designers should have hope? For instance, in a hopeless scenario where the clock, situated in Texas, gets lost because Texas becomes a battleground…have you thought about that? Are you hopeful that it gets found again?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> We designed it to be lost and found for sure, both in the way that it keeps time and has power that it can harvest from the temperature difference. It does more things when people are there, but when they’re not there, it conserves that energy of showing you the time and chiming and things like that. Some of the most successful stories of things lasting a long time are things that are lost, like the Dead Sea Scrolls. If they’re not lost, their chances of surviving sometimes go down. We chose its location based on it being far from human populations, so it is out of the path where humans may destroy and rebuild on a regular basis. We also put it where it’s nowhere near minerals that people would find valuable.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> I hope to visit someday. How has your thinking about time generally changed over the course of your career?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> I’m always kind of looking for a long-term angle on just about anything that I work on and that I think about. In some cases, it’s also discerning what doesn’t need to be thought about long-term and what should be ephemeral. Not everything needs to be long-term. Art and fashion need a lot of space to be ephemeral and playful. On the other hand, organizations like the WHO, which have been around for 40–50 years, have just gone through their first modern global pandemic, but they don’t seem to be well-positioned to provide all the data gathered and lessons learned for another one. They seem highly politicized and defunded. It’s sad, too, that the CDC is getting decimated. We’re in a position for the first time where we can share information instantly and broadly, and redundantly. We have the ability to gather data and collect data even when people are locked down, which didn’t happen during the Black Plague.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Or even the 1918 Flu Pandemic.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Right. Neither situation had the means to understand what was going on globally. Even worse, is that we have European numbers on deaths but little information on African lives lost.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Switching gears a bit, can you talk about AI and its potential to help with long-term thinking?</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> The first time I remember it coming up was in a digital preservation conference we had back in ’98. It was actually <a href=""https://www.jaronlanier.com/"">Jaron Lanier</a> who said, “You know what would be a great use for AI is basically little agents that exercise boring data. Everyone’s preserving all the video games because they’re fun, but who’s preserving WordPerfect 2.0 and knowing if it’s not working on a current system?”</p><p>I don’t think that AI is going to be as destructive as many think. I think it’s going to cause a lot of differences, but I’m certainly not a big doomsayer about it.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> If we’re engaged with spectral thinking, AI exists on that spectrum. There will be bad actors who do horribly evil things, there’ll be some really, really cool advancements for humanity and society, and everything in between. It will take some jobs and create other jobs. There will be a shift.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> When people started freaking out about AI taking jobs was exactly when AI could start taking journalist jobs. Automation has been taking jobs for a long time…a dishwashing machine in a restaurant took a dishwasher’s job. Dishwashers are like the first robots, but no one cared because doing dishes was a chore, and dishwashers had no agency. But the day that ChatGPT could write an article better than about 75% of writers, the journalists all freaked out, and then they wrote a bunch of articles. When DALL-E came out, I saw real problems coming for the illustration market.</p><p><strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I teach over at California College of the Arts, and the Illustration Department in particular is very upset about AI. But it’s just one perspective. When <a href=""https://www.pentagram.com/about/paula-scher"">Paula Scher,</a> a Pentagram Partner, is willing to train an AI with an illustration style to generate hundreds of icons for <a href=""http://performance.gov/"">Performance.gov</a>, I appreciate her efforts to embrace the new tools, although she took a lot of shit for it. I think it’s going to be a bit of a roller coaster ride for a while. <br /> <br /> Listen, thanks very much for your time. I realize how valuable it is.</p><p><strong>Rose:</strong> Happy to speak to you. Thanks.</p><p>After we spoke, I dug up the earliest reference to what would become the Long Now Foundation and the clock in an article by Hillis.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of a photo I took of the Wired Scenarios article from Danny Hillis. The quote that is most completely pictured here is: “I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oak. I have hope for the future.” — Hillis (1995)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5tsO1KCEOtjLUx7XkwLrbQ.png"" /><figcaption>Photo of Wired Scenarios from the library of the California College of Arts taken by Dave Hoffer</figcaption></figure><p>Several things struck me:</p><p><strong>Conception</strong><br /> <br />Hillis talks about conceiving of the clock, and he says,</p><blockquote>“My friends who get it all have ideas that focus on a particular aspect of the clock. My engineering friends worry about the power source: solar, water, nuclear, geothermal, diffusion, or tidal? My entrepreneurial friends muse about how to make it financially self-sustaining. My writer friend, <a href=""http://www.well.com/user/sbb/"">Stewart Brand</a>, starts thinking about the organization that will take care of the clock. It’s a Rorschach test — of time. <a href=""http://www.geffen.com/gabriel.html"">Peter Gabriel</a>, the musician, thinks the clock should be alive, like a garden, counting the seasons with short-lived flowers, counting the years with sequoias and bristlecone pines. Artist <a href=""http://www.spies.com/Eno/Enohome.html"">Brian Eno</a> felt it should have a name, so he gave it one: The Clock of the Long Now.”</blockquote><p>That’s a really good list of people to speak with about an endeavor like this.</p><p><strong>Execution</strong></p><p>Hillis talks about what it means to build such a clock and its longevity. Corrosion and power sources were actually less of a concern to him than people, as the real problem. What if, for instance, it lasted 500 years but was lost? Those who found it cared more about the metal that it was made of and scrapped it for parts.</p><blockquote>“In the universe, pure information lives the longest. Bits last.”</blockquote><p>People’s construct of time has lasted a great deal longer than most clocks. It’s the ideas (bits) that last. Hillis is friends with Teller (of Penn and Teller), who suggested that Hillis film a documentary, establish the idea that the clock exists, but never really build it. Teller’s career was built on misdirection, but it’s an interesting take on longevity. Create the idea, not the actual clock.</p><p><strong>Hope</strong></p><p>What struck me the most was how Hillis ended the article:</p><blockquote>“I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. I have hope for the future.”</blockquote><p>I’m with Hillis on this. I planted Redwood trees in my backyard, and I know I’ll never live to see them grow huge, but we have to have hope for the future, despite how bleak things look right now. Earlier in the article, Hillis talks about what the future might hold.</p><blockquote>“The end of everything we know. The beginning of something we may never understand.”</blockquote><p>Certainly, no one foresaw the place we’ve arrived at in this, our future. The English expression (misattributed to an ancient Chinese curse) — May you live in interesting times — seems especially significant. <br /> <br /> And yet, I still have hope for the future. I hope you do too.</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Tse, P.U., Intriligator, J., Rivest, J. <em>et al.</em> Attention and the subjective expansion of time. <em>Perception &amp; Psychophysics</em> <strong>66</strong>, 1171–1189 (2004). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844"">https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03196844</a></p><p>Inner Cosmos with David Eagleman — Does time really slow down when you’re in fear for your life?

<h4>What happens when systems decide the human is ‘all-knowing’</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover design with title, ominous, with illustrative eyes peering through fur"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*hefC9NVYPmY91g01Rlsdeg.png"" /></figure><blockquote>Ever click a button and have a system misbehave with no warning, feedback, or a way to undo, only to feel the repercussions minutes or a few days later?</blockquote><p>This is what I’ve coined “Designing for Omniscience” (and the horrors thereof). It’s what happens when a system assumes the human on the other end is ‘all-knowing’ and proceeds in silence. This arrogance of finality can scar (or scare) and have real world consequences beyond the screen, and in some cases, can be catastrophic.</p><p>Many systems are accidentally designed to act with certainty. I’ll unpack the hidden ghosts of imperfection in interfaces we rely heavily on to handle our finances, ensure smooth healthcare transactions, make online purchases, and govern how we secure our homes and travel.</p><h4><strong>Horror #1: Design systems devoid of humanity</strong></h4><p>To be human is to make mistakes. But every product makes a choice: to create space for human error, or silently treat it as intent. What happens when systems act in such a way that the human is blamed for the system’s oversight? Earlier this month, I found myself in this scenario with a healthcare portal.</p><p>It’s common knowledge through our collective experience as patients that some medical software is a patchwork of older systems and code at best. Don’t be surprised if there are cobwebbed corners of COBOL, responsible for critical system functions behind the curtain in municipal and financial software that you rely on.*</p><p>Both healthcare professionals and patients who rely on these tools are forced to use software that feels like a journey to the infancy of the internet. Part of the problem is that the software is optimized for the larger healthcare company at best.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for one persona is twofold:</p><ol><li><strong>The system is developed for the licensee’s benefit. </strong>Designed for data compliance, billing accuracy, and liability management, leaving a gap for the lived experience of patients (not to mention the most vulnerable populations seeking care);</li><li><strong>The system is brittle. </strong>When those least equipped (elderly patients, caregivers, busy parents managing entire family care), must navigate these systems, errors turn into billing nightmares or missed care, creating unnecessary burdens due to a system that assumes the patient is all-knowing.</li></ol><p>For nearly a decade, I used a popular digital payment service for online transactions. Adding a virtual card as one of my payment methods in my healthcare provider’s portal, I wasn’t aware that the system would decline payment despite a funded checking account. There was no alert, warning, or feedback provided. I didn’t need to triple check on a card in the portal before payment, nor did I get a signal that anything could go awry.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*HShv6TOVGz6_5_6yKSTeSg.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of the software’s Billing and payments page, with no update, read, or delete experience to verify or change payment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first time, I assumed a temporary glitch in the portal since I’d never had problems with utilization. A day after the 2nd decline, I received formal communication framing a routine billing issue in alarmingly severe terms. Later, I discovered, the system allows users to upload payment methods that it cannot always reliably process due to privacy and compliance regulations that virtual cards are not held against. The typical user will never have this knowledge.</p><figure><img alt=""Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*V6hUMbausOtApDLuXmOt2A.png"" /><figcaption>Rough sketch of ‘Add card’ interface. Defaulting a new card is unnoticeable and prechecked.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a result of “Designing for Omniscience.” The software introduces a lived experience with a horrifying threat for the end user by prioritizing transaction finality and legal defensibility over people and their well being. The most vulnerable populations won’t experience ‘Designing for Omniscience’ as minor bug but as a systemic failure, one with no business incentive to fix. It’s software built on the idea that the intended beneficiary is 100% responsible for an unvalidated click.</p><h4><strong>Horror #2: Granting unearned ‘God mode’</strong></h4><p>Imagine you’re facing the cockpit of a commercial aircraft. These systems are built on a design ethos that assists users in their decision making, and have set up parameters to check human choices given environmental factors. Now, consider for a moment, while activating another control, you accidentally activate the thrust reverser, a device that redirects engine power to slow down on the ground. Sensors confirm when they can be deployed on the ground, but if activated during flight, the system does more than display a warning; <strong>it prevents you from taking the action.</strong> The system design for aeronautics employs situational awareness and anticipates human error to protect everyone on board.</p><p>In 2021 a video-on-demand streaming service sent a blank test email, subject line: “<strong>Integration Test Email #1</strong>” to 6 million subscribers, bypassing the internal test list. The mass mailing was sent by an intern who likely received insufficient system feedback when confirming, with no perceived consequences before clicking “Send.” Ask any Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) about a failsafe, and they’d wax lyrical about the concept of a “Game day.” A simulation environment that enables practicing for disasters and the ability to run various tests in a controlled learning environment before an incident.</p><p>The company’s help team took to a social media platform and apologized for the incident, but called out its intern.</p><figure><img alt=""We mistakenly stend out an empty test email to a portion of our HBO Max mailing list this evening.

Most related to posts confirming they too experienced poorly designed hands-off systems, treating the “Send” button as low, if not no friction. In this case, the software assumed the user understood the volume of the distribution list chosen and confidently didn’t need draft mode or a sandbox, following the send command.</p><p>Being able to select a full list of subscribers from a test account is nerve wracking; then to hit send with no fail safe, is a design flaw with rightfully placed anxiety on the user. Here, the system assumed a level of confidence in the intern, who likely hasn’t garnered this level of trust, yet was afforded an unusual amount typically granted a senior or seasoned manager driving a marketing platform.</p><p>Without parameters like role-based access control (RBAC), there’s a projected fallacy of perfect knowledge onto humans by software, giving free rein and superpowers over decisions that can cause a ripple effect of issues. Imagine a system design deciding that a newly onboarded user would never confuse a test for six million subscribers.</p><figure><img alt=""Sketch illustration of Twitter posts from tech professionals, filled with support."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZVX3rEU2zfaNJXCIMfWP5g.png"" /><figcaption>Support on Twitter from other tech professionals. <a href=""https://x.com/rakyll/status/1405752437286133760"">https://x.com/rakyll/status/1405752437286133760</a>, <a href=""https://x.com/carotechie/status/1406070141604052994"">https://x.com/carotechie/status/1406070141604052994</a>, <a href=""https://x.com/chorne_/status/1405917919108685825"">https://x.com/chorne_/status/1405917919108685825</a></figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Horror #3: Speed over protection</strong></h4><p>Imagine navigating a workflow with a wall of input fields and checkboxes to complete a task involving enormous sums of money, with no final summary or warning about the large sum of funds about to transfer hands.</p><figure><img alt=""Image of the hired financial management software."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VU6ZQIYFjiwn1jhDHUqbCw.png"" /><figcaption>Source: United States District Court Southern District of New York 2021, Figure 1</figcaption></figure><p>Financial tools, if not designed with the end user in mind, can be a minefield of detrimental UX challenges. In 2020, a financial institution intended to make a $7.8M interest payment to its lender. The institution employs a loan operating system to handle its financial transactions. The software was older and inherently complex. The interface mistakenly allowed a wire disbursement to the full principal, shy of $900 million.</p><p>A built in pause: When purchasing my home, before receiving a cashier’s check for an amount that my financial institution saw as unusual for my spending pattern, they paused. Seeing the recipient was an Esq., they assumed it was for a home down payment. The banker asked if it was for a down payment, and gave me a surprising, heartfelt congratulations when I confirmed. This subtle, in person fact checking process was designed with humans and connection in mind to protect the individual and the institution. The banking software missed this layer of contextual awareness, and the opportunity to flag high stakes was missed. This pause can catch errors before they become legal pain.</p><p>The product teams designing <strong>against</strong> omniscience today,</p><ol><li><strong>Create a pattern of verifying </strong>and communicate with context. Affirming: “Are you sure? You’re sending an email to 6M subscribers” or “$900M will be funded toward principal. Is this information correct?” allowing multiple people to check the summary.</li><li><strong>Enforce awareness and constraint.</strong> Building safe systems that warn you and prevent errors before they happen. When enforcing constraints, the system is designed to collect data for improved contextual awareness and pattern recognition over time, circumventing a crisis.</li><li><strong>Allow for good service management.</strong> They know that not every user needs access to ALL commands. Approvals and governance give far more freedom, reinforcing a culture of psychological safety in organizations, big or small.</li></ol><p>Every system’s design pattern carries the weight of necessary decision making, a decision about who carries the burden of cognitive load. It questions, “Will this flow remove the final confirmation for powerful commands?” “Will every weighted command be granted by default?” “Can we give users a choice on which failures to silence?” When designing, diverse teams can choose differently, building systems that balance power, protection, and forgiveness, making the choice for more efficient and safe software. The alternative gears us toward a future in which the very technologies built to serve us, as we quickly make advances, create larger implications if they are designed to continue to see users as omniscient. That’s the greatest horror of all.</p><p>*<em>Source:<br /></em><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/new-jersey-seeks-cobol-programmers-to-fix-unemployment-system.html""><em>NJ needs volunteers who know COBOL</em></a><em>… (2020), + NYDOL<br /></em><a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/if-cobol-is-so-problematic-why-does-the-us-government-still-use-it/""><em>If COBOL is so problematic, why does the US gov’t still use it?</em></a><em> (2025)</em></p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=557ba3ea60e4"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-horrors-of-designing-for-omniscience-557ba3ea60e4"">The horrors of designing for omniscience</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>Karl Popper and the extinction of the rational mind</h4><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of philosopher Karl Popper in his later years, wearing a light collared shirt under a sweater, looking thoughtfully at the camera against a dark background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gsKgDFv2JisUig2zOdNqOA.png"" /><figcaption>Karl Popper</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Disagreement feels like a loyalty test.</strong></p><p>Even the way we ask questions has changed. We phrase them like traps and treat the answers as evidence. That hasn’t stopped us from talking about sensitive topics, but it’s made talking things out feel very performative.</p><p>For me, it’s raised a harder question: What does tolerance actually mean? Because those most eager to claim it might be showing us its limits.</p><p><em>I’m </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/natesowder/""><em>Nate Sowder</em></a><em>, and this is unquoted, installment 11. It’s on Karl Popper and why our ability to reason is losing ground.</em></p><h3>The paradox that defined an open society</h3><p>In the 1940s, Karl Popper was watching Europe fracture under ideologies that promised perfection. Fascism on the right… communism on the left. Each claimed moral certainty, each silenced dissent, and both produced the same result: <strong>ruin</strong>.</p><p>He also saw that when societies built on freedom fail, they fail because they forget how to defend that freedom, not because they lack ideals.</p><p>That distinction is important and became known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance""><em>Paradox of Tolerance.</em></a></p><p>If a society is endlessly tolerant (even of those who would destroy it) its openness becomes the weapon that ends it. However, if it fights back by becoming intolerant in its defense, it destroys itself from the inside.</p><p>You can see the paradox everywhere.</p><ul><li>Online communities that tolerate every voice until no reasonable ones remain.</li><li>Workplaces where “all ideas are valid” slowly turn into echo chambers.</li><li>Governments that either over-police or under-protect, losing legitimacy both ways.</li></ul><p>This is where constraints become useful. When disagreement has rules that keep learning possible, a system can stabilize. Remove those boundaries, and what’s left isn’t conversation, it’s noise. Really loud noise.</p><h3>Is conviction incentivized?</h3><p>Popper assumed reason would have home-field advantage. That people, given access to enough information and debate, would use both to get smarter.</p><p>He didn’t live to see a world where information moves faster than understanding. Where the desire for attention replaced the desire for credibility, and the platforms built to democratize truth started monetizing conviction instead of reflection.</p><p>The <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/"">open society</a> he imagined depended on friction which included time to debate and learn. As we know too well, the systems we built removed that. Attention has become a metric of truth and if you can move fast enough, well, that’s a pretty good <a href=""https://medium.com/user-experience-design-1/negotiating-truth-ad3ea06886b2"">negotiation tactic</a>.</p><p>That’s when the result starts to feel predictable. Moral confidence will always outperform curiosity, and when belief spreads faster than anyone’s desire to verify it, conviction becomes a competitive advantage.</p><p>That’s a design flaw Popper didn’t anticipate: <strong>We built networks that prize the expression of belief but penalize the act of changing one.</strong></p><figure><img alt=""Philosopher Karl Popper sitting outdoors at a table, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt, writing in a notebook with a pen. A cup and small recorder rest nearby, and the background shows a garden with chairs, potted flowers, and sunlight."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9CeKlg-bxFE367WsqH7QjA.png"" /><figcaption>Philosopher Karl Popper</figcaption></figure><h3>The moral armor of tolerance</h3><p>Popper saw tolerance as a civic safeguard. That means a system designed to protect disagreement so reason could do its work. But somewhere along the line, tolerance stopped being a discipline.</p><p>Let’s look at where things are today. The people most likely to describe themselves as <a href=""https://www.freiheit.org/mexico/limits-tolerance-poppers-paradox"">“tolerant”</a> often carry the firmest moral boundaries. Their openness ends right where their convictions begin. They don’t enter conversations to be open or change. Instead, they enter to show that they don’t need to be.</p><p>You can hear it in how people with conviction build their case. They take a broad topic and zoom in until only a small part is emphasized. That part becomes the whole argument, which to them, feels very clear. That’s why conviction feels like clarity. It’s not a wide view, it’s actually very narrow.</p><p>This is how those exchanges feel when they unfold.</p><ul><li>Questions feel phrased like traps.</li><li>Answers are scored like confessionals.</li><li>Statement are weighed for moral correctness before they’re considered for meaning.</li><li>There is little desire to ‘abstract’ or take a broader view of a topic.</li></ul><p>That’s how tolerance turns into ‘armor’. It wears the language of inclusion but moves like a defense strategy. It’s not there to protect dialogue (or friendship… or relationships) it’s there to protect the person’s identity.</p><p>True openness means arriving without a verdict. If your moral identity enters the room first, your curiosity never makes it through the da*n door.</p><h3>The consequence</h3><p>Conviction is exhausting. It‘s angry.</p><p>I get it. People are passionate, they’re frustrated and feel unheard. And they’re right… a lot of people don’t want to talk to them any more.</p><p>But look, I usually don’t disagree with what’s being said, so it’s not because they’re wrong, it’s because every conversation is abrasive.</p><p>That’s what conviction does. It makes conversation feel like a sentencing.</p><p>Rational people disappear because that’s something they don’t want to deal with. To them, it’s about progress, not persuasion… and that’s a distinction that never seems to register.</p><p>They’re watching the same movie… they just notice different things. For them, it’s more about trying to understand how the scene fits into the plot.</p><p>Reasoning is endurance. They‘re happy to be in the room… they just don’t need to win it.</p><h3>My reflection</h3><p>We can each decide what kind of openness we want to practice… the decorative kind that performs virtue while closing their ears (la-la-la), or the difficult kind that listens without any sort of defense.</p><p>I’ve enjoyed reading about Popper. His stuff was meant to keep societies <em>thinkable, </em>which applies to every system we build.</p><p>The biggest lesson? Reason isn’t polite — but it’s generous.</p><p>If reason feels endangered, it’s because too many of us confuse certainty with strength… and mistake agreement for some sort of progress.</p><p>An open society (and an open mind) only survive the same way: by staying corrigible (Which means being open to being corrected).</p><p>That’s not a weakness.<br />That’s design, baby.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=518c42ec62be"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/the-paradox-of-tolerance-518c42ec62be"">The paradox of tolerance</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>How the new Sora app icon gives away more than meets the eye.</h4><figure><img alt=""Sora App Icon: A Visual Breakdown"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h_U-o0S_igR0xLB9nQxcBg.png"" /><figcaption>The New Sora App Icon is Giving Away More Than Meets the Eye.</figcaption></figure><p>Two weeks ago we saw <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/news/797752/openai-sora-app-1-million-downloads"">the release of the new Sora app by OpenAI</a>. Unfortunately the app is only available in the US and Canada, and I’m in neither. Since I can’t use the app itself, I thought I’ll do a breakdown of what I can actually see — the app icon, it looks simple at first glance but it packs a lot if we can deconstruct it. I’m doing this breakdown as a fun exercise in design appreciation, I know my breakdown will probably not going to align with the authorial intent behind it. If you like this breakdown please share it, now let’s dive in.</p><p>These kinds of breakdowns are akin to exercises I used to do while earning my Master’s Degree in Visual Communications, they can be a lot of fun but they’re intended to reveal hidden truths or meanings lurking in plain sight. Seeing with our eyes is great but analyzing a visual component in a written long-form article tend to make us (or at least — make me) think a little harder, to notice the things I can feel when looking at a visual work, but don’t consciously see.</p><p>Breaking down Sora’s app icon will require some knowledge of what the Sora app is. Sora is a mix of a social video app, like TikTok, but all the content is AI generated videos, not unlike Midjourney’s Explore page.</p><p>The Sora app also has a feature called “cameo” where you can generate videos of yourself, or any other person who gave the app permission, could be your friends or could be celebrities like Michael Jackson or even OpenAI’s Sam Altman (who appears in many of Sora’s videos).</p><p>The generated videos are not more than 10 seconds long and rendered with both sound and a moving watermark, to make it harder to spread as real footage. The app itself is invite only right now, but will probably be available soon to everyone, with better and more precise rules and guardrails in place. Even though the app feels like TikTok and got a lot of comparisons to TikTok in both the traditional media and social media — its app icon is very different.</p><figure><img alt=""OpenAI Sora new website, screenshot shows 4 AI Generated videos."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xMhzoToX8aixuIrFPpGpzw.png"" /><figcaption><em>OpenAI’s Sora website — on the right side are 4 generated videos.</em></figcaption></figure><h3>The little cloud</h3><p>The most prominent element in the Sora icon is without a doubt the cloud in the middle. At first we can see by its shape and angle of rotation that this cloud is the same as the ChatGPT icon — OpenAI’s only app except Sora.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon, ChatGPT app icon and both overlayed on one another."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sZUSB5cki_xyNyb23vFeHA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left to right: Sora app icon, ChatGPT app icon, both icons overlayed.</em></figcaption></figure><p>The reason I started by calling it a “cloud” is that it looks kind of like a cloud since it’s floating in the sky. This also can fit the AI narrative of making everything, including videos, in the cloud (in the technological sense of clouds). Generated AI images are also often compared to humans looking at the clouds and seeing things, and in that sense it would be really easy to see a cloud in this icon too. But when I tried to compare it to other clouds iconography used by tech companies, something amazing happened- I realized it’s not a cloud at all.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PpcopKEAVo8yQaO0bvpmeg.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon, Apple’s iCloud app icon and Microsoft’s OneDrive App icon</em></figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the other “clouds” are flat at the bottom so the cloud can actually stand upright when left alone on a desk, like a computer would. This might be an intentional aspect of cloud computing since they are computers behind the curtains, after all.</p><p>The Sora icon is different, so it’s not a cloud, it can also reference a thought bubble in the style of comics, since they have no flat part. Notice that these bubbles are for thinking, not speaking.</p><p>The thinking behind this might be that Sora generates videos in the speed of thought, any video you can think of will be done in mere minutes. The only barrier now is your own imagination, or your thought process, just like the thought bubbles in comics that can only hold so much text. Also, both comics and AI prompts use text in a very similar ”conversational” manner, so it’s only natural to use it for this icon.</p><figure><img alt=""Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_DErPy0iu-bjGI7V1kODdw.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: a thought bubble (from Understanding Comics/ Scott McCloud, 1993)</em></figcaption></figure><p>At this point you might think sure I believe you it’s a thought bubble, but why does this bubble have eyes, well I’m getting to it.</p><h3>Smiling with your eyes</h3><p>First of all let’s get the obvious out of the way — the eyes make it seem like a friendly robot, signaling this AI is a friendly one. Sora’s AI is a cute little robot that just wants to help you be more creative and is capable of no harm (roll your eyes now, please).</p><p>Of course, that’s not the whole story, the eyes have little AI “sparkling” emoji, as we all know this emoji (✨) was intended to signal magical stuff but was hijacked by the AI industry to signal if anything has AI in it. Much like the AI industry highjacked all of our content and scrapped everything humans ever created- they also highjacked the icon to represent it (again, roll your eyes).</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an anime girl with sparkling eyes."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FGJHCLSs7F2EYhoVhcAUMA.png"" /><figcaption><em>Left: Sora app icon, Right: Smile Precure!, スマイルプリキュア！ (Episode 35)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This emoji, like all original emojis, was first made by Shigetaka Kurita for SoftBank- a Japanese telecom company. Kurita itself was asked by David Amel (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw""><em>YouTube link</em></a>) about the usage of this icon for AI features and he didn’t like it. Of course anybody can use any emoji but since its meaning was originally supposed to be something else and the literal father of emojis doesn’t like it, I’ll consider this emoji stolen because they highjacked its meaning.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot from David Amel’s video showing him talking and two sparkling amojis signifying either magical things or AI."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ADT0DP5Uz6zR6_7Le47u4w.avif"" /><figcaption>David Amel Emoji video (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-pG79LOtMw"">YouTube Link</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>To bring it back to the Sora icon itself, if we’ll look closely at the eyes we can see that it’s not eyes at all, it’s holes that we can see the background through. What can be the meaning of those “holes for eyes” face, well — first of all let’s explore the most simple answer. A face with holes for eyes is a skull, the eyes decay and we’re left with only the bones.</p><figure><img alt=""Sora’s app icon next to an Emoji skull."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*52WES-3a-DkiTiXOWW9kUQ.png"" /><figcaption><em>Sora app icon vs a skull (via Apple’s Emoji)</em></figcaption></figure><p>A skull is obviously a dead person, but it can also refer to pirates because of their flag, known as the Jolly Roger or simply as the “skull and crossbones”. Pirates can mean a few things in the software business, first and the most likely explanation here is a nod to the famous Steve Jobs quote “it’s better to be a pirate than to join the navy”.</p><p>The meaning of this quote is that it’s better to explore the unexplored than to act inline — since the discovery of the new will always happen by “pirates”. Steve Jobs apparently felt so strongly about this quote that he did decorate Apple’s offices with the Jolly Roger flag in his first run at Apple.</p><figure><img alt=""Young Steve Jobs and John Sculley standing in frond of an Apple-made Jolly Roger pirate flag."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3aD_OJbftxwqTxSoODN3TA.avif"" /><figcaption><em>Steve Jobs standing in front of Apple’s Jolly Roger flag.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of course we’re all thinking about the other explanation of a pirate flag in the software industry and that’s pirated software. Pirated software is what the software industry calls a piece of software that users share among themselves without proper licensing.</p><p>That was (and still is) a crime when people did that and some people even got sued or fined for it. But when big companies do that, like OpenAI and other AI companies it’s somehow not a crime and they get to be worth billions of dollars instead. So they do really get to be pirates.</p><p>Another popular entity with holes for eyes is the Golem. The Golem is a famous European Jewish myth about a clay creature that becomes alive when a wise rabbi does some magic to awake him. The magic this rabbi is doing is to carve a word into the Golem’s forehead, the word in this instance can be analogous to a prompt the AI needs to do its magic, to become “alive”.</p><p>Both AI and the Golem in the story are not really alive but rather have the illusion of being alive. The Jewish tale is meant to be cautionary, the Golem is becoming unstoppable and tries to upstage the rabbi, much like AI is threatening to upstage human workers in many different industries today.</p><p>If you don’t like this Jewish parable you can think of The Terminator instead, it’s also a man-made entity that, once built, we lost any control over it. The Terminator again looks like a skull and again has no eyes (only lights, much like the sparkling in Sora’s no-eyes), so it’s a good enough reference, although I prefer the Golem analogy.

<h4>What impact does digitization of electoral process actually have?</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fALUsm56qBpcYPmPfWG2fQ.png"" /><figcaption>Image of a hand dropping a ballot inside of a computer</figcaption></figure><p>The mayoral election is around the corner in my hometown of Montreal, so I wanted to confirm whether I was registered to vote at my current address. What I naively assumed would be a simple task turned out to require a trip to a local community centre. I gave my name, they flipped through a binder, and gave me the thumbs up within 3 seconds of arriving. It felt like the ultimate “this could have been an email” moment and I lost two hours of my day confirming something I should’ve been able to check online in those 3 seconds.</p><p>Technology isn’t a silver bullet, and I’m far from a techno-optimist, but it <em>can </em>be a powerful vector for improvement. When designed carefully, it can increase accessibility, surface critical information, maybe even make it easier for people to engage civically in this context. For a long time, I assumed the main reason we hadn’t digitized more of the democratic process was good old-fashioned bureaucracy, a sluggish, underfunded government with outdated tools. I held a fundamental belief that if we simply made it easier to vote by letting people cast ballots from their phones or laptops more people <em>would</em>! More access = more engagement.</p><p>So I decided to investigate some interesting examples of places where they’ve managed to digitize their electoral process and see what the results were!</p><figure><img alt=""Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*Pnh_PCN3gDlRGcYk"" /><figcaption>Markhamian looking at an digital ballot on an iPad</figcaption></figure><h3>Markham’s digital experiment</h3><p>We’ll start with an interesting homegrown example. <a href=""https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&amp;dir=rec/tech/consult&amp;document=p5&amp;lang=e"">In 2003, the City of Markham,</a> a suburb north of Toronto, launched one of Canada’s first pilot projects to enable online voting in a municipal election. The initiative was small at first but had the ambitious aim of testing whether residents could safely and securely cast a ballot from their home computers!</p><p>As is often the case with public sector innovation, the city didn’t have the money or in-house expertise to develop its own secure digital voting infrastructure so it turned to a third-party vendor called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytl"">Scytl</a>, a Spanish company that specialized in using cryptography to secure elections. The way the system works is each eligible voter receives a Voter Information Letter by mail, this includes a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN). Then during the advance voting period, Markhamians? Markhamites? People from Markham would go to Markham’s election website, hosted by Scytl, enter their PIN, and authenticate their identity with personal information (such as date of birth and postal code) matched against the city’s registry. Once verified, they could cast their vote through a digital ballot interface! And voila, the vote was then encrypted and transmitted to a secure election server, where it remained sealed until game day(election day).</p><p>Seems straight-forward enough right? And, cherry on top, according to city officials, online voting participation increased in each cycle, particularly among seniors and people with mobility limitations! But here’s the kicker: despite the relatively simple process, turnout didn’t budge. Most of the people who voted online were the same people who would’ve voted anyway.</p><p>Unfortunately, Markham’s experiment became a reference point across Canada informing other municipalities’ approaches to digital voting. Also more importantly, the third party system that Markham was relying on, Scytl, eventually filed for <a href=""https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20200514/481138885893/scytl-sandton-capital-liquidacion-venta-negocio-juez-voto-electronico.html"">bankruptcy in 2020, citing over €75 million</a> in debt. Causing us to ask the question: what happens when the company holding your digital ballots no longer exists? Without money to invest in an internal system and having to rely on third parties, can be potentially devastating. What if Scytl had gone bankrupt, during an election? Needless to say, Markham no longer allows e-voting, which makes me e-sad.</p><figure><img alt=""ivote interface showing how votes could be stolen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*I7c20DI7UwdOvEO3.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1504.05646"">A proof of concept, that shows the exploit against iVote to inject malicious code that would surreptitiously manipulate the voter’s choices</a></figcaption></figure><h3>When e-voting went wrong</h3><p>While Markham was a valiant attempt, it was small potatoes dealing with local politics and might not in and of itself be representative of the potential impact of online voting at a national level. So let’s look at an example of how things can go, very, very wrong and very right. Starting with the bad.</p><p>In 2015, New South Wales Australia rolled out the <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05646?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">world largest ever e-vote</a> system called iVote. This system allowed voters to cast their ballots online during the state election. Again the goal was to increase accessibility for people with disabilities and those living remotely, while also trying to modernize the voting experience by letting people vote from personal devices.</p><p>iVote purportedly was actually quite a nice app and the user experience was smooth and intuitive. Public communication about this new way of voting was also strong, causing nearly 280,000 votes to be cast using iVote in that election! Trouble is, in the days following the election, some pesky independent researchers discovered <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22270-7_3""><strong>severe vulnerabilities</strong></a> in the live system. Among them: an insecure external analytics script that could have allowed attackers to intercept or alter votes, and a verification process that could be manipulated to provide false assurances to voters.</p><p>What’s worse, there is no clear evidence of tampering, but the possibility was there and because of this they will never try to pilot a program like this again. This may have very well affected who took office and the downstream impacts of that are no joke. The point of this example is to highlight what is at stake if the system goes south, or should I say New South (I’m sorry). In this case, there was no clear evidence of hacking but the vulnerability existed and may have been exploited to favour one candidate or another. With consequences this high, how important is the convenience of voting online in contrast?</p><p><a href=""https://www.innovationaus.com/ivote-written-out-of-nsw-law-as-digital-voting-review-begins/"">iVote was quietly shelved</a> in the years that followed. They had lost the trust of the public despite a lack of evidence of hacking and what began as a promise of a modern democracy ended up as a prime example of how important security is in this conversation. The lesson from New South Wales is clear: building digital voting systems isn’t just about making them easy to use, it’s about making them impossible to doubt. And that requires more than good design. It requires deep, structural transparency, independent oversight, and a willingness to stop and re-assess when trust begins to weaken.</p><figure><img alt=""Image showing Estonia’s digital ID card"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Wds6woYpODxmW6Pv.jpg"" /><figcaption>Example of Estonias Digital ID card</figcaption></figure><h3>The shining beacon of Estonia</h3><p>Lastly, I’d like to pull up the most frequently cited example of a successful techo-democracy. Estonia! A small but mighty nation that is often on the cutting edge. They were the first country to launch internet voting at a national level in <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4343374.stm"">2005</a>. Their system called i-voting, allowed citizens to cast their ballots online from any internet connected device, for both national and municipal elections. When it initially rolled out, online adoption was around <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">2%</a> in the first year but it has since climbed to over <a href=""https://www.valimised.ee/en/archive/statistics-about-internet-voting-estonia"">40%</a> of its population using online voting.</p><p>But, the reason this is possible is because unlike most countries, Estonia had spent the prior decade building a national digital identity card. This is a critical part of the puzzle unfortunately, and it’s what allows their digital voting program to be so successful. They already use their digital ID’s to file taxes, access their own medical records, and sign legal documents. So when the opportunity came to use this same, state-backed secure authentication method, it was a no brainer. They had the full infrastructure to roll it out.</p><p>Their i-Voting process is built for security and usability. Voters insert their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_identity_card"">digital ID card</a> (or they can use a mobile app), log into a government portal, and are presented with a digital ballot. Once completed, their vote is encrypted and then sent to a secure server. To guard against coercion or vote buying, voters can re-vote multiple times online. This protects against a common concern people have in e-voting, which is buying votes! Only their final submission is counted. And if someone chooses to vote in person on election day, it overrides any previous digital votes. Pretty ingenious.</p><p>Crucially, Estonia’s system includes end-to-end cryptographic verification. Voters can use a smartphone app to verify that their encrypted ballot was received and counted as intended without revealing who they voted for. The entire system is publicly audited, with detailed post-election reviews conducted by independent experts.</p><p>The Estonian system really is as good as it gets when it comes to a thoughtful, comprehensive and secure approach to digitizing democracy, and because of its long history it also offers us some concrete data on what effect digitization has on voter turnout. So here it is: 0.2 to 0.8 percentage points. That’s it. From 2005 to 2025. The painful truth is that if you’re looking to get more empowered citizens, focusing on access to voting is actually the last step in the process.</p><p>There are tangibly good reasons to invest in e-voting and they genuinely matter. From an accessibility standpoint alone, giving people with reduced mobility the ability to vote independently and securely is a powerful step forward. That, in itself, is worth the effort.</p><p>But if the goal is to dramatically increase engagement, we’re nowhere near a solution and I’m confident that the solution won’t be a purely technological one. What I uncovered is, if you care about people voting, it’s clear that access, especially technological access, is not the main bottleneck.</p><p>We need to stop obsessing over the ballot interfaces and start asking harder questions. Why don’t people vote in the first place? What would make them want to?</p><p>That’s where the real design challenge lies and that’s where we should be putting our energy!</p><p>P.S Don’t forget to vote in your next election</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=cfd6674465a2"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/can-technology-fix-voting-cfd6674465a2"">Can technology fix voting?</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"
