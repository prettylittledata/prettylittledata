I feel a lot, as a writer by profession and heart.</p><p>I’ve gone through the seven stages of grief with AI a couple of times.</p><p>Shock. It can write better than many.</p><p>Denial. It’s not going to affect me.</p><p>Anger. When my first clients started using it instead of paying me to write.</p><p>Guilt. When I started using it myself.</p><p>Depression. Realizing what it’s done to the quality of writing. Experiencing the downside of giving everybody a cheap tool to post whatever they want, without a human edit, everywhere I scroll. Its impact on the environment, people, the economy.</p><p>Acceptance. I have to deal with it; there is no turning back.</p><p>Hope. Some days, like today, I have a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Maybe, between the repetitive phrasing and slightly off tone, maybe, somewhere between the word “groundbreaking” and exhaustive punctuation, there it is: an opportunity for writers to claim back their art.</p><p>To finally separate writing as a <em>tool</em> to create content, from writing, the art, the act itself, the beauty.</p><p>This post is about how to get there.</p><h4>It doesn’t have to be perfect. It has to be real.</h4><p>I’ve always loved writing, and I’ve always been frustrated with the number of typos that get away from me. My brain thinks quickly. I hate re-reading what I’ve written, so it happens. People might think I’m dumb for correcting typos too late or not at all, especially in the days of auto-correct. But I have embraced the typo. It’ll be there, maybe next to a comma that’s in the wrong place, but instead of thinking I’m no skilled writer, I hope you appreciate that I actually did write that. I didn’t tell a machine to. It came out as intended. It lived a little.</p><p>A lot of our linguistic developments originate from typos and that <em>laziness</em> that makes you not want to write certain words: definitly (how do you spell that?) becomes def, to be honest, becomes tbh, going to gonna, because to cuz. Other changes stem from a word not fully saying what it has to say: girl becomes gurl or giiiirl. Meaning on a “if you know you know basis”. That <em>if </em>is what makes us human. That nuance is realness.</p><p>A machine simply knows, or it doesn’t.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Apply fewer filters to your own writing and more to the writing you consume.</p><h4>Format matters.</h4><p>For me, the worst thing about AI writing isn’t the takeover of the em dash, or that everything sounds the same, it’s that so much is written that really shouldn’t be. Why write about your rebrand when you can show me? Why tell me about your course when you could just give me a snippet of your teaching?</p><p>With AI, it’s easier to create content that passes most people’s bar for what’s good enough. And so more content is created. We scroll our way through it. We barely take it in. Most of that content shouldn’t be. Or it could be something else. Just because writing is easy doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this:</strong> Ask yourself (or your boss) does this have to be? And if yes, how does this have to be?</p><h4>Effort is a good thing.</h4><p>Imagine writing would take the effort it used to take: coming up with an idea for what you want to put out there. Thinking of what you want to say. Breaking it down into pieces. Structuring it. Finding the right tone. Drafting it. Editing it. Putting parts of yourself in there. Wondering if that sentence comes across right or if you should use a different word there.</p><p>If this were still the required effort, you might post less. Companies would too: if every piece of content they published still took a few hours to create, sign-off and distribute, they’d think twice before creating it.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Remind yourself that effort is good. Keep a personal bar for quality and don’t let the pressure of <em>easier with AI</em> get to you.</p><p>I try to only write stuff that I think is worth the effort. Why would AI change that?</p><h4>Believe in your voice.</h4><p>Everything AI writes does sound the same. It’s recognizable for most. If you’re a writer, you can easily spot the patterns. If you aren’t, you can still sense them.</p><p>That’s not inherently a bad thing. AI writing follows certain formats and structures because those have been proven to be easy to read, fast to take in, and drive the point home. It’s learned from the best: Hemingway to copywriters, accessibility specialists to lyricists.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*JX65AmZNI55dBeyzO-4v-Q.png"" /><figcaption>Just as I was writing this post, I got this suggestion. Ironic, isn’t it?</figcaption></figure><p>The thing is: writing was never supposed to be the sum of its best parts.</p><p>Writing is meant to be personal.</p><p>That’s why even today, companies invest in tone and voice, trying to find a way to create content that feels like them, that others can recognize. That’s why you like some writers, and can’t get through a page by others.</p><p>What makes reading AI content tiresome is not the mass; it’s the lack of meaning, intention, personality, and yes, also humility.</p><p><strong>How to embrace this</strong>: Turn off Grammarly, auto-correct, and don’t ask ChatGPT to edit your work. Just write. Edit it yourself or ask a friend or colleague. Make a deliberate effort not to let AI touch your output and (re)learn how <em>you</em> write. And remind yourself: it’s OK to be unsure and say (write) that.</p><h4>Exit the machine and consume.</h4><p>Even before AI, I would seek inspiration in the analog. I‘d read poetry, write some of my own, pen on paper. I’d read books from various authors about different things, cultures, times: Dostoevsky. Kafka. Didion. Kerouac.</p><p>I almost always go back to my favorite recommendation for any writer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_to_a_Young_Poet"">Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet</a>, a quick (re)read.</p><p>It works with other forms of media and art too: Ingmar Bergman movies, music from past decades, art museums.</p><p>If you have the means to, go beyond media. Travel. Visit museums. Talk to strangers. Learn a new skill. Cook a complicated meal (not something you found on TikTok).</p><p>Turn off your phone. It’s going to feel uncomfortable and wrong. Trust me, it’s right. Especially if you want to create something meaningful.</p><p>The internet may be artificial intelligence’s turf – but that’s all it has.</p><p>We have everything and everywhere else.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/683/1*cpd2ewynUmYbgwahCIphlw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Robin Williams’ character in the Dead Poets Society: “But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive fo.r”</figcaption></figure><h4>AI has made me a greater writer.</h4><p>That’s what it’s done to me.</p><p>Not because it makes my work faster or easier. And not because it suggests different terms or corrects my punctuation. But because it has forced me to create with more intention than ever before. To reconsider each word carefully, to ensure it means what I want it to mean. To think, in every syllable,<em> is this human?</em></p><p>I write slower now than I have in years.</p><p>That’s made me better.</p><p>It’s helped me separate creating content from <em>creating</em>. It’s the distinction that makes all the difference.</p><p>In a world held together by doomscrolling and fake news, stepping away is a privilege. Creating is power.</p><p>Allow yourself.</p><p>Nicole is a Content Designer turned Design Director based in Stockholm, Sweden.

<h4>Using AI in UX design, Interactions, Motion, &amp; Marketing.</h4><figure><img alt=""AI Hat"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJH-70_fdENoXr8UHWpGyQ.jpeg"" /></figure><p>Recently top companies have publicly come out to share their processes implemented by senior designers and entire creative teams. Some notable companies like Meta and Atlassian stood out. Not only are these companies building their own AI workflows, but they are spending millions of dollars to train their employees on them. From watching interviews to reading lengthy articles, here is what I’ve learnt about their carefully crafted AI workflows.</p><h3>Atlassian’s design-to-prototype workflow, powered by AI</h3><figure><img alt=""Atlassian AI workflow"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4fZ32GccUsAaebh-zYfjBg.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The famous software company has to build large scale tools and software for some of the biggest enterprises in the world. AI is the perfect companion for their team to design and test faster.</p><p>In a recent <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">hands-on session</a> with their design team, the wonderful people at Dive Club who interviewed them, shared exactly the methods that work for them. PS. It’s all about the balance here.</p><h4><strong>Using a pre-built template strategy:</strong></h4><p>The Atlassian team realized that AI was often messing up core elements and not completely understanding complex commands. So they created a sort of “design system” for their AI led prototyping. Here they feed a page with pre-coded elements which AI doesn’t change, but lets the tool work on other elements which are open to interpretation in a way.</p><h4><strong>They built instruction files:</strong></h4><p>Unlike most designers who just ask AI tools to code in a certain programming language or use a certain framework, their team has created certain instruction files to “guide the AI”. This instructions file (essentially a text file) might have a specific instruction to use a design system element, variable or certain token in case the AI encounters a certain type of element.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u6dpoZI88gIqb_QfvirDcg.png"" /><figcaption>Their template file in Figma — These are written instruction for the AI to follow</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=""https://youtu.be/CqMZTg7L-wE?si=Nue1uhN51uMVgBJ3"">the interview</a>, their team discusses using tailwind (a CSS framework), but writing specific instructions to <em>only use their own design components</em> in certain areas. This is essentially an <strong>over-ride instruction</strong>, where the AI skips certain actions in order to fulfill their prompts.</p><h4>Recipes over hard work:</h4><p>A complex business like Atlassian requires simplified workflows to make life easier.

<h4>What it really takes to build a product inside ChatGPT while the ecosystem is still forming (and without an engineering team)</h4><figure><img alt=""Illustration of a hand pressing the ChatGPT logo, surrounded by abstract shapes, nodes, and connecting lines on a blue background, suggesting interaction within a networked system."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0B3_mRr5_B3ZZYMtsXm6RA.png"" /></figure><h3>Building in a space that doesn’t exist yet</h3><p>A ChatGPT app isn’t an app in the way we’ve learned to think about software.</p><p>It doesn’t ship with a standalone interface or a familiar navigation model. It lives inside a conversational surface, where <a href=""https://blog.uxtweak.com/conversational-ux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">language, intent, and orchestration shape how a product is experienced</a> just as much as UI does. Still, companies are moving quickly to integrate, sensing that showing up inside these systems will soon be table stakes for discovery.</p><p>The moment feels familiar. In the early 2010s, <a href=""https://resources.latana.com/post/mobile-first-brands-level-up/"">teams rushed to become mobile-first</a> before fully understanding what mobile would demand of product, design, or infrastructure. Large language models are triggering a similar shift — except this time the interface is conversational, the distribution layer is centralized, and many of the constraints are still undefined.</p><p>Participating in this new layer requires more than exposing an API. Products need a way to express what they do, how they should be used, and under which conditions they should be invoked. <a href=""https://getsquid.ai/blog/what-are-mcps"">MCP</a>s are one emerging attempt to make products legible to language models, though the standard itself is still taking shape.</p><figure><img alt=""Modal titled “New Connector (Beta)” with fields for name, description, MCP server URL, authentication type set to OAuth, and a warning indicating the connector is not verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vuiQNBn2oJH3kx0Ndm_1Rg.png"" /><figcaption>Adding connectors in ChatGPT developer mode. Full breakdown of steps <a href=""https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode"">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>What stands out most is how early this ecosystem feels.</p><p>Tools are appearing faster than shared mental models. Founders are building in parallel toward very different interpretations of what a “ChatGPT integration” actually is. For non-technical builders — designers, product thinkers, operators — the promise of access exists alongside real uncertainty about control, responsibility, and realism.</p><p>This article is a set of field notes from trying to build a ChatGPT app early, without a technical background, while the space itself is still in flux.</p><h3>A platform shift that pulled me in</h3><p>I started paying attention to this space out of curiosity more than mandate.</p><p><a href=""https://openai.com/index/developers-can-now-submit-apps-to-chatgpt/"">When OpenAI released the ChatGPT app ecosystem</a> to direct submissions in Dec 2025, it felt like the opening of a new product surface — one that would quietly reshape how discovery works and how products are understood. Conversational interfaces were no longer just answering questions; they were influencing what users saw, compared, and acted on.</p><figure><img alt=""ChatGPT “Apps (Beta)” directory screen showing a featured “Create with Canva” card, category tabs, and a list of integrated apps such as Adobe Photoshop, Airtable, and Booking.com."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*97ppIXhA8gP73ShHZ0l6qA.png"" /><figcaption>ChatGTP’s Apps directory as of Dec 2025</figcaption></figure><p>It was obvious that <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants?utm_source=chatgpt.com"">surfacing inside ChatGPT would matter, and quickly</a>. Not as a simple presence, but as a product that could be interpreted, ranked, and differentiated within a conversational flow.</p><p>I wanted to understand what that actually meant in practice.</p><p>Rather than speculating from the outside, I started exploring the space by trying to build something concrete: a prototype that behaved like a real app inside ChatGPT, constrained by its strict UX &amp; UI guidelines, its invocation patterns, and its rules.</p><figure><img alt=""Flow mapping document titled “Product selection &amp; handoff,” showing a multi-row UX analysis with labeled sections, notes, and a large embedded property listing interface on the right."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NmpIfEnyO5qXNr0ppEOuGg.png"" /><figcaption>My initial research led my to observe &amp; analyze flows and patterns of behavior around the very first ChatGTP partner apps (here Zillow)</figcaption></figure><p>That exploration pulled me into an ecosystem I didn’t fully understand yet, but one that felt important to experience from the inside.</p><h3>The constraint: moving fast without being technical</h3><p>I approached this as a product designer — someone whose value comes from shaping behavior and orchestrating systems, not writing production code. That constraint became clarifying: it forced me to focus on the product questions that actually mattered. At the start, my mental model was incomplete: I didn’t yet understand where code actually lived, how APIs differed from MCPs, or how invocation worked once a product entered a conversational system.</p><p>What I did have was urgency, and a strong drive to understand the space.</p><p>Waiting for engineering availability wasn’t realistic. No-code tools became leverage — a way to maintain velocity while the ecosystem was still forming.</p><p>I expected the process to be relatively fluid. That these tools would absorb complexity and make experimentation easier.</p><p>Instead, I encountered a fast-growing ecosystem full of ambition, pressure, and partial solutions. Many platforms promised to bridge the gap between non-technical builders and ChatGPT integration. Very few actually reduced the friction involved.</p><h3>Entering the frontier: a fragmented ecosystem</h3><p>My exploration started with a straightforward question: which tools could realistically help me export an MCP and demo a functioning ChatGPT app?</p><p>I did my due diligences and experimented first with general no-code and AI-assisted platforms like <a href=""https://cursor.com/agents"">Cursor</a> and <a href=""https://lovable.dev/"">Lovable</a> in order to get a reference.</p><p>Cursor, while powerful, assumed familiarity with local development environments, file systems, and publishing semantics that weren’t obvious without a development background. “No-code” didn’t remove complexity — it required architectural intuition most designers simply do not have. The recent emergence of various <a href=""https://adplist.notion.site/cursor-for-designers"">courses</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faezjTHA5SU"">tutorials </a>explicitly aimed at making Cursor more approachable to designers reinforces that this gap is structural, not personal.</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot from a marketing video displaying a Cursor interface, with a design inspector panel open on the right showing component properties, and an embed chat UI panel on the left."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4j2r_Pa-lBy5prbKnf0q_g.png"" /><figcaption>Cursor introduces their <a href=""https://cursor.com/blog/browser-visual-editor"">visual editor</a> end of 2025 in an attempt to make its software more accessible to non-coders</figcaption></figure><p>Lovable, as I had rightfully assumed, assisted in creating beautiful and realistic enough visuals when carefully prompted but never could extend beyond the role of ingenious prototype.</p><p>I then quickly moved on to exploring several early platforms attempting to solve this problem specifically, including <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a>, <a href=""https://fractalmcp.com/"">Fractal</a>, <a href=""https://noodleseed.com/"">NoodleSeed</a> and <a href=""https://manifest.build/"">Manifest</a>.</p><figure><img alt=""Four landing pages arranged in a grid, each promoting tools for building or deploying apps inside ChatGPT, with headings, call-to-action buttons, and product interface previews."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*TeDhUZwtkXCTyugG8cQgMw.png"" /></figure><p>In conversations with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmatthews-pm/"">Colin Matthews</a>, founder of <a href=""https://chippy.build/"">Chippy</a> and instructor at <a href=""https://maven.com/tech-for-product/ai-prototyping-for-product-managers"">Maven</a>, he described the value as enabling teams to “export code, view sharable specs, and run evals directly within the platform to facilitate cross-functional handoffs.” That made sense for what I was trying to do — bridging design intent and implementation without owning production code.</p><p>Each of these emerging tool approached the problem differently. Some were strong on prototyping but struggled when pushed toward something deployable. Others required a level of technical investment that conflicted with my constraints. A few were promising but blocked by access limitations, incomplete products, or early-stage instability.</p><p>Nearly everything I tried was in beta.</p><p>Platforms were buggy. Context was frequently lost. Documentation was thin. Many tools assumed users already knew how to prompt effectively, how to reason about conversational flows, or how to debug hallucinations when things broke.</p><p>Alongside the tooling, I spent time talking directly with founders building in this space. Those conversations became just as informative as the products themselves.</p><p>Even when tools looked similar on the surface, the underlying visions were very different. Builders had conflicting ideas on who the primary user was, what MCPs should represent, and whether this layer was fundamentally about infrastructure, product creation, or distribution.</p><p>You could feel that divergence in how each platform behaved.</p><h3>Where things broke</h3><p>As I kept experimenting, patterns began to repeat.</p><p>Hallucinations showed up in different forms — including code that looked convincing but simply didn’t hold up. Some abstractions accelerated early progress, only to break under real constraints. Context loss meant restating intent again and again.</p><p>In several cases, MCPs appeared to work inside builder environments but failed to surface at all inside ChatGPT. In others, the system repeatedly reported success — changes “applied,” actions “completed” — while nothing had actually changed. Debugging became conversational: repeatedly prompting the system to self-diagnose. When that failed, progress depended on reaching out directly to founders to investigate issues that weren’t visible from the surface.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing an error message while creating a custom connector on the left, and a ChatGPT conversation on the right explaining that live event data cannot be verified."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tKa5E30Fiwa0arbzoYTF2w.png"" /><figcaption>Left: MCP fails to connect altogether despite numerous attempts at self-diagnosis | Right: Although app is connected it fails to respond when invoked</figcaption></figure><p>These issues aren’t unique to any one tool. They’re <a href=""https://openai.com/index/why-language-models-hallucinate/"">well documented</a> across current LLM platforms and early-stage developer tooling, particularly when systems rely heavily on generative output without strong validation layers.</p><p>The harder part was understanding where responsibility sat.</p><p>When behavior deviated from expectations, it wasn’t obvious whether the issue came from the platform, the MCP configuration, or the tool itself. There was very little support for reasoning across those layers.</p><p>I also realized that I had more influence than I initially thought — over ChatGPT-native layout, conversational flow, and follow-up questions — but that influence was rarely surfaced clearly. It lived behind structured inputs and assumptions that were easy to miss if you didn’t already know they existed. That realization forced me to get more deliberate about what I was actually optimizing for.</p><h3>How I learned to choose</h3><p>Facing this level of fragmentation and instability, I needed a way to evaluate what actually mattered.</p><p>I stopped optimizing for comprehensiveness and started optimizing for learning velocity. That shift required being explicit about tradeoffs — what I was willing to sacrifice and what I wasn’t.</p><p>The framework that emerged:</p><p>Speed to behavioral validation over perfect infrastructure — I cared more about seeing how something behaved in ChatGPT than building it “correctly.” Mock data, hardcoded responses, simplified flows — whatever got me to a testable embedded interaction fastest.</p><figure><img alt=""Split screen showing screengrab from various softwares.

I’d rather ship one well-orchestrated flow than ten that worked but felt bolted on.</p><p>Debuggability over abstraction elegance — When something broke, I needed to understand why. Tools that hid complexity behind beautiful abstractions became liabilities. I favored visibility, even if it meant more manual work.</p><p>This hierarchy shaped everything: which tools I abandoned, which compromises I accepted, and how I structured the interaction model itself.</p><h3>Patterns that emerged across tools and conversations</h3><p>Looking across tools and conversations, a few themes stood out.</p><p>Guidance was mostly under-designed. Many platforms offered powerful capabilities but assumed a level of prompt literacy and architectural intuition that designers don’t naturally start with — and that the tools themselves didn’t teach.</p><p>“No-code” didn’t remove the need for systems thinking. It redistributed it. I found myself reasoning about flows, tool invocation, compliance, system architecture and boundaries, even without writing production code.</p><figure><img alt=""Dashboard-style interface showing six configuration panels labeled Attachments, Connectors, Filters, Model management, Modes, and Parameters, each describing options for controlling data sources, model selection, interaction modes, and prompt settings."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tqfV5fo1MGgNWpJ9KDLfdg.png"" /><figcaption>Tuners, as described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmiecampbell/"">Emily Campbell</a> in the <a href=""https://www.shapeof.ai/"">Shape of AI</a></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest source of friction was translation. Enterprise assets — APIs, design systems, UI kits, brand and photography guidelines — aren’t LLM-ready by default. Converting them into something that could be safely and predictably invoked required manual judgment at nearly every step.</p><p>ChatGPT<a href=""https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/ui-guidelines/""> UI guidelines</a> added another layer of ambiguity. It wasn’t always clear what was disallowed, what was risky, and what simply needed adaptation. Validating those decisions ahead of review remained difficult, even when an app appeared to work. That ambiguity isn’t accidental — it reflects a space where standards, responsibilities, and even product definitions are still being negotiated.</p><figure><img alt=""Slide showing a question about implementing brand colors in ChatGPT UI, alongside two panels outlining a “Brand Colors — Implementation Plan,” with color tokens, SDK-compliant areas, gray areas, and sections marked “keep as-is.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LM8ZeYvQmVFZ_3zSyWOlWg.png"" /><figcaption>Screenshot from Chippy illustrating ambiguity in ChatGPT UI compliance due to unclear SDK guidance.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it became obvious that the space hasn’t converged yet. Founders are building toward different futures, and that lack of alignment shows up directly in the products.</p><h3>What the workflow revealed</h3><p>Over time, I stopped expecting the tools to define the experience for me.</p><p>Progress came from taking ownership of the interaction model: deciding which results to surface, how they should appear, and what kind of conversational path felt intentional rather than reactive. I worked with mock data instead of real APIs to focus on behavior before scale.</p><p>Visual control required additional effort. UI components &amp; the data they should contain were thought through and designed separately, exported as structured assets, and reintroduced into the platforms to better align with each product’s unique requirements.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of two content cards, one showing restaurant listings with images, ratings, addresses, and selectable reservation times, and the other showing hotel listings with photos, review scores, amenities icons, pricing per stay, and “View on Booking.com” buttons."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9SgFgdIcq_QK1bwFx6iDEw.png"" /><figcaption>Left: ChatGTP’s inline carousel widget template | Right: Booking.com’s interpretation</figcaption></figure><p>Testing always happened inside ChatGPT itself. Differences between builder environments and real platform behavior were common, and those gaps often surfaced the most insight.</p><p>What this workflow ultimately revealed was less about process and more about role. Building in this space required judgment across design, systems, and platform interpretation. The work sat somewhere between product design and infrastructure awareness, even without owning production code.</p><h3>What this shift changes about who gets to build</h3><p>This experience clarified something: the line between “product” and “technical” work is dissolving.</p><p>In an informal conversation I had with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noamsegal/"">Noam Segal</a> — AI Insights Lead at Figma — he framed it simply: “designers in this space have to agree to tinker, fail often, and share those failures in order to learn.” Even without owning production code, I had to understand how tools connect, how data flows, and how decisions propagate through an LLM-driven product. These aren’t optional skills for designers working in AI — they’re foundational.</p><p>Prompting felt less like creative expression and more like intent specification. Over time, it became clear that this skill will likely be absorbed into tooling rather than remain a standalone practice.</p><p>For designers, this shift is significant. The work moves away from static artifacts and toward shaping behavior in uncertain systems. Comfort with experimentation, ambiguity, and failure matters more than deep mastery of any single tool.</p><p>Finally, product leadership too, is shifting. Outcomes matter more than mechanics. Adaptability matters more than precedent. And direct visibility into how products behave in the world matters more than perfectly polished specs.</p><h3>Open questions and forward-looking bets</h3><p>This exploration surfaced more questions than it resolved — and that feels appropriate for a space still taking shape.</p><ul><li>Where does responsibility sit when hallucinations slip through?</li><li>How much control will non-technical builders retain as governance tightens?</li><li>How do teams meaningfully validate products when preview environments remain incomplete?</li></ul><p>At the same time, a few patterns feel durable enough to bet on:</p><p>The translation layer will become its own discipline. Converting enterprise systems into LLM-legible interfaces isn’t a one-time technical task — it’s an ongoing design problem that requires new kinds of judgment.</p><figure><img alt=""Composite interface showing Slack-style messages, an audio digest player titled “Q4 projects — Weekly Insights,” and a “Configure digest” panel with fields for title and destination channels."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*m0v180qrT0PFk_rGKVWKZw.png"" /><figcaption>Rather than replacing existing tools, AI products are increasingly embedded within them — shifting the design challenge toward translation and orchestration, from Design Patterns For AI Interfaces course, by <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/vitaly-friedman/"">Vitaly Friedman</a></figcaption></figure><p>Conversational coherence will matter more than feature count.

<h4><em>It’s not about adding AI, it’s about solving problems better than before.</em></h4><p>Lately, I've seen a shift in the market… one that gives me hope for the future. Instead of asking, <em>&quot;How can we put AI into our product?&quot;</em> the new question to ask is, <em>&quot;How might we solve customer problems with AI?&quot;</em></p><figure><img alt=""Two sales people from the sketch comedy show, Portlandia, with the phrase, &quot;Put a bird on it.&quot;"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5uSmq93bQqBjA9TpYR-Tpw.jpeg"" /><figcaption>Put a bird on it — Portlandia, Source <a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/put-bird-on-xugExlK"">imgur</a></figcaption></figure><p>This seemingly subtle difference represents a massive mindset shift because one question is driven by hype, and the other is driven by value.</p><p>The first question, “How can we add AI?” is <em>trend-chasing</em>. It puts technology before purpose, and often leads to bloated features no one asked for, wasted development time, money, and opportunity cost of building something desired and innovative instead.</p><p>The second, “How can we solve a real problem better with AI?” is <em>value creation</em>. It puts the customer at the center and treats AI as a tool, not a trophy.</p><p>That’s the shift we’re seeing. And it’s the difference between shipping gimmicks and building enduring solutions.</p><h3>Put some AI in it!</h3><p>Since the start of the AI revolution, we've been doing research with both Big Tech and smaller AI-based startups to help them understand their customers and their response to AI-based products and services.</p><p>The initial request was simply to, &quot;Put some AI into the product.&quot; It makes sense: it's a new, emerging technology and it's important to stay competitive…</p><p>What it looked like in real life was a different story: It became more of a race to integrate a chatbot into the product than a process of determining whether a chatbot is really the solution to a problem.</p><p>I mean, unless the business problem is have a chatbot because my competitors also have a chatbot.</p><p>If you remember the sketch comedy show, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlandia""><em>Portlandia</em></a>, then you might recall the sketch, &quot;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw"">Put a bird on it</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the sketch, two well-meaning artists try to help struggling businesses by literally adding birds to random products:</p><blockquote>&quot;Look at this sad little tote bag… I know, I'll put a bird on it!&quot; easily becomes, &quot;Look at this sad Pre-GenAI product… I know, I'll put some AI on it!&quot;</blockquote><p>It’s funny because it’s true. And it’s tragic because it’s happening.</p><p>That sketch nails the problem with trend-first thinking: it’s surface-level. Aesthetic over substance. AI becomes a sticker, not a solution. When you chase a trend, you decorate. When you pursue end-user value, you solve.</p><p>And solving is where the real growth is.</p><p>(Continue watching as it devolves hysterically at your own risk).</p><a href=""https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href"">https://medium.com/media/6b7299b7cee614d163f78c79d427538f/href</a><h4>You aren't asking the right question</h4><p>Having spent my career helping companies uncover deep customer pain points and design real solutions, this wave of “just add a chatbot” feels like watching innovation on autopilot.</p><p>It wasn’t strategic. It wasn’t solving for anything. It was tech for tech’s sake fueled by FOMO (Fear of missing out). The real question that drives long-term growth is this:</p><blockquote>“Are we solving our customer’s most urgent problem better than anyone else?”</blockquote><h4>AI is a means to an end</h4><p>Simply adding AI is like when the internet exploded in the mid-90s saying that we needed to add some HTML into our product. Or, to have a website. But a website to do what? To solve what problem?</p><p>AI can help answer that question. But it doesn’t replace the question itself. AI is a means to an end, not the end in itself. And to be clear: the end goal is happy customers that purchase your product or service.</p><p>This is where the mindset shift comes in: It's not about <em>adding AI </em>as much as it's about <em>solving customer problems.</em></p><h3>The mindset shift</h3><p>&quot;I have a new tool in my toolbox. It's called AI. Or Agentic AI. Or an LLM.&quot;</p><p>Ok, cool, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>The real shift is this: instead of jamming AI into an already bloated product roadmap, teams are starting to ask a smarter question:</p><blockquote>“Where can this tool help us solve a customer problem in a better way than we could before?”</blockquote><p>This may sound obvious, but the implications are transformative.</p><p>The best companies aren’t leading with the tool. They’re leading with the outcome. AI is a means, not the mission. A lever, not the solution itself.</p><p>Think of it this way: You used to have a hammer, maybe it was a really good hammer, but it was really good at nails. Now you also have a screwdriver. It's flashy and helps you solve new problems because not every problem is a nail.</p><figure><img alt=""Quote from Star Wars: &quot;These aren't the droids you're looking for.&quot; Obi-Wan Kenobi."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*wYrXWxbixlOW_G__CcIiig.png"" /><figcaption>Obi-wan from Star Wars (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_aren%27t_the_droids_you%27re_looking_for"">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>The shift isn’t just about what tools are available, it’s about what problem you’re solving and what’s now possible because of this new AI toolset.</p><p>The leading Tech companies understand this shift because it comes from a place of power. By reframing the problem and the approach, you're able to stop playing catch-up and start leading the market with your new, innovative approach.</p><p>Leveraging AI for what it does best allows product development teams to focus on what they do best: designing and developing solutions, now with more options on how to solve problems.</p><h3>Taking action</h3><p>If you’re building with AI, here’s your first step: pause and reframe the question.</p><p>Don’t start with, “Where can I use AI?” Instead, start with:</p><blockquote><strong>“What is the biggest, most urgent, and most underserved problem our customers face? And what is now uniquely possible because of AI?”</strong></blockquote><p>To help you shift into this problem-first mindset, try this simple diagnostic:</p><ul><li>What’s the #1 frustration your customers keep bringing up?</li><li>What do they wish they could do but currently can’t?</li><li>If you could wave a magic wand, what would you remove, automate, or radically improve?</li></ul><p>Now ask yourself: does AI give us a new advantage to solve that?</p><p>If the answer is Yes: Great! Keep going and build with intentionality.</p><p>If not: don’t force a square peg into a round hole. This isn't the screw your AI-screwdriver is looking for.</p><h4><strong>Now it's your turn</strong></h4><p>Putting the <em>most </em>AI into your product isn’t a winning strategy. Instead, it’s being <em>intentional</em> and <em>selective</em> about when, where, and why you chose to incorporate AI into your product.</p><p>This is your opportunity to lead the shift inside your team, your company, your product. Solve real problems by being the one who helps your team make the mindset shift and asks the better question.</p><p>That’s how meaningful innovation and growth happens.

<h4>An accessibility-focused evolution of Inter that blends modern geometry with hyperlegible design principles.</h4><figure><img alt=""Cover image showing the name “Hyperlegible Sans” on a dark background, with supporting text describing it as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter’s modern aesthetic, including version number 1.0, open-source license, and available weights (regular, medium, bold)."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cYZPrBJzp61844wdgTnRSg.png"" /><figcaption>Hyperlegible Sans, a free, open-source typeface designed as an accessibility-focused evolution of Inter. Version 1.0 includes Regular, Medium, and Bold weights.</figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans/releases/latest""><strong>Download Latest Font</strong></a></p><p>I’ve used <a href=""https://rsms.me/inter/"">Inter</a> for years. It’s been my default across dozens of projects and, in my opinion, represents the best of open-source typography. Its clean geometry, strong engineering, and consistent rhythm have made it a staple of modern design systems. Over time, especially while working on accessibility-focused products, I began noticing small limitations. Certain glyphs blurred together at smaller sizes, some bowls felt tight in low-vision contexts, and characters like I, l, and 1 weren’t distinct enough for readers who rely on extra clarity. None of this diminished my respect for Inter, it simply highlighted areas where accessibility could be improved.</p><p>Because of these legibility challenges, when I started doing product work for <a href=""https://loudandclear.io/""><em>Loud + Clear</em></a>, an app designed for people with Parkinson’s, I turned to <a href=""https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/"">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>. It’s one of the most thoughtfully designed accessibility fonts available, with radically open forms and unmistakable glyph shapes that prioritize clarity. For low-vision users, it excels.</p><p>But I missed Inter’s visual aesthetic, its modern geometry, contemporary rhythm, and the familiarity designers expect in UI typography. I admired Atkinson’s readability and Inter’s overall look, and kept wishing there were a way to bring the strengths of both into a single design.</p><p><strong>Hyperlegible Sans</strong> is the result. It’s an open-source fork of Inter that preserves its modern character while incorporating hyperlegible principles inspired by Atkinson. It isn’t meant to replace either font, just to offer another option, one that didn’t exist before.</p><p>What I changed (and why)</p><p>The philosophy behind Hyperlegible Sans is simple: keep the visual identity of Inter intact, but reduce ambiguity wherever it appears. That meant making targeted, deliberate adjustments rather than redrawing the font from scratch.</p><p>Here are the most impactful changes:</p><figure><img alt=""Comparison image showing Inter on the left and Hyperlegible Sans on the right, with highlighted letters demonstrating clearer apertures, improved differentiation between I, l, and 1, a wider capital O, and a slashed zero in Hyperlegible Sans."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZLD_DI4KANEeF9uaOSqhmQ.png"" /><figcaption>Side-by-side comparison of Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, highlighting changes to ambiguous glyphs, including a, e, I, O, and 0, to improve character differentiation and legibility.</figcaption></figure><h4>Capital I</h4><p>I added subtle top and bottom bars. This keeps it visually aligned with Inter’s geometry while removing its similarity to lowercase l and numeral 1. Low-vision readers rely on disambiguation, and this single change dramatically improves clarity without altering the overall feel.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the capital letter I, with Inter on the left as a plain vertical stroke and Hyperlegible Sans on the right with added top and bottom bars to increase clarity and differentiation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*13DkDS1Lg5mmu5y9oR_qlg@2x.png"" /><figcaption>Capital I comparison demonstrating the addition of subtle top and bottom bars in Hyperlegible Sans to improve distinction from lowercase l and numeral 1.</figcaption></figure><h4>Lowercase l</h4><p>I added a small baseline spur. This makes it unmistakable as a lowercase letter and prevents confusion with 1. It also provides more visual stability inside dense UI strings.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the lowercase letter l, with Inter on the left as a simple vertical stroke and Hyperlegible Sans on the right featuring a small baseline spur for clearer identification."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Hf9uflQ_kG2hmDbAonbjRg.png"" /><figcaption>Lowercase l comparison showing the addition of a small baseline spur in Hyperlegible Sans to reduce confusion with the numeral 1.</figcaption></figure><h4>Zero</h4><p>I added a slash. A slashed zero is simply more readable for everyone. It avoids the O/0 problem entirely, especially in interfaces that rely heavily on numeric input or one-time codes.</p><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side comparison of the numeral zero, with Inter on the left showing an unmarked zero and Hyperlegible Sans on the right showing a slashed zero for improved character differentiation."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Fz6HgU8NOM5ggOOjt0usBg@2x.png"" /><figcaption>Zero comparison illustrating the addition of a slashed zero in Hyperlegible Sans to clearly distinguish it from the letter O.</figcaption></figure><h4>Capital O</h4><p>I widened it slightly.

Crowding can become a barrier. Certain letter combinations can merge when users read with low acuity.</p><p>I added additional kerning space to pairs that commonly collapse:</p><ul><li>rn, ri, rl</li><li>fi, fl, ft, tt</li><li>ii, ll, il, li</li><li>la</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Side-by-side image comparing Inter and Hyperlegible Sans kerning for letter pairs such as rn, ri, rl, fi, fl, ft, tt, ii, ll, il, li, and la, with Hyperlegible Sans showing increased spacing to improve clarity and prevent visual merging."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9SjhTB_ThOhCqilQGem5jQ.png"" /><figcaption>Comparison of kerning-sensitive letter pairs in Inter and Hyperlegible Sans, showing increased spacing for combinations that commonly collapse in low-vision or dense UI text.</figcaption></figure><p>These are small changes, but small changes can have large effects. Hyperlegibility is often achieved through a series of minor adjustments that build up to meaningful improvements in clarity.</p><h3>The design belief behind this project</h3><p>Accessibility shouldn’t require compromising aesthetics.</p><p>A font shouldn’t look “special” or “different” to be inclusive. Good typography should simply work for everyone.</p><p>Hyperlegible Sans reflects a belief I carry into every project: <strong>design can be both beautiful and accessible</strong>.</p><p>We don’t need to choose between modern geometry and clear letterforms. We can have both.</p><p>Design is full of these false choices, and part of the work is expanding the range of tools available so designers can choose what best fits their intentions.</p><h3>What’s next for Hyperlegible Sans</h3><p>This is only version 1. The roadmap includes:</p><ul><li>additional weights</li><li>a full variable font</li><li>expanded punctuation</li><li>broader language support</li><li>refinements for dark mode and low-contrast environments</li></ul><p>And like Inter, this project is open-source. I’m uploading the complete files to GitHub, along with documentation on the changes and a roadmap for future versions.</p><p>My hope is simple: that this font becomes another tool in the accessibility toolkit. Something UI designers, developers, and product teams can reach for when they need both clarity and beauty, when they want typography that reflects how modern design should work.</p><p>Not less beautiful. Not more clinical. Just clearer, easier, more humane.</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/matthewlarn/hyperlegible-sans""><strong>View “Hyperlegible Sans” on Github</strong></a></p><figure><img alt=""Text layout titled “Why Legibility Matters,” explaining how clear letterforms and spacing improve readability, reduce cognitive effort, and support comfortable reading in conditions such as small sizes, low contrast, or motion."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A0mM6d5g12cE1BdBg-qr7A.png"" /><figcaption>Legibility-focused text sample demonstrating how clearer letterforms, consistent spacing, and strong character differentiation reduce cognitive load and improve reading comfort.</figcaption></figure><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7b3c823692fb"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/hyperlegible-sans-a-free-open-source-font-for-accessible-design-7b3c823692fb"">Hyperlegible Sans: a free, open-source font for accessible design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"
