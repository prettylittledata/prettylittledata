There are many existing web features and technologies in the wild that you may never touch directly in your day-to-day work. Perhaps you’re fairly new to web development and are simply unaware of them because you’re steeped in the abstraction of a specific framework that doesn’t require you to know it deeply, or even at all. Bryan Rasmussen looks specifically at XPath and demonstrates how it can be used alongside CSS to query elements."

Perhaps, just like me, you’ve searched the internet for different sources about the Gestalt principles and found that there are many, each slightly different from the others. That’s why I decided to bring several of them together, analyze and group them, and highlight the fundamental ones, the core laws that we, as designers, can confidently rely on when creating our work.</p><p>But let’s start from the beginning, where these principles came from, and why they are, in fact, more of a science than just an observation.</p><h3>The History of Gestalt Principles</h3><p>Gestalt psychology emerged in Germany at the very beginning of the 20th century as a response to the then-dominant, and in fact the first, school of psychology — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)"">Structuralism</a>. Structuralism viewed consciousness as something that could be deconstructed into individual elements: sensations, images, and feelings; to understand how the mind is built from its smallest parts.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with glasses, a full beard, and a serious expression, wearing a suit and white collar."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/274/0*StoYieZSdCa2uo0p.jpg"" /><figcaption>Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927) is founder of Structuralism — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_B._Titchener#/media/File:Edward_B._Titchener.jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology"">Gestalt psychology</a>, on the other hand, saw perception as an inherently holistic process: our consciousness emerges from the organization of those parts into meaningful wholes, but unlike structuralism, it does not attempt to view perception as the sum of its parts.</p><p>Where structuralism tried to analyze the structure of experience, Gestalt focused on the patterns that give experience its unity and sense.</p><p>The Gestalt principles we use in design today were first studied in their earliest form by Gestalt psychology founders <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer"">Max Wertheimer</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_K%C3%B6hler"">Wolfgang Köhler</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Koffka"">Kurt Koffka</a>. They explored and expanded upon each other’s work on how the human brain perceives visual images not as a collection of separate elements, but as unified, structured wholes. That’s where the term “Gestalt” comes from — the German word for “form” or “structure.”</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white portrait of a man with a beard and receding hairline, wearing a dark coat and posing with arms crossed against a dark background."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/256/0*-7bNwJ1VdkNU9UIm.jpg"" /><figcaption>Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer#/media/File:Max_Werheimer_(1880-1943).jpg"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>The main idea was that the mind automatically organizes sensory information into meaningful forms, even when parts of the data are missing or distorted. Because of the growing popularity of psychology in the early days of marketing, these principles quickly became the foundation for understanding composition, object grouping, and visual hierarchy, concepts we still actively apply in interface design today.</p><p>Over the past hundred years, countless interpretations and variations of these laws and principles have been written and discussed. Originally, Max Wertheimer identified only nine principles, which he didn’t even call <em>“principles”</em> at the time. He referred to them as <em>“factors”</em> that determine how humans perceive groups of objects. It was only later that these factors were reformulated and became known as the Gestalt principles.</p><h3><strong>Why Gestalt is more than just observation</strong></h3><p>What made Gestalt psychology truly revolutionary was that it proved its claims through controlled experiments, not just philosophical speculation or introspection.</p><p>Max Wertheimer’s study of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon"">phi phenomenon</a> was among the first to show that the mind can perceive movement where none exists: two still images flashing in sequence were seen as continuous motion. This finding demonstrated that perception is an active process of construction, not passive reception. And it is this principle that underlies animation and cinema, as well as, the transitions we create in design.</p><figure><img alt=""A sequence of twelve black-and-white photographs showing a horse and rider in motion, illustrating the phases of a gallop, with grid lines and the title “The Horse in Motion” by Eadweard Muybridge."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*70V1TnUbPL5pk-D1.jpg"" /><figcaption>The Horse in Motion by Eadweard Muybridge — <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=57260211"">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Wolfgang Köhler’s <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">experiments with apes</a> later reinforced this idea. Chimpanzees were placed in situations where food was visible but out of reach. Instead of relying on random trial and error, they would suddenly grasp how to combine available objects, for example stacking boxes or using a stick to solve the problem. Köhler called this moment of sudden understanding insight.</p><figure><img alt=""Black-and-white photo showing chimpanzees in an enclosure, with one climbing onto boxes and reaching upward toward an object while others look on or raise their arms."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/297/0*0Y1c0R3E0iZWFs0I.JPG"" /><figcaption>Photo from The Mentality of Apes — <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm"">image source</a></figcaption></figure><p>That is precisely what happens in great UX. When an interface is well-designed, users don’t have to memorize steps or instructions; they see how things fit together. Their mental model of the system reorganizes itself into something coherent and intuitive. Good design, like Köhler’s insight, doesn’t teach but reveals.</p><p>Together, these and other first studies gave Gestalt psychology an empirical foundation, transforming it from a set of visual curiosities into one of the earliest scientifically validated theories of perception.</p><h3>Our focus for today</h3><p>For this article, we’ll focus on three modern interpretations of these principles, and original paper of Max Wertheimer, <a href=""https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Wertheimer/Forms/forms.htm""><em>Laws of Organization in Perceptual Forms</em></a>. Our other reference sources for today are:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles""><em>What are the Gestalt Principles?</em></a><strong> </strong>by<strong> Interaction Design Foundation </strong>(12 principles)<strong> </strong>is an excellent and by far the most comprehensive list I’ve come across, complete with clear examples not only through abstract visuals but also real interface designs.

By combining and comparing all four of the sources, I’ve distilled 16 Gestalt principles, which I’ve grouped into three distinct categories. It’s important to note that these are not all existing Gestalt principles interpretations but rather the ones most commonly found and applied within the information-driven UI/UX design context.</p><h3>Basic Gestalt principles of grouping</h3><p>These principles, in one form or another, appear across all four sources — with only minor variations in interpretation.</p><h4><strong>Proximity</strong></h4><p>Elements that are placed close to each other are perceived as related.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UJjgVzM1J_PNh5PESqGlYA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles form a group because they are evenly spaced and positioned close to one another, while three other circles are set apart and do not visually belong to any group.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Two buttons in a modal window appear as one group, whereas a separate button stands visually independent from them. We can use this principle to categorize actions for example, the button on the left might <em>close</em> or <em>cancel</em> the modal, while the grouped buttons on the right could represent <em>Save</em> and <em>Delete</em>. In the first case, the user does not affect the content; in the second, either action directly modifies the information.</p><h4><strong>Similarity</strong></h4><p>Objects that share similar color, shape, or size are perceived as belonging to the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*A9NOIvnyctmytyOMIqp8vg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Four circles filled with a more saturated color stand out from the rest of the elements and are perceived as a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We apply this principle in UI design, for example, with CTAs in most apps or websites, all primary buttons share the same color and size, helping users instantly recognize them as elements of the same functional group.</p><h4><strong>Common fate</strong></h4><p>Elements that move in the same direction or manner are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BvA0wbiXYlDxtFQ3XugkKg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> If we imagine the circles in motion, the two central circles moving together would naturally be perceived as belonging to a single category.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> A simple example of this is animated partner logos that automatically scroll in the same direction.

In this case, we perceive three groups of elements within a dropdown menu because they’re arranged parallel to one another and perpendicular to the main navigation. This layout makes scanning much easier for the user than, for example, displaying one long list or aligning all items parallel to the main navigation, as often happens in secondary menus.</p><h4><strong>Common Region / Shared Area</strong></h4><p>Elements placed within the same visual container or area are perceived as a single group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9hbTi5l2oLWebGotZjvcoA.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even though all small circles are evenly spaced, we perceive them as two separate groups because they are enclosed within different areas.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> Buttons inside a modal window are perceived as part of the same group, while a navigation button (even if it has the same visual weight and is positioned on the same level) is perceived as belonging to another group, simply because it’s outside that shared visual region.</p><h4><strong>Prägnanz (Simplicity)</strong></h4><p>The brain tends to perceive simple, concise, and stable forms first.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*9m5_JWItTB5yhbkE9G1T6A.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the complex shape created using multiple circles and a glass-like effect, we primarily perceive it as one large circle.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> We structure page content into blocks because it makes scanning easier for the user.

In my example, you can see a schematic of a video streaming page, where we instinctively recognize the main sections: navigation, video, recommendations, and description.</p><h4><strong>Focal point</strong></h4><p>An element that contrasts with its surroundings is the first to capture attention.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uyuSSw1LRepf8xfTLSuYsw.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A white circle stands out against the background of all other circles and becomes the primary focal element.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my example, there are two elements that contrast with the rest of the interface: the button and the hero image.</p><p>Contrast in UI isn’t defined by color alone; it’s important to remember that color itself has three attributes: Hue, Saturation, and Value/Brightness, each of which can influence perception differently.

Almost all modern sources reference the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_vase""><em>Rubin’s Vase</em> </a>optical illusion since Edgar Rubin’s research greatly influenced Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka, who were working on similar visual phenomena at the time.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, however, I decided to use simpler shapes to illustrate how our perception tends to arrange objects spatially. For instance, in a <strong>reversible/unstable</strong> type example, two semi-transparent circles overlap and whichever one you focus on appears to be in the foreground. But when one of the shapes becomes opaque, the perception becomes <strong>stable</strong>, because we can clearly identify which element is in front and which is behind.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In my interface example, you can see list items that share the same background color as the page itself but stand out due to shadows. We often apply this same principle in modal windows, where the background is darkened to visually separate the active layer from the rest of the interface.</p><h4><strong>Connectedness</strong></h4><p>Elements that are visually connected are perceived as part of the same group.</p><figure><img alt=""Abstract and interface diagrams demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gIe7bK8PVsFwLiGyStiSEg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my example, you see sixteen circles and it’s easy to identify eight of them as belonging to the same group because they are physically connected by a line.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong> In design, we often apply this principle in steppers, forms, or as in my example in informational blocks that illustrate the stages of a process or present step-by-step instructions.</p><h3>How it actually works</h3><p>It’s also important to note that each of these principles can and often does work in combination with others. Even the simplest element, like a hyperlink, can serve as an example of a <strong>multimodal Gestalt</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=""Image demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*CYrVDvlzy6LqCit1afzeUg.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>In this example, several principles operate simultaneously, reinforcing one another:</p><ul><li><strong>Connectedness provides structure.</strong> The underline creates a visual link between all letters and elements.

Our gaze naturally flows from left to right, allowing us to read line by line.</li><li>A stable <strong>Figure–ground relationship ensures clear contrast</strong> between text and background, making the content both visible and readable.</li></ul><p>And you’ve probably also seen the classic example of guiding the user’s attention through the text.</p><figure><img alt=""Image demonstrating Gestalt principle."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vAJbUuzoxmSxBqhU2pEcUw.png"" /><figcaption>Example created by Maxim Kich</figcaption></figure><p>Even with a minimal set of tools, we can direct our user’s focus by applying the basic laws of Gestalt: Proximity, Continuity, Focal point and Simplicity.</p><h3>Gestalt psychology of perceptual interpretation</h3><p>You’ll find these three principles only in the Interaction Design Foundation’s list (out of our four main sources). And while they can be incredibly valuable and relevant for us as designers, they’re often left out of other summaries likely because they don’t deal with how we group elements, but rather with how we perceive and interpret entire visual compositions.</p><p>I’d also like to note that these principles partially overlap with some of the ones we’ve already discussed.

We often encounter this principle in typography: no matter which typeface we choose, we can usually still read and understand the characters, unless the font becomes extremely stylized or abstract.</p><h3>The archaic roots of Gestalt principles</h3><h4><strong>Familiarity / Past Experience</strong></h4><p>The brain groups or interprets elements because it remembers the context in which they were previously encountered.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that even Max Wertheimer mentioned this principle in a special context, emphasizing that it’s not a primary law of organization, but rather a secondary factor that <em>can </em>influence perception.</p><blockquote>In some cases, past experience or familiarity may influence the perception of organization, but the primary laws of grouping remain independent of experience.</blockquote><blockquote>— Wertheimer, 1923</blockquote><p>For us as designers, “Familiarity” is not really a law of perception in its simplest interpretation, it aligns more closely with one of Jakob Nielsen’s <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"">heuristic design principles</a>. In more complex frameworks, it becomes part of cognitive psychology, connecting to concepts such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model""><em>Mental model</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance""><em>Affordance</em></a>.</p><h3>Gestalt principles as the grammar of visual design</h3><p>Let’s imagine interface design as a language. If color defines the tone of our message, Gestalt principles define its structure.</p><p>A designer who understands how the human brain groups, aligns, and interprets visual elements doesn’t just make things “look good” but builds meaning. Gestalt is what transforms shapes into hierarchy and flow.</p><p>These principles aren’t theories to debate. They became laws of perception we can rely on with confidence. But there’s always room to explore their interpretations and to experiment with how these principles interact, overlap, and sometimes even contradict one another.</p><p>That’s why I encourage everyone who cares about users and about design as a craft to keep experimenting with the old and exploring the new in the pursuit of creating truly delightful and unique design.</p><img alt="""" height=""1"" src=""https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c34d6772fc36"" width=""1"" /><hr /><p><a href=""https://uxdesign.cc/patterns-your-brain-cant-unsee-gestalt-psychology-in-design-c34d6772fc36"">Patterns your brain can’t unsee: Gestalt psychology in design</a> was originally published in <a href=""https://uxdesign.cc"">UX Collective</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"

<h4>How to get production-ready code from AI by structuring Figma file, connecting your design system with Figma MCP, and writing better prompts.</h4><figure><img alt=""Overview of components like toggle, badges, buttons, data visualisation cards, forms and page header from Ivy Design System"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4ecR3i5SgK488SMg3drtIA.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, overview of Ivy Design System components</figcaption></figure><p>Right, pull up a chair, grab your coffee. We need to talk about the new team member. They’re brilliant, frankly, work all hours and can write boilerplate code in their sleep. They’re also a bit… literal. This new team member is an AI agent, and it’s changing how we go from design to code.</p><p>But here’s the reality check as <a href=""https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2025-ai-report-perspectives/"">Figma’s recent AI report</a> ↗ found that while 68% of developers are using AI to write code, only 32% actually trust the output. The problem isn’t the AI’s ability to write code, it’s the AI’s ability to understand context.</p><p>Now, we could spend a whole other coffee chat talking about how brilliant AI is for spinning up quick interactive prototypes for stakeholders and testing. And, indeed, it’s a valid way to work. But to grow trust in AI to write real, production-ready code, we have to <strong>give it clean data with clear context to work with in the first place.</strong></p><p>So, how does this happen? Until recently, we could only give an AI a screenshot and hope for the best. That’s changing with something called the <a href=""https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro"">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> ↗. Think of the new Figma MCP server as an interpreter for your Figma files that sends rich, structured information to the LLM. The process looks simple: Figma file → Figma MCP → LLM. But for it to work, every step needs to be packed with meaning. <strong>Simply throwing a prompt and a Figma link at an AI agent and hoping for the best is not going to work.</strong></p><h3>Build foundation in Figma</h3><p>The foundation of any good design-to-code workflow, whether for a human or an AI, is a Figma file that clearly communicates its own intent. Every decision you make in how you structure your file can either bring clarity or create confusion.</p><p>First things first, master your <strong>structure hygiene</strong>. An AI reads your layer tree to understand your design’s structure, so a messy tree leads to a messy DOM. Name everything with purpose. Instead of <em>Frame 74</em>, use names that describe what something <em>is</em> or what it <em>does</em>, like <em>CreateProjectModal</em> or <em>ProjectForm</em>. This directly influences the names of the components and elements the AI generates. While you’re at it, try to keep your structure as flat as possible. Avoid deep, unnecessary nesting. If a group isn’t serving a specific layout purpose, get rid of it. A flatter hierarchy is simply easier for everyone to understand.</p><figure><img alt=""A before-and-after comparison of a Figma layers panel, showing a messy structure with generic names like ‘Frame 79’ being replaced by a clean, semantic structure with names like ‘ProjectForm’ and ‘Group-DateRange"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*81rdmmTMHIezX1y46fuLag.png"" /><figcaption>Image by the author, showing the improvement from generic layer structure to a clean, semantically-named one</figcaption></figure><p>Next<strong> think and build components like a developer </strong>defining their API. Your layer order should reflect the visual hierarchy or, for the web, the DOM order. This is a massive help for accessibility and logical code output.</p><ul><li>Use variants for states like <em>State: Default | Hover | Disabled</em>. This maps directly to CSS pseudo-classes or state props.</li><li>Use a boolean property (Icon: True | False) to show or hide an element. It’s cleaner than separate variants and translates perfectly to a prop like <em>showIcon={true}</em>.</li><li><strong>Use the </strong><a href=""https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/35794667554839-What-s-new-from-Schema-2025#h_01K84PB569NTFMXBDS36C8DCPV""><strong>new slots</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗<strong> feature from Figma to define flexible content areas.</strong> This is a massive improvement over simple instance swaps because it directly maps to the concept of “slots” or the children prop in code.</li></ul><p>Let’s be honest, <strong>Auto Layout</strong> should be your default for almost everything. It’s the clearest way to communicate layout intent. Use absolute positioning sparingly, keeping it for specific cases like notification badges or modal overlays. We’ve all seen the mess that older design-to-code tools made by sprinkling <em>position: absolute</em> everywhere.</p><p>Move beyond primitive names like <em>blue-500</em> and embrace <strong>semantic tokens</strong> that describe purpose. For example, <em>color-button-background-brand</em> tells the AI not just what color this is, but <em>why</em> it exists. This tells the AI <em>why</em> this color exists. <strong>For a masterclass on this, check out t</strong><a href=""https://medium.com/design-systems-collective/when-semantic-tokens-are-no-longer-semantic-d65ef16fadd7""><strong>he article series by Nate Baldwin</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗</p><figure><img alt=""An infographic explaining semantic design tokens.

An AI should consume your existing components, not generate new ones. Without a direct link to your codebase, the AI relies on inaccurate searches that result in redundant code. Tools like <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/code-connect-integration/"">Figma’s Code Connect </a>↗ or third-party integrations with Storybook create this essential link, turning your Figma components into pointers to the real components in your repository.</p><figure><img alt=""A screenshot of the Code Connect UI feature linking a Figma component to its corresponding React code.

Image from the <a href=""https://developers.figma.com/docs/code-connect/code-connect-ui-setup/"">official Figma developer documentation</a></figcaption></figure><h4>But what if you don’t have a codebase yet?</h4><p>You can absolutely use these tools without a connected codebase. The AI will analyze your Figma file and generate new code from scratch that is great for quick prototypes or iterating on ideas. However, understand the trade-offs: you get generated code, not system code; it’s less efficient; and it <strong>creates technical debt that a developer will have to refactor later</strong>.</p><p>A practical middle ground is to <strong>use the AI to create a “scaffold.</strong>” Let it generate the initial components, then treat that output as the first version of your design system’s codebase. From there, you refine it, connect it back to Figma, and build a sustainable system.</p><h3>Extra: The ultimate source of truth with components as data</h3><p>The ultimate source of truth is defining components as structured data (JSON), not as Figma drawings. For a deeper dive into this architectural approach, <a href=""https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis/components-as-data-2be178777f21""><strong>Nathan Curtis’ article “Components as Data”</strong></a> ↗ is an essential read. LLMs thrive on structured data, whereas the standard MCP workflow provides an <em>“incomplete and imprecise”</em> interpretation of your visual design. Tools like the <a href=""https://www.anova.design/""><strong>Anova plugin for Figma</strong></a><strong> </strong>↗ can help you get started. This data-first approach is the future of building AI-ready design systems.</p><h3>Give your AI a “cheat sheet”</h3><p>Whether you’re connecting to code or defining components as data, you still need to guide the AI’s behavior. This involves two skills: writing better prompts and creating a set of rules for the AI to follow. On more in-depth</p><h4>Write context-rich prompts</h4><p>Your prompt is your direct instruction. The more specific, the better.</p><ul><li><strong>Instead of:</strong> “Make this a component.”</li><li><strong>Try:</strong> “Generate a React component for the selected frame using our design system library. Place the new file in src/components/ui/ and name it PricingCard.tsx.”</li></ul><p><strong>Split your work into consumable bites</strong>: the nav bar, then the sidebar, then a content card. If you give them too much at once, AI agents can “choke” on the context and create a mess. Build your UI gradually.</p><h4>Set custom rules</h4><p>While one-off prompts are great for specific tasks, the real power comes from creating a permanent “cheat sheet” that the AI can reference every single time.</p><p>In your project root, create a dedicated folder like <em>.docs/</em> or <em>.ai/.</em> Inside, create your three core rules files: <em>README.md</em> file (for foundational rules), <em>design-system-rules.md</em> (for how to use our components), <em>figma-mcp-rules.md</em> (for the specific Figma MCP workflow).</p><figure><img alt=""Screenshot of Cursor IDE with project structure and particularly dedicated folder for AI rules that incudes README.md, design-system-rules.md, figma-mcp-rules.md files.

It defines the core tech stack and file structure, and most importantly, it instructs the AI to use the other two files as part of its context.</p><pre># AI Coding Guidelines: <br />This repo uses Figma MCP. For instructions, for styles, mappings and design of components you MUST read and strictly apply the rules from all three of the following files:<br />1.  This `README.md` file (for foundational rules).<br />2.  `design-system-rules.md` (for how to use our components).<br />3.  `figma-mcp-rules.md` (for the specific Figma-to-code process).---<br />## Core Principles &amp; Best Practices<br />- Expert Persona: Act as an expert senior frontend developer writing clean, accessible, and maintainable TypeScript and React.<br />- Accessibility: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.<br />- Performance: Optimize for performance. Code should have linear time/space complexity where possible.<br />- Testing: Suggest testable code.<br />---<br />## Core Technologies (React &amp; Tailwind)<br />- Framework: React<br />- Language: TypeScript<br />- Styling:Tailwind CSS, configured via `tailwind.config.js`.<br />---<br />## File Structure &amp; Naming Conventions<br />- Components: Place all new components in `src/components/`.<br />  - Reusable UI Primitives:`src/components/ui/` (e.g., Button, Input).<br />  - Feature-Specific Components: `src/components/feature/` (e.g., `UserProfileCard`).<br />- Component Files: Use PascalCase for filenames. Each component must be in its own folder. (e.g., `src/components/ui/Button/Button.tsx`)<br />- Hooks: Custom hooks go in `src/hooks/` and should be named with the `use` prefix (e.g., `useUserData.ts`).</pre><p><strong>design-system-rules.md<br /></strong>This is the detailed guide on how to correctly use your custom components from your-design-system.</p><pre># Design System Usage Rules<br />This document outlines how to correctly implement components and styles from `your-design-system`.<br />---<br />## Component Architecture &amp; Styling<br />- Design System First: Always use existing components from the `your-design-system` package. Do not rebuild them.<br />- Layout Primitives: Always use layout components from `your-design-system` (e.g., ``, ``). Do not use raw `div`s with custom flexbox CSS.<br />- Styling with Tokens: Use Tailwind utility classes that are configured in our `tailwind.config.js`. Prefer our custom theme utilities (e.g., `bg-brand-primary`) over default Tailwind colors.<br />- Icons: Use the `` component from `your-design-system`, passing the appropriate icon name. Do not import raw SVGs.<br />- Props: Component props must be defined with a TypeScript `interface`.<br />---<br />## What to Avoid<br />- No Hardcoded Values: Do not use hardcoded strings (use translation files), URLs (use config files), or styling values (use tokens).<br />- No Inconsistent Naming: Follow the project's naming conventions.<br />- No Ignoring Errors: Do not ignore TypeScript errors.<br />- No Unnecessary DOM: Avoid unnecessary `div` wrappers.</pre><p><strong>figma-mcp-rules.md<br /></strong>This file is a specific, process-oriented set of instructions for the AI to follow whenever it’s translating a design from Figma.</p><pre># Figma to Code Workflow Rules<br />When generating code from a Figma design, follow this specific process:<br />1.  Get Context First: Run `get_design_context` to fetch the structured representation of the Figma node.<br />2.  Get Visual Reference: Run `get_screenshot` for a visual reference.<br />3.  Implement: Only after you have both, begin implementation.<br />4.  Translate the MCP output (React + Tailwind) into our project's conventions, strictly following the rules defined in `README.md` and `design-system-rules.md`.<br />5.

<h4>Turns out, the more feelings in your text, the weirder it feels to let AI touch it.</h4><figure><img alt=""The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where each wooden plank is replaced with a silicon chip"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*MV2D6JbcFgdCKayve-w0rw.png"" /><figcaption>The Ship of Theseus reimagined: a vessel where wooden planks are being replaced with silicon chips. Generated in Sora.</figcaption></figure><p>I use AI writing tools the way most people use spellcheck: casually, constantly, almost without thought. A typo here, a phrasing fix there, a quick “make it flow better.” Over time, it’s become second nature that I write <em>through</em> the machine.</p><p>And that’s not unusual. Grammarly alone reports over <strong>40 million users</strong>, across <strong>50 thousand organizations</strong> and <strong>96 percent of the Fortune 500</strong> (<a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/about"">source: Grammarly.com</a>). The habit has gone mainstream, invisible, automatic, and everywhere.</p><p>But every so often, I pause over a polished paragraph and feel an odd flicker of detachment. The words look like mine, sound like mine, but they’ve passed through <strong>someone else’s hands</strong>. Or circuits. Or whatever metaphor fits. How many edits does it take before the voice that returns isn’t me anymore?</p><p>It’s the Ship of Theseus. Turns out Greek mythology still works in 2025. Swapping planks on a ship is just the new metaphor for rewriting yourself through syntax. Each replaced plank a synonym, each tightened sentence a substitution, until the vessel of thought sails on. The ship, and the writing, are familiar in shape butforeign in soul.</p><p>And this anxiety about “losing your voice” didn’t arrive with ChatGPT. As others have noted, the fear of writing identity slipping away has circulated for years, long before AI became a default tool (see <a href=""https://medium.com/emma-identity/why-loss-of-writing-identity-is-a-myth-and-other-writing-debacles-85fda0b4b046"">Emma Identity’s 2017 essay</a> on textual fingerprints). What’s different now is how automated the erosion feels.</p><h4>A Family-and-Friends Field Test</h4><p>I wanted to understand that uneasy drift between “me” and “machine,” so I ran a small, human-scale test. A handful of volunteers, friends, family, and a few generous redditors who gave five minutes of their lives to a Qualtrics link joined in.</p><figure><img alt=""Flowchart showing participants providing three types of writing (casual text, essay paragraph, code snippet), sending each through an AI tool for ten iterative rewrites, and rating on a 1–7 scale how much the output still felt like “theirs.”"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ut4rB0gbseUm7BDETSYkoQ.png"" /><figcaption>Diagram of the study procedure: participants wrote a casual text, an essay paragraph, and a code snippet, then passed each piece through an AI tool ten times and rated how much the rewritten text still felt like their own. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><p>Each person worked across three familiar modes: a casual text, a short essay paragraph, and a code snippet. They wrote something genuine, then passed it through an AI writer of their choice ten times in a row. After each iteration, they rated it on a 1–7 scale: <strong>“How much is this still mine?”</strong></p><p>The survey itself ran on Qualtrics; I cleaned and visualized the data in R, using a simple mixed-effects model to trace how that sense of ownership decayed over time. Everyone consented, all responses were anonymized, and what’s shown here reflects only the aggregate picture.</p><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*tsdSUozOICLkG9w_oCeT-w.png"" /><figcaption>Perceived ownership steadily declines with each AI rewrite, dropping fastest for texting and slowest for code.</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out, the ownership ratings <strong>fell off a cliff</strong> around the third or fourth rewrite for texting and essay writing, but held surprisingly steady in code. A spline model (R, lme4, three-knot natural spline) showed the steepest drop early on: texting collapsed fastest, essays followed, code barely flinched.</p><p>By the numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Texting:</strong> sharpest drop of –1.4 points around iteration 3.</li><li><strong>Essay:</strong> a slower, smaller decline (–1.25 points near iteration 5).</li><li><strong>Code:</strong> almost no falloff (–0.3 points around iteration 4).</li></ul><p>When asked when their text felt “more AI than me” (below a 4 on the 1–7 scale), people hit that midpoint at <strong>iteration 3 for texting</strong>, <strong>iteration 7 for essays</strong>, and <strong>never</strong> for code.</p><p>This aligns with a broader cultural confusion around what “human-written” even looks like. As <a href=""https://alpace.medium.com/unless-it-was-written-by-ryan-holiday-it-was-probably-written-by-ai-0b7099516d98"">Aaron Pace</a> recently wrote, the more polished a piece of writing is, the more likely AI detectors are to label it “machine-made.” Today we see a strange modern reversal where professionalism now reads as artificial. My data shows the inverse feeling: the messier and more intimate the writing, the more its owner wants to keep machines out.</p><h4>What the Humans Said</h4><p>After the survey, I spoke with a few participants again, some over Zoom, some across a kitchen table. Their reactions lined up quite cleanly with the numbers. <strong>The more personal the writing, the more wrong it felt to let an AI touch it.</strong></p><p>When it came to texting, everyone hesitated. That space is messy and intimate. You’d use lowercase shorthand, inside jokes, typos, emojis that say more than syntax ever could. Watching an AI rewrite that kind of message felt invasive, like handing your phone to someone else mid-conversation.</p><p>Essay writing was easier to surrender. Participants said it felt “professional,” “detached,” something meant to be polished anyway. The AI’s edits felt like a second pair of eyes rather than a replacement of self.</p><p>And code, unless you were a computer science student who lives in it, wasn’t personal at all. In fact, most people said they <em>needed</em> AI to even get started, describing the help as “welcome,” “expected,” or “honestly, a relief.” For them, authorship was more functional than emotional. The machine wasn’t rewriting their voice, it was scaffolding their logic.</p><p>One person linked their experience to the idea of <strong>vibe coding</strong><em>, </em>which, as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/vibe-coding"">an IBM article described</a>, is <em>the emerging practice of writing code by talking to AI using natural language prompts instead of lines of syntax</em>. They acknowledged that software engineers often dismiss it as unserious, even lazy, but for them, it was liberating. As a non–computer science student, they said vibe coding made the process less intimidating and more creative.</p><p>It echoed something <a href=""https://medium.com/contemplate/chatgpt-grammarly-and-hemingway-walked-into-a-bar-de2fa481022f"">Jasmine McCandless</a> captured: people don’t pick the “best” writing tool, they pick the one that demands the least effort. But effort can manifest in many ways. And one of them is emotional risk. In my study, the more personal the writing, the more people resisted AI intervention. Once the task shifted into professional or functional territory, the comfort gap widened and AI quietly became the low-effort choice.</p><figure><img alt=""A person giving a robot directions on what to write"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7PDMmFtdCzfA4b_6caHVuA.png"" /><figcaption>Collaboration between a human writer and an AI assistant. Original illustration by the author.</figcaption></figure><h4>Takeaways for UX Design</h4><p>The tension here is becoming infrastructural. <a href=""https://epiren.medium.com/trust-verify-and-write-using-grammarlys-authorship-in-the-age-of-ai-1778e015dea0"">René Najera</a> recently wrote about Grammarly’s new Authorship feature, which records your keystrokes and generates a replay of how a document came together. Their point is simple: in an age of ubiquitous AI tools, writers now feel pressure not only to produce authentic work, but to <em>prove</em> they made it. My findings speak to the same impulse from the user side: authorship isn’t just who typed the words, but how much of the process still feels human, intentional, and personally owned.</p><p>Maybe the real product insight here is that Grammarly should just buy Copilot and call it a day. One interface to smooth every sentence, human or machine. Beneath the joke, though, is a deeper cue for design: people’s comfort with AI assistance scales with emotional distance.</p><p>Texting felt intimate, messy, and human. That’s where participants pulled back. They didn’t want the machine polishing what was meant to be personal. Essay writing lived in the middle zone, where improvement feels professional rather than invasive. Code, on the other hand, was almost depersonalized; help there felt efficient, not existential.</p><p>The takeaway isn’t to build less AI assistance. It’s to build <strong>context-aware</strong> assistance. In spaces where expression carries identity (e.g., messages, creative writing, voice) AI needs to step lightly, amplifying rather than rewriting. In functional spaces such as emails, documentation, and code, it can take the wheel without moral friction.</p><p>Designing for this gradient of intimacy means giving users <strong>control over how much authorship they’re willing to trade</strong>. The future of AI writing UX isn’t about raw capability. It’s about sensitivity: knowing when to finish your sentence, and when to leave your typos alone.</p><p>In practice, this could look like:</p><ul><li><strong>Surface adjustable “AI intensity” controls directly in writing surfaces.</strong><br />Let users slide between light-touch suggestions (“fix punctuation only”) and heavier rewrites (“rewrite for clarity”).</li><li><strong>Use mode-aware defaults.</strong><br />If the system detects texting-like language (emojis, slang, rapid back-and-forth), default to minimal intervention. For structured writing (docs, reports, code blocks), default to more active assistance.</li><li><strong>Show the </strong>Δ<strong><em>delta</em> , not just the final rewrite.</strong><br />Display what was changed and why. Visible authorship boundaries reduce the feeling of being overwritten.</li><li><strong>Offer reversible, granular edits.</strong><br />Let users accept or reject changes at the sentence or phrase level, rather than forcing an all-or-nothing rewrite.</li><li><strong>Preserve voice automatically.</strong><br />Train style models on the user’s past writing and ensure AI edits mimic that tone rather than flattening it.</li><li><strong>Avoid “dominant tone” suggestions in intimate spaces.</strong><br />Don’t push “professional tone,” “confident tone,” or “assertive tone” suggestions inside chat or messaging contexts. It reads as intrusive.</li><li><strong>Let users lock sentences or paragraphs.</strong><br />If a line feels emotionally important or identity-revealing, users can mark it: “don’t rewrite this.”</li><li><strong>Respect the emotional labor of writing.</strong><br />When edits touch personal content, frame them as support (“Want help clarifying this?”) rather than replacement (“Here’s a better version”).</li></ul><p>There’s an <a href=""https://medium.com/technology-hits/why-your-niche-is-your-shield-the-types-of-writing-ai-struggles-to-replace-dad50e79a01c"">argument</a> that emotionally grounded writing acts as a kind of “shield” that AI can’t easily penetrate, the kind of work rooted in lived experience, personal history, or emotional nuance that resists mechanization by its very nature. And maybe that’s the point: the parts of writing that matter most aren’t the ones AI can smooth; they’re the ones only a human can feel.</p><p><em>Alice Ji is a PhD researcher at UIUC’s Institute of Communications Research, studying digital persuasion, attention, and interface design.

When Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) decided to run for City council in season 4, she does so with her friends running every aspect of her campaign (after being let go by “official” campaign managers), this gives her campaign an approachable, friendly and personal aspect that eventually led to her victory.</p><p>Although specific names of the entire Mamdani’s campaign team are not extensively detailed in publicly available sources, it is known that the campaign operated with a community-driven approach characterized by deep community roots, and a decentralized yet well-coordinated volunteer network, with digital and field teams working closely to listen, test, and refine the outreach based on real-time input from voters.</p><figure><img alt=""Photograph of Zohran Mamdani speaking at a Fix the MTA press conference.

The answer lies in principles every UX designer should understand but while keeping in mind questions of power, authenticity, and manipulation in digital spaces.</blockquote><p><a href=""https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/user-experience-politics-how-ux-can-be-applied-to-political-campaigns-4efe25435846"">Brad O’Conner</a> who transitioned into UX design after 15 years in political consulting, discovered that he had been practicing UX design principles in political campaigns long before transitioning into the field, writes &quot;The voters whom you are trying to reach are the users. The goal is to provide the voter with relevant information so that their decision to vote for your candidate or cause is made more accessible.”</p><blockquote><strong><em>One key difference is that politics is also a lot more “manipulative” than UX.</em></strong></blockquote><p>A study carried out by the <a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report"">Oxford Internet Institute</a> that documented organized social media manipulation campaigns in 81 countries, found that “governments and political parties “produced misinformation on an industrial scale.” So as designers we must ask, <em>where does authentic transparency end and performance begin?</em></p><h3>1. Active listening as user testing</h3><p>Mamdani’s campaign broke from the traditional political playbook by engaging directly with both supporters and critics on social media.</p><h4>The “ultimately” moment: iteration made visible</h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DMBjabdOTPe/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I was given an ultimatum.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Zohran Mamdani catching himself mid-sentence about to say “ultimately” and self-correcting with humor</em> <em>Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram / Original creator</em></p><p>In one instance from July 2025, Zohran Mamdani, prompted by feedback from his communications team and voters, makes a conscious effort to stop himself from overusing the word “ultimately” during interviews and public appearances. In this light-hearted video, Mamdani acknowledges the feedback, shares clips illustrating his habit, and includes a segment where — mid-sentence — he catches himself about to say “ultimately” and quickly redirects his phrasing.</p><blockquote><em>“I am listening, I am learning. Please keep sending me your feedback because ultimately, I will get better.”<br />“In response to my team and supporters pointing out that I say ‘ultimately’ a lot, I caught myself on camera correcting the habit. Keep holding me accountable. This is how we improve, together.” (Zohran Mamdani)</em></blockquote><p>This approach mirrors what the <a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/"">Nielsen Norman Group teaches about design thinking</a>: empathy mapping helps “distill and categorize your knowledge of the user into one place” and “discover gaps in your current knowledge.” Mamdani essentially created a public empathy map of his own communication style, inviting collective feedback.</p><figure><img alt=""The User-Centered Design Loop: Mamdani’s Campaign as a Design Process.

Building trust through transparency</h3><p>Mamdani’s response embraced feedback as a tool for self-improvement much like designers should seek out feedback and build on it in order to inspire trust in their designs. Furthermore, the transparency in documenting the process of listening and acknowledging the feedback is what inspired people’s trust in him. This moment, in equal parts humorous and earnest, embodies the essence of user-driven iteration.</p><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, a question we, as designers, must ask ourselves is, how do we distinguish genuine transparency from performed authenticity? The Mamdani campaign appears to represent authentic engagement, and although their strategies are effective, they can also easily be replicated by good actors with bad intentions.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Find the line between authentic iteration and manipulative performance and listen to your users, show them you’re paying attention, and let the process of improvement happen in public view.</em></blockquote><h3>3. Small, agile teams win</h3><p>Mamdani did not have the funding for a large campaign nor was he backed by any billionaires. According to the official <a href=""https://www.nyccfb.info/vsapps/CandidateSummary.aspx?as_cand_id=2899&amp;as_election_cycle=2025&amp;cand_name=Mamdani"">campaign finance summary</a> from the New York City Campaign Finance Board for the 2025 election cycle, Zohran Mamdani’s total campaign spending was $12,794,272. His campaign raised $17,159,487 in total receipts, with over $4 million coming from private funds and significant additional support from public funds through matching programs. This is relatively lean compared to Cuomo’s 40 million dollar budget which mostly came from super PACs and billionaire donors. Unlike Cuomo’s traditional campaign operation, Mamdani relied on volunteers and a handful of core personnel to constantly iterate and connect at the ground level.</p><h4>Here’s how an agile approach played out in practice:</h4><ul><li><strong>Culturally aware content</strong>: Mamdani’s team highlighted community through moments like salsa dancing in Bronx parks, sharing biryani with cabbies, or joining Tai Chi classes in Flushing. These resonated with the voters and quickly turned viral.</li></ul><figure><img alt=""Collage of eight campaign photos showing Zohran Mamdani at diverse community events including large crowd gatherings, group photos with supporters on steps and on motorcycles, media appearances on MSNBC Weekend, indoor community meetings, a Congresswoman Yvette Clarke endorsement poster, and candid moments speaking with constituents in outdoor settings Source: https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*l4oBSYa9PKgbsRxCViYHDg.png"" /><figcaption>Collage of Mamdani at community events.

These partnerships came together quickly, built on DMs and group chats rather than formal contracts.</li><li><strong>Volunteer-led feedback loops</strong>: The campaign harnessed a decentralized WhatsApp-powered network of volunteers for canvassing, “friendraisers,” and “house parties.” First-time volunteers were rapidly trained and empowered to experiment, suggesting new neighborhoods to target, new stories to tell, and even filming spontaneous street interviews. This grassroots network was not only executing, but also feeding real-time insights and inspiration back to the campaign’s creative leads.</li><li><strong>Prototyping at campaign speed</strong>: from valentine’s day skits to a CTA in a box of chocolates, to working with rising and diverse artists like Aneesh Bhoopathy (whose branding drew from New York’s multicultural cityscapel), Wael Morcos of Morcos Key (who brought an Arabic inflection to the design for outreach in immigrant communities) and Rama Duwaji (Mamdani’s wife) a Syrian-American artist, all contributed creative input to the campaign’s bold color palette and storytelling style. Together, these collaborators crafted a visual system that embodied the campaign’s ethos: energetic, multicultural, and community-rooted.</li></ul><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/554/1*-cHRq1W7oDToc9LlXLl85g.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qP_poKjabd5DdbvWcCKONg.png"" /></figure><figure><img alt="""" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/538/1*n8JGlCWyY_n831nkV_arRQ.png"" /><figcaption>Campaign poster designs.

Social media engagement and message clarity</h3><p>If social media was meant for anything it was storytelling. This is exemplified in Mamdani’s social media campaigning, he didn’t just tell a story, he listened to other people’s stories.</p><h4><strong>Near real-time responsiveness</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQrrenCDtrg/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Thank you, New York City.

When he won the mayoral race, influencers joked that Mamdani should “go to bed” as the very next day Mamdani posted a video announcing his plan for the transitional phase.</p><p>Digital experts credited his social media presence with fueling grassroots participation at levels rarely seen in local politics. Mamdani did not simply use social media he was intertwined in its roots through collaboration with influencers he knew would target his voters and his audience, that’s good user research: <em>know your audience</em>.</p><p>This engagement and real-time communication transcended boundaries and was embraced far beyond its original audience because it told a story and stories have no borders.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Storytelling as a tool in UX is often overlooked and under-appreciated, yet it is at the center of good UX and UI.

Clarity as empowerment</h3><p>Other than the consistent and constant social media messaging and presence, the likes of which have never been seen in US political campaigning, Zohran Mamdani’s message was committed to clarity. On social media and in real life, whether he was explaining voting requirements, or his plans as mayor for the city, he was walking people step-by-step through the message and in multiple languages and settings thereby empowering first-time or previously disengaged voters.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: Mamdani’s approach exemplified the core UX principle of affordance: making it immediately visible what action is possible and how to take it.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>However</em></strong><em>, the question then arises, </em>Why should anyone have to explain the ability and process of voting?<em> Doesn’t this then allow those with the explanation the power to weaponize this knowledge? </em><a href=""https://ask.edgarallan.com/blog/a-ux-perspective-on-the-us-election""><em>Edgar Allan’s UX team notes</em></a><em>, “If there was ever a thing that should be unquestionably clear, understandable and accessible, it is the ability to vote. Unfortunately, the U.S. voting system suffers from a distinct lack of user-centricity.”</em></blockquote><h3>6. Cultural pain points = empathy mapping</h3><p>One of the first steps in the design thinking process is to empathize. Empathy was the main message throughout Mamdani’s campaign, it “goes beyond what users explicitly state and manages to unearth hidden motivations, desires, and pain points.” (<a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/empathy-map-why-and-how-to-use-it"">Interaction Design Foundation</a>).</p><p><em>By focusing on lived experiences, cultural nuances and specific community needs his campaign resonated with voters in an unprecedented way.</em></p><p>In a historic move not seen before in American politics, Mamdani publicly asked his supporters to stop donating once the campaign reached its financial goals. He posted transparent breakdowns of fundraising progress and, upon reaching the spending cap, communicated directly:</p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DOOI8_Ijrm5/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;I am once again asking you to stop sending us money. But we do need your time. Comment CanvassNow - one word, no spaces - to get a sign up link in your DMs.&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani asking voters to stop donating money to his campaign.

Redirect your generosity to mutual aid, to neighbors, to other grassroots causes.” (Zohran Mamdani)</blockquote><h4><strong>Plain language, clear needs</strong></h4><p>There were no hidden motives or complicated political lingo, just a plain-language presentation of what he needed from his supporters at each moment. Voting instructions were step-by-step. Donation limits were openly discussed. When the campaign reached its fundraising goal, supporters were told explicitly and publicly that there was no need for more underlying the empathetic line that his campaign had been running “For a New York You Can Afford”.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: make empathy visible by listening, responding, and adapting your design to users’ actual lives and constraints.</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Here again we must consider the power of manipulation and exploitation.</em></strong><em> When genuine empathy certainly bridges gaps, but when performed it can manipulate vulnerable populations. Our responsibility, as designers is to ensure empathy serves users’ interests, not just campaign goals, to quote </em><a href=""https://uxpamagazine.org/political-design/""><em>Lloyd Hervey writes about Political Design</em></a><em>, designers must consider “what is possible and what is ethical…the trade-offs of who will benefit from a particular solution versus who will be negatively affected.”</em></blockquote><figure><img alt=""Instagram post by Zohran Mamdani promoting a “Savings Calculator” tool for New York City residents.

Multilingual communication = inclusive design</h3><p>Some political opponents criticized Mamdani for “code switching”, shifting languages and communication styles to match his audience. But in UX terms, this is exactly right. Code switching isn’t diluting your message; it’s adapting it for different user contexts.</p><h4><strong>Authentic voices from communities</strong></h4><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQZrQz4jtFm/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram: &quot;Juntos vamos a construir la ciudad que merecemos! Y con tu ayuda, voy a seguir aprendiendo español 😉 ¡Puedes votar temprano hasta el Domingo y el día de las elecciones es el Martes 4 de Noviembre! ¡Comenta con la palabra VOTA y te enviaremos un enlace para ver dónde votar!&quot;</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Spanish with a local Spanish speaking voter. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/zohrankmamdani/reel/DQhue5vjlgj/"">Zohran Kwame Mamdani on Instagram‎: &quot;‏أنا اسمي زهران ممدان وعم رشّح حالي لأكون العمدة الجديد في مدينة نيويورك&quot;‎</a></p><p><em>Alt text: Video of Mamdani speaking Arabic. Video credit: Zohran Mamdani Instagram</em></p><p>Mamdani’s socials are flooded with videos in Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, appealing to all the New York demographics and communities. He did so by enlisting the help of people from those communities, in other words he engaged with more diverse audiences thoughtfully and used locals to help make his message more authentic and relevant. This helped communities feel seen and heard and Mamdani was able to build trust with communities small and large.</p><blockquote><strong><em>Lessons for designers</em></strong><em>: use language fluidity to engage broader, more diverse audiences thoughtfully and do not translate blindly, instead ellicit help from locals who speak the language. S</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Such help from local communities should go beyond translation and requires including the diverse communioties in the design process itself and not just in the final messaging. Language fluidity is not automatically inclusive and as designers we must be weary of what researchers call “</em>performative diversity<em>” which is looking inclusive without transferring actual power to marginalized communities</em></blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><h4>Hope through human-centered design</h4><p>Mamdani’s campaign gave people something special and new (perhaps also dangerous, it remains to be seen): Hope.</p><p>He did it by embodying core UX principles: <em>empathy</em>, <em>storytelling</em>, and <em>iteration</em>. His message was always empathetic, his statements clear and direct, and his “user requirements” (what he needed from his supporters) consistently open and accessible. This was a campaign led by the people, for the people, but more importantly, Mamdani didn’t position himself as someone observing New Yorkers from the outside. He is a New Yorker. He lived their stories alongside them, not above them.</p><h4>Remembering the human element and our responsibility as designers.</h4><p>As designers, it’s all too easy to get caught up in technical features or aesthetic appeal. While those things matter, the most meaningful work happens when we remember the element of humanity at the heart of every experience. As the UX world shifts rapidly, perhaps toward “Zero UI” where interfaces recede and experience comes to the foreground, we should focus on listening deeply, telling better stories, and designing platforms where users’ stories are welcomed, valued, and allowed to live and breathe.</p><p>But we must also remember our ethical responsibility; feelings give way to manipulation and exploitation, and the same techniques that built hope in Mamdani’s campaign can and are also used to to spread misinformation, manipulate vulnerable populations, and erode democratic institutions. Our work as designers is never neutral, after all design for everyone is design for no one, and the question is not whether our design has impact, but whether that impact serves democratic values, human dignity, and truth.</p><p>Mamdani’s campaign was a reminder that empathy, clarity, and authentic connection are what build hope and inspire change. But it’s also a reminder that these tools are powerful, and that with great power comes great responsibility.</p><blockquote>The future of design in democracy depends on our willingness to hold two simultaneous truths: that connection matters deeply, and that not all connection is created equal.</blockquote><p>Every design decision is a choice. Choose wisely.</p><h3>References and Additional Readings</h3><h4><strong>Campaign Coverage:</strong></h4><ul><li>Wikipedia. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_York_City_mayoral_election"">“2025 New York City mayoral election.”</a></li><li>Adweek. <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/meet-melted-solids-the-scrappy-agency-behind-zohran-mamdanis-primary-winning-campaign/"">“Meet Melted Solids, the Scrappy Agency Behind Zohran Mamdani’s Primary-Winning Campaign.”</a></li><li>New York Times. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/11/05/nyregion/nyc-mayor-mamdani"">“Mamdani, N.Y.C.

<h4>A guide to the extinction of user joy in the digital age.</h4><figure><img alt=""Image of a crab over a phone, symbolizing the evolution of apps into ad machines"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Yarbt8n6ZoCN7HwRnRAJHg.png"" /><figcaption>An crap shaped ad, emerging from a cellphone.</figcaption></figure><p>I was halfway through doing the dishes while listening to a podcast when an ad cut through and interrupted one of the most interesting bits. My phone was a few meters away in the living room and I rushed over like I had forgotten a burning turkey in the oven to make sure that I got to the phone before the second ad started playing. I tapped that lower-right hand skip button and the tension in my body temporarily melted away as I made my way back to the chore and continued listening to my podcast, ironically about the slow decay of once useful apps, that was so rudely interrupted by a Nissan ad.</p><figure><img alt=""Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/0*qVaAxIWg4nrXMgaT.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://strangershow.com/how-to-buy-youtube-premium/"">Popup for YouTube Premium offering ad free experience</a></figcaption></figure><p>As I pondered how possible it would be to find an ad blocker for my phone, the answer was slapped in my face in the form of a glorious popup! <strong>Try YouTube premium and you’ll be ad free</strong>… something that only a few years ago was standard had become a premium and I asked myself why? The term I happened to be learning about that day from <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/https-pluralistic-net-2024-04-04-teach-me-how-to-shruggie-kagi-caaa88c221f2"">Cory Doctorow was <strong>enshittification</strong></a>, which can be loosely defined as the process by which platforms decay as they shift value away from users and toward themselves and their business customers. In other words, things start out good for us, then get worse as the companies optimize for profit. While we all have a collective <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/"">intuitive sense of platforms decaying</a> over the last few years, I wanted to look closer from a design perspective, specifically, at how that decay unfolds through the deliberate, incremental rollout of ads.</p><p>The key players in this <strong>enshittification</strong> race are the four major tech companies that dominate our digital lives: Google, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, and YouTube. But for the sake of this article, I’m going to focus on one in particular, because it’s where I spend the most time: YouTube.</p><p>These companies’ slow decay into ad infested dystopian nightmares reminded me of a conversation I had with my good friend and cofounder <a href=""https://charliegedeon.medium.com/"">Charlie Gedeon</a>. He told me about this theory, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation""><strong>carcinisation</strong></a>, which is the very hilarious scientific process which can be described as “<a href=""https://brill.com/view/journals/ctoz/67/2/article-p79_1.xml"">the many attempts of Nature to evolve [into] a crab</a>”. In simple terms, there is an evolutionary momentum that has slowly pushed a variety of unrelated species to evolve into the general behaviour pattern and shape of a crab. So given enough time and opportunity, every species will eventually become a crab. I couldn’t ignore the metaphorical parallel: in our technological ecosystem, the biggest species don’t turn into crabs, they turn into ads.</p><p>Before YouTube, there was TV. The TV was invented in 1939, and the <a href=""https://www.madhive.com/insights/history-of-tv-advertising"">first ads were shown in 1941</a>. In the early 1940s, ads were short, mild interruptions between programs then by the 1980s, they had become pretty much the reason every sitcom, news broadcast, and sports event existed at all. It was simply the packaging for the ad breaks that paid for it. Then streaming arrived and it felt like a breath of fresh air! A new, ad-free subspecies breaking free from its commercial ancestors. Netflix, YouTube, and early Hulu gave us hope of a new evolutionary path: content without interruption. But, it didn’t stay ad free for long.</p><p>So let’s look at YouTube, starting with the first signs of life to crawl out of the primordial soup, we have the humble <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/66159/"">InVideo overlays first launched in 2007</a>, these were thin, semi-transparent banners that floated over the bottom of a playing video, usually small text or a tiny ad image that you could close with a small “X.” These early ads didn’t stop the video, or call for too much attention. They quietly fed on our attention without killing us, like a parasitic symbiosis. While annoying, they didn’t destabilize the delicate environment of early to mid-2000’s YouTube.</p><figure><img alt=""The early dismissible youtube ad banner showing at the bottom 20% of the screen"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QMeV9fQYXmh-XYNo.png"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Early dismissible youtube ad banner taking up the bottom 20% of a video.</a></figcaption></figure><p>Then between 2010 and 2018 there’s an explosion of life, the ads grow legs, lungs, and teeth… YouTube launched <a href=""https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/trueview-video-ads-give-viewers-choice/"">TrueView ads</a>, those aforementioned and all too familiar skippable pre-rolls that appear before your chosen video. These ads demand visibility, they evolved to study their prey’s habits, tracking which openings held attention longest. At first, there was just one, small but intrusive, a 5-second interaction before you could skip and move on. But as we all know, evolution rewards persistence. Soon, a single ad became two, then a pair before and after your video, and finally in 2012, <a href=""https://blog.youtube/creator-and-artist-stories/mid-roll-ads-updates-explained"">mid-roll ads appeared</a>, splitting your entertainment in bite size chunks.</p><figure><img alt=""Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video"" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ZSukJyjEmxwlLrTt.jpg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://setupad.com/blog/youtube-ad-formats-guide/"">Showing the skipable after X number of seconds ad at the beginning of a video</a></figcaption></figure><p>With each mutation, they became harder and harder to ignore. The variety was overwhelming, displaying banners above, overlays below, and videos within videos. The content creators themselves now, mimicking the copy of the ads. By the end of this period, the once teeming with life content creator ecosystem had turned into a chewed through rotting swamp where every spare patch of attention was colonized with a swarm of ads.</p><p>Understandably, this environment was not the most pleasant so I, like many others, used an ad-block. To put in perspective how prevalent this problem is, here’s a quote from Cory Doctorow that really struck me: <a href=""https://youtu.be/P1EKQidRooc?si=W5D9-f7NSy8VVT3I&amp;t=1372"">“51% of web users have installed an ad blocker, it is literally the largest consumer boycott in human history.”</a> The majority of people, which I imagine probably encompasses people making these decisions in the first place, probably have an ad blocker installed. This was our one tool to try and avoid the onslaught of ads that we’d be subjected to on a daily basis, and while there weren’t as easily accessible tools on mobile, we’d at least have a reprieve on our computers… or so we thought.</p><figure><img alt=""YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups, showing that Ad Blockers aren’t allowed on the platform."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/690/0*zH9j2L6vBUyKB43D.jpeg"" /><figcaption><a href=""https://community.brave.app/t/youtube-showing-popup-for-ad-blockers/511149"">YouTube rollout of the ad blocker warning popups</a></figcaption></figure><p>In late <a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-growing-3380809"">May of 2023</a>, YouTube began to mutate again, starting with a small subset of tests where they rolled out banners saying “Ad Blockers are not allowed on YouTube.” An easily dismissable popup asking you to uninstall your Ad Blocker. It was the early signs of a dominant species that was going to make it impossible for you to avoid ads. Eventually, making it an unfeasible arms race between ad-blockers and ad-blocker-blockers (that’s a mouthful). This persisted to where we’re at now where it’s more of a pain to find a way to circumvent ads then to just sit through the discomfort that we’ve been conditioned to endure.</p><p>This whole process has been a calculated and heavily studied rollout. In some ways it is a masterful example of how to slowly introduce a feature to users that doesn’t actually benefit the majority. At first users feel discomfort, but not enough to abandon the platform. The designers, researchers and tech CEO’s know that they’re pushing unpleasantness and that they have to go as far as they can without causing too much pain because they understand that it’s a delicate ecosystem of attention and people will find alternatives if pushed too far too quickly. If YouTube had not given notice of its intention to block ads for months prior to the rollout of the full ad-block extinction, what would have happened? I personally think the consequences would have been cataclysmic and in some ways hoped that they would have torn off the bandaid a little more violently to shock us into action.</p><p>So over the course of 25 years, they’ve increased the heat and now we’re in a pot of boiling water, but in truth it’s we actually don’t know how much hotter it might get. Many <strong>PAID</strong> platforms now include ads, such as Prime and you have to pay additional fees to exclude them. So what comes next in this grand evolutionary chain? Maybe ads that blend seamlessly into the content, AI-generated sponsorships that mimic the creator’s voice so perfectly we can’t tell where the video ends and the commercial begins. Maybe they’ll feel like features instead of intrusions. Either way, the species isn’t going extinct anytime soon. Like crabs, like capitalism, ads always find a way.</p><p>The hope is for the next disruption. YouTube once broke the cable monopoly with creativity, and community before slowly mutating into the very thing it replaced. It would seem, that’s the pattern of evolution, the old ecosystem collapses under its own weight, and something new crawls out of the primordial muck.</p><p>One can hope that there is a better answer gestating. Maybe it’s decentralized video, maybe it’s a new model of sharing that doesn’t depend on monetized attention, more than likely it’s something we haven’t imagined yet. The godfather of the term, <a href=""https://doctorow.medium.com/"">Cory Doctorow</a>, explores this in his new book <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222615930-enshittification""><em>Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It</em> </a>, with the most important part being that final clause: <strong>what to do about it.</strong></p><p>As citizens, we can advocate for antitrust laws, interoperability, and policies that prevent platforms from locking in both users and creators. As users, we can choose to support the smaller, values-driven platforms that still have a soul, ones that remind us the internet doesn’t have to be stinky pile of ads, but a place we actively connect. And lastly as designers, we can embed the values of portability, transparency, user control, and minimal hidden value extraction.

<h4>How to translate philosophical theory into practical design principles and responsibility.</h4><figure><img alt=""Colorful circular diagram titled “Ethical Interface Design” with sections: Inclusion, Privacy, Autonomy, Transparency, Well-Being, each linked to ethical theories."" src=""https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gm8743DS4GxpcGXJdywN2g.jpeg"" /></figure><p>The following article introduces an evolving academic framework called <em>Ethical Interface Design</em>, which examines how moral philosophy can guide interface design in the era of emerging technologies. The working site, <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com""><strong>ethicalinterface.com</strong></a>, presents these ideas through a minimalist, text-focused layout that intentionally prioritizes thought over visuals — a meta-commentary on where design itself may be heading. The framework remains in active development, and thoughtful feedback is welcome.</p><p>Society is moving beyond screens into conversational, immersive, and neural experiences, placing designers at the center of the ethical landscape of human–technology interaction. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> helps designers understand not only the impact of their choices but also the ethical frameworks behind them, exploring:</p><ul><li>How interfaces influence behavior across visual, tactile, conversational, neural, and mixed-reality modalities</li><li>The philosophical roots of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> — inclusion, autonomy, privacy, transparency, and well-being</li><li>The trade-offs between competing moral frameworks — such as egalitarianism versus meritocracy, or collectivism versus libertarianism — that determine how ethical priorities are balanced in design</li><li>Practical guidance for applying ethics to real-world projects</li></ul><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> equips designers to make intentional, responsible choices as they shape the digital world ahead.</p><h3>Interface Modalities</h3><p>Every interface mediates the relationship between humans and machines — translating intention into action, and in doing so, shaping how we perceive, decide, and connect. Emerging technologies such as <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models"">large language models</a> and <a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/"">neural chips</a> are expanding that relationship, blurring the boundary between user and system. As interfaces grow more adaptive and conversational, the very definition of “user interface design” begins to dissolve — replaced by fluid exchanges that merge cognition, language, and computation.</p><p>This evolution raises profound questions about agency, inclusion, and moral responsibility — questions explored further in the Ethical Foundations and <em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em> section of this article.</p><h4>From Command to Conversation</h4><p>Early computing relied on text-based <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp"">command-line interfaces</a> — precise but exclusive, accessible only to those fluent in code. The 1980s introduced the <a href=""https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphical-user-interfaces?srsltid=AfmBOorkkBsRT2lPaE0zQed3OJt5HT3hCRkelHQF4-T-KQ_riqUiSau2"">Graphical User Interface (GUI)</a>, popularized by Xerox PARC and Apple, replacing syntax with icons and windows. This visual paradigm made computing public but also aestheticized control — what you could see, you could do.</p><p>As technology spread beyond the desktop, new modalities emerged. Touchscreens redefined tactility. Voice assistants reintroduced conversation. Gesture and neural systems now blur the line between intention and execution. Each step expanded access while also raising new ethical questions about consent, surveillance, and cognitive autonomy.</p><h4>Types of Interfaces</h4><p>Interfaces are the boundaries between human intention and digital response. They manifest through the senses and combinations of them — and increasingly through language itself in conversational systems.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visual-design-in-ux-study-guide/""><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong></a> → Screens, icons, and layouts that communicate through sight. Examples include smartphone apps, operating systems, dashboards, and AI applications that blend visual and conversational interaction.</li><li><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/article/pii/S2666998624001728""><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong></a> → Touchscreens, trackpads, haptic vibrations, and adaptive textures that make interaction physical. The iPhone’s multitouch screen (2007) made touch the dominant input for a generation.</li><li><a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2023.103448""><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong></a> → Spoken interaction with assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. Generative AI extends this to conversational agents voice mode, emphasizing tone, intent, and context over fixed commands.</li><li><a href=""https://www.hci.org.uk/article/exploring-the-role-of-gestural-interaction-in-user-interface-design-challenges-and-opportunities/""><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong></a> → Motion-based control through cameras and sensors, from the Nintendo Wii (2006) and Microsoft Kinect (2010) to AR/VR hand tracking. They extend interface design into physical space and embodiment.</li><li><a href=""https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6914248/""><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong></a> → Brain–computer links such as Neuralink or medical prosthetics that translate thought into action. These collapse the boundary between user and system, making ethics inseparable from cognition itself.</li><li><a href=""https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/3/600""><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong></a> → Hybrid environments such as virtual and augmented reality that merge visual, tactile, and spatial interaction. Examples include Meta Quest, Apple Vision Pro, and AI-powered immersive design spaces.</li></ul><p>Every modality encodes a worldview — about who controls interaction, what is considered intuitive, and where agency resides. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> asks not only how interfaces function, but what kind of human they imagine.</p><h3>Ethical Foundations</h3><p>Ethics has always asked how we ought to act. From <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/"">Aristotle’s pursuit of virtue</a> to <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kant’s universal duty</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/"">Mill’s utilitarian calculus</a>, moral philosophy has sought to balance intention, outcome, and character. In design, these same questions take form in pixels, code, and policies. Every layout, algorithm, and feedback loop implies an answer to an ethical question — sometimes implicitly, sometimes with intent.</p><p>Yet the foundations of ethics are not absolute. Thinkers like <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/"">Nietzsche</a>, <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/"">Foucault</a>, and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/derrida/"">Derrida</a> challenged the idea of universal morality, arguing that ethical systems are shaped by culture, power, and interpretation. From this view, ethics is not a fixed code but a living discourse — one that evolves with our technologies and values. What counts as “good design” may therefore reflect not timeless truth, but the shifting moral architectures of an age.</p><h4>Philosophical Frameworks</h4><p><em>Ethical Interface Design</em> draws from a range of philosophical frameworks that form the foundation of <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>. While ethics is contextual, these pillars rest on moral principles widely recognized across contemporary society.</p><p>These principles act as guiding coordinates rather than fixed rules, reflecting a shared yet evolving moral landscape. The <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> reveal how ethical tensions emerge when values intersect — the goal is not to eliminate these contradictions but to make them visible, allowing designers to act with clarity and intent.</p><p>History shows how one value can override another — privacy may yield to collective well-being during crises, or inclusion may challenge merit-based systems. <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> highlights these trade-offs, guiding designers toward more transparent and deliberate choices.</p><h4>Core Ethical and Philosophical Principles</h4><p>The following list outlines major philosophical frameworks relevant to ethical design. While many other schools of thought exist, these principles form the foundational basis for <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a>.</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism""><strong>Collectivism</strong></a> → A moral and political philosophy that prioritizes the needs, goals, and well-being of the group over individual interests. It emphasizes cooperation, shared responsibility, and social interdependence as essential to human flourishing.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/""><strong>Communitarianism</strong></a> → A perspective emphasizing community, shared values, and social responsibility in shaping moral and political life. It critiques excessive individualism in liberal thought.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/""><strong>Egalitarianism</strong></a> → The view that all individuals deserve equal moral consideration and that social and economic inequalities require justification. It emphasizes fairness, equal opportunity, and the reduction of arbitrary privilege.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/""><strong>Kantian Ethics</strong></a> → A deontological moral theory grounded in reason and autonomy. It holds that moral action arises from adherence to universal moral laws derived from rational duty.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/""><strong>Liberalism</strong></a> → A political and moral philosophy that upholds individual rights, freedom of choice, and consent as the basis of legitimacy. It limits interference by the state or others in personal domains.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/""><strong>Libertarianism</strong></a> → A philosophy centered on individual liberty and minimal external control. It values personal autonomy, voluntary exchange, and limited government intervention, often resisting collective mandates or welfare-oriented design.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/""><strong>Meritocracy</strong></a> → The belief that rewards and positions should reflect individual talent, effort, and achievement rather than social status or inherited privilege. It values ability and contribution as the basis for distribution.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/""><strong>Pragmatism</strong></a> → A philosophical movement that evaluates ideas and actions by their practical effects. It privileges usefulness and results over strict adherence to principles or absolute truth.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/""><strong>Utilitarianism</strong></a> → A consequentialist theory asserting that moral value depends on outcomes, with the best action being the one that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering for the greatest number.</li><li><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/""><strong>Virtue Ethics</strong></a> → A moral framework emphasizing the cultivation of moral character and the pursuit of virtue. It focuses on traits such as honesty, integrity, and wisdom as the foundation of ethical behavior.</li></ul><h4>Toward an Ethical Interface</h4><p>As we move into an era defined by artificial intelligence, automation, and neural integration, ethics becomes both more complex and more urgent. Interfaces now operate at cognitive and emotional levels once considered private. The goal of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em> is to preserve human dignity within this expanding field of influence.</p><h3>The Five Pillars of <em>Ethical Interface Design</em></h3><p><a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html""><em>The Five Pillars of Ethical Interface Design</em></a> are built on established <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/ethics.html"">ethical principles</a> and common and emerging <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/modalities.html"">interface modalities</a>. Together, they reveal how moral values manifest across different modes of interaction — and how every ethical choice involves trade-offs that designers must navigate responsibly.</p><p>To learn more, review the principles in detail below. For a concise overview, refer to the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/img/five-pillars-ethical-design-2025.pdf"">summary table</a>.</p><h4>Inclusion</h4><p>Inclusion ensures that interfaces welcome, represent, and empower people across abilities, cultures, and contexts. It rejects design that privileges one type of user at the expense of others and treats accessibility not as accommodation but as design integrity. An inclusive interface assumes difference as a constant, not an exception.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Support diverse visual and linguistic literacies through adjustable type scales, high-contrast modes, and culturally inclusive iconography.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Design haptic feedback and physical controls that accommodate varied dexterity and sensory abilities, ensuring equitable interaction.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Train recognition systems on global accents, dialects, and speech patterns to prevent bias toward dominant languages.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Calibrate motion detection for diverse ranges of movement, body types, and physical capabilities instead of a single “ideal” gesture model.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Build adaptive systems that account for neurodiversity, cognitive variation, and comfort levels in signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Configure AR and VR environments to support varied sensory sensitivities, spatial perception, and physical comfort across users.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Rooted in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/"">Egalitarianism</a>. The core claim is moral equality — like cases should be treated alike unless a relevant difference justifies unequal treatment. In design terms, capability differences, cultural background, and context are relevant inputs to equalize effective opportunity, not reasons to exclude.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meritocracy/"">Meritocracy</a> links reward to demonstrated talent, effort, or productivity, appealing to fairness through performance. In design, this logic supports optimizing for “power users” or “high-value segments” to maximize efficiency and impact.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Equality vs. Merit</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Design for accessibility and difference as defaults while recognizing merit, balancing equality with performance.</p><ul><li>Adopt accessibility guidelines (<a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"">WCAG</a>, <a href=""https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"">WAI-ARIA</a>) as creative constraints.</li><li>Use participatory methods to include marginalized users in testing and feedback.</li><li>Offer personalization — contrast, input method, motion sensitivity, voice settings — without stigma.</li><li>Audit datasets, prompts, and imagery for cultural or algorithmic bias.</li><li>Frame inclusivity as an innovation driver that benefits all users.</li><li>Provide “power features” as additive layers, not the default path.</li><li>Evaluate efficiency metrics for the whole user base, not just the fastest quartile.</li></ul><h4>Autonomy</h4><p>Autonomy protects the user’s capacity to think, choose, and act without manipulation or coercion. In interface design, it means preserving agency — giving users real control over what they see, share, and decide.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Empower users to manage visibility and consent through clear privacy controls, opt-in dialogs, and transparent data-use indicators.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide physical controls, such as undo buttons and emergency stops, that let users reverse or interrupt actions on their own terms.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Require explicit verbal control over actions, ensuring conscious intent over automated interpretation.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Design gestures that distinguish deliberate intent from incidental movement, preventing unintended triggers.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Secure informed consent and allow opt-out before interpreting or predicting user intent from neural signals.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Give users control over spatial permissions, tracking boundaries, and data sharing within AR and VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Grounded in <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/"">Kantian Ethics</a>. People must be treated as ends in themselves, not as means to collective goals. Ethical action respects rational self-rule, even when doing so conflicts with collective well-being. Favor transparent choices, meaningful consent, and reversibility over efficiency or mass benefit.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism/"">Utilitarianism</a> values the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach may favor streamlined decisions, the removal of risky options, or persuasive defaults to maximize collective well-being and system efficiency.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Freedom vs. Welfare</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Preserve informed choice while allowing limited, transparent guidance that prevents harm without coercion.</p><ul><li>Treat informed consent as ongoing and contextual.</li><li>Provide granular settings for automation and data sharing.</li><li>Default to privacy-preserving choices.</li><li>State clearly where automation begins and ends.</li><li>Eliminate dark patterns and manipulative urgency cues.</li><li>When nudging for welfare, disclose the nudge, show the rationale, and offer a one-tap opt-out.</li><li>Provide escape hatches (undo, exit, manual override).</li></ul><h4>Transparency</h4><p>Transparency concerns the integrity of information shared between humans and systems. It requires honesty, disclosure, and authenticity so that what is shown aligns with what is real. It provides the truthful foundation necessary for understanding, accountability, and rational choice.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Present data truthfully through accurate charts, clear sponsorship labels, and visible indicators of AI-generated or manipulated media.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Provide feedback that reflects the true system state, distinguishing between successful actions, errors, and pending responses.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Disclose when users are interacting with non-human agents and summarize what information is recorded or retained.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Notify users when motion data is being tracked, interpreted, or stored to maintain awareness of system observation.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Distinguish which neural signals can be measured versus which should be, clarifying how thought-related data is interpreted and used.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Display clear boundaries between simulated and real elements, including visibility into what is recorded, shared, or AI-generated within AR/VR environments.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Draws on <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/"">Virtue Ethics</a>. Honesty and truthfulness appear as reliable presentation, avoidance of deception, and willingness to disclose limits. Interfaces operationalize these traits via faithful visualizations, provenance signals, and candid explanation of uncertainty.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/"">Pragmatism</a> values what works over what is strictly true. It treats clarity and usefulness as higher goods than full disclosure, accepting that some truths may be simplified or deferred when they hinder progress.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Truth vs. Utility</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Reveal truth and uncertainty clearly and in context, maintaining usability and trust.</p><ul><li>Disclose algorithmic involvement in rankings and outputs.</li><li>Make consent and data flows comprehensible in context.</li><li>Expose uncertainty and known limitations.</li><li>Align copy and feedback with actual system behavior.</li><li>Design clarity as a user benefit, not just compliance.</li><li>Use layered explanations: short, then expandable detail — never hide conflicts of interest.</li><li>Avoid “spin” — simplify presentation without sacrificing truth.</li></ul><h4>Privacy</h4><p>Privacy safeguards the boundary between the individual and the system. It upholds user control over information, attention, and identity — defining the conditions under which data is observed, shared, or stored.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Provide clear permission settings, visible tracking indicators, and accessible private modes that let users manage visibility and data exposure.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Incorporate hardware shutters, physical switches, and tactile indicators to give users direct control over sensors and device activity.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Include audible or visual cues when recording begins, and enable quick, in-flow deletion or redaction of captured speech.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Capture movement data only upon explicit initiation, ensuring gestures are recorded intentionally rather than passively monitored.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Protect sensitive neural data through local processing, encryption, and consent-based access to signal interpretation.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Allow users to define spatial privacy zones and control when spatial mapping, camera feeds, or biometric data are shared.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Informed by <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/"">Liberalism</a>. Individuals possess rights to personal domain and consent that constrain collective or commercial interests. Privacy functions as a precondition of autonomy by preserving mental space for deliberation, identity formation, and dissent.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/communitarianism/"">Communitarianism</a> prioritizes common goods and may endorse broader sharing for safety, coordination, or solidarity. Legitimate community aims must be balanced against the standing claim of individuals to control access and use of their data.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Autonomy vs. Solidarity</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Protect dignity through consent and control while permitting ethical data sharing for genuine collective benefit.</p><ul><li>Practice data minimization.</li><li>Show what’s shared, why, and for how long — without fatigue.</li><li>Make controls accessible, contextual, and reversible.</li><li>Process data on the user’s device whenever possible — use cloud storage or computation only when essential and clearly justified.</li><li>Frame privacy as trust that enables participation.</li><li>For “common good” uses, require aggregation, anonymization, purpose binding, and expiry by default.</li><li>Provide opt-out mechanisms for any data pooling or sharing when feasible — document non-optional cases.</li></ul><h4>Well-Being</h4><p>Well-being asks whether technology supports human and ecological flourishing — psychological, social, physical, and environmental. It favors sustained clarity, balance, and restoration over compulsive engagement, overuse, or unsustainable resource demand.</p><p><strong>Examples Across Modalities</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Interfaces</strong> → Design calm visual hierarchies, offer dark or focus modes, and adjust color temperature or brightness over time to reduce eye strain and fatigue.</li><li><strong>Tactile Interfaces</strong> → Use haptic cues to encourage rest, posture shifts, or mindful breaks, supporting physical comfort and recovery.</li><li><strong>Voice Interfaces</strong> → Employ tone and pacing that convey calm support without emotional manipulation or artificial empathy.</li><li><strong>Gesture Interfaces</strong> → Encourage healthy movement through interaction patterns that counter sedentary use and promote active engagement.</li><li><strong>Neural Interfaces</strong> → Adapt cognitive pacing and information density to match user comprehension and prevent overload or fatigue.</li><li><strong>Mixed Reality Interfaces</strong> → Balance immersion with grounding cues, allowing users to pause, recalibrate, or exit experiences to protect mental and physical well-being.</li></ul><blockquote><strong>Underlying Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Anchored in <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism"">Collectivism</a><strong>.</strong> Well-being is measured by the health of the collective — how design supports shared welfare, mutual dependence, and the long-term sustainability of both human and ecological systems. Design choices emphasize cooperation, community benefit, and responsibility for collective outcomes over purely individual gain.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Contrasting Philosophy</strong></blockquote><blockquote><a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"">Libertarianism</a> prioritizes individual freedom and self-determination, often resisting design constraints that guide or limit user behavior for the sake of collective good. From this view, interventions that promote well-being — such as limiting usage or prompting rest — can be seen as paternalistic, infringing on personal autonomy even when intended for protection or benefit.</blockquote><p><strong>Ethical Tension: Welfare vs. Freedom</strong></p><p><strong>Design Focus</strong> → Foster flourishing and reduce harm without violating autonomy or moral boundaries.</p><ul><li>Replace engagement KPIs with well-being metrics: satisfaction, balance, trust, recovery.</li><li>Use persuasion for healthy habits, not compulsion.</li><li>Add protective friction: time limits, focus modes, optional pauses.</li><li>Assess long-term emotional and cognitive effects of tone, color, and loops.</li><li>Test for calm, clarity, and self-perception, not only task completion.</li><li>Offer well-being prompts as configurable aids with clear off switches.</li><li>Decouple core utility from compulsive loops (infinite scroll, variable rewards).</li></ul><h3>Design for the Future</h3><p>Design for the future means translating moral philosophy into tangible choices that shape how people live, work, and connect. <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/index.html""><em>Ethical Interface Design</em></a> and the <a href=""https://ethicalinterface.com/pillars.html"">Five Pillars</a> framework were developed by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/micbuckcreative/"">Michael Buckley</a> to help designers approach emerging technologies with awareness and accountability.
