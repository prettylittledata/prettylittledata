In projects of various scales, the Genoese architect maintains an essential thread: the implementation of passive architectural strategies, highlighting the importance of these methods for sustainability and energy efficiency. This is often made explicit in his sketches, as an initial concern, and clearly comes through in the finished works. Here are some examples of iconic projects developed by his office in recent decades.</p>"

<p>The Cashmere Tech Centre, part of a much larger factory complex, was first developed at the turn of the millennium. Located away from the city of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ordos"">Ordos</a> in the arid desert landscape of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the complex was conceived almost as a self-sufficient town. It included residences for factory staff and extensive facilities for the production of fabrics destined for both domestic and international brands. Within this compound, the Tech Centre was established as a dedicated building for advancing cashmere research and production. Equipped with laboratories, sample testing rooms, and studios, the centre was originally designed to support highly specialized processes. Our commission was to regenerate this ageing facility into a contemporary R&amp;D community — one that reflects today's collaborative and open office practices. </p>"

<p>The rural pircas, so characteristic of the mountain landscape of Córdoba, have the function of enclosing or limiting a piece of land. In this case, they delimit a space of use, some ensuite rooms as an expansion of a hotel. The place in question corresponds to the former summer stay of former Argentine president J.A. Roca transformed into a hotel.</p>"
