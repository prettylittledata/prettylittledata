<p>Cabin Fever is an international summer school and festival launched by the Hungarian architecture studio Hello Wood, known for its design-build approach and community-focused, sustainable projects. Since its founding in 2010, Hello Wood has become a global platform merging hands-on education with socially engaged architecture. The 2025 edition, powered by VELUX, explored how light and space shape human experience — placing presence, intimacy, and connection at the centre of architecture. This dialogue with VELUX reflects a shared conviction: that the future of building lies in responsibility — in creating spaces with care, with awareness, and with light — offering meaningful alternatives in an overstimulated world. 2025 Concept, Location, Participants. From 23–31 July 2025, the festival took place in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ceska-kamenice"">Česká Kamenice</a>, Czech Republic, on the grounds of a former textile factory and wartime labour camp — a place that embodies both the weight of memory and the potential for transformation.

<p>What matters more: looking to the past or to the future? Recognizing established trajectories or fostering paths still under construction? Perhaps this is not a question with a single answer. Traditionally, architecture awards have operated as devices of consecration, recognizing completed works, established careers, and already tested solutions, most often through a retrospective lens. But what would happen if recognition ceased to be an end in itself and instead began to operate as a catalytic agent, investing less in what has already been done and more in what is still yet to unfold?</p>"

<p>Across history, the relocation of capital <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cities"">cities</a> has often been associated with moments of political rupture, regime change, or symbolic nation-building. From Brasília to <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/islamabad/page/1"">Islamabad</a>, new capitals were frequently conceived as instruments of centralized power, territorial control, or ideological projection. In recent decades, however, a different set of drivers has begun to shape these decisions. Rather than security or representation alone, contemporary capital <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/relocation"">relocations</a> are increasingly tied to structural pressures such as demographic concentration, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/infrastructure"">infrastructural</a> saturation, environmental risk, and long-term resource management.

Yet most of what we remember about living is how we eat together, withdraw, argue, care, and rest, which happen far from view. It happens inside rooms.
