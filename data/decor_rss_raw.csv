Starting from the initial stage of urban planning, the landscape system has been emphasized as green infrastructure connecting the future CBD, transportation hub, residential area and the Huangpu Chong River, mitigating the urban heat island. The 300-meter-long, 4-hectare Pazhou South Waterfront Park <strong>restores the natural riverfront from the existing rigid embankment, connecting the ecological corridors to the city.</strong> Integrating <strong>nature inspiration, ecological restoration and urban lifestyle</strong>, the park brings accessible nature riverside experience and public open spaces to the heart of the booming CBD.</p>"

<p>A good project should always be one with the user. In order to develop the architectural program, we start by understanding the client, their needs, tastes, and interests. <strong>House Roja is a project designed for a man who alternates his residence between his hometown (El Grullo) and abroad, where he develops professionally.</strong> For this reason, a place was envisioned that is truly pleasurable to be in after a long period of work away from loved ones, a place equipped with communal spaces in such a way that even on the stairs, one feels inclined to stop and chat.</p>"
