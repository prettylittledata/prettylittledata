Positioned as a largely linear volume on an elevated site, the form refrains from overpowering its context. Instead of exploiting the site's height advantage over the surrounding terrain, the architecture integrates a laterite wall that functions both as a compound wall and the main building skin along the eastern elevation. This wall stretches across the larger volume that houses the common areas.</p>"

<p>A Dialogue Between Concrete and Nature<br />Site Selection: Architectural Intuition The story of the project began with a pivotal moment of professional insight. The client had already purchased two plots in a forested area, but after evaluating the surrounding territory, the architectural team suggested a change. The reason was a breathtaking landscape nearby, dominated by ancient, towering pines. A strong intuition—which proved to be exactly right—suggested that these <strong>pines should become the central axis of the house</strong>, rather than just a backdrop.</p>"
