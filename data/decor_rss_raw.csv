Rather than directly restoring the structural joints or framing system of traditional Hanok, the project focuses on its nonlinear spatial organization, the fluidity of curves, and the continuous transitions between interior and exterior. These characteristics are gradually transformed through an AI-based three-dimensional mapping algorithm that interprets sequences of images as evolving forms.</p>"
