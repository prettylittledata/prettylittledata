<p>Zero-Concrete Architecture: A New Vernacular – Vernacular architecture existed long before concrete. Across regions and climates, it evolved through local materials, gravity, craft, and accumulated knowledge—without relying on reinforced concrete as a universal solution. This villa is built entirely without concrete. The project is conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of vernacular architecture and as a continuation of a critical inquiry into modern, concrete-dependent construction culture.</p>"

<p>When we first visited the site, what struck us the most was that after emerging from a narrow alley, an extraordinary view opened up toward one of the slopes of the Tepozteco mountain range. These rock formations are emblematic of the region, and the land ends precisely at the base of this dramatic topography. From the very beginning, one of our main concerns was to ensure that every room&mdash;whether for gathering or resting&mdash;could enjoy this privileged view.</p>"

<p>The OneTwoHouse (German: EinZweiHaus) is a residential building whose exterior form creates an optical illusion: Although it appears to be a semi-detached house, it is in fact a single-family home. The staggered volumes and symmetrical façade create the impression of two separate units that are, however, united under one roof.</p>"

<p>The project is a renovation project which located in Xianjing Village, Baita Town, Xianju County, Zhejiang Province. From the village, one can directly overlook the Fanzeng Peak in the southwest. Relying on the beautiful natural scenery of the Shenxianju mountains, the town government hopes to transform Xianjing Village into a sketching art village. They entrusted us to renovate the abandoned primary school, hoping to attract young art students and artists to come to the village, stay and do some sketching nearby. The Youth Artist's Dormitory is named as ""Qingyi Lodge"".The main building of the village primary school was originally a two-story brick-concrete structure constructed in the 1970s-1980s. We hope to retain the form of the old school, but bring new life to it.</p>"

<p>Residence AV is a courtyard house located in a dense residential neighborhood in Bruges, Belgium. Designed by YAMA architects, the project responds to a paradoxical brief: a strong desire for connection to the surrounding context combined with an equally strong need for privacy. The client, living alone, was attracted to the social presence and perceived safety of the neighborhood, yet sought a dwelling that could withdraw from direct views and support a more introspective way of living.</p>"

<p>Located in a southern sloping <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/vancouver"">Vancouver</a> neighbourhood, the mid-century house is one of the few remaining bungalow-scaled homes in a part of the city where larger lots were desirable for the construction of larger houses in the 1980s and 90s. The 1 ½ story house, both designed in 1952 and renovated in 1982 by the Canadian Architect Ron Thom, sits beneath a mature canopy of cedars, maples, and dogwoods. The home's spaces are sheltered under staggered planes of 3x6 cedar roof decking, with the living space guarded from the street by a concrete brick hearth with clerestory and terrace glazing opening the house to the south.</p>"

<p>The Flamboyant House emerges from a dialogue with a partially occupied territory.

These conditions are not treated as limitations but embraced as structuring elements of the project, guiding decisions regarding placement, volumetry, and spatiality.</p>"

<p>The main idea behind the house design was to fit an extensive functional program into a long plot bordering the Wielkopolska National Park while maximizing daylight in as many living spaces as possible. This resulted in an elongated form composed of three overlapping, truncated volumes. An equally important goal was dividing the house into lifestyle-based zones so that, despite its size, it would not dominate the surrounding development. Through careful layout and use of local conditions, the house blends naturally into its context.</p>"
