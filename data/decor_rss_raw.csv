<p>Public schools are an essential tool for addressing current social and environmental issues. Promoting children's well-being, raising their civic, ecological, and social awareness, and reducing class and gender inequalities are the goals that public schools must set for themselves.

Inspired by the French ""open-air school"" movement of the 20th century, this new school offers an alternative to traditional schooling.

<p>The neo-classical semi-detached house with large adjoining stable, a small wash house, and a shooting lodge was built in 1837 by master builder Joseph Anton Seger from Vaduz. From 1864 to 1912, the listed farmstead on Feldkircher Strasse served the imperial post office to deliver mail to most of Liechtenstein.</p>"

<p>The design approach seems to focus on creating a seamless integration between the interior and exterior spaces, with an emphasis on spatial fluidity and visual continuity. The elongated plan of the residence likely informed the layout, fostering a sense of openness while minimizing abrupt divisions between functional zones. The use of neutral tones for the background palette effectively establishes a restrained architectural canvas, allowing for the functional compositions to be articulated through the juxtaposition of contrasting textures, colors, and materials.</p>"

<p>Every act of building begins with the<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1019364/building-better-with-data-the-role-of-material-libraries-in-sustainable-architecture?ad_campaign=normal-tag"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> transformation of raw materials</a>, energy, and land, and this inevitably entails environmental impact. This encompasses all the changes a process triggers in the natural world: from resource extraction to pollutant emissions, from energy consumption to biodiversity loss. Measuring this is complex, as it spans multiple dimensions. Carbon has emerged as the common metric, translating these effects into greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂ equivalent) directly linked to global warming. This standardization has made it omnipresent and comparable across materials, systems, and sectors. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1007607/how-to-use-alternative-products-and-materials-to-reduce-a-projects-carbon-footprint?ad_campaign=normal-tag"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Reducing carbon emissions</a>, therefore, means addressing the root of global warming, which is a particularly urgent task in the construction industry, responsible for about 39% of global emissions.
