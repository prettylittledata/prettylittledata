<p>The design of the new Faculty of Sciences at the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana faced unique challenges, such as achieving a harmonious balance with the historic Pablo VI building, <strong>activating the urban edge of Carrera S&eacute;ptima, and coherently articulating the campus.</strong> The comprehensive project was structured around three fundamental components: A) A linear platform that establishes a human-scale front along Carrera S&eacute;ptima, B) A tall tower with a broad and fluid base, defining a new iconic entrance to the campus, and C) An extensive landscape intervention and collective spaces that serve as a connector between different areas of the campus.</p>"

<p>Project 1374 is located in one of the plotted developments in the north of Bangalore, characterized by well-demarcated plots, spacious roads, and organized infrastructure. Trees flank the wide streets, dividing the plots with dense canopies offering shaded avenues. Abutting the plot stood a cluster of trees- a quiet presence. We borrowed these trees into the design, their presence extending into the home's narrative. </p>"

<p>Located in Danjingshan Town, Pengzhou, Sichuan, the Jianjiang Small Train Linear Park is a comprehensive tourism route centered on railway stations, organically connecting dining, exhibitions, arts, and heritage revitalization. Its predecessor, the Peng-Bai Railway, was a narrow-gauge line opened in 1961. Although operations ceased in 2004, it remains an irreplaceable emotional bond for the people of Pengzhou. In 2024, driven by the ""Operations-Led"" philosophy, Jiulong Xinchuang and UN-GROUP launched a revival plan. They proposed the concept of ""Time Fold · Rebirth on Tracks,"" linking over ten project nodes via 3.5 kilometers of rail, with full completion expected by 2026.</p>"

<p>""Vala"" is a response to a fundamental question: How can we create a place for collective living and conscious presence within today's dense and vertical urban fabric? The project, centered on the construction of 50 residential units within a single volume, brings human density into an integrated structure where social interactions and a sense of belonging to the neighborhood can emerge.</p>"
