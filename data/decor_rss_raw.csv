<p>The inspiration for the new Ragu was Italian hospitality, the neighborhood rhythm of the day, and pasta – understood both symbolically and literally. Our aim was to capture the atmosphere of a small Italian trattoria: homely, relaxed, and conducive to gatherings. Guests were meant to have the opportunity both to celebrate meals together and to spend time in smaller groups.</p>"

<p>Like the famous Russian Matryoshka doll, opening a package often feels like uncovering endless layers. Inside a cardboard box, there might be molded Styrofoam, then several plastic air pillows, and finally, individual plastic wrapping around each piece. Even a small product can leave behind a trail of plastic waste far larger than its size. Now imagine <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/944297/towards-a-common-practice-of-material-recycling"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">this logic applied to a construction site</a> where every component, every delivery of materials, often arrives wrapped in multiple layers of protection. What already seems excessive in retail becomes monumental when repeated daily on large construction projects. </p>"

<p>The Red House is located in Bahías de Huatulco, Oaxaca, in a residential area a few minutes from the coast, in a completely urban environment with no sea views. The property is surrounded by four houses on three of its abutments and opens to the west onto a main street with views of a natural area not yet developed. There are three pre-existing trees on the site; in the front and a central position, there is an Alejo/Matapescado (Piscidia Carthagenensis), an endemic deciduous tree. Very close to it grows a young guayacán with purple flowers (Guaiacum coulteri), a tree in danger of extinction and very slow growing, and finally, in the back there is a Cuahulote (Guazuma ulmifolia), an evergreen tree of medium size abundant in the low Oaxacan jungle.</p>"
