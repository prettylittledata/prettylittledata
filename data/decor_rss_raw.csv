TiggColl was approached by the client to design a new bespoke home on the water to replace their existing canal barge, which lacked the living space and accessibility requirements for a growing family with changing health needs. <strong>Allowance for future level access was central to the brief, as was having a property which sits above the water</strong> – unlike traditional canal barges, where the internal floor level is below the water line, leading to cold and damp conditions. Crucially, the family wished to remain within a co-operative of 35 houseboats at a private residential mooring at Hampton Hall Farm, in a beautiful but confined location.</p>"
