<p>The site is located on the suburban edge of Kunshan High-Tech Zone, within an area planned as an industrial park. When we first visited, the area was still largely vacant land. A small canal along the western edge connects to the Wusong River a short distance to the south; downstream it becomes <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/suzhou"">Suzhou</a> Creek, which flows through Shanghai and joins the Huangpu River at the Bund.</p>"

<p>Ramand is, before being a project, a decision—a decision about how a cube can stand on a dual-cornered site without compromising its own geometry and without disregarding the city. The wooden volume is a controlled rotation, neither a formal gesture nor an exaggeration; merely the minimal deviation required for the form to settle into the site. Its geometry does not impose itself on the city, but aligns with it. The wooden skin is not an emotional choice, but a means to soften the hard cube. In a site surrounded by schools, the wood transforms potential seriousness into a conversational tone, aware of the daily gaze of children building their spatial memory.</p>"

<p>On the outskirts of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/balcarce"">Balcarce</a>, <strong>a mountain range is interrupted by a precise void: a sharp cut in the slope, a missing piece that becomes a signal. The house takes this ""bite"" as its starting point and organizes all its material around that absence.</strong> More than an isolated object, it is conceived as a device for viewing: a heavy roof that aligns with the silhouette of the mountain range and establishes, in the foreground, <strong>a new geometry from which to reinterpret the landscape.</strong></p>"

<p>Built in 1811 on the banks of the Rivière des Mille Îles, the Aubé house is a patriot's home nestled in the heart of a vast garden, a remnant of former farmland. Inhabited by the same family for generations, <strong>this site has become, over time, the stage for a multigenerational architectural and human story</strong>. Faced with evolving uses and the accumulation of ad hoc interventions, the owners wished to restore the heritage home to its original coherence and strength, while also increasing its capacity.</p>"
