<p>Traditional Ukrainian vernacular architecture evolved through simple yet expressive solutions: thick whitewashed walls, thatched roofs, and regular plastering as an act of care and an aspiration toward order and beauty. In YOD Group's contemporary interpretation of traditional Ukrainian Hata-Mazanka, this pursuit of light and cleanliness is translated into fully transparent glass façades, while the roof – deliberately oversized – becomes the project's primary architectural gesture. Its sculptural form defines a strong, instantly recognisable silhouette, evoking both a traditional tall hat and an oversized mushroom rising from the landscape.</p>"
