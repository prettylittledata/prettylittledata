<p>This week's architectural highlights traced the intersections between <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/heritage"">heritage</a>, climate awareness, and contemporary design practice. As <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/venice-architecture-biennale-2025"">the 19th Venice Architecture Biennale </a>approaches its closing, projects exploring collective intelligence and material experimentation offer reflections on small-scale responses to global challenges. In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/egypt/page/1"">Egypt</a>, the completion of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1035595/the-grand-egyptian-museum-fully-opens-completing-gizas-new-cultural-landmark?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=projects_tab&amp;ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all"">Grand Egyptian Museum</a> marks a long-anticipated moment in cultural <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/preservation"">preservation</a>, while new <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/competition"">competition</a> initiatives in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/jordan/page/1"">Jordan</a> extend this dialogue toward sacred and archaeological contexts.

<p>Chimneys are among the most quietly persistent elements in architectural history. Yet <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/953149/how-to-use-and-reuse-chimneys-in-architecture"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">their presence persists in nearly every cultural and climatic context</a>, serving as a technical feature and a spatial, atmospheric, and symbolic device. It populates dense city skylines and anchors rural horizons alike, its vertical silhouette as ordinary as a window or a doorframe. This apparent ordinariness is deceptive. The chimney is one of the few architectural components that links<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/887460/cross-ventilation-the-chimney-effect-and-other-concepts-of-natural-ventilation"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> the intimate scale of interior life with the expansive forces of the environment.</a> For architects and designers, the necessity of the chimney presents a choice: to let it recede quietly into the building's functional fabric or to amplify it as a central, expressive element that shapes a project's identity.</p>"
