<p>Scandinavia is shaped by environmental conditions that test both human endurance and architectural ingenuity, with long winters defined by limited daylight, low sun angles, deep snowfall, and cold winds that transform everyday movement, gathering, and habitation into deliberate acts. In this context, architecture is never neutral, and hospitality is never incidental. Buildings that welcome visitors across cities, forests, and coastlines must respond directly to darkness and cold, not by denying them, but by creating interior worlds that offer orientation, warmth, and psychological relief. The act of welcoming in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/scandinavia"">Scandinavia</a> is therefore inseparable from the climate, grounded in the understanding that shelter, light, and human presence are fundamental resources in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/arctic"">Arctic</a> environments.</p>"

<p>London-based architecture practice Mosley Thorold has transformed a Victorian villa into a coherent and materially rich family home. Once remodelled into a flamboyant 1990s party house, the existing property featured a number of bizarre circulation conditions including a poorly detailed mezzanine walkway leading nowhere but breaking up the double height space and views of the garden at the rear. This fragmented the plan, and cluttered the space leaving the house with disoriented circulation unsuitable for family life. The refurbishment sought to restore flow, bring light deeply into the plan and create a home to support everyday life with ease.</p>"
