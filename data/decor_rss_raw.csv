<p>As great stories go, this is one to keep for the records. As a young couple, moving between countries and business clients as one moves between hot chocolate choices, was looking for a place to live in Lisbon, there were several priorities which they felt should be met: spatious, light-filled, not too complex or technically challenging to change/renovate, and something which felt just right for both of them and their child. Now, something which feels right is a common principle when house hunting: you may see 20 prospective houses in one day that seem to fit the briefing, but there&rsquo;s always something missing you cannot truly pinpoint. What no one was waiting, or hoping for, was that you could find something truly special on a street in Lisbon which most Portuguese children grew up seeing on TV (the official Prime Minister Office &ldquo;sits&rdquo; proudly and grandly just opposite the building). So, street-wise it was a win-win situation in terms of a prime location, but there was a setback.</p>"

<p>Adopting sustainable living today, both in design and daily life, is crucial for reducing our environmental footprint and preserving resources for future generations. In design, this means using eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient technologies, and creating spaces that harmonize with natural surroundings. In daily living, sustainability involves mindful consumption, reducing waste, conserving water and energy, and supporting local, ethical products. Together, sustainable design and living form a holistic approach that not only benefits the environment but also enhances health, well-being, and long-term resilience.</p>"
