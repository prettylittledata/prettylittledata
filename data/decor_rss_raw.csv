<p>Beit Hawa, is a <strong>residential project</strong> in Uptown Cairo shaped by the ethos of morphosis,  where the interior architecture functions as an adaptive system rather than a static arrangement. The design moves away from rigid modernist typologies, employing fluid spatial sequences that negotiate transitions between private and public zones. Surfaces and volumes are defined through <strong>layered materiality, integrating light, texture, and structural clarity</strong> into a coherent spatial syntax. <strong>Circulation operates as a generative element</strong>, creating smooth shifts that dissolve conventional boundaries between functions. </p>"
