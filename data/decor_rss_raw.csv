The stadium project covers 13,500 square meters and provides high-quality facilities for both residents' sports activities and top-level football experiences for 8,000 spectators. The stadium meets the main UEFA category 4 requirements, which means it can also be used for example UEFA Europa League and national team matches. Every seating position in the stadium offers an unobstructed view of the entire field. The stadium also accommodates 15,000 people for concerts and other larger events. The stadium is part of a nearly 50,000 square meter hybrid block, complementing the urban structure, which consists of eight interconnected plots, including the football stadium, five residential buildings, a commercial centre, and parking facilities.</p>"
