Though surrounded by urban streets, S House feels closer to an eco-lodge than a city dwelling: a personal rural refuge with gentle touches of modernity.</p>"

One of the earliest large-scale examples of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034993/lighter-and-stronger-composites-are-changing-how-we-build"">composite materials</a> can be found in the Great Wall of China, where stone, clay bricks, and organic fibers such as reeds and willow branches were blended to create a resilient and lasting structure. These early techniques reveal a timeless intuition: distinct materials, when combined thoughtfully, produce properties unattainable by any single element. As the construction sector faces urgent ecological pressures, this intuition is being revisited through the lens of sustainability, with architects and engineers exploring bio-based, recycled, and hybrid composites designed not only for performance but also for circularity and environmental responsibility.</p>"

<p><em>1. Two Temperaments and Two Scales of the Site</em> — The site is an independent old farm located outside a village at the foot of Cangshan Mountain. It is a long, narrow plot oriented east–west, with relatively shallow depth from north to south. To the north lies Shuangyuan Stream, one of the eighteen streams descending from Cangshan. The site is embraced by dense woodland, accompanied by the constant sound of flowing water, creating a secluded and tranquil mountain-forest atmosphere. To the south, the land opens dramatically toward vast farmland, where the nineteen peaks of Cangshan undulate across the horizon in full view, evoking an expansive pastoral scene reminiscent of the poetic line, ""Plucking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, I leisurely glimpse the southern mountains."" The site thus possesses two distinct temperaments: mountain forest and pastoral landscape.</p>"
