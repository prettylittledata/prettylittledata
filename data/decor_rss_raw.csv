The project offers the central Parisian urban space an exciting 110-metre long façade. In this area, the existing concrete structure forms the backdrop for an innovative window system. Its rules are as simple as they are intelligent: simple openings alternate with box-type windows set at different depths in the concrete structure. The elementary moments of the architecture are realised in this way: rhythm, plasticity and self-chosen order come together to form a façade that gives the address and the ""Grande Armée - l1ve"" project a strong physiognomy.</p>"
