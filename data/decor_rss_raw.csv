<p>The main idea behind the house design was to fit an extensive functional program into a long plot bordering the Wielkopolska National Park while maximizing daylight in as many living spaces as possible. This resulted in an elongated form composed of three overlapping, truncated volumes. An equally important goal was dividing the house into lifestyle-based zones so that, despite its size, it would not dominate the surrounding development.

<p>Topology: Hanok is an experiment that develops a topological design workflow using AI to reinterpret the sectional logic and spatial continuity of traditional Korean architecture beyond mere formal reconstruction or structural reproduction. Rather than directly restoring the structural joints or framing system of traditional Hanok, the project focuses on its nonlinear spatial organization, the fluidity of curves, and the continuous transitions between interior and exterior. These characteristics are gradually transformed through an AI-based three-dimensional mapping algorithm that interprets sequences of images as evolving forms.</p>"

<p>A very small bookstore began by the banks of Nanjing's Qinhuai River. The owner's philosophy is to leave the bookstore to its guests as much as possible, providing a warm place for different people at different times. The shop's staff are four adopted stray cats, and the walls are covered with message postcards. The books in the store initially came from the owner's old collection, and as guests increased, new and used books were donated one after another.</p>"
