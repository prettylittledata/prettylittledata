<p>The niche has been a space of visible intention throughout the history of architecture. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ancient-rome"">In ancient Roman architecture</a>, it served as a formal device carved into masonry to display statues, vases, or other objects.

In Florence, the external cavities of Orsanmichele held guild-commissioned statues, while the Uffizi Palace's recesses displayed sculptural works. Whether filled or intentionally left empty, these openings articulated internal and external walls and facades, introduced hierarchy, and provided visual interest, serving as deliberate gestures meant to be seen. </p>"

<p>Architecture has always played a key role in providing shelter and protection for human beings. In prehistoric times, we sought refuge in caves, taking advantage of rock structures for protection against the natural elements and predators. Over time, shelters began to be made from materials found in nature, such as branches, leaves, and animal skins, evolving into more permanent and complex homes, with walls made of stone, bricks or wood, roofs to protect against rain and sun, and doors to control access. As we developed more advanced building skills, we used materials such as wood, stone, and clay and architecture evolved significantly, with the construction of temples, palaces, and fortifications that provided not only shelter but also symbolized power, status, and cultural identity. Even so, our buildings can continue to be seen as shells that protect us from the outside world. </p>"

<p>The European <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/capital-of-culture"">Capital of Culture</a> (ECoC) initiative was launched in 1985 and has, to date, been awarded to more than 60 cities across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/europe"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Europe</a>. It is designed to celebrate and promote cultural diversity on the continent, strengthen European citizens' sense of belonging to a shared cultural space, and foster culture's contribution to urban development. In practice, the designation has proven to be a catalyst for <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/urban-regeneration"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">urban regeneration</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/tourism"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">tourism</a> growth, the strengthening of cities' international profiles, and the improvement of how they are perceived by their own residents. European Capitals of Culture are formally designated four years before the title year, allowing time to plan, prepare, and embed the program within a long-term cultural strategy, establish European partnerships, and ensure that appropriate infrastructure is in place. In 2025, the European Capitals of Culture are the German city of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/chemnitz"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chemnitz </a>and the Slovenian city of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/nova-gorica"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nova Gorica</a>.

<p>As 2025 approaches its end, we look back at an eventful year in the world of interior design. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1024255/10-interior-design-trends-of-2024"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Last year</a>, designers favored reserved, modest approaches, a trend that continued from previous years. The emergence of artificial intelligence generated intense discussions on digital equity and misinformation, which continued into 2025, especially with the topic of the Venice <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/architecture"">Architecture</a> Biennale, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031098/an-unfolding-crisis-with-a-hopeful-outlook-highlights-from-the-projects-exhibited-at-venice-architecture-biennale-2025"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Intelligens</a>. This opened the conversation to the opportunities of digital technologies, attempting a more hopeful outlook. On the other hand, completed interior design projects over the year focused more on the tangible and the pragmatic, with expressed raw materials and an appreciation of history.</p>"

<p>Facing the future while honouring the past, the First Building — housing Stage 1 of the Advanced Manufacturing Readiness Facility (AMRF) — is a collaborative space for government, industry and research to incubate innovative manufacturing projects. As the name implies, it's also the first building designed for the new city of Bradfield and the surrounding area of Aerotropolis, the new urban region set to transform Western Sydney. This unique workplace features a visitor centre and public viewing spaces designed to showcase the real-time building progress of Australia's newest sustainable, connected city. With the design informed by First Nations cultural research and design agency Djinjama, the First Building is a celebration of the meandering and ephemeral water of the Cumberland Plain. It reinstates the site's permeability, collecting and filtering the building and the site's runoff across,  through a richly planted landscape of Cumberland Plain plant species and water features.</p>"
