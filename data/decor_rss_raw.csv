<p>Ramand is, before being a project, a decision—a decision about how a cube can stand on a dual-cornered site without compromising its own geometry and without disregarding the city. The wooden volume is a controlled rotation, neither a formal gesture nor an exaggeration; merely the minimal deviation required for the form to settle into the site. Its geometry does not impose itself on the city, but aligns with it. The wooden skin is not an emotional choice, but a means to soften the hard cube. In a site surrounded by schools, the wood transforms potential seriousness into a conversational tone, aware of the daily gaze of children building their spatial memory.</p>"

<p>This is a private house in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/jakarta"">Jakarta</a>, Indonesia, for a dentist couple with 2 kids. The site is a typical rectangular shape, with both sides and the rear of the house closed off from the neighboring houses, and no ventilation or sunlight can be expected from the side openings. The front façade faces neighboring houses. Despite these challenges, homeowners desire a home that feels open and lush with greenery.</p>"

<p>""We approach the construction of the academies as an opportunity to reactivate community culture. The proposal seeks not only to mend the existing spatial fabric of the city but also trace and reveal the valuable cultural threads embedded in its surroundings. We hope to 'nourish' the future of the district, weaving a more generous urban space and a richer urban life through the architectural design of two new schools.""Meng Yan.</p>"

<p>The design and construction of a project on a steeply sloped terrain in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/shandiz"">Shandiz</a>, adjacent to a seasonal river, with mandatory boundary consideration and a weekend villa program, was assigned to the Abar office. According to regulations, the project was permitted to construct two stories above ground and one basement level. This perpetual regulation has led to repetitive typologies that, on one hand, due to the relentless villa development in the region (in a situation similar to apartment typology), obstruct the view of the valley and distort the natural landscape, and on the other hand, result in stereotypical programs that sometimes have no connection to the user's lifestyle and creating ""possibilities"" in their experience. Despite having previously prepared complete plans, the client requested a redesign due to unmet needs; a matter we analyzed as the ""Difference between In-Town and Out-of-Town Housing"".</p>"
