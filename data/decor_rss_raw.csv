I remember during our first discussion, he mentioned three possibilities: (1) using it as a second residence for himself, with the possibility of his parents occasionally staying there; (2) converting it into his company's office space after three years; or (3) renting it out if no concrete plans were finalized. Therefore, our design process began by systematically analyzing the corresponding relationships between these three different functional requirements and the spatial layout.</p>"

<p>The house is situated on a raised section of the lot, taking advantage of the gentle topography and deep views of the surrounding rural landscape. <strong>The main volume is arranged in a strictly longitudinal manner, aligned with the predominant boundaries of the land and integrating into the terrain through a green platform that follows the natural movement of the soil.</strong> The project is organized around two simultaneous formal operations: a monolithic body of continuous walls in earthy tones that creates a blind front towards the vehicular access and another that is completely permeable towards the landscape; and a support pavilion, with a lighter and more contemporary language, characterized by black carpentry, glass planes, and horizontal sunshades.</p>"

<p>In cities across the world, the relics of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/category/industrial-architecture"">industrial production</a> have become the laboratories of a new urban condition. Warehouses, power plants, and shipyards, once symbols of labor and progress, now stand as vast empty shells, waiting to be reimagined. Rather than erasing these structures, architects are finding <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1013399/contrast-or-harmony-the-aesthetic-of-modern-adaptations-to-historic-buildings"">creative ways to adapt</a> them to contemporary needs, transforming spaces of manufacture into spaces of culture, education, and community life.</p>"
