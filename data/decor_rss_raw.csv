<p><em>From Restroom to Waystation</em> - In recent years, our studio has designed a series of small-scale public restrooms through various competitions and commissions. These designs have incorporated varying degrees of public functions—such as rest areas for sanitation workers, auxiliary spaces, and vending areas—continually transforming the conventional concept of restroom spaces across different contexts. For this project, the client initially requested event storage space for Luke Island. Later, owing to the restroom's favorable location, a temporary office space was incorporated as well. Thus, the public restroom has gradually evolved into a compact, multi-functional public infrastructure, continually expanding the possibilities of design.</p>"

To respect the daily rhythms of three generations and consider their different perceptions of the house, the archetype of the house was designed to foster mutual empathy, and each area of the house was subdivided to ensure the privacy of family members.    </p>"

<p><strong>A Landmark</strong> - The direction of the winds and the path of the sun have determined the floor plan for our project. Protected from cold north-easterly winter winds, nestling up to the forest, the aquatic park opens towards the west to make the most of cool breezes in warm weather. Looking out to the south-west, the aquatic park is bathed in light throughout the year. It is oriented so as to receive as much sunlight as possible in winter, while protecting itself from excessive exposure to the sun through its terraces in summer. Like an origami sculpture, our proposal for the aquatic park resembles an unfolding landscape, culminating at around 35m: it is a built landscape, rising into the sky. The structure is visible from the surrounding area - it becomes a point of reference and a symbol of Villages Nature. This new type of landmark contrasts with the relatively flat topography. It is not an element that has been imposed on the landscape, but an extension of the landscape itself.</p>"
