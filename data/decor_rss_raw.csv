In his interview with <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/louisiana-channel"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Louisiana Channel</a>, Zhu Pei describes architecture as an artistic discipline that, like poetry, relies on openness, imagination, and the creation of new experiences. He argues that great architecture goes beyond functional problem-solving by generating a sense of wonder through its ability to ""invent"" and ""create some new thing, new experience,"" positioning architectural practice as cultural and sensory exploration rather than purely technical production.</p>"

<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/athens"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Athens</a> stands as a city where the legacy of Antiquity is woven into its modern and vibrant urban landscape. World-renowned landmarks of Ancient <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/greece"">Greece</a> like <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/804921/ad-classics-acropolis-athens-ictinus-callicrates-mnesikles-phidias"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the Acropolis and the Parthenon</a> stand as enduring symbols of classical architecture and the city's storied past. These structures reflect the foundational principles of symmetry and balance that have influenced generations of architects and continue to attract scholars from around the world. Yet, Athens is also a thriving metropolis where contemporary architecture coexists with its historical counterparts. Recent developments, led by international firms and local architects, focus on <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/sustainability"">sustainability</a> and innovation while respecting Athens' rich <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cultural-heritage"">cultural heritage</a>. This duality—preserving the old while embracing the new—reflects Greece's broader urban aspirations, making Athens a focal point in global architectural discourse. The city's architectural evolution also extends to its contemporary architecture and interior design scene, which is gaining international recognition.</p>"

Their traditional structure typically relies on the front façade for <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/daylight"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">daylight</a> and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/natural-ventilation"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ventilation</a>. People living there often face the challenge of designing in a space defined by the deep plots, limited street frontage, and close neighboring buildings, restricting natural light and airflow. To counter this fundamental lack of perimeter exposure, Vietnamese architects usually employ several strategies oriented towards internal environmental manipulation. This curated collection explores tube houses under 100 m2, where their small size increased the need for absolute spatial economy and the verticalization of function, which directly influenced design decisions across all projects. </p>"
