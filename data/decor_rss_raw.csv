<p>Designing an interior is, in many ways, an exercise in orchestration. Just as a conductor coordinates instruments, timbres, rhythms, and intensities to compose a coherent piece, the architect brings together materials, color, light, texture, and proportion to define the spatial quality and atmosphere of an environment. None of these decisions operates in isolation: the choice of a surface influences how light is reflected; a given material can shape how a room ages over time; <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com.br/br/935034/como-as-cores-alteram-a-percepcao-dos-espacos-interiores"">color</a>, in turn, directly affects the perception of scale.</p>"
