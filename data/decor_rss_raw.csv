<p>Every year brings new ideas, projects, and shifts in architectural culture, but it also marks the loss of voices that have shaped the discipline across decades. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/architecture"">Architecture</a> moves forward, but it also advances through absence. When figures who helped articulate its language and its ambitions disappear, they leave behind more than completed works or influential texts. Their absence becomes a threshold, a moment in which the discipline pauses to understand what remains, what evolves, and what continues to guide us. These moments of loss remind us that architecture is a long, collective construction, carried not only by those shaping the present but also by those whose visions continue to orient how we think about cities and landscapes.</p>"

<p>The niche has been a space of visible intention throughout the history of architecture. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ancient-rome"">In ancient Roman architecture</a>, it served as a formal device carved into masonry to display statues, vases, or other objects. These recesses animated the walls of temples, bath complexes, and civic buildings, adding rhythm, depth, and focal points to otherwise massive structures. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/802201/ad-classics-roman-pantheon-emperor-hadrian"">The interior spaces of the Pantheon</a> framed statues of gods, and the Baths of Caracalla used similar voids to structure expansive halls. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/renaissance"">By the Renaissance</a>, the niche evolved into a refined architectural frame. In Florence, the external cavities of Orsanmichele held guild-commissioned statues, while the Uffizi Palace's recesses displayed sculptural works. Whether filled or intentionally left empty, these openings articulated internal and external walls and facades, introduced hierarchy, and provided visual interest, serving as deliberate gestures meant to be seen. </p>"

<p>Initially envisioned as a renovation of an existing house, this project evolved into the creation of a new residence, located on the same lot as the old construction. The underlying question of the architectural concept, therefore, is the <strong>balance between the new and the memory of the qualities of the old, so as to make the new house a fulfillment of the clients' desires while also establishing a connection with the past life at the site.</strong> The challenge was to achieve more space and better conditions for the interaction of residents and their guests, both inside and outside the house, while maintaining familiarity with the land and its shelter.</p>"

<p>Architecture has always played a key role in providing shelter and protection for human beings. In prehistoric times, we sought refuge in caves, taking advantage of rock structures for protection against the natural elements and predators. Over time, shelters began to be made from materials found in nature, such as branches, leaves, and animal skins, evolving into more permanent and complex homes, with walls made of stone, bricks or wood, roofs to protect against rain and sun, and doors to control access. As we developed more advanced building skills, we used materials such as wood, stone, and clay and architecture evolved significantly, with the construction of temples, palaces, and fortifications that provided not only shelter but also symbolized power, status, and cultural identity. Even so, our buildings can continue to be seen as shells that protect us from the outside world. </p>"
