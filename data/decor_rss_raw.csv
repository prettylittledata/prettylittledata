<p>The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/pritzker-prize"">Pritzker Prize</a> is the most important award in the field of architecture, awarded to a living architect whose built work ""has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity through the art of architecture."" The Prize rewards individuals, not offices, as happened in 2000 (when the jury selected <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/rem-koolhaas"">Rem Koolhaas</a> instead of his firm <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/oma"">OMA</a>) or in 2016 (with <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/alejandro-aravena"">Alejandro Aravena</a> selected instead of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/elemental"">ELEMENTAL</a>); however, the Prize can also be awarded to multiple individuals working together, as was the case in 2001 (<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/herzog-and-de-meuron"">Herzog &amp; de Meuron</a>), 2010 (Kazuyo Sejima and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ryue-nishizawa"">Ryue Nishizawa</a> from <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/sanaa"">SANAA</a>), and 2017 (Rafael Aranda, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/carme-pigem"">Carme Pigem</a>, and Ramon Vilalta from <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/rcr-arquitectes"">RCR Arquitectes</a>).</p>"

<p>""We know we are not born to die,"" often said Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. ""We are born to continue."" In architecture, this idea of continuity lies at the heart of heritage, not as a static inheritance, but as something that endures, transforms, and is constantly reinterpreted. Yet what continues, and what is allowed to disappear, is never neutral.
