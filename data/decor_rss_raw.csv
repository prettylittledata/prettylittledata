<p>Sa_Yu, located on a hilly site in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/kure"">Kure</a> City, Hiroshima, is an architectural project that redefines the very notion of dwelling by overlapping two temporal layers — renovation and extension. Beginning with the renovation of a 70-year-old wooden one-story house and followed by the addition of a new community wing at the rear of the site, the project evolves from a private home into an architecture of relationships — where people, spaces, and time are gently intertwined.</p>"

<p>Amidst the lush vegetation of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ubatuba"">Ubatuba</a>, São Paulo, the DRN Residence, designed by Pitta Arquitetura, embodies a sophisticated blend of nature, contemporary Brazilian architecture, and sustainability. Spanning 250m² across two floors, the house was designed to offer comfort, spatial fluidity, and a full connection with its natural surroundings. ""The large preserved jackfruit tree on the lot was our starting point. From it, we created an architecture that not only respects but celebrates the existing nature,"" emphasizes Thiago B. Pitta.</p>"

<p>Vertime offers a multifaceted and versatile program: at once a hotel, bar, restaurant, pool, workspace, meeting place, and living space. More than a venue, it is a large villa with a warm, family-oriented spirit. The site's main constraint is also its greatest strength: located at the entrance of the city on a busy boulevard, it enjoys immediate proximity to the Olonna marina and the Vendée Globe pontoon. The challenge was to build a strong relationship with the port while shielding the project from the boulevard's nuisances. A landmark building, Vertime embodies a new and dynamic identity while remaining rooted in the history of seaside architecture.</p>"
