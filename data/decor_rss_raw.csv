<p>Suzhou, as a city, has distinctive regional architectural characteristics. We abstracted three key elements from traditional garden architecture—""pavilions,"" ""corridors,"" and ""views""—and sought to combine these elements with the inherent attributes of the original building. The lower floor of the original structure contained a row of hidden columned corridors, which were downplayed in the 2012 renovation, and the facades were enclosed with glass curtain walls, thereby clearly separating the interior and exterior spaces.</p>"

Originally conceived as modest workshops made with ordinary materials, typical of the fabric of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bagnolet"">Bagnolet</a>, these structures have gradually been converted into family homes. They belong to that fragile typology of small workers' houses—descendants of a precarious form of housing, sometimes close to the shack—whose transformation demands the utmost care. The existing dwelling consisted of a single living space on the ground floor, with two low-ceilinged bedrooms and a bathroom tucked under the eaves, where the height ranged from 1 m to 1.80 m.

Originally commissioned as a display venue for the client's residential developments, the project evolved into a flexible platform accommodating exhibitions, pop-up retail, events, and public gatherings. The key inspiration emerged from an unexpected constraint: the client's request to rotate the main entrance by 37.5 degrees to align with Feng Shui principles.
