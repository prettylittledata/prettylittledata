<p>We planned the new head office for Uchida Shōten, a hardware manufacturer established 160 years ago in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/fujisawa"">Fujisawa</a> City, Kanagawa Prefecture. The surrounding area flourished as Fujisawa-juku, the sixth post town along the Tōkaidō road during the Edo period, a town lined with inns, teahouses, and merchants. Traces of this history remain in places, and the site itself is characterised by its narrow, elongated townhouse-style plot.</p>"

<p>""Ay"" (硋) is a type of black-glazed ceramic indigenous to the mountainous region of northeastern Fujian, positioned between pottery and porcelain. The site is a century-old traditional Ay kiln built against a hillside, forming an elongated, sloped ""dragon kiln."" Situated at the village entrance and flanked by open fields, the site exhibits characteristics of a rural handicraft compound: the kiln sits at the center, an old rammed-earth house to the west, a modern brick-and-concrete dwelling to the east, and several stone outbuildings scattered around.</p>"
