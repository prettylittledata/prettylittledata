The wonders of nature and human artifice are presented here almost simultaneously. The client's brief was clear: this pavilion must offer a view of the sea. This inspired a broader aspiration: to create a ""space"" where one can enjoy 360-degree panoramic views. Concurrently, we set ourselves a requirement: the presence of the architecture must not disturb the natural ground.</p>"

<p>Laoyuting Pavilion is one of the invited projects of the 2024 Dianchi Art Season: ""Home and Future"". It is located on the southern side of the Water-Forest Art Zone in the Laoyu River Wetland Park at Dianchi Lake. After its completion, it first served as the entrance to the Dianchi Art Festival, and after the festival, the pavilion was permanently preserved as a spatial hint for entering the wetland park, as well as a resting place for visitors. This wetland, filled with groves of bald cypress along the edge of Dianchi Lake, is in fact part of the city's water-purification infrastructure—the final stage of natural filtration before water enters the lake. It is home to many small fish, and city dwellers often come here during leisure time to catch fish, hence the name Laoyu River Wetland. As a pavilion where people rest while fishing, it naturally came to be known as the Laoyuting Pavilion.</p>"

<p>This week's news reflects architecture's simultaneous engagement with cultural reflection, professional legacy, and the material realities of building cities. The passing of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/frank-gehry""> Frank Gehry</a> prompted a broader reassessment of late 20th- and early 21st-century architectural practice, while<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036740/shigeru-ban-named-recipient-of-the-2026-aia-gold-medal""> Shigeru Ban's selection as the recipient of the 2026 AIA Gold Medal</a> brought renewed attention to socially driven design and the profession's public responsibilities. These milestones unfolded alongside wider conversations sparked by<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036816/on-human-rights-day-perspectives-on-architecture-equity-housing-access-and-safety-worldwide""> Human Rights Day, examining architecture's role in equity, housing access, and safety worldwide</a>, and forward-looking discussions setting the architectural agenda for 2026 through major international events and cultural programs. At the scale of the built environment, these themes are echoed in three projects shaping future urban conditions:<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/powerhouse-company""> Powerhouse Company</a>'s transformation of a former limestone quarry into a mixed-use neighbourhood in Bærum, near<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/oslo""> Oslo</a>; the groundbreaking of Riverside Wharf, a hospitality-led development contributing to the regeneration of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/miami""> Miami</a>'s River District; and<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/foster-plus-partners""> Foster + Partners</a>' approved retrofit of 1 St James's Square in<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/london""> London</a>, focused on structural retention and long-term urban resilience.</p>"

<p>Recent federal discussions in the United States regarding the <a href=""https://www.aia.org/resource-center/federal-professional-degree-definition-excludes-architecture-member-briefing?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">reclassification of architecture as a degree that no longer carries professional standing </a>have intensified the need to articulate the purpose and structure of accredited programs. These political conditions have produced a moment in which the internal coherence of architectural curricula intersects with broader questions on public welfare, technical accountability, and the ethical responsibilities that define professional expertise. Architectural education in the United States requires an examination that acknowledges <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/379514/does-architectural-education-create-a-barrier-to-the-profession?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">its internal pedagogical logic and the external pressures that shape its contemporary reception.</a></p>"
