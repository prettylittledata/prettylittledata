<p>The Street is envisioned as a <strong>community house</strong> designed for a plotted residential development of modest 1500 sq.ft. plots, where each homeowner builds their own dream home. As urban land becomes increasingly expensive, many families are moving to the city's peripheries. This transition, however, often comes with a loss of the vibrant social life found in traditional neighbourhoods. The Street seeks to bridge this gap by offering a shared space that complements the Indian way of life, rooted in <strong>community interaction, cultural continuity, and everyday connection.</strong></p>"

<p>The bold use of frustum-shaped metal exterior walls reflects a contemporary aesthetic. The design initially proposes light steel structures with fiber cement cladding—using modern materials and construction to echo traditional methods, a thoughtful approach. However, we suggest adopting more common concrete structures for the exterior walls to lower technical barriers, enhance weather resistance against wind and snow, and achieve a simpler, more rustic expression that contrasts sharply with the metal roof. We also recommend adding more semi-outdoor spaces in each dwelling to create additional viewing highlights for visitors.</p>"

<p>After its completion in late 2023, Tianlin Park1 designed by VIASCAPE has been receiving positive public feedbacks. Coincidentally, teachers from Xuhui Science and Technology Kindergarten2 visited Tianlin park multiple times during 2024–2025, both spontaneously and in organized groups. They found that the natural habitat design, which integrated into the holistic landscape experience, closely aligns with their ongoing early childhood nature education program. This led to an initial contact with VIASCAPE through connections, in which they expressed a strong interest in collaborating on the landscape enhancement of their kindergarten's Wending campus (hereinafter referred to as ""the kindergarten""). Following this initial contact in April 2025, VIASCAPE design team was invited to give a tour guide for the kindergarten teachers, introducing the landscape-oriented natural habitat design in Tianlin Park. During the visit, design team also elaborated on the concept and value of ""urban habitat,"" an integrated approach that combines natural, vibrant, and cultural elements.
