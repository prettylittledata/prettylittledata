<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/public-space"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Public space</a> is often understood as belonging to no one in particular, collectively accessible yet institutionally maintained, yet a growing number of initiatives are challenging this assumption by testing shared management and distributed ownership models.

It serves as a supplementary public space for citizens and tourists to relax by the river and for events. The concept originates from the site; the high-pile dock, shipbuilding cranes, pump house, and flood control wall all evoke memories of the industrial history of the Zhonghua Shipyard. The super-scale shipyard machinery and infrastructure on the site presents a state of being static yet potentially dynamic. We hoped to extend this site character into the design of the Floating Cabin, transforming it into a contemporary architectural space that transcends conventional types. ""Cabin"" refers to the mechanical aesthetics of the shipyard industry, and also to a functional space that accommodates variable content; while ""floating"" represents a suspended structural state.</p>"

The current green seems to have originated accidentally. An accidental green area due to the absence of buildings, not laid out, not functional. Recently, the city decided to divide the park into parts again, and to complete the building block again.</p>"

<p>In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/contemporary-architecture"">contemporary architectural</a> discourse, scale is often mistaken for influence. Large firms, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/built-projects"">landmark projects</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/mixed-use-architecture"">master-planned developments</a> dominate visibility.

<p>The project concerns the first house in a row of four terraced dwellings, built along a narrow plot. Originally conceived as modest workshops made with ordinary materials, typical of the fabric of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bagnolet"">Bagnolet</a>, these structures have gradually been converted into family homes. They belong to that fragile typology of small workers' houses—descendants of a precarious form of housing, sometimes close to the shack—whose transformation demands the utmost care. The existing dwelling consisted of a single living space on the ground floor, with two low-ceilinged bedrooms and a bathroom tucked under the eaves, where the height ranged from 1 m to 1.80 m. Following the birth of a second child, the clients wished to alter the roof to expand the attic space.</p>"
