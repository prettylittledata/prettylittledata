In the project area, which also includes a steel manufacturing workshop, the main purpose was to highlight the steel, which forms the structural system of the building, as a design element. The archive is a completely self-enclosed program, the museum is a completely extroverted program, and the office acts as an organism that is partly closed and partly open. One of the main parameters in the design was forming a mass in a single structure with this different type of program.</p>"

<p>Earlier this month, news of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036716/frank-gehry-visionary-architect-of-the-bilbao-guggenheim-dies-at-96?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">Frank Gehry's passing</a> prompted an outpouring of tributes to the architect behind flamboyant <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034567/lina-ghotmeh-on-memory-museums-and-the-archaeology-of-the-future?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">museums</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/970134/from-hotels-to-concert-halls-8-distinctive-projects-with-original-bathrooms?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">concert halls</a>, and sinuous residential complexes. Rather than revisit that well-charted terrain, it is worth pausing on a more contemplative work in his oeuvre: <a href=""https://www.maggiescentre.org.hk/en/home?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">Maggie's Cancer Caring Centre in Hong Kong</a>.

<p>Laoyuting Pavilion is one of the invited projects of the 2024 Dianchi Art Season: ""Home and Future"". It is located on the southern side of the Water-Forest Art Zone in the Laoyu River Wetland Park at Dianchi Lake. After its completion, it first served as the entrance to the Dianchi Art Festival, and after the festival, the pavilion was permanently preserved as a spatial hint for entering the wetland park, as well as a resting place for visitors. This wetland, filled with groves of bald cypress along the edge of Dianchi Lake, is in fact part of the city's water-purification infrastructure—the final stage of natural filtration before water enters the lake. It is home to many small fish, and city dwellers often come here during leisure time to catch fish, hence the name Laoyu River Wetland. As a pavilion where people rest while fishing, it naturally came to be known as the Laoyuting Pavilion.</p>"
