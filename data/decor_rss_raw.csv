<p>In the coastal and jungle regions of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/costa-rica/page/1"">Costa Rica</a>, high humidity and intense solar radiation dictate an <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/928807/design-guidelines-for-contemporary-tropical-architecture?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">architectural strategy</a> centered on permeability rather than enclosure.

<p>At the entrance to the Po Valley, in the province of Cuneo, a house with a simple, compact profile reveals itself gradually. The construction does not appear to flaunt striking gestures, but rather blends discreetly among its neighbors — tall apartment blocks, clumsy detached houses, a constellation of buildings without particular quality. Yet appearances are deceiving. A radical transformation, partly concealed within its own volume, lies at the origin of ErranteArchitetture's project for Casa BM: an <strong>intervention that dismantles the existing structure to generate new spatial configurations and distinct atmospheres.</strong> It is an apparently paradoxical operation, conducted in the spirit of artistic research and self-construction practices.</p>"

<p>The Ian Potter Museum of Art, Education and Programs Centre is a significant expansion of the original museum at the University of Melbourne's <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/parkville"">Parkville</a> campus, extending into the heritage-listed 1930s Physics Annex. Connecting with both the campus and a major road leading out of the city centre, the concave, mirrored, polished stainless-steel portal extends from the original façade, marking the museum's presence and creating a multi-faceted public interface.</p>"

<p>Moon Bay Waterfall marks the threshold of Mount Wuyi National Park and is the first landscape encountered upon entering the park. In 2023, CLAB Architects was commissioned to construct a viewing platform at this site. The waterfall originates from an artificial dam built in 1979 for hydrological regulation. Crescent-shaped in plan, it lends Moon Bay its name. Over decades of interaction between human intervention and natural processes, the dam has been fully absorbed into its environment. Upstream, the water settles into a calm surface; downstream, erosion exposes massive river stones. Together, these elements form a place in the phenomenological sense—close to the ground, yet acting as a center that brings sky, mountain, and water into relation.</p>"
