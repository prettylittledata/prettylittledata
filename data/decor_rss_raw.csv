<p>DLCA HOUSE reflects the principles of contemporary Mexican architecture through a deliberate balance of material contrasts, spatial clarity, and contextual awareness. Spanning 496 m&sup2; across three levels, the residence is oriented north-south to optimize climatic conditions, establishing a straightforward and functional architectural language. The exterior is defined by a concrete monolith, whose stark presence is softened by warm wood cladding on the ground floor. This material contrast creates a layered composition that distinguishes programmatic elements while highlighting the orthogonal design, where vertical and horizontal planes are carefully articulated in both the fa&ccedil;ade and interior spaces.</p>"
