The existing structure, dating back to 1616, originally functioned as a country house and later served for many years as a café-restaurant. Over time, the building underwent numerous renovations and alterations, largely aimed at concealing damage caused by ageing and earlier interventions rather than restoring its architectural integrity. Extensive paved terraces surrounded the building, providing additional seating during the summer months.</p>"

<p>Perched above the cliffs of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/crimea"">Crimea</a>, the Druzhba Thermal Sanatorium appears less as a building than as a landed spacecraft. Its circular forms, suspended decks, and spiraling ramps evoke a scene from Andrei Tarkovsky's <em>Solaris</em> (1972), where architecture and psychology merge into a single landscape. Built between 1978 and 1985 by <a href=""https://www.archinform.net/entry.htm?ID=dojk5i1kc6tt5uimraeal74gda&amp;loc=%2Farch%2F108377.htm&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">Igor Vasilevsky</a>, the complex was conceived as a thermal resort for workers of the oil industry, part of the Soviet Union's extensive network of sanatoria dedicated to health and recreation.</p>"
