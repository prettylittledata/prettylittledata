<p>The main idea behind the house design was to fit an extensive functional program into a long plot bordering the Wielkopolska National Park while maximizing daylight in as many living spaces as possible. This resulted in an elongated form composed of three overlapping, truncated volumes. An equally important goal was dividing the house into lifestyle-based zones so that, despite its size, it would not dominate the surrounding development.
