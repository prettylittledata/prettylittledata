It serves as a supplementary public space for citizens and tourists to relax by the river and for events. The concept originates from the site; the high-pile dock, shipbuilding cranes, pump house, and flood control wall all evoke memories of the industrial history of the Zhonghua Shipyard. The super-scale shipyard machinery and infrastructure on the site presents a state of being static yet potentially dynamic. We hoped to extend this site character into the design of the Floating Cabin, transforming it into a contemporary architectural space that transcends conventional types. ""Cabin"" refers to the mechanical aesthetics of the shipyard industry, and also to a functional space that accommodates variable content; while ""floating"" represents a suspended structural state.</p>"

<p>Suzhou, as a city, has distinctive regional architectural characteristics. We abstracted three key elements from traditional garden architecture—""pavilions,"" ""corridors,"" and ""views""—and sought to combine these elements with the inherent attributes of the original building. The lower floor of the original structure contained a row of hidden columned corridors, which were downplayed in the 2012 renovation, and the facades were enclosed with glass curtain walls, thereby clearly separating the interior and exterior spaces.</p>"
