Stores, showrooms, and branded interiors often operate as laboratories where architects experiment with form, material, and light, translating corporate narratives into spatial experiences. In this context, the architect emerges as a mediator of desire, shaping atmospheres that guide perception, evoke emotion, and subtly influence behavior. This role reveals a complex intersection between <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/884086/hate-contemporary-architecture-blame-economics-not-architects"">design and capitalism</a>: the creation of spaces that sell not only products, but also aspirations, lifestyles, and cultural meaning.
