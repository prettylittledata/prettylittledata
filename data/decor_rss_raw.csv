<p>As environmental accountability becomes embedded in design culture, the building envelope is being reconsidered not just as a protective skin, but as an active energy-producing surface. Treating solar technology as a material rather than an attachment reshapes how architecture is conceived and detailed. Color, texture, rhythm, and assembly become inseparable from performance. Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) operate within this expanded definition of materiality. By integrating solar technology into façades and rainscreens from the earliest project stages, architects can reduce redundancy, align energy goals with design intent, and rethink how envelopes are composed. Yet translating this ambition into buildable systems requires technical precision and construction intelligence.</p>"

<p><em>Project Background and Site Understanding</em> — The site is located on an elevated riverside plot along the Wuxi River in Wangcunkou Town, Suichang County, Zhejiang Province, descending toward a natural stone riverbank. Historically, it served as an important water transportation dock during the Ming and Qing dynasties and later became an active area of revolutionary history. With the shift of time, the site has remained abandoned for many years. Although the village is structured along the river, most of the riverbank is occupied by residential buildings, leaving little public access to the water. The renovated house sits between a small plaza and the riverbank, and its enclosed condition had long blocked villagers' approach to the water. The design goal therefore emerged clearly: to transform ""separation"" into ""connection"" by renewing the old house and releasing an openly accessible waterfront public space for the community.</p>"

<p>Aqqu Central Café is an architectural regeneration project that restores a legendary landmark of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/almaty"">Almaty</a> from the 1960s.

The design is entirely dedicated to restoring the city's visual memory through a modern interpretation of 1960s modernism. The conceptual starting point for the project was a vibrant swan mosaic created by local artist Anastasia Zharko. Its bright palette of blue, yellow, red, and burgundy served as the foundation for every color selection throughout the interior.</p>"

<p>When we enter a <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/museum"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">museum</a>, walk through a historic center, or review a country’s list of protected heritage sites, we rarely think about the process behind those <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/971945/architecture-and-unesco-rethinking-preservation-and-cultural-heritage"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">choices</a>. <a href=""https://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/PortoArte/article/view/27940/16550?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Who decided, on behalf of all of us</a>, that certain objects, places, and architectures <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1038647/when-do-buildings-begin-to-matter-rethinking-heritage-in-local-time"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">deserved to be preserved and disseminated,</a> while others were discarded?</p>"

Our brief was twofold: create an interior cabinet for storage and an exterior canopy for shelter. From the outset, we saw these as a single architectural problem rather than two separate tasks.</p>"

<p>As the primary interface between interior spaces and the external environment, facades play a central role in both the performance and architectural expression of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/buildings"">buildings</a>. Increasingly, they are no longer seen as static envelopes, but as active mediators between climate, energy, use, and aesthetic.
