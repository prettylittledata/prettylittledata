<p>Liberation Museum of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/manisa"">Manisa</a> (MKM) was conceived as a memory space to convey the civilian popular movement that developed independently of central authority in the region of Manisa between 1918 and 1923. The design merges the traces of the surviving load-bearing masonry, stone, and brick structures post-fire with Manisa's local brick tradition, which stretches back to archaic periods. The 14 independent brick chambers, constructed entirely using the load-bearing technique, present different historical moments as a sequential experience.</p>"

<p>Located in the municipality of Saint-Ferréol, Québec, the secondary residence presents itself as a retreat removed from the everyday, a place of escape that lives to the calm rhythm of the forest. The existing building bears the imprint of architecture inspired by Austrian chalets: a compact elevated volume, a light base, generous roof overhangs, and a strong presence of wood. These qualities, highlighted and carefully revealed, guided the integration and design of the extension.</p>"
