What was once <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034866/from-overlooked-waste-to-circular-opportunity-plastics-in-construction?ad_campaign=normal-tag"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">considered waste is now revealing itself as a dormant architectural archive</a>, an urban ecosystem of materials waiting to be reclaimed, revalued, or reimagined. Within this shift, architects are beginning to play a radically different role. Not only as designers of buildings, but also as orchestrators of the flows that sustain them.</p>"

<p>Located in the prestigious diplomatic district of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/rabat"">Rabat</a>, the new Royal Thai Embassy sits on a strategic site in the country's capital. Though the initial brief was to rehabilitate an existing dilapidated villa, we realized that with a similar investment in time and budget, it would be preferable to demolish the existing building and construct a new one that would be better adapted to its role as an embassy. </p>"

<p>We designed and built a two-story wooden house for a family raising children in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/date"">Date</a> City, Fukushima Prefecture. During discussions with the clients, their initial wish was to ""live in a house with a dirt-floored space."" The husband works in agriculture and wanted a place to cook vegetables he grew himself and share meals with his family. They wanted a space outside the house to temporarily store and wash vegetables harvested from their fields. They wanted a place where their young children could play freely and enjoy life. From these key ideas, the house-building journey began with creating a large earthen-floored space that connects the inside and outside, becoming the heart of the family's life.</p>"

<p>Architectural space has long been framed by permanence: rooms for fixed functions, facades that clearly define where exterior ends and interior begins. Yet contemporary life is defined by overlap and transition: between work and living, interior and exterior, privacy and community. Spatial needs evolve continually, demanding architecture that can respond, adapt, and remain relevant over time. </p>"

<p>Manor Mirage is located in the wilderness of Huai'an County, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/zhangjiakou"">Zhangjiakou</a> City, Hebei Province, adjacent to the Zhangbei Grassland. Its design core lies in the lightweight translation and functional regeneration of the abandoned concrete bridge on the site. With ""mirage"" as a metaphor, the project, on the basis of respecting the site memory and grassland culture, constructs a spatial form with both a sense of disappearance and transience through low-intervention strategies, realizing the dialectical coexistence of architecture and nature, tradition and modernity.</p>"
