<p>Long before architecture took the form of walls, roofs, or cities,<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/962817/fire-and-architecture-how-fire-shapes-the-design-of-buildings?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> it gathered people around fire</a>. The simple fire pit was one of humanity's earliest spatial devices: a place for warmth, food, storytelling, and ritual. Around it, space took shape through proximity rather than enclosure, through shared presence rather than prescribed use. The fire organized bodies in a circle, fostered alliances, and turned survival into collective life. Today, this ancestral logic persists: architecture has the potential of bringing people together not by commanding how they gather, but by creating the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1037387/architecture-that-shapes-health-lessons-of-design-and-well-being-in-2025?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">conditions that make togetherness possible</a>.</p>"

<p>Lotus Clubhouse was conceived as a living organism that breathes in harmony with the terrain and surrounding natural environment. Rather than standing as an isolated architectural object, the building appears to emerge from the ground itself, shaped by natural slopes, layers of vegetation, and its orientation toward the lake. From the earliest design stages, the project was defined as a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and local context. As a result, the boundaries between built form and nature gradually dissolve, allowing the clubhouse to exist simultaneously as architecture and landscape, a place of shelter for people and an extended habitat for nature.</p>"

Within the site, portions of the original village dwellings have been preserved, reconstructed, or adapted and incorporated into the museum's exhibition spaces, serving as thematic galleries or support facilities, thereby allowing elements of the site's historical fabric to be sustained. The main body of the museum is composed of two parts.
