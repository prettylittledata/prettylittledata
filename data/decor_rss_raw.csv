<p>Beit Hawa, is a <strong>residential project</strong> in Uptown Cairo shaped by the ethos of morphosis,  where the interior architecture functions as an adaptive system rather than a static arrangement. The design moves away from rigid modernist typologies, employing fluid spatial sequences that negotiate transitions between private and public zones. Surfaces and volumes are defined through <strong>layered materiality, integrating light, texture, and structural clarity</strong> into a coherent spatial syntax. <strong>Circulation operates as a generative element</strong>, creating smooth shifts that dissolve conventional boundaries between functions. </p>"

Years of habit had formed a vertical functional zoning: the second floor, connecting to the vehicular road in the southern community, served as the main entrance, housing the living room, garage, guest room, balcony, and atrium; the first floor, backing against the hillside retaining wall and facing the rear garden, connected to the pedestrian secondary entrance and consisted of the dining room, kitchen, and entertainment room; the third floor was the most private sleeping area, containing two bedrooms and a study.

<p>Visits to the site sparked the desire to build a house that would blend into the landscape. We found large rocks on the land, which is protected by dense vegetation, that protruded from the steep slope of the southern portion. There's also a lake nearby, accessible via a short trail through the woods.</p>"

<p>The project involves the restoration of a castle, designated as a Cultural Heritage Site, located in the Chera-Sot de <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/chera"">Chera</a> Natural Park, Valencia. <strong>This 12th-century structure, from the Almohad period, fell into ruin over successive historical periods and was definitively abandoned at the beginning of the 19th century.</strong></p>"

<p>The project transforms a former neighborhood restaurant in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/watermael-boitsfort"">Watermael-Boitsfort</a> (Brussels, BE) into a set of adaptable dwellings, rooted in the heritage value of the existing building. In an uncertain ecological and economic context, reprogramming such a building for a single, fixed use appears increasingly inadequate. The project therefore rejects a deterministic approach in favor of a restrained, legible, and forward-looking architectural strategy.</p>"

<p>In some languages, the very word for <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/immeuble?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">building</a> refers to its immovability. The discipline of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/structural-engineering"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">engineering</a> related to buildings is referred to as <em>statics</em>. Thus, architecture is closely related to the fixed and the immobile. And yet, for millions of nomadic people around the world, shelters must be of a light and distinctly movable structure, while home is the vast landscape in which they reside. Such lifestyles, which carry centuries of traditions, are constantly under threat from the pull factors of sedentary life in towns and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cities"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">cities</a>.

<p><em>A Millennium Cross-Section on a Living Street</em> — This project originates from a major breakthrough in the archaeological discovery and conservation practice at Bastion No. 11 of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/jingzhou"">Jingzhou</a> City Wall. Since 2016, this section of the ancient wall had been listed for emergency conservation due to foundation settlement and structural cracking. During the repair process, a stratified structure of ""walls built upon walls,"" spanning the Five Dynasties, Song, Ming, and Qing periods, was uncovered. This led to the approval by the National Cultural Heritage Administration for systematic archaeological excavation.</p>"
