<p>For decades, musical performances and other non-religious public gatherings were strictly controlled by the Saudi government. This practically confined most forms of public cultural expression, especially music, to the privacy of homes and gated communities. By 2016, the country witnessed wholesale social, cultural, and economic transformations to wean off religious extremism, improve the quality of life, and attract foreign investment. In 2019, a small group of entrepreneurs established Middle Beast (widely known by the acronym MDL Beast) to launch a series of large-scale music festivals across the country. This historic moment represented a dramatic shift in common attitudes towards public gatherings. More importantly, it is considered the first time that the hidden underground culture of electronic music was accessible to the public.</p>"

<p>Amid ongoing global discussions on climate adaptation and resilient urban development brought into sharper focus by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036340/cop30-outcomes-for-the-built-environment-from-sustainable-cooling-to-climate-adaptation-commitments"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the outcomes of COP30</a>, this week's architecture news illustrates how cities worldwide are rethinking their built environments. From Venice, where <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/venice-architecture-biennale-2025"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the 19th Architecture Biennale</a> concluded with debates on material use and long-term cultural impact, to international awards foregrounding regenerative and socially responsive design, the conversation around architecture is increasingly intertwined with planetary priorities. Major urban interventions, from <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/thessaloniki"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thessaloniki</a>'s seafront redevelopment and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/rio-de-janeiro"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rio de Janeiro</a>'s new public library, to <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/abu-dhabi"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Abu Dhabi</a>'s Natural History Museum and a civic stadium in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/birmingham"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Birmingham</a>, demonstrate how multiple cities are addressing mobility, heritage, density, and climate resilience. Additional plans, such as <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/mantua"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mantua</a>'s ecological urban strategy, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/utrecht"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Utrecht</a>'s elevated landscape above transport networks, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol's redesigned landside mobility system, further reflect a transition toward integrated, people-centred urban frameworks that prioritize environmental performance, public space, and long-term territorial stewardship.</p>"

<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/modernism"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Modernism</a> has a long history in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/morocco/page/1"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Morocco</a>. Being close to <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/europe"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Europe</a> and under French Protectorate rule, it kept pace with architectural developments in the movement. Its relative peace after the Second World War further strengthened its role as some European architects sought a hub for new ideas. Architects in independent Morocco adopted Modernism as they were tasked to build the infrastructure of a new nation. The architect Jean-François Zevaco, born in Morocco to French parents, practiced across these formative periods, developing his own expressive version of modern architecture.</p>"
