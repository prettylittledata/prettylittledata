<p>Fowóralé II extends the calm, coastal character of the original building, completed in 2024 along the quiet, sun-dappled sands of Ilashe. <strong>This extension unfolds as a natural continuation of the first phase, with spaces thoughtfully oriented to capture natural light, coastal breezes, and views of the shoreline. </strong>The design balances areas for communal gathering with quieter moments of retreat, supporting everyday activity in harmony with the sea. In this phase, the extension gains a more outward-facing dimension to meet the client's evolving program, introducing spaces for dining, connection, and curated social experiences while maintaining the structure's balance and order and adding a warmer, more inviting character. Rather than appearing as an addition, the extension feels like a gentle widening of the building's spatial and experiential boundaries.</p>"

<p>Behind layers of plaster, paint, and finishes lies an intricate network of pipes, electrical conduits, beams, and other structural elements that make a building function and stand, yet remain invisible to the everyday eye. Within these layers, traces of different periods accumulate: replaced systems, improvised adaptations, and technical solutions that once responded to specific contexts and urgencies. In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/adaptive-reuse"">adaptive reuse</a>, the greatest challenge often begins before construction even starts, which is understanding what lies within when little or no reliable documentation exists. During a renovation, pleasant or unpleasant surprises are inevitable. The unexpected is part of the process, but it also represents cost, delay, and risk factors that often discourage investors and professionals from engaging in this type of project.</p>"

<p>Is it possible to restore a way of life? Can it be done with the same delicacy as recovering an ancient object?</p>"
