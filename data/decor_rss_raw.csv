In designing a house for a family of five suited to this place, the image I had in mind was that of a traditional Japanese house. Timber framing is exposed through <em>shinkabe</em> construction (<em>shinkabe</em>: a traditional Japanese method in which columns and beams are expressed), resulting in a stripped-down appearance free of excess.

One of the earliest large-scale examples of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034993/lighter-and-stronger-composites-are-changing-how-we-build"">composite materials</a> can be found in the Great Wall of China, where stone, clay bricks, and organic fibers such as reeds and willow branches were blended to create a resilient and lasting structure. These early techniques reveal a timeless intuition: distinct materials, when combined thoughtfully, produce properties unattainable by any single element. As the construction sector faces urgent ecological pressures, this intuition is being revisited through the lens of sustainability, with architects and engineers exploring bio-based, recycled, and hybrid composites designed not only for performance but also for circularity and environmental responsibility.</p>"
