<p>With a civic landscape doubling as ecological infrastructure, the 250,000 m² mixed-use urban regeneration project sets a precedent for future climate adaptation in Southeast Asian cities. Snøhetta, in collaboration with A49 Architects, has unveiled its most extensive urban regeneration project in Asia for Magnolia Quality Development Corporation (MQDC). Located in the South Sukhumvit — one of Bangkok's most vibrant cultural and innovation hubs — Cloud 11 is a mixed-use development defined by a central courtyard that serves as both ecological infrastructure and cultural park. The design harnesses the power of landscape to create an urban oasis that champions environmental resilience and community wellbeing. Rooted in its surrounding context, the project is inspired by the layered conditions of Bangkok's shophouse streets, elevated sky train lines, and emerging high-rise towers. By sculpting the architecture from the space between these layers, Cloud 11 forms a new ""in-between"" realm. The result is a generous public landscape that bridges scales, reconnecting the neighborhoods, offering a vibrant civic space for all.</p>"

<p>How often are irregularly shaped plots dismissed when buying land? In many towns, the land is subdivided into perfect rectangles for construction, leaving plots with unconventional shapes—sharp angles and awkward dimensions—undesirable and in low demand. The architecture studio Tropical Tones, however, has set an example by tackling this challenge. This Tropical Modern residence in Azhiyur Village in Kozhikode, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/kerala"">Kerala</a>, is built on an 8-cent trapezoidal plot within the Coastal Regulations Zone, just 100 metres from the National Highway.

<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/collective-living"">Collective housing</a> remains one of the most active areas for <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/unbuilt"">unbuilt</a> architectural exploration, revealing how architects are rethinking domestic life, density, and shared living across different cultural and environmental contexts. In this curated <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/unbuilt"">Unbuilt</a> edition, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/contact"">submitted by the ArchDaily community, </a>the selected proposals investigate new forms of dwelling that span mobile units, vertical developments, adaptive reuse, and landscape-driven residential clusters. Rather than treating <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/housing"">housing</a> as a purely functional container, these projects position it as a social and spatial framework that shapes everyday life, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/community"">community</a> ties, and long-term urban resilience.</p>"

Established over the old Igarap&eacute; das Almas &mdash; now a canal about 1.2 km long in the central median of Avenida Visconde de Sousa Franco &mdash; <strong>the project recaptures the hydric identity that historically structured the Reduto basin and which, throughout the urbanization process, has been buried under fragmented and functional logics.</strong></p>"
