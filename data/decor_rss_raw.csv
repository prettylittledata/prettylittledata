<p>Set on the edge of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/mediterranean"">Mediterranean</a> and shaped by centuries of continuous occupation, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/naples"">Naples</a> is a city where architecture is inseparable from time.

<p>Shell House is a residential project that reimagines the traditional courtyard home through the language of softness, light, and spatial layering. Located on a corner plot in Kuwait, the design draws inspiration from the organic morphology of a shell—protective on the outside, open and nurturing on the inside. At its heart lies a lush, intimate courtyard with a pool, visible from the home's primary living spaces and home gym, establishing the courtyard as both a literal and conceptual anchor. The architecture wraps gently around this core, with a series of soft curves that define the building's form and guide the spatial experience throughout.</p>"
