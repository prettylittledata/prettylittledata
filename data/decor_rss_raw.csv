<p>In some languages, the very word for <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/immeuble?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">building</a> refers to its immovability. The discipline of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/structural-engineering"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">engineering</a> related to buildings is referred to as <em>statics</em>. Thus, architecture is closely related to the fixed and the immobile.

The original structure is a three-story, cube-shaped building with a frame system—consistent with most structures in the park, it abuts the main thoroughfare directly, enclosed on all sides, and presents an almost collisional interface with the street front, lacking any form of buffer zone. The design brief calls for the transformation of this cubic building into a garment design office capable of accommodating approximately 100 occupants. The high occupancy density, combined with the inherently strong functional attributes of the office typology, introduces a pronounced sense of spatial density to the site.

<p>The Lefferts Manor section of the Prospect Lefferts Gardens Historic District in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/brooklyn"">Brooklyn</a> is a remarkably well-preserved series of historic houses from the late 19th to early 20th-century: stately and large enough for families, the interiors can pose challenges to contemporary living, with outdated building systems, a lack of storage, and dark, divided spaces. New owners of a corner house—a couple with backgrounds in marketing and journalism, raising two children—came to ABA for something ""clean, bright, natural, highly purposeful/functional, and kid-friendly."" While the exterior of the building is protected by landmark status, ABA approached the interiors not as restoration, but as reinvention. Looking to retain character while minimizing complexity, ABA suggested unifying spaces and bringing calm and simplicity by using as few ingredients as possible, consistently throughout. In doing so, the design process simultaneously references the house's historic form, borrows from early modernists like Adolph Loos in material usage, and unapologetically eliminates detail.</p>"
