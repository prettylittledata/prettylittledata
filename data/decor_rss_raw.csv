<p>""We know we are not born to die,"" often said Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. ""We are born to continue."" In architecture, this idea of continuity lies at the heart of heritage, not as a static inheritance, but as something that endures, transforms, and is constantly reinterpreted. Yet what continues, and what is allowed to disappear, is never neutral. Decisions about preservation are shaped by power, memory, and value, raising a fundamental question for contemporary practice: who defines what is worth carrying forward, and for whom?</p>"

<p>""In various regions of the planet, nature imposes adverse conditions on the human body. In these places, designing a building is almost like creating a garment: an artifact that protects and offers comfort. This challenge requires technological performance that must be combined with aesthetics. Making human beings feel good involves more than just meeting notions of comfort and safety; it's also a question of working with spaces in their symbolic and perceptual dimensions."" This is the beginning of the description for the design of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/946070/comandante-ferraz-antarctic-station-studio-41"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brazilian Antarctic Station in Antarctica, by Estúdio 41</a>, located on the Keller Peninsula, where the surrounding sea freezes for around six to seven months of the year, where everything and everyone arrives by plane or ship and the nearest hardware store is days away. If designing a building in normal circumstances already presents numerous complexities, it's not hard to imagine the additional challenges when developing something in an extreme environment, such as locations with very high or low temperatures, or in places susceptible to corrosion, radiation, and more. In this article, we will explore the difficulties, the main solutions and the materials used in these contexts.</p>"

<p>""The Memory of the River"" is a project located at the intersection of public art and ephemeral architecture, conceived as a transitory infrastructure capable of reactivating urban spaces in the city of Bogot&aacute; through cultural uses. The initiative arises from the Secretariat of Culture, Recreation and Sports (SCRD) with Secretary Santiago Trujillo, the Director of Art, Culture, and Heritage Diego Parra, and structured by the Subdirectorate of Infrastructure and Cultural Heritage of the Secretariat, led by Edgar Figueroa, with a team composed of: Edgar Bernal, Emmanuel Guerra, Juliana Mendoza, Diego Rodr&iacute;guez, and Juan Sebasti&aacute;n Robayo. <strong>They advocate for a temporary intervention&mdash;instead of a permanent one&mdash;as a strategy to decentralize cultural uses and allow different neighborhoods in the city to host their activities.</strong></p>"
