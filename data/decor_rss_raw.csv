<p>The design for the new school in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/chyne"">Chýně</a> is based on a contemporary, modern approach to education. The school's shared spaces — both interior and exterior — play an equally important role in the learning process as traditional classrooms. Informal learning can take place in alcoves along corridors, while small nooks provide opportunities for quiet conversation. Study rooms offer various seating arrangements, supporting different modes of concentration. The roof is designed for both play and learning. Thus, the school offers a rich internal world in which both young pupils and teenage students can find their own place.</p>"
