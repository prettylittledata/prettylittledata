Once a humble dwelling, the space now serves as a rush-weaving classroom.

From the sidewalk to the parking area/town entrance, the project invites a walk with a view of the landscape beauties of Marmilla, transforming a peripheral route into a true story of welcome.

<p>Urban living is largely defined by a settled lifestyle. Typically, people anchor their lives around the home, radiating outward to the street and further connecting to workplaces and social activities—together forming a tightly woven living grid. As the starting point of family life, a residence is not merely a place for basic daily functions; it often doubles as a space for professional activity as well. A comfortable living environment often unfolds from the ordinary and familiar acts: dining, sleeping, washing, connecting with others, or engaging in hands-on labor. These moments of daily life construct a complex and secretive spatial structure.</p>"
