<p>The building is a combination of blocks with high and low juxtaposition in a straight north-south shape. The first-floor building near the low tea hill in the south is designed as a kitchen and dining room, and the second-floor building with a wide view in the north is designed as a coffee shop. Several huge trees in the west of the site can reduce indoor energy consumption in hot summer, which creates favorable conditions for the design of large-area glass floor-to-ceiling windows. The lower terrain in the northeast of the building can be seen by tea gardens and villages in the distance.</p>"

<p>The main concept of this project is ""Continuity,"" which is formed from the external body and continues to the interior. The nature of this project is not formed just from the extension of a unique form but from the multiplication of a basic element in architecture, which is the ""wall."" These thick and pure walls are made from the vertical arrangement of Basalt stone ingots that form the project from the entrance to the roof garden and Project skyline, and eventually the whole body. These walls are cut in specific borders of the combination of the facade layers, architectural plan, and structural construction.</p>"
