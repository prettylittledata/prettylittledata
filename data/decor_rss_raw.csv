<p>For a long time, architecture was understood as an essentially individual activity, dependent on the figure of a creative genius and centered on the ability to solve problems through drawing. Over time, this image began to fade. The protagonism once concentrated in a few names reached its peak during the era of the starchitects and gradually became distributed among offices, collectives, and multidisciplinary teams. Today, architects are expanding their boundaries into other fields such as gastronomy, music, design, and the corporate world, applying spatial thinking to address challenges of various kinds. As social, environmental, and political crises deepen, the role of the architect continues to evolve from a solitary author to a mediator, activist, and collective agent of transformation. This shift reflects an ethical awakening and a recognition that design, regulation, and care are inseparable dimensions of contemporary practice.</p>"

<p>With a civic landscape doubling as ecological infrastructure, the 250,000 m² mixed-use urban regeneration project sets a precedent for future climate adaptation in Southeast Asian cities. Snøhetta, in collaboration with A49 Architects, has unveiled its most extensive urban regeneration project in Asia for Magnolia Quality Development Corporation (MQDC). Located in the South Sukhumvit — one of Bangkok's most vibrant cultural and innovation hubs — Cloud 11 is a mixed-use development defined by a central courtyard that serves as both ecological infrastructure and cultural park. The design harnesses the power of landscape to create an urban oasis that champions environmental resilience and community wellbeing. Rooted in its surrounding context, the project is inspired by the layered conditions of Bangkok's shophouse streets, elevated sky train lines, and emerging high-rise towers. By sculpting the architecture from the space between these layers, Cloud 11 forms a new ""in-between"" realm. The result is a generous public landscape that bridges scales, reconnecting the neighborhoods, offering a vibrant civic space for all.</p>"

<p>How often are irregularly shaped plots dismissed when buying land? In many towns, the land is subdivided into perfect rectangles for construction, leaving plots with unconventional shapes—sharp angles and awkward dimensions—undesirable and in low demand. The architecture studio Tropical Tones, however, has set an example by tackling this challenge. This Tropical Modern residence in Azhiyur Village in Kozhikode, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/kerala"">Kerala</a>, is built on an 8-cent trapezoidal plot within the Coastal Regulations Zone, just 100 metres from the National Highway. The proximity to the sea and the narrow corner of the site are typically considered non-negotiable constraints for homeowners. Yet, this family of a young couple and four kids took a leap of faith.</p>"

<p>The land where the house is located has a regular, longitudinal shape and is perpendicular to Campo da Bola Street, in the parish of Mundão, located northeast of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/viseu"">Viseu</a>. The solar orientation (from the street to the interior) is West - East. Regarding the topography, the plot has a steep slope, ascending from the entrance. This morphological condition of the land influenced the programmatic and volumetric shape of the building.</p>"

<p>The flat terrain with generous dimensions, intended for a residence with a maximum area of 250 m&sup2;, motivated us to position it in a way to <strong>maximize the interface between the covered program and the external areas</strong>. The resulting distribution follows a logic already tested in other residential projects by the office, where <strong>the circulation between the rooms is configured as covered passages, yet open laterally</strong> &mdash; without frames or masonry &mdash; to extend the experience between the interior and exterior.</p>"
