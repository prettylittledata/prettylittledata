<p>As an installation for SUSAS 2025 (Shanghai Urban Space Art Season), this project is situated on Fuxing Island, Shanghai—once the former China Shipbuilding Factory, which relocated across the Huangpu River in the early 2000s. The client initially asked for an intervention to enhance the slipway's exposed elevation. Yet on site we realized the slipway is more than a façade: it traces the site's central axis and, more importantly, was the final stage where ships were assembled and launched. Rather than a surface upgrade, the project begins by activating a larger imagination embedded in the scale and memory of the place.</p>"

<p>The transformation of the chapel of the Saint-Joseph convent in Saint-Félicien is founded on a guiding principle: designing with what already exists. The intervention seeks neither to erase nor to stage the heritage, but rather to offer a precise and measured reinterpretation of its architectural qualities in service of new cultural uses. The 342 m² chapel has been converted into a versatile cultural venue hosting cinema, theatre, and exhibitions. The project forms part of a broader strategy for the requalification of the convent and its gardens, led by the municipality in collaboration with local associations. From the earliest stages, the definition of the program was developed in close partnership with the client, through a process grounded in attentive dialogue, trust, and a strong commitment from the local authority.</p>"

<p>For many architects, schematic design is defined by a familiar tension. It is the phase of open-ended exploration—where multiple ideas are tested, challenged, and refined for clients to define a project's direction. In essence, it's where the design magic happens. The challenge is rarely a lack of ideas, but the effort required to test and evaluate those ideas properly under time-, resource-, and budget constraints. It is an especially acute challenge for architects as early design work must balance creativity with client needs and commercial feasibility.</p>"

<p>As one of the ""largest railway transportation hubs in Asia,"" <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/guangzhou"">Guangzhou</a> Baiyun Station relies on its supporting station complex to realize the ""Station-City Integration"" model. The interior design of the East Plot Twin Towers takes the architectural and facade logic as its starting point, continuing the morphological language of ""High Mountains and Flowing Water."" By extending the facade language to the interior scale, the design achieves systematic synergy between the architecture, facade, and interior spaces, facilitating the hub's overall evolution from a mere transportation facility into a vibrant urban public activity space. Standing atop the super TOD hub of Guangzhou Baiyun Station, the twin towers on the East Plot are positioned as headquarters office buildings for unicorn enterprises in the Greater Bay Area. Our vision is not merely to build an office tower above a transportation hub, but to deliver a groundbreaking reinvention of the traditional transit-oriented office model—transforming it from a mere transportation adjunct into a dynamic urban node. Drawing inspiration from the architectural facade language of ""High Mountains and Flowing Water,"" the design allows natural forms and artistic conception to evolve and flourish within the interior spaces. This approach precisely addresses the deep-seated needs of emerging enterprises regarding spatial quality, talent attraction, and community connectivity. Ultimately, it creates a distinctive workplace that fosters connections with nature and culture, all within the context of an intensive and efficient transportation hub.</p>"

<p>In Vietnam's accelerating urbanization, particularly in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ho-chi-minh-city"">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, the proliferation of new residential quarters has alleviated acute housing shortages yet frequently perpetuated obsolete typologies. Many developments recycle standardized house models from two to three decades past, failing to address contemporary demands adequately for spatial comfort, natural ventilation, daylight penetration, aesthetic sophistication, and personalized habitation.</p>"
