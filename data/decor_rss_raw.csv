<p>'French family looking for an apartment to settle in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/madrid"">Madrid</a> for an indefinite period of time'. With this headline, Marion and Paul Franck, a couple with three young children - Leo, Romeo and Zöe - who until then had lived, due to his work in the aeronautical industry, five years in Toulouse, another two in Reunion Island, one in Washington and the last four in London, presented themselves in the studio at the end of 2022. The difference with previous destinations is that Madrid now appears to be the place they have chosen to settle permanently. And they do so by acquiring a 151 m2 dwelling located on the top floor of a residential building constructed at the beginning of the 20th century in the Justicia neighborhood, near Gran Vía and Chueca, in the center of Madrid. With a marked longitudinal character and a floor plan organized around three courtyards, paradoxically, despite being a penthouse, the dwelling does not establish notable links with the surrounding urban profile. Rather, as if it were the shell of an armadillo, it is closed and protected from the outside. For this purpose, it has an extensive roof: a 200 m2 surface of undulating and opaque tiles, made up of 7 roofs of different slopes and lengths and consisting of a framework of wooden beams, many of them darkened, in poor condition and hidden behind a false ceiling. </p>"

<p>'Plot 33' is an honest study about how to achieve a balance between inside-outside, work-life, privacy-openness, reused-new materials, adaptability-single use, etc. This project is also an attempt to amalgamate the aspirations of an Architect duo coming from diverse backgrounds – South Asia (India) and Southern Europe (Spain) – in the rapidly growing city of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/rajkot"">Rajkot</a>, India. The site is located in a tight urban residential neighborhood adjacent to the region's university campus. It is a 10 x 24 meters parcel of land, with the northern short side facing the road that leads to the university. On the opposite side of the plot, across the road, there is a small public park with large sheltering trees.</p>"
