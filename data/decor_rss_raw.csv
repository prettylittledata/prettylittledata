<p>Unlike most popular sports, the origin of basketball has a precise year and creator: it was invented in 1891 in the United States by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith as an indoor sport for athletes at Springfield College during the winter, after the end of the football season. The sport quickly expanded beyond U.S. borders, being included in the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/olympic-games"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Olympic Games</a> in 1936 and achieving international popularity after the Second World War. As basketball became more widespread, it also left the controlled environment of gymnasiums and began occupying a wide range of locations: playgrounds, public plazas, school courtyards, driveways, and backyard patios became informal courts for play and community life, reinforcing <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/925956/7-examples-where-physical-activities-were-the-catalyst-behind-a-neighborhood-regeneration"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">the role of physical activity as a catalyst for social interaction and neighborhood regeneration</a>.</p>"

The corten steel expanded mesh cladding gives an almost woven appearance to the facade while reminding the tones of local stone (Vosges sandstone), very present in the historic village.
