<p>The remodeling and expansion of this typical ground floor PH unit with its own terrace responds to the challenge of adapting the home to two possible configurations: a first version as a single-family dwelling and a possible future division into two independent units, one on the ground floor and another developed on the first and second floors.</p>"

<p>In the heart of Marmilla, architect Martino Picchedda transforms the village's main entrance into a poetic urban threshold. The design evokes the timeless forms of the Giants' Tombs while celebrating the Sardinian landscape's identity through corten steel, local stone, and light. Here, history and contemporary design converge, creating a welcoming space that tells the story of place and people. From the sidewalk to the parking area/town entrance, the project invites a walk with a view of the landscape beauties of Marmilla, transforming a peripheral route into a true story of welcome. Corten steel, local stone, and light become the three key elements that intertwine memory, identity, and landscape, welcoming arrivals and offering at the same time a sign of recognition.</p>"

<p>Earthboat Cave is a small timber accommodation quietly embedded in the lakeside forest of Shirakabako. The project was developed under the concept of ""nature escape,"" an Earthboat philosophy that allows people to escape dense urban life and reconnect with nature in a calm environment.</p>"
