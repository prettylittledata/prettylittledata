<p>The house is positioned on the site with the aim of responding in a relatively simple way to two central questions: How can it capture a panoramic view of the horizon, which also brings us the presence of the sea?

<p>It is undeniable that, at first glance, the idea of a <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/louvre"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Louvre</a> in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/abu-dhabi"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Abu Dhabi</a> or a <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/centre-pompidou"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Centre Pompidou</a> in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/64028/ad-classics-centre-georges-pompidou-renzo-piano-richard-rogers"">Brazil</a> may seem somewhat disconcerting.

And to some extent, it truly is. The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/louvre"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Louvre</a>, deeply rooted in the history of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/country/france"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">France</a> as a former fortress and later royal residence, embodies a set of invaluable heritage values, further amplified by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/88705/ad-classics-le-grande-louvre-i-m-pei"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">I. M. Pei’s iconic glass pyramid intervention</a> in 1989. The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/64028/ad-classics-centre-georges-pompidou-renzo-piano-richard-rogers"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pompidou</a>, meanwhile, is remembered as a historic turning point: by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1035073/democratizing-access-to-culture-the-past-present-and-future-of-cultural-centers"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">redefining the concept of public infrastructure</a> through radically unconventional architecture, it marked the first time culture drew in mass audiences.</p>"
