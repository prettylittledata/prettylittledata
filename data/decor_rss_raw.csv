The 3600 views are equally exciting; therefore, needed significant consideration. Envisaged as a circular edge of a ""forest clearing"", the structure needed to merge with the dense plantation.

<p>By shifting rotation away from traditional hinges and distributing weight vertically, pivot doors were developed to address a specific architectural challenge: how to move large, heavy door panels with precision, durability, and minimal visual interference. These systems allow doors to grow significantly in scale, weight, and material ambition, often blurring the line between door, wall, and architectural surface. Over time, this technical innovation has expanded the role of doors in architecture, allowing them to operate not only as points of access, but also as spatial thresholds, compositional devices, and expressive elements within the building envelope.</p>"

Challenging the visual dominance of conventional museum design, the project introduces smell, memory, and multisensory perception into spatial narration. Guided by principles of openness, collaboration, and sustainability, the museum is conceived not merely as an attractive cultural destination, but as a platform for public engagement with the history of perfumery, traditional craftsmanship, and contemporary technologies. It offers an ideal environment to experience the evolution of fragrance creation. Through architectural expression, the intangible nature of scent is transformed into a tangible, spatial encounter—establishing the museum as a vital venue for dialogue and exchange within global fragrance culture.</p>"
