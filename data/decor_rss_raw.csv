However, one shortcoming was its lack of service facilities in the waterfront area.

As a result, we collaborated again to design a restaurant within a children's playground. During the preliminary planning phase, the restaurant was named ""The Brave Cabin,"" as it was surrounded by challenging recreational climbing equipment. We hoped the building would inspire children's courage to overcome difficulties. With an indoor area of less than 200 square meters, the building has a relatively small footprint. Our goal was to create ample semi-outdoor spaces where visitors could relax in the shade. Additionally, thanks to its prominent location at the island's gateway, the building is visible from a distance to arriving visitors.</p>"

<p>As the late urban planner Jaime Lerner once argued, the future of architecture lies not in building new cities but in updating those that already exist. In a world where resources are finite and urban space is increasingly saturated, his statement feels more urgent than ever. It calls for architects to look inward, to rethink what truly needs to be built, and to recognize the creative potential of what is already there. Within the constraints of existing structures lies an opportunity to design differently: to repair, adapt, and reuse. Or, as French poet Louis Aragon would have it, to reinvent the past to see the beauty of the future.</p>"

<p>Architecture has entered a pivotal moment. As cities continue to grow under the weight of climatic and social pressures, the materials and systems that shape them are being redefined. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1012951/artificial-intelligence-and-urban-planning-technology-as-a-tool-for-city-design?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">Artificial intelligence</a> and robotics, once used to accelerate construction processes, are now being rethought as tools for cultivation. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031069/exploring-living-building-materials-through-robotic-earth-printing?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=projects_tab&amp;ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all"">Printed structures that grow</a>, breathe, and decay. Cultivation, in this context, refers to designing with biological materials, where growth and decay are active parameters, merging digital precision with ecological intelligence. This evolution shows the shift from efficiency to empathy, where architecture becomes an agent of active repair. The introduction of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1012323/interspecies-design-developing-materials-that-allow-the-growth-and-inhabitation-of-non-human-species"">mycelium and other natural materials</a> into <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1029735/exploring-3d-printing-in-academia-prototypes-that-foster-collaboration-in-architecture?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">3D printing</a> presents a new paradigm in architecture: the logic of the living.

<p>The Christinger Residence offers around <strong>fifteen rental apartments designed for seniors. </strong>The project originates from the bequest of Mrs. Christinger, who donated to the municipality a 1,933 m² plot of land and the villa that had been built there in the 1940s. Upon receiving the testament, which dedicated the property to the benefit of the municipality's senior citizens, the municipality initiated a reflection on the type of housing for a population experiencing declining autonomy.</p>"

<p>The architecture and construction sector currently accounts for the highest carbon emissions among all global industries. Architecture, which has evolved alongside humanity for over 10,000 years, entered the 20th century prioritizing efficiency and economy above all else, adopting concrete and steel as its near-exclusive materials. This pursuit of industrial optimization, while enabling rapid development, also detached architecture from its ecological roots and intensified the environmental burden of the built environment.</p>"
