<p>In recent years, food has taken on a renewed role within architecture, not simply as a program or typology, but as a shared spatial practice. Beyond restaurants or dining design, communal eating spaces are increasingly understood as environments where presence, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ritual"">ritual</a>, and time intersect, allowing people to gather, stay, and coexist. In these settings, eating does not just happen within space; it actively shapes it, temporarily transforming ordinary, borrowed, or improvised environments into places of exchange.</p>"

Once a humble dwelling, the space now serves as a rush-weaving classroom.
