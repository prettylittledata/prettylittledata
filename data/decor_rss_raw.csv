<p>Moncler's new headquarters, a landmark of urban regeneration. ACPV ARCHITECTS Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel presents Casa Moncler, the new headquarters of the brand, located within the Symbiosis District in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/milan"">Milan</a>, a strategic area of urban regeneration in the southern quadrant of the city. The project takes the form of a complex spanning 77,000 square meters, distributed across six above-ground floors and two basement levels, reaching a total height of approximately 32 meters. Designed to accommodate over 700 employees, the building offers highly flexible workspaces and advanced environmental performance, establishing a dialogue with the site's historical legacy. The new headquarters for Moncler reinterprets contemporary industrial architecture by evoking the morphology and materiality of the site's original manufacturing context, transforming these references into an architectural language that is both essential and sophisticated. The main building stands out for its rigorous compositional layout and its restrained formal presence. The volumetric articulation also includes a semi-underground showroom, whose architecture features a shed roof that establishes a dialogue with the surrounding structures. This element intersects volumetrically with the main body, creating an architectural junction that defines the perimeter of the campus and reinforces its overall compositional coherence. Embracing the principles of the Building-as-a-City, the structure absorbs the complexity of an urban environment, becoming an organism capable of accommodating a wide range of functions and services, while fostering exchange and cross-contamination among different architectural typologies. Moreover, elements of industrial archaeology, such as the historic chimney, have been repurposed and integrated into the new design, reinforcing the connection between past and present and anchoring the building within Milan's urban landscape.</p>"

<p>The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/tallinn-architecture-biennale"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tallinn Architecture Biennale</a> (TAB) has been organized by the Estonian Centre for Architecture (ECA) since 2011. Since its founding, it has become <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/estonia"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Estonia</a>'s leading international festival dedicated to architecture and the built environment. The ECA recently announced that the upcoming edition will be curated by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/stuudio-tana"">Stuudio TÄNA</a> and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/mark-aleksander-fischer"">Mark Aleksander Fischer</a>, winners of the Curatorial Competition for the 8th International Tallinn Architecture Biennale (TAB 2026). Their winning proposal, titled ""How Much?"", poses the question of what affordability truly means in architecture today. The event, which <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/tallinn-architecture-biennale"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">in previous editions</a> has included exhibitions, lectures, seminars, tours, satellite events, and installations across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/tallinn"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tallinn</a>, seeks to open a space for reflection on how architecture and design can be genuinely cost-effective, addressing the broader implications of cost and consumption. TAB 2026 will take place in the Estonian capital from 9 September to 30 November 2026.</p>"

<p>As <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/cities"">cities</a> continue to expand upward, the office tower remains one of the most visible symbols of architectural ambition and urban evolution. No longer defined solely by efficiency or corporate image, contemporary workplace architecture is being reimagined as a hybrid ecosystem, one that balances density with daylight, productivity with well-being, and technology with material and spatial integrity. The following unbuilt projects, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/contact"">submitted by the ArchDaily community</a>, reveal how architects across continents are rethinking the typology of the tower, turning verticality into an opportunity for connection, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/adaptability"">adaptability</a>, and sustainability.</p>"

<p>When architects are still students, a moment often marks a turning point: their first encounter with software. It's not just about learning a tool but discovering a space where ideas transcend physical models, taking shape in a digital environment and beginning a relationship many will carry throughout their careers. What happens next? <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/software"">Software keeps evolving</a>, and with it, the design experience. In recent years, this evolution has accelerated—<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034327/the-plan-and-the-prompt-how-ai-is-rewiring-design-and-practice?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=projects_tab&amp;ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all"">machine learning, AI, prompts</a>, and integrated workflows have moved from the periphery to the core of design practice, becoming part of the shared language between software and users. As these tools take hold, a key question emerges: How will this reshape our experience of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034955/from-design-fiction-to-design-futures-the-changing-role-of-architecture-in-cultural-production?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=projects_tab&amp;ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_all"">designing architecture in the future?</a></p>"
