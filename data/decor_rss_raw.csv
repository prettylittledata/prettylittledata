<p>The site is a flagpole-shaped lot located amid a mixture of traditional Japanese houses and contemporary developer-built homes. In designing a house for a family of five suited to this place, the image I had in mind was that of a traditional Japanese house. Timber framing is exposed through <em>shinkabe</em> construction (<em>shinkabe</em>: a traditional Japanese method in which columns and beams are expressed), resulting in a stripped-down appearance free of excess. At a time when construction costs continue to rise, I believe that reconsidering the wisdom embedded in traditional Japanese houses was a rational approach.</p>"

The ground beneath our feet is not a void but a complex territory that holds the infrastructures, memories, and anxieties of our age. In recent years, as land becomes scarce and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/climate-change"">climate pressures intensify</a>, architects and urbanists have turned their gaze downward, rediscovering the subterranean as both a physical and conceptual frontier. To design <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/underground"">underground</a> is to engage with the unseen mechanisms that shape the world above.</p>"

<p>The house balances outside and inside, living in the garden of a coastal village. The living volume and rooms are arranged around an open court with the pool at its center. The grand stair continues the courtyard space to the roof level, opening vistas toward nearby and distant landscapes.</p>"

<p>The pursuit of stronger, lighter, and more durable materials has guided architecture long before polymers or carbon fibers existed. One of the earliest large-scale examples of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034993/lighter-and-stronger-composites-are-changing-how-we-build"">composite materials</a> can be found in the Great Wall of China, where stone, clay bricks, and organic fibers such as reeds and willow branches were blended to create a resilient and lasting structure. These early techniques reveal a timeless intuition: distinct materials, when combined thoughtfully, produce properties unattainable by any single element. As the construction sector faces urgent ecological pressures, this intuition is being revisited through the lens of sustainability, with architects and engineers exploring bio-based, recycled, and hybrid composites designed not only for performance but also for circularity and environmental responsibility.</p>"
