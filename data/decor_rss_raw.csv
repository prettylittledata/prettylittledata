The term ""clean"" signals a fundamental shift away from extractive, finite, and exhaustible <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/energy"">energy</a> sources toward systems based on <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/renewable-energy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">renewable resources</a> or on capturing energy embedded in natural processes.

However, being labeled ""clean"" does not exempt these systems from the impacts associated with their production, deployment, and commercialization. In this context, architectural knowledge related to space, materiality, and habitation becomes relevant for supporting a transition toward energy systems that are sustainable over time. As stated by the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/united-nations"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">United Nations</a>, the science is clear: to limit climate change, reliance on fossil fuels must end, and buildings must be heated, lit, and electrified through clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable power sources.</p>"

Bridging professional practice and academia, his work consistently <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1035072/every-second-counts-every-space-matters-15-contemporary-fire-stations?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">expands the architectural toolkit through computational design, experimental material research, and an evolving commitment to ecology</a> as a responsibility and a design driver. In 2025, the studio was selected as a winner of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1033983/20-practices-shaping-the-future-of-architecture-winners-of-the-archdaily-2025-next-practices-awards"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ArchDaily Next Practices Awards.</a></p>"
