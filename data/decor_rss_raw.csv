This new facility restructures the entrances, playgrounds, and walkways of the nursery and primary schools, while blending harmoniously into its surroundings.

The building comprises three large activity rooms and two multi-purpose dormitories, all facing east towards the playgrounds and educational areas. A wide central circulation area, bathed in natural light, also serves as a living space in its own right. Designed to provide a healthy, fun, and eco-friendly environment, the building has a timber frame, straw insulation, and exposed beams. The hemp block partitions and earth plaster reinforce this bio-based design, rooted in living materials.</p>"
