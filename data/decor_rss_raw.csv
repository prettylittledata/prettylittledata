Since then, UIA congresses have been held every three years in a different city within a member country, serving as the organisation's main recurring event. In 2026, the Congress will be held in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/barcelona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barcelona</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/966002/barcelona-named-unesco-world-capital-of-architecture-for-2026"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNESCO has consequently designated the city as the World Capital of Architecture 2026</a>.
