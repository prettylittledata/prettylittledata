<p>In recent years, food has taken on a renewed role within architecture, not simply as a program or typology, but as a shared spatial practice. Beyond restaurants or dining design, communal eating spaces are increasingly understood as environments where presence, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ritual"">ritual</a>, and time intersect, allowing people to gather, stay, and coexist.
