<p>The house is located in one of the villages near Warsaw, close to a river, surrounded by a gently sloping mixed forest. The owners say they bought it by accident when they met a real estate agent while walking their dog, who led them to a pyramid-like building hidden among the trees. It turned out to be an uninhabited residence, which the local militia commander had dreamed of owning. The building was constructed between 1976 and 1981 during a period of crisis and low availability of building materials. It was built from whatever could be obtained from construction sites and renovations of infrastructure facilities: for example, the ceilings were made of tram rails, which were laid at a slight slope above the ground floor, as they pierced through the outer wall and became part of the terrace structure. Thanks to its slight slope, the terrace was naturally drained. At the same time, the floor in the living room behind the wall had a noticeable slope, and the wall was blackened by the cold and moisture penetrating through the rails. The original construction documentation consisted of a few A4 pages with very sketchy drawings and one page of laconic description.</p>"

<p>Are living spaces getting smaller? As cities densify and the global population continues its steady migration toward urban centers—projected to reach around 70% by 2050—domestic space is becoming increasingly compressed. Rising land prices, high construction costs, and a surge in single-person households push developers toward smaller units and tighter floor plans. At the same time, cultural shifts toward resource efficiency and minimal living support this move. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1020291/design-solutions-for-small-living-maximizing-space-in-apartments-under-40-square-meters"">Shrinking living spaces</a> require fewer materials, consume less energy, and encourage people to live closer to their means. </p>"

<p>Cheng Tsung FENG's artistic practice has long been intertwined with endangered traditions, vanishing techniques, and fading cultural memories. Among them, the traditional bamboo theatre — once a vital part of temple festivals and folk celebrations across Taiwan — holds a special resonance.

<p>THE KYEOL Clinic is conceived as a modern interpretation of Korean aesthetics, offering a calm and refined atmosphere through natural materials, restrained details, and a focus on spatial stillness. Located within a 58-pyeong (191 m²) interior, the clinic was designed for a client seeking a space that expresses Korean identity without relying on luxury or ornamentation. The site required a balance between functionality as a dermatology clinic and the brand's desire to create a serene, culturally rooted environment. The main challenge was to build a contemporary medical space that still conveyed traditional sensibilities while maintaining openness and simplicity.</p>"

<p>This tenant office building stands just steps from a subway station in the Ichibancho district of Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward—an area near the Imperial Palace (the former Edo Castle), steeped in history and culture. Conventional tenant office buildings generally house multiple companies within a single structure, yet their facades fail to reflect the diversity within. On top of this, they lack a sense of connection with the surrounding community and contribute little to the streetscape or the character of the local neighborhood. This project addresses these problems by creating a building that connects people to the surrounding urban environment while accommodating increasingly diverse work styles and values. To achieve this, two key architectural elements were incorporated: interior spaces defined by projecting bay windows and an open exterior space.</p>"
