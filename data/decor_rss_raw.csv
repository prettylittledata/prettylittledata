With the spatial arrangement of the open and closed spaces focusing on the interaction between humans and dogs while at the same time reinforcing the theme of adoption, the facility sits on a 110.000 m2 site located in the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/gokdere"">Gökdere</a> district of the town of Bornova in Izmir. Being the first of its kind, this facility was not only designed as a temporary care center but also a center for rehabilitation that is predicated on the interaction between humans and dogs, providing a space that promotes the idea of reciprocal rehabilitation and can be seen as an alternative space for families to spend quality time and reinforces human-dog interaction. </p>"

<p>In cities, containers filled with construction debris and discarded furniture are evidence of constant interior renovations driven more by aesthetic trends and marketing strategies than by real functional needs. This same superficial impulse is also reflected in public spaces and buildings, where many interventions prioritise image over fundamental aspects such as accessibility, comfort, or future adaptability.</p>"
