From the outset, a solution was sought that not only adapted to the land but utilized its characteristics as spatial and landscape potential. The residence was designed for a young couple, with the premise of accommodating transformations over time, which led to the adoption of a modular system capable of allowing coherent future expansions. Currently, the house features five suites, a direct result of this progressive growth strategy.</p>"
