<p>This project is an extension and renovation of a 40-year-old clinic located in Mie Prefecture, Japan. The existing reinforced concrete building, constructed in 1984, houses a dental clinic on the ground floor and a residence on the second floor. At the time of its construction, concepts of universal design were not yet widely recognized. The surrounding area was more rural and tranquil than it is today, and the appearance of this pure white RC clinic must have made a strong impression on the landscape. Its elevated plinth, dignified stance, and geometric composition based on strict horizontality and verticality created a sharp contrast with the surrounding fields, reflecting an era when medical architecture was expected to possess a strong sense of symbolism and autonomy.</p>"

<p>The National Museum of the United States Army (NMUSA), a cultural institution of national significance that is the first to tell the story of the oldest branch of the United States military. The building – which is located just 20 miles outside of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/washington"">Washington</a>, D.C. – is designed to serve as a center of education, and the Army's symbolic front door. By walking visitors through every generation of the Army, the museum focuses not on battles or wars, but on the individual soldier – a centuries-long narrative of honor, sacrifice, and valor.</p>"

<p>A proposal is made for an architecture that intertwines with the garden, maximizing the perimeter of contact with the landscape and blurring the boundaries between the built environment and nature. In this location in Madrid, that relationship with the surroundings takes on a unique value. To achieve this, a compact volume is deliberately abandoned in favor of an ascending layout that evokes certain works by Alfaro. The project aims to resolve a dichotomy: to be both geometric and organic. Although its structure is precise, the inhabitant perceives it as something natural, almost as if it has randomly settled into the place.</p>"
