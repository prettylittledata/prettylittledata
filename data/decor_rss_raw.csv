These are particularly abundant in some of its central neighborhoods like the Plateau Mont-Royal. Interestingly, their preservation is not accidental; it is the result of decades of advocacy by influential figures who recognized the value of the city's built environment, such as <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1025621/saving-montreals-architectural-heritage-phyllis-lamberts-legacy-of-community-driven-change?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">Phyllis Lambert</a> and <a href=""https://mcgillnews.mcgill.ca/honouring-the-woman-who-saved-old-montreal/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">Blanche Lemco Van Ginkel</a>.
