<p>Across Europe and beyond, architects are confronting a turning point. As rising emissions targets collide with shrinking material supplies and <a href=""https://circular-cities-and-regions.ec.europa.eu/news/ccri-pilot-flanders-visits-rotor-learn-about-construction-material-reuse?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">the growing urgency of climate commitments</a>, the built environment is being forced into a deeper reckoning with how it consumes, circulates, and discards resources.

Though the initial brief was to rehabilitate an existing dilapidated villa, we realized that with a similar investment in time and budget, it would be preferable to demolish the existing building and construct a new one that would be better adapted to its role as an embassy. </p>"
