<p>The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/uia-world-congress-of-architecture"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">UIA World Congress of Architects</a> is an international event for architectural dialogue organised by the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/international-union-of-architects"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">International Union of Architects</a> (UIA, by its French acronym), a non-governmental organisation that unites national associations of architects from over 100 countries, representing more than one million professionals. The first UIA Congress of Architects, which also marked the institution's founding, was held in Lausanne in 1948 during the post-war reconstruction period. Since then, UIA congresses have been held every three years in a different city within a member country, serving as the organisation's main recurring event. In 2026, the Congress will be held in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/barcelona"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Barcelona</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/966002/barcelona-named-unesco-world-capital-of-architecture-for-2026"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNESCO has consequently designated the city as the World Capital of Architecture 2026</a>. Each Congress focuses on a key topic relevant to the profession, articulated through a central theme. Recent themes include <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/uia-2023-copenhagen"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Copenhagen 2023: ""Sustainable Futures. Leave no one behind.""</a> and Rio 2020–2021: ""All the worlds. Just one World."" The topic for 2026 is ""Becoming. Architectures for a Planet in Transition,"" welcoming renowned figures in contemporary architectural thought and practice for a broad and critical overview of the possible futures of architecture.</p>"

<p>The project is located in the Quartier de la Piscine in Petit-Quevilly, south of the Rouen metropolitan area. Situated on a former industrial site, the plot lies at the heart of a fragmented territory, divided by the Sud III expressway, which has long disrupted the urban continuity between the historic center and the eastern neighborhoods. Until recently, the site read as a disparate assemblage: parking areas to the north, an urban boiler house at the center, dispersed public facilities to the south, all enclosed by a series of physical barriers – fences and ball-stops – which accentuated the fragmentation of the space.</p>"

These surviving entities embody the deep cultural lineage of traditional Eastern architecture. DANNONG, a clothing brand grounded in an inner Eastern sensibility, already operates many stores. Yet in the capital of Shanxi, how should garments be presented in space? How should the store grow in resonance with the region's architectural heritage?
