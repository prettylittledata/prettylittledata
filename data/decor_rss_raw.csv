The 3600 views are equally exciting; therefore, needed significant consideration. Envisaged as a circular edge of a ""forest clearing"", the structure needed to merge with the dense plantation.

<p>By shifting rotation away from traditional hinges and distributing weight vertically, pivot doors were developed to address a specific architectural challenge: how to move large, heavy door panels with precision, durability, and minimal visual interference. These systems allow doors to grow significantly in scale, weight, and material ambition, often blurring the line between door, wall, and architectural surface. Over time, this technical innovation has expanded the role of doors in architecture, allowing them to operate not only as points of access, but also as spatial thresholds, compositional devices, and expressive elements within the building envelope.</p>"

It offers an ideal environment to experience the evolution of fragrance creation. Through architectural expression, the intangible nature of scent is transformed into a tangible, spatial encounter—establishing the museum as a vital venue for dialogue and exchange within global fragrance culture.</p>"

<p>In the translation of three-dimensional reality onto a two-dimensional plane, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/axonometric"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">axonometry</a> stands as one of the graphic systems of representation that form the foundation of the language used by architecture and design professionals. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/966202/how-to-properly-design-circular-plans"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Alongside plans, sections, and elevations,</a> its exploded views often stand out for their ability to study the multiple layers that compose a project. Although axonometry is also employed in other disciplines such as engineering and urban planning, it consistently proves its capacity to function as more than a mere representational tool, strengthening the understanding not only of a project's construction processes, materials, and structural systems but also expanding the communication of the ideas and design processes that shape a project.</p>"
