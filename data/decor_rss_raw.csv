<p>As great stories go, this is one to keep for the records. As a young couple, moving between countries and business clients as one moves between hot chocolate choices, was looking for a place to live in Lisbon, there were several priorities which they felt should be met: spatious, light-filled, not too complex or technically challenging to change/renovate, and something which felt just right for both of them and their child. Now, something which feels right is a common principle when house hunting: you may see 20 prospective houses in one day that seem to fit the briefing, but there&rsquo;s always something missing you cannot truly pinpoint. What no one was waiting, or hoping for, was that you could find something truly special on a street in Lisbon which most Portuguese children grew up seeing on TV (the official Prime Minister Office &ldquo;sits&rdquo; proudly and grandly just opposite the building). So, street-wise it was a win-win situation in terms of a prime location, but there was a setback.</p>"
