Yet most of what we remember about living is how we eat together, withdraw, argue, care, and rest, which happen far from view. It happens inside rooms.

<p>Wujiang Wedding Hall is located on the northern side of the Chuihong Scenic Area in Wujiang District, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/suzhou"">Suzhou</a>. Its cultural roots could be traced back to the Chuihong Bridge, originally built during the Northern Song Dynasty. Over the course of a millennium, the site has accumulated a series of significant cultural landmarks, including the ruins of Chuihong Bridge, Huayan Pagoda, and the Ji Cheng Memorial Hall. Together, these elements form a historic landscape shaped by the convergence of Taihu Lake and the Grand Canal, bearing witness to the layered transformations of Wujiang's urban and cultural history. The original project site consisted of a two-story cafe and a gateball court located at the intersection of two streets, which had been vacant for many years. The renovation preserves the existing structural framework while introducing new functions such as a marriage registration office, community-oriented commercial spaces, and public activity areas. Through this transformation, the project seeks to weave together historical context and contemporary urban life.</p>"

<p>Cornered against a protected forest, on a gentle slope that overlooks a lush botanical garden, there is <strong>a bold infrastructure, a mute monument, almost without memory, function and scale.</strong> The building is meant to host culinary activities; from intimate, informal dines to large social events.

<p>Chongqing is a city shaped by the continuous interplay between mountains and water. Its complex topography overlaps with a dense infrastructural network, where elevated roads, steep terrain, and waterfronts together form a highly charged urban landscape. Located at the convergence of these conditions, the Luxi Lake Café is conceived as a small architectural insertion that responds to the relationships between urban infrastructure, natural geography, and everyday public life through a light and restrained spatial intervention.</p>"
