<p>Cities bring together the best and worst of the human condition. They concentrate opportunities for work, social networks, and cultural production, but they also expose deep social inequalities. Among the many forms of urban exclusion are limited access to transportation, housing, leisure, or safety issues. One form that is rarely discussed is thermal inequality. In lower-income neighborhoods, where there are fewer trees, parks, and permeable surfaces, heat accumulates and thermal discomfort dominates, resulting in higher energy consumption and health risks. As concern about the climate crisis grows, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031146/heat-resilient-design-how-city-leaders-use-building-materials-to-fight-urban-heat"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">this discussion becomes more urgent</a>: extreme heat is no longer just a climatic phenomenon but also a spatial expression of inequality.</p>"

It is not a foreign object, but a fragment of the mountain, a inhabited sculpture that breathes with the same cadence as the forest. Its shape does not seek to impose itself, but to coexist; following the slope as one draws a dialogue with the earth.
