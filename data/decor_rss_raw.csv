In projects of various scales, the Genoese architect maintains an essential thread: the implementation of passive architectural strategies, highlighting the importance of these methods for sustainability and energy efficiency. This is often made explicit in his sketches, as an initial concern, and clearly comes through in the finished works.

Located away from the city of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ordos"">Ordos</a> in the arid desert landscape of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the complex was conceived almost as a self-sufficient town. It included residences for factory staff and extensive facilities for the production of fabrics destined for both domestic and international brands. Within this compound, the Tech Centre was established as a dedicated building for advancing cashmere research and production. Equipped with laboratories, sample testing rooms, and studios, the centre was originally designed to support highly specialized processes. Our commission was to regenerate this ageing facility into a contemporary R&amp;D community — one that reflects today's collaborative and open office practices. </p>"

<p>Located within Sunsetfalls Gardens &amp; Resort in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/salatiga"">Salatiga</a>, Central Java, the Loka Meru Ballroom stands gracefully on the foothill overlooking three majestic mountains—Andong, Sindoro, and Sumbing. Designed by Andra Matin Architect, the structure embodies the serenity of its surrounding landscape while embracing a modern tropical character through its exposed timber architecture.</p>"

<p>The rural pircas, so characteristic of the mountain landscape of Córdoba, have the function of enclosing or limiting a piece of land. In this case, they delimit a space of use, some ensuite rooms as an expansion of a hotel. The place in question corresponds to the former summer stay of former Argentine president J.A. Roca transformed into a hotel.</p>"

<p>The space has been conceptualised and designed by architect and artistic director Sumayya Vally, Counterspace, whose practice is internationally recognised for redefining cultural typologies through community, memory, and ritual. Envisioned as an incremental unfolding — a gathering of gatherings — the headquarters will grow and evolve, responding to how people use and inhabit it. At its heart, the project is less about static architecture and more about an ongoing choreography of space, activated by dialogue, learning, and exchange. As a space that will grow over time through response, adaptation, and use, the project is a living framework, and many of its elements offer multiple configurations to accommodate and generate a plurality of encounters. ""Because of the fever-dream speed with which the project has come into being, our approach reflects this moment — incremental and alive,"" says Sumayya Vally, Architect-in-Residence of the new Ibraaz space.</p>"

<p><strong>Nestled in line with the boundary walls</strong> of its neighboring Finsbury Park properties, the <strong>timber façade of a new housing association office</strong> meets the quiet street it now calls home. Embodying the question of how small something monumental can be, Owain Williams Architects has transformed a disused concrete garage into a <strong>single-story freestanding office building </strong>that faithfully serves as the headquarters of the Stroud Green Housing Co-operative. Responding thoughtfully to its context and community, the building almost takes on an earnestness in the way it carries itself, projecting a quiet self-consciousness in its role of public service. Despite its compact footprint of just 38 square meters, the building gives the impression of being much larger than it is, demanding exaggerated ritualistic gestures that deepen its identity as a civic place. Through clever use of volume and form, the modest center sits with assured confidence in its place – a public building, but in miniature. </p>"
