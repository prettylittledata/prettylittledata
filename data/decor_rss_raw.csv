Since the horses, who are the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/stable"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">stable's </a>primary inhabitants, cannot articulate their needs, design relies on the rigorous requirements dictated by human caretakers, requiring a balance between streamlined human operations and maximized horse comfort and safety. Architects often seem to address this through three core principles: Equine Comfort &amp; Well-being, Contextual Materiality, and Operational Efficiency. Thus, the resulting layouts are characterized by rigorous zoning that <a href=""https://www.lighthoof.com/blogs/blog/horse-barn-layout-essentials-12-design-secrets-from-top-equestrian-architects?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearly separates the programs</a> into residential (stalls), service (tack, storage, wash, feed), and training spaces (arenas, walkers). The designs also address visual well-being: <a href=""https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavior-of-horses/social-behavior-of-horses?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Horses are social animals</a>, so they strategically position stables to promote sightlines between animals and to the exterior, often employing louvered or open-frame systems. Furthermore, lighting is kept diffuse using materials such as translucent panels to prevent sharp, stress-inducing shadows in arenas. Similarly, circulation paths are designed for the safe, efficient movement of both people and animals.</p>"

<p>Set in the hills near <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/essaouira"">Essaouira</a>, Morocco, DDAR is a modern rustic villa that embodies a dialogue between tradition and contemporaneity, craftsmanship and landscape. Designed collaboratively by architect Othmane Bengebara and the owner, the house is conceived as a living structure rather than a fixed object — a place where architecture becomes a vessel for creation, exchange, and cultural transmission. Built by hand using ancestral techniques, the villa draws from the vernacular forms of rural Morocco, merging local know-how with an environmentally conscious approach to design. Its irregular rhythm, tactile surfaces, and sculptural volumes blend seamlessly into the surrounding terrain, giving the impression that the house has grown organically from the land itself.</p>"
