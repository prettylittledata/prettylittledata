To counter this fundamental lack of perimeter exposure, Vietnamese architects usually employ several strategies oriented towards internal environmental manipulation. This curated collection explores tube houses under 100 m2, where their small size increased the need for absolute spatial economy and the verticalization of function, which directly influenced design decisions across all projects. </p>"

His building plot in the suburban area of Beijing had been left unused for many years. In 2022, he conceived the idea of utilizing it, though the specific manner of how to do so remained uncertain. I remember during our first discussion, he mentioned three possibilities: (1) using it as a second residence for himself, with the possibility of his parents occasionally staying there; (2) converting it into his company's office space after three years; or (3) renting it out if no concrete plans were finalized. Therefore, our design process began by systematically analyzing the corresponding relationships between these three different functional requirements and the spatial layout.</p>"

<p>For a long time, architecture was understood as an essentially individual activity, dependent on the figure of a creative genius and centered on the ability to solve problems through drawing. Over time, this image began to fade. The protagonism once concentrated in a few names reached its peak during the era of the starchitects and gradually became distributed among offices, collectives, and multidisciplinary teams. Today, architects are expanding their boundaries into other fields such as gastronomy, music, design, and the corporate world, applying spatial thinking to address challenges of various kinds. As social, environmental, and political crises deepen, the role of the architect continues to evolve from a solitary author to a mediator, activist, and collective agent of transformation. This shift reflects an ethical awakening and a recognition that design, regulation, and care are inseparable dimensions of contemporary practice.</p>"
