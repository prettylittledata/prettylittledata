<p><em>Introduction</em> — The redevelopment of the Jean Dauger sports complex is an integral element in considering Bayonne's green belt. Reclaimed from ground originally used for military manœuvres and occupied by moats at the foot of the ramparts, this green space, with pleasure gardens and open-air sports facilities, has benefited from its historic and cultural status, giving it a sense of significance and protecting it from invasive urban development.</p>"

<p>Aster, led by chef Joshua Paris, is a new dining destination inspired by its namesake flower, the aster, which also means ""star."" The restaurant's design translates the flower's natural structure—a central disc surrounded by radiating petals—into a spatial experience. Guests gather at the heart of the flower, dining beneath a constellation of light.</p>"

<p>Tinderbox House is, at its core, a practical, understated family retreat, for a successful and local Tasmanian family. Responding to the many natural and manmade constraints of the site, the highly crafted design is an attempt to add to the ecosystem rather than imposing itself on it. The site is a large semi-rural battle-axe block with challenging bushfire exposure, complex biodiversity overlays and a rugged cliff-side coastline to the East and South. The design progressed through a series of iterations based on our desire for a successful passive solar building.</p>"

The investor's brief was to create a monumental space in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/prague"">Prague</a> offering not only Central American cuisine, but also an experience of its culture as such.

<p>Scandinavia is shaped by environmental conditions that test both human endurance and architectural ingenuity, with long winters defined by limited daylight, low sun angles, deep snowfall, and cold winds that transform everyday movement, gathering, and habitation into deliberate acts. In this context, architecture is never neutral, and hospitality is never incidental. Buildings that welcome visitors across cities, forests, and coastlines must respond directly to darkness and cold, not by denying them, but by creating interior worlds that offer orientation, warmth, and psychological relief. The act of welcoming in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/scandinavia"">Scandinavia</a> is therefore inseparable from the climate, grounded in the understanding that shelter, light, and human presence are fundamental resources in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/arctic"">Arctic</a> environments.</p>"

Its implementation responds to the conditions of the terrain, characterized by a steep slope and abundant vegetation, aspects that determine both its spatial organization and its material expression. The social area is located on the highest level of the site, resting on the first floor volume. This arrangement guarantees the best views for the most permanent spaces, framing the treetops and establishing a privileged relationship with the landscape. In turn, the roof of the lower volume is conceived as an accessible terrace, configuring a patio in height that reinforces the continuity between the house and its natural surroundings.</p>"
