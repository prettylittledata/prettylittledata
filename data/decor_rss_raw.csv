<p>In 2018, the City of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/los-angeles"">Los Angeles</a> made available some of its more than 1,700 city-owned parcels to affordable housing developers. Many of these sites are difficult, lying along heavy-traffic corridors or next to freeways. In other instances, the sites are composite parcels that have been left untouched for decades. In LOHA's second collaboration with non-profit developer Holos Communities, this 35,000-square-foot, <strong>54-unit housing project and adjacent paseo</strong> repurpose a 19,814-square-foot triangular site, uniting a traffic island and a former railroad right-of-way. Situated near one of the world's busiest freeway interchanges—the meeting of the 110 and 105 freeways—the design makes a challenging location more livable.</p>"

<p>As the nearby trees age, in no hurry, this scaleless piece will become even smaller. Cornered against a dark forest of Coihues (Nothofagus dombeyi), the concentrated and directionless footprint acquires an axial sense, explicitly asymmetrical, with one high side, perhaps completing an imaginary cube, and with its opposite side with no elevation at all.</p>"

<p>Nestled in Xiaye Village, Zhejiang Province, the Xiaye Zhang Residence represents a sophisticated architectural intervention that reinterprets rural living through a contemporary lens. Designed by STUDIO MOR for a design-literate client, this 474 m² residence transforms a formerly congested family plot into a harmonious composition of built form and landscape.</p>"

<p>Pfaffenhofen is a small village near Heilbronn. It is characterized by an idyllic setting with a church, and half-timbered houses dating from the 16th and 17th centuries in the center of the village, with vineyards rising picturesquely in the background. The village center is now being redensified with a residential building in a cubature typical for the region, which is extraordinary in several respects. For one thing, the way it is built reflects the client's mindset and area of work. As far as possible the aim was to realize a building that was ideally made from natural and renewable raw materials which can be re-introduced into the natural cycle.</p>"
