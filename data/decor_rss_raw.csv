<p>La Doyenne is a renovation and the expansion project of a Victorian house built in 1887, a few steps away from Square Saint-Louis in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/montreal"">Montreal</a>. In a high-density built environment characteristic of the Plateau Mont Royal, the main challenge to meet the desire of its new occupants was to design an extension in the back yard preserving their privacy from the side and rear buildings. The project's singularity comes from the integration of multiple floor level variations. One enters the house through the living room, located half a level above the street, to reach the backyard, slightly recessed into the garden. This intervention aims to create a height offset in relation to the level of the neighboring terraces while reinforcing the verticality of the interior volumes.</p>"

<p>The <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/japan"">Japan</a> Pavilion at the 2025 <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/venice"">Venice</a> Biennale investigates the evolving role of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/artificial-intelligence"">artificial intelligence (AI) </a>in architecture, focusing on the concept of the ""in-between."" Curated by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/jun-aoki"">Jun Aoki, </a>the exhibition runs from May 10 to November 23, 2025, at the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/giardini"">Giardini</a> della Biennale in Venice.

<p>In 2018, the City of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/los-angeles"">Los Angeles</a> made available some of its more than 1,700 city-owned parcels to affordable housing developers. Many of these sites are difficult, lying along heavy-traffic corridors or next to freeways. In other instances, the sites are composite parcels that have been left untouched for decades. In LOHA's second collaboration with non-profit developer Holos Communities, this 35,000-square-foot, <strong>54-unit housing project and adjacent paseo</strong> repurpose a 19,814-square-foot triangular site, uniting a traffic island and a former railroad right-of-way. Situated near one of the world's busiest freeway interchanges—the meeting of the 110 and 105 freeways—the design makes a challenging location more livable.</p>"

<p>As the nearby trees age, in no hurry, this scaleless piece will become even smaller. Cornered against a dark forest of Coihues (Nothofagus dombeyi), the concentrated and directionless footprint acquires an axial sense, explicitly asymmetrical, with one high side, perhaps completing an imaginary cube, and with its opposite side with no elevation at all.</p>"

<p>Nestled in Xiaye Village, Zhejiang Province, the Xiaye Zhang Residence represents a sophisticated architectural intervention that reinterprets rural living through a contemporary lens. Designed by STUDIO MOR for a design-literate client, this 474 m² residence transforms a formerly congested family plot into a harmonious composition of built form and landscape.</p>"
