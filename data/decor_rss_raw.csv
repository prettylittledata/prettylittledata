<p>Laoyuting Pavilion is one of the invited projects of the 2024 Dianchi Art Season: ""Home and Future"". It is located on the southern side of the Water-Forest Art Zone in the Laoyu River Wetland Park at Dianchi Lake. After its completion, it first served as the entrance to the Dianchi Art Festival, and after the festival, the pavilion was permanently preserved as a spatial hint for entering the wetland park, as well as a resting place for visitors. This wetland, filled with groves of bald cypress along the edge of Dianchi Lake, is in fact part of the city's water-purification infrastructure—the final stage of natural filtration before water enters the lake. It is home to many small fish, and city dwellers often come here during leisure time to catch fish, hence the name Laoyu River Wetland. As a pavilion where people rest while fishing, it naturally came to be known as the Laoyuting Pavilion.</p>"

<p>This week's news reflects architecture's simultaneous engagement with cultural reflection, professional legacy, and the material realities of building cities. The passing of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/frank-gehry""> Frank Gehry</a> prompted a broader reassessment of late 20th- and early 21st-century architectural practice, while<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036740/shigeru-ban-named-recipient-of-the-2026-aia-gold-medal""> Shigeru Ban's selection as the recipient of the 2026 AIA Gold Medal</a> brought renewed attention to socially driven design and the profession's public responsibilities. These milestones unfolded alongside wider conversations sparked by<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1036816/on-human-rights-day-perspectives-on-architecture-equity-housing-access-and-safety-worldwide""> Human Rights Day, examining architecture's role in equity, housing access, and safety worldwide</a>, and forward-looking discussions setting the architectural agenda for 2026 through major international events and cultural programs. At the scale of the built environment, these themes are echoed in three projects shaping future urban conditions:<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/powerhouse-company""> Powerhouse Company</a>'s transformation of a former limestone quarry into a mixed-use neighbourhood in Bærum, near<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/oslo""> Oslo</a>; the groundbreaking of Riverside Wharf, a hospitality-led development contributing to the regeneration of<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/miami""> Miami</a>'s River District; and<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/foster-plus-partners""> Foster + Partners</a>' approved retrofit of 1 St James's Square in<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/london""> London</a>, focused on structural retention and long-term urban resilience.</p>"

<p>Luigi Rosselli's new ""build to rent"" homes often feature rammed earth: a slow, sustainable material affordable only for those with the time to build them, deep pockets to cover the costs, or both. Now the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/sydney"">Sydney</a> architect is experimenting with another highly sustainable material on a row of four terraces in Bondi Junction with walls that go up ""like a Lego kit."" Designed as a low-cost version of a terrace, the homes use prefabricated cross-laminated timber (CLT) made from layers of wood stuck together to shrink construction time from ""one-and-a-half years [conventional build] to just six months.""</p>"

<p>Where cities were once shaped by simple structures that could adapt to new uses, they are now packed with rigid dwellings—often designed with a single use in mind and fixed in both layout and lifespan. As climate deadlines tighten, communities demand more resilient, resource-conscious spaces, and work and living patterns continue to shift, this rigidity is becoming a liability. When <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/buildings"">buildings</a> refuse to bend, they are often treated as disposable, triggering cycles of demolition, downtime, and loss. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/adaptability"">Adaptability</a>, once considered an added convenience, is becoming an imperative—something the inaugural <a href=""https://www.adaptablebuilding.club/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Adaptable Building Conference (ABC)</a> in Rotterdam aims to put front and center.</p>"

<p>FEZH reinterprets the spatial logic of Fes El Bali, where clustered dwellings form the foundation of an organic urban fabric. Drawing from this precedent, the project aspires to create a ""minimal urban unit"" that consolidates essential communal functions for healing, culture, and everyday life. Within the gentle alleyways of Hannam-dong, FEZH positions itself as a compact city—an intersection of architecture, nature, and human experience—embodying its name, which merges Fez, Healing, and Hannam-dong.</p>"
