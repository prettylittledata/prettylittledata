<p>We designed and built a two-story wooden house for a family raising children in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/date"">Date</a> City, Fukushima Prefecture. During discussions with the clients, their initial wish was to ""live in a house with a dirt-floored space."" The husband works in agriculture and wanted a place to cook vegetables he grew himself and share meals with his family. They wanted a space outside the house to temporarily store and wash vegetables harvested from their fields. They wanted a place where their young children could play freely and enjoy life. From these key ideas, the house-building journey began with creating a large earthen-floored space that connects the inside and outside, becoming the heart of the family's life.</p>"

<p>Architectural space has long been framed by permanence: rooms for fixed functions, facades that clearly define where exterior ends and interior begins. Yet contemporary life is defined by overlap and transition: between work and living, interior and exterior, privacy and community.

<p>La Doyenne is a renovation and the expansion project of a Victorian house built in 1887, a few steps away from Square Saint-Louis in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/montreal"">Montreal</a>. In a high-density built environment characteristic of the Plateau Mont Royal, the main challenge to meet the desire of its new occupants was to design an extension in the back yard preserving their privacy from the side and rear buildings. The project's singularity comes from the integration of multiple floor level variations. One enters the house through the living room, located half a level above the street, to reach the backyard, slightly recessed into the garden. This intervention aims to create a height offset in relation to the level of the neighboring terraces while reinforcing the verticality of the interior volumes.</p>"
