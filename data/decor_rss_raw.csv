<p>Public schools are an essential tool for addressing current social and environmental issues. Promoting children's well-being, raising their civic, ecological, and social awareness, and reducing class and gender inequalities are the goals that public schools must set for themselves. To achieve these ambitions, the Élisabeth &amp; Robert Badinter School Group is innovating and proposing to rethink public education facilities by creating a new symbiosis between school and nature. Inspired by the French ""open-air school"" movement of the 20th century, this new school offers an alternative to traditional schooling. Here, classes are taught differently, in contact with nature.</p>"

<p>India carries an ancient lineage of tradition that has long shaped the very conception and crafting of its cities. Vastu Shastra is one such tradition, more a science than a belief, intimately woven into the principles of architectural design. The practice remains widespread and highly regarded, with <a href=""https://www.trigunaprojects.com/the-impact-of-vastu-for-house-plans-on-real-estate-sales-and-purchase-choices?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">93% of homes designed to align with Vastu principles</a>. As <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/india"">India</a> urbanizes at an unprecedented pace, projected to add 416 million city dwellers by 2050, Vastu Shastra continues to influence billions of real estate decisions amid the trials of modern city living. How might an 8,000-year-old spatial science evolve to guide the design of cities housing millions?</p>"
