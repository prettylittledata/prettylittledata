<p>The Ternura House project was born from the intention to create a serene and welcoming refuge, set amidst the greenery of the Pass&aacute;rgada condominium in Belo Horizonte. The main inspiration came from the surrounding environment: the street where the house is located is called Alameda da Ternura, and this name brought the idea of translating into architecture an atmosphere of warmth, simplicity, and integration with the landscape. The key concept was a <strong>single-story house, defined by its horizontal layout, that enhances direct contact with the garden and views of the mountains.</strong> Natural materials such as stone, wood, and ceramic tiles were chosen to reinforce this identity of a timeless refuge, deeply rooted in the place.</p>"

<p>Open architectural competitions have long been regarded as gateways for new ideas. They level the playing field by proposing a single call, a clear set of rules, and an evaluation based on the quality of the work, conducted anonymously.

<p><strong>Anchored in the Landscape</strong> - Marhûs is anchored in its context—both in name and in form. The name Marhûs comes from the Frisian language, in which ""Mar"" means lake and ""hûs"" signifies dwelling or house. Marhûs can be understood to mean lake house, referring to a home located near a lake. Positioned on the edge of a lake, the design expresses a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and space. The site—framed by two small harbors, a garden with mature trees, a reed-fringed quay, and a long jetty—opens up to expansive panoramic views across the water. The architectural gesture conveys a sense of hospitality, craftsmanship, and reverence for nature. Approached from the street, Marhûs presents a modest, understated profile that resonates with the fine grain of the village. Facing the lake, however, it asserts itself with a confident presence that responds to the vast openness of the Frisian landscape.</p>"
