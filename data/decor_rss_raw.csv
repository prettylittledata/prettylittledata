<p>Fairmead House is a renovation of a late 20th-century modernist bungalow at the edge of the wild meadows in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Originally built in the 1970s, the house has been reimagined through quiet, precise interventions: gestures that bring new clarity to daily life while improving performance and deepening its connection to the landscape.</p>"

<p>The fragility—and temporal beauty—of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/645768/light-matters-a-flash-back-to-the-glittering-age-of-las-vegas-at-the-neon-museum?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"">neon </a>has captivated audiences since the early 1900s. First shown commercially by French engineer Georges Claude at the 1910 Paris Motor Show, neon spread rapidly, achieving <a href=""https://northamericansigns.com/golden-age-neon/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">broad popularity in the United States from the 1920s</a> through the 1950s. Mid-century America saw it everywhere: from the casinos of the Las Vegas Strip to roadside motor inns along Route 66 and the spectacle of Times Square. By the latter half of the century, however, many signs were scrapped or left to decay, and numerous municipalities restricted neon as visually garish or power-hungry—<a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/why-neon-lights-are-glowing-again-across-the-us?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" target=""_blank"">despite the technology's comparatively modest energy use</a>.

<p>The Ponto C - Cultura e Criatividade project is more than just a new space in the city of Penafiel. It contributes to a transformation in the city&rsquo;s urban fabric. A new entrance and a new connection with the southern area allow for structured expansion, putting aside the phrase that echoed for years as &ldquo;the city split down the middle.&rdquo; A renewed proximity with the historic center: what was once &ldquo;the back&rdquo; is now a carefully designed front, facing Pra&ccedil;a de S. Martinho.</p>"
