<p>Across Europe and North America, pedestrianisation is increasingly being deployed as a context-specific urban strategy shaped by distinct economic, social, and spatial pressures. As cities continue to reassess the role of streets in the wake of economic shifts, climate pressures, and changing mobility patterns, pedestrianisation is emerging as a tool in current urban transformation efforts. Across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/london"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">London</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/new-york"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/houston"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Houston</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/stockholm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stockholm</a>, ongoing pedestrian-first projects are testing different pathways toward more resilient and walkable cities, ranging from statutory planning and capital construction to research-driven visioning. London's Oxford <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/street"">Street</a> is advancing through consultation and governance reform to address retail decline; New York's Paseo Park is moving from a temporary pandemic intervention into permanent infrastructure; Houston is accelerating the pedestrianisation of its downtown core in preparation for a global sporting event; and Stockholm's Superline is using design research to rethink the future of an inner-city motorway. These initiatives reveal how pedestrianisation is being actively negotiated, designed, and built today, adapting to local motivations while converging on a shared objective of streets that perform as resilient public spaces rather than traffic conduits.</p>"
