<p>This project is an extension and renovation of a 40-year-old clinic located in Mie Prefecture, Japan. The existing reinforced concrete building, constructed in 1984, houses a dental clinic on the ground floor and a residence on the second floor. At the time of its construction, concepts of universal design were not yet widely recognized. The surrounding area was more rural and tranquil than it is today, and the appearance of this pure white RC clinic must have made a strong impression on the landscape. Its elevated plinth, dignified stance, and geometric composition based on strict horizontality and verticality created a sharp contrast with the surrounding fields, reflecting an era when medical architecture was expected to possess a strong sense of symbolism and autonomy.</p>"

<p>A proposal is made for an architecture that intertwines with the garden, maximizing the perimeter of contact with the landscape and blurring the boundaries between the built environment and nature. In this location in Madrid, that relationship with the surroundings takes on a unique value. To achieve this, a compact volume is deliberately abandoned in favor of an ascending layout that evokes certain works by Alfaro. The project aims to resolve a dichotomy: to be both geometric and organic. Although its structure is precise, the inhabitant perceives it as something natural, almost as if it has randomly settled into the place.</p>"

The simple fire pit was one of humanity's earliest spatial devices: a place for warmth, food, storytelling, and ritual. Around it, space took shape through proximity rather than enclosure, through shared presence rather than prescribed use. The fire organized bodies in a circle, fostered alliances, and turned survival into collective life. Today, this ancestral logic persists: architecture has the potential of bringing people together not by commanding how they gather, but by creating the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1037387/architecture-that-shapes-health-lessons-of-design-and-well-being-in-2025?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">conditions that make togetherness possible</a>.</p>"

<p>The home carries multiple identities as <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/924549/home-office-23-solutions-for-more-flexible-workspaces?ad_medium=widget&amp;ad_name=related-article&amp;ad_content=1026607"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">shelter, sanctuary, workplace, and stage for daily rituals</a>. In recent years, its role has expanded in unprecedented ways. The pandemic, notably, coerced the home to act as <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/924549/home-office-23-solutions-for-more-flexible-workspaces"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">a site of extraordinary adaptability to absorb functions once delegated to schools, offices, gyms, and studios</a>. This transformation has shifted how we imagine <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/domesticity?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">domestic</a> life, urging us to think of the home not simply as a backdrop for activity but as a dynamic framework for living, producing, and creating. Within this expanded understanding, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/art"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">artists</a> find themselves asking a renewed question: <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1028863/living-and-creating-12-homes-with-art-studios-in-latin-america?ad_source=search&amp;ad_medium=search_result_articles"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">how can the home allow the flexibility needed for creative practice?</a></p>"

<p>Lotus Clubhouse was conceived as a living organism that breathes in harmony with the terrain and surrounding natural environment. Rather than standing as an isolated architectural object, the building appears to emerge from the ground itself, shaped by natural slopes, layers of vegetation, and its orientation toward the lake. From the earliest design stages, the project was defined as a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and local context. As a result, the boundaries between built form and nature gradually dissolve, allowing the clubhouse to exist simultaneously as architecture and landscape, a place of shelter for people and an extended habitat for nature.</p>"

<p>Situated on the streetside of Ivan Hill terrace, a Silver Lake ADU comprises <strong>two pods which appear to float above the hillside</strong>—a large, shimmering reflective ocean blue cube clad in ribbed tiles and its counterpart, a stepped greige volume with black rectilinear window frames. Consisting of <strong>staggered floorplates, the form responds to the site as it follows the hillside</strong> with short runs of stairs to connect each level of the two-storey ADU.</p>"

<p>The Porcelain Source Museum is located on the former site of Longsheng Village in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province. To the north of the site are the remains of primitive porcelain kilns dating from the Shang through the Warring States periods, while a small river runs along the southern edge, spanned by the Wukang Shishe Bridge, originally constructed during the Yuan dynasty. Within the site, portions of the original village dwellings have been preserved, reconstructed, or adapted and incorporated into the museum's exhibition spaces, serving as thematic galleries or support facilities, thereby allowing elements of the site's historical fabric to be sustained. The main body of the museum is composed of two parts. One part extends longitudinally along the riverbank, adopting a rectilinear plan while presenting an overall architectural form of an organic character.</p>"

<p>Urban Sparkle transforms a restaurant site in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ho-chi-minh-city"">Ho Chi Minh City</a> into a luminous urban beacon through an origami-inspired steel roof that captures and refracts light throughout the day. Located along a 30-meter street frontage in Thao Dien, the project sits directly in front of Ho Chi Minh City's first metro line while surrounded by high-rise residential towers. This creates a unique visibility condition where the building is viewed from three distinct elevations—street level, passing trains, and tower windows above.</p>"
