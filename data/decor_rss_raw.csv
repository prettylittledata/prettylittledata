<p>B.Red House is situated within an urban development governed by fixed planning regulations, where the latitude for architectural self-expression is narrowed by the imperative to maintain a unified overall appearance. The extended sameness across successive building masses has, perhaps inevitably, produced a sense of order bordering on monotony—an environment in which individual houses appear to share a common formal vocabulary. Within such a context, the pursuit of self-definition becomes challenging, as each building must sustain its own internal logic while still operating within the predetermined limits of an established urban typology.</p>"

<p>The house is located in one of the villages near Warsaw, close to a river, surrounded by a gently sloping mixed forest. The owners say they bought it by accident when they met a real estate agent while walking their dog, who led them to a pyramid-like building hidden among the trees. It turned out to be an uninhabited residence, which the local militia commander had dreamed of owning. The building was constructed between 1976 and 1981 during a period of crisis and low availability of building materials. It was built from whatever could be obtained from construction sites and renovations of infrastructure facilities: for example, the ceilings were made of tram rails, which were laid at a slight slope above the ground floor, as they pierced through the outer wall and became part of the terrace structure. Thanks to its slight slope, the terrace was naturally drained. At the same time, the floor in the living room behind the wall had a noticeable slope, and the wall was blackened by the cold and moisture penetrating through the rails. The original construction documentation consisted of a few A4 pages with very sketchy drawings and one page of laconic description.</p>"

<p>Are living spaces getting smaller? As cities densify and the global population continues its steady migration toward urban centers—projected to reach around 70% by 2050—domestic space is becoming increasingly compressed. Rising land prices, high construction costs, and a surge in single-person households push developers toward smaller units and tighter floor plans. At the same time, cultural shifts toward resource efficiency and minimal living support this move. <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1020291/design-solutions-for-small-living-maximizing-space-in-apartments-under-40-square-meters"">Shrinking living spaces</a> require fewer materials, consume less energy, and encourage people to live closer to their means. </p>"
