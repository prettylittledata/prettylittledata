<p>London-based architecture practice Mosley Thorold has transformed a Victorian villa into a coherent and materially rich family home. Once remodelled into a flamboyant 1990s party house, the existing property featured a number of bizarre circulation conditions including a poorly detailed mezzanine walkway leading nowhere but breaking up the double height space and views of the garden at the rear. This fragmented the plan, and cluttered the space leaving the house with disoriented circulation unsuitable for family life. The refurbishment sought to restore flow, bring light deeply into the plan and create a home to support everyday life with ease.</p>"

<p><em>A Climatic Refuge in Stone: BGA's School Blossoms Like a Calanque in the City - </em>The Les Fabriques school complex, designed by BGA in the heart of Marseille's Littorale urban development zone, brings together a nursery school and an elementary school, each with its own reception areas, circulation spaces, and generously lit and ventilated classrooms. On a highly constrained plot, the agency developed a compact, vertical project, freeing the center of the site for the preschool playground, while the elementary school playgrounds and educational gardens unfold in tiers up to the rooftop. At the request of the City, a rooftop sports facility — half a basketball court, an athletics track, and a catamaran sail-like mesh — completes the program and becomes a true gathering space for the neighborhood.</p>"
