That plan, in force since 2017, required the facility to be moved east of the boardwalk that links the local beaches, with the consequent demolition of the existing structure. Formally, the building is defined by its annular geometry, which shields users from prevailing northerly winds on the south‑facing terrace while reducing visual impact by aligning the ring's internal void with one of the dune's highest points.
