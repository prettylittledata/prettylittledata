<p>The project is located in La Vicentina, a traditional middle-class neighborhood in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/quito"">Quito</a>, Ecuador. <strong>The location of the lot on a staircase makes it impossible to have parking, but far from being a disadvantage, it aligns with the lifestyle of the owner, who is a frequent bicycle user. </strong>In addition, the hillside topography provides an opportunity to take advantage of the view towards Cerro Auqui. Added to these conditions are the client's needs:<strong> a home for his own use, a smaller one for his daughter, and a versatile common space that can function as a workshop or social area.</strong></p>"
