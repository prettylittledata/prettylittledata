<p>The Switzerland Innovation Park, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/allschwil"">Allschwil</a>, home to life sciences enterprises, continues to grow. The sustainable Hortus office building creates a modern and flexible working environment for a new generation of technology companies that are settling in the Basel metropolitan region. Our client, Senn, commissioned us to design a radically sustainable office building made of renewable and recyclable building materials. The brief initiated a design process aimed at combining the lowest possible grey energy during construction, an energy-optimized concept during operation, and a surplus of self-generated energy. After 31 years, the building, which has around 600 workplaces, will have fully offset the energy used during its construction.
