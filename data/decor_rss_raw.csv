Commissioned by private clients as a retreat for a couple, while also serving as a place to gather their children and grandchildren, the brief called for a contemporary summer house with a calm atmosphere, durable materials, and a layout that could support both family gatherings and smaller stays throughout the year.

<p>In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/architecture"">architecture</a>, most practices revolve around delivering projects to clients. Offices are shaped by deadlines, budgets, and clear briefs. While this structure produces buildings, it rarely leaves space for architects to question broader issues — about how we live, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1009199/our-cities-arent-dead-yet"">how cities are changing</a>, or what the future demands of design. But alongside this production-focused system, a quieter movement has emerged: <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/studio"">studios</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/collective"">collectives</a>, and <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/foundation"">foundations</a> that prioritize research, experimentation, and reflection. These are the architecture think tanks — spaces designed not to build immediately, but to think first.</p>"
