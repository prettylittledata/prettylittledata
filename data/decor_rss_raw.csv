<p>This house was built in the 1980s, following the design codes of the time: a semi-subterranean ground floor housing the garage and boiler room, a raised floor above the garden for the living areas, and an attic converted into bedrooms. In the early 2000s, an extension was built on the garden side to accommodate a large living room, but it quickly showed signs of deterioration. After a decade of legal proceedings, the owners were finally compensated for the damages suffered. They then decided to move on from those difficult years by considering the construction of a new house. However, the architect proposed a different approach: to retain as much of the existing structure as possible and demolish only the damaged sections.</p>"

Architects are learning that <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1033320/how-not-to-build-architecture-by-the-absence-of-intervention"">doing less can mean designing more</a>, and this shift marks the emergence of what might be called an <em>architecture of restraint</em>: a practice defined by care, maintenance, and the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1031192/the-european-citizens-initiative-houseeurope-receives-the-2025-obel-award?ad_campaign=special-tag"">deliberate choice not to build</a>.</p>"
