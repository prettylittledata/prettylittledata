<p>For decades, musical performances and other non-religious public gatherings were strictly controlled by the Saudi government. This practically confined most forms of public cultural expression, especially music, to the privacy of homes and gated communities. By 2016, the country witnessed wholesale social, cultural, and economic transformations to wean off religious extremism, improve the quality of life, and attract foreign investment. In 2019, a small group of entrepreneurs established Middle Beast (widely known by the acronym MDL Beast) to launch a series of large-scale music festivals across the country. This historic moment represented a dramatic shift in common attitudes towards public gatherings. More importantly, it is considered the first time that the hidden underground culture of electronic music was accessible to the public.</p>"

<p>Stretching along the Atlantic coast at the southern tip of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/florida"">Florida</a>, Miami is often introduced through postcard views of beaches, palm trees, and glass towers facing the water. Yet, behind this familiar image lies a city shaped by migration, tourism, and real estate cycles, where architecture has repeatedly been used to project new identities and reinvent the urban landscape. From early resort hotels and the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/art-deco"">Art Deco</a> façades of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/south-beach"">South Beach</a> to experimental high-rises and cultural institutions on the bay, the built environment offers a way to read how <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/miami"">Miami</a> negotiates climate, economy, and everyday life.</p>"

<p>Villa Omah Prana is a circular home in the highlands of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/payangan"">Payangan</a>. The project follows one clear idea: a ring-shaped plan that places all rooms along the perimeter, orienting them toward the surrounding landscape. The living room opens up to both the courtyard and the exterior, creating a fluid transition, while the more private spaces — bedrooms and enclosed areas — remain air-conditioned and sheltered.</p>"
