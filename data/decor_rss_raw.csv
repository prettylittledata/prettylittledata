<p>As artificial intelligence tools sweep through creative industries, architecture stands at a pivotal moment: how to adopt systems that amplify design thinking without eroding authorship or craft. To understand how the profession is responding, <a href=""http://airilab.com?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">AIRI Lab</a> surveyed designers and leaders from practices including <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/lwk-and-partners"">LWK+P</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/mvrdv"">MVRDV</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/gensler"">Gensler</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/buro-ole-scheeren"">Büro Ole Scheeren</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/cube-design"">CUBE</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/huayi-design"">HUAYI</a>, and others. Their responses reveal a nuanced, pragmatic view: AI is a collaborator rather than a substitute.</p>"

<p>The project is situated in Xueshan Village, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/changping-district"">Changping District</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/beijing"">Beijing</a>, at the junction between urban and rural areas. It only takes about 30 minutes to drive to the city's Second Ring Road from here. This location is considered conveniently accessible in Beijing, a megacity. The homeowner is a fellow alumni of mine. His building plot in the suburban area of Beijing had been left unused for many years. In 2022, he conceived the idea of utilizing it, though the specific manner of how to do so remained uncertain. I remember during our first discussion, he mentioned three possibilities: (1) using it as a second residence for himself, with the possibility of his parents occasionally staying there; (2) converting it into his company's office space after three years; or (3) renting it out if no concrete plans were finalized. Therefore, our design process began by systematically analyzing the corresponding relationships between these three different functional requirements and the spatial layout.</p>"

<p>M.Casa reinterprets the spirit of the traditional Vietnamese home, balancing simplicity and warmth within the fast-paced rhythm of contemporary urban life. Located on a 6 × 20-meter plot in a small alley of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/ho-chi-minh-city"">Ho Chi Minh City</a>, the house is surrounded by dense concrete structures. The young couple who owns the home sought a quiet, natural, and intimate environment to welcome their growing family.</p>"

<p>The house is situated on a raised section of the lot, taking advantage of the gentle topography and deep views of the surrounding rural landscape. <strong>The main volume is arranged in a strictly longitudinal manner, aligned with the predominant boundaries of the land and integrating into the terrain through a green platform that follows the natural movement of the soil.</strong> The project is organized around two simultaneous formal operations: a monolithic body of continuous walls in earthy tones that creates a blind front towards the vehicular access and another that is completely permeable towards the landscape; and a support pavilion, with a lighter and more contemporary language, characterized by black carpentry, glass planes, and horizontal sunshades.</p>"

<p><strong>Urban planning</strong>. A secondary school for 1000 pupils was to be founded and built for the newly developed Reininghaus district. The 4-storey development of the AHS Reininghaus extends in an L-shape along the streets Am Steinfeld and Margarethe-SchütteLihotzky-Straße and forms the noise-protecting, north-eastern end of Quartier 12. The central stepping towards the south-west fragments the compact, L-shaped building mass, creating a striking sequence of terrace incisions.</p>"
