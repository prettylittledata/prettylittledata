<p><a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/public-space"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Public space</a> is often understood as belonging to no one in particular, collectively accessible yet institutionally maintained, yet a growing number of initiatives are challenging this assumption by testing shared management and distributed ownership models.

Elsewhere in the city, community gardens operating under the <em>Main Verte</em> framework demonstrate a self-managed model, in which public and private landowners retain ownership while delegating day-to-day control to citizen associations for food production and shared use. In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/new-york"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York</a>, <em>The Common Corner</em> represents a third pathway, based on institutional collaboration and participatory design, where public agencies, nonprofits, designers, and residents co-produce public space within a public housing context. Taken together, these three cases suggest that care, authorship, and responsibility can be distributed across citizens and institutions, producing more resilient, locally grounded urban environments.</p>"

The concept originates from the site; the high-pile dock, shipbuilding cranes, pump house, and flood control wall all evoke memories of the industrial history of the Zhonghua Shipyard. The super-scale shipyard machinery and infrastructure on the site presents a state of being static yet potentially dynamic. We hoped to extend this site character into the design of the Floating Cabin, transforming it into a contemporary architectural space that transcends conventional types. ""Cabin"" refers to the mechanical aesthetics of the shipyard industry, and also to a functional space that accommodates variable content; while ""floating"" represents a suspended structural state.</p>"
