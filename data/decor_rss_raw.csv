<p>January 26 marks the<a href=""https://www.un.org/en/observances/clean-energy-day?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> International Day for Clean Energy</a>, an initiative aimed at raising awareness and mobilizing action for an inclusive transition from fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power generation systems with lower greenhouse gas emissions and fewer pollutants. The term ""clean"" signals a fundamental shift away from extractive, finite, and exhaustible <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/energy"">energy</a> sources toward systems based on <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/renewable-energy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">renewable resources</a> or on capturing energy embedded in natural processes. In a world grappling with <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/climate-crisis"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">climate change</a>, clean energy plays an important role in reducing emissions and expanding access to reliable power. However, being labeled ""clean"" does not exempt these systems from the impacts associated with their production, deployment, and commercialization. In this context, architectural knowledge related to space, materiality, and habitation becomes relevant for supporting a transition toward energy systems that are sustainable over time. As stated by the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/united-nations"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">United Nations</a>, the science is clear: to limit climate change, reliance on fossil fuels must end, and buildings must be heated, lit, and electrified through clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable power sources.</p>"

<p>Architecture is increasingly asked to do less, not more. In environments shaped by constant movement, noise, and expectation, spaces that allow people to stay, pause, and be present have become both rarer and more necessary. Many public and semi-public places are designed to keep people moving, consuming, or reacting, leaving little room for <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1029304/wellbeing-and-slow-spaces-can-architecture-distort-the-way-we-experience-time?ad_campaign=normal-tag"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">lingering, observation, or simply being without a reason</a>.</p>"

<p>Nicolas Hugoo Architecture has completed <strong>36 social housing units</strong>, LA Architectures a <strong>media library and 75 family flats</strong>, and the atelier Régis Roudil has completed a <strong>student residence hall with 75 flats</strong> in the Paul Bourget neighborhood of the 13th arrondissement in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/paris"">Paris</a>. The operation to upgrade the Paul-Bourget neighborhood began in 2014, aiming to break the isolation of the site and ensure the lasting improvement of the cityscape for its inhabitants. Led by Elogie Siempand Semapa and designed by Urban Act, this ambitious urban renewal project achieved the creation of a new generation of flats on this 4-hectare site and restored the presence of greenery and biodiversity.</p>"
