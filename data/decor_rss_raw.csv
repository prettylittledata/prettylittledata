In his interview with <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/louisiana-channel"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Louisiana Channel</a>, Zhu Pei describes architecture as an artistic discipline that, like poetry, relies on openness, imagination, and the creation of new experiences.

<p>By shifting rotation away from traditional hinges and distributing weight vertically, pivot doors were developed to address a specific architectural challenge: how to move large, heavy door panels with precision, durability, and minimal visual interference. These systems allow doors to grow significantly in scale, weight, and material ambition, often blurring the line between door, wall, and architectural surface. Over time, this technical innovation has expanded the role of doors in architecture, allowing them to operate not only as points of access, but also as spatial thresholds, compositional devices, and expressive elements within the building envelope.</p>"

It offers an ideal environment to experience the evolution of fragrance creation.

<p>From building codes to <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/mobility"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">mobility </a>restrictions and new diplomatic roles within city governments, climate policy is increasingly being shaped at the local level through a widening range of legislative and institutional tools. Cities as varied as <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/sydney"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sydney</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/boston"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Boston</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/new-york"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/paris"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paris</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/city/miami"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Miami</a>, and dozens across <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/latin-america"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Latin America</a> are adopting targeted strategies that reflect their distinct environmental pressures and governance structures.

Together, these approaches illustrate how territorial management is evolving in response to the accelerating <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/climate-crisis"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">climate crisis</a>, and how local governments are experimenting with regulation and collaboration to confront challenges that are at once global and deeply place-specific.</p>"

<p>Residence AV is a courtyard house located in a dense residential neighborhood in Bruges, Belgium. Designed by YAMA architects, the project responds to a paradoxical brief: a strong desire for connection to the surrounding context combined with an equally strong need for privacy.
