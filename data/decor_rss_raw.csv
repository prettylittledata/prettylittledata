<p><em>Site: Ecological Restoration</em> - The design team and clients observed that the southern area of this volcano, supporting only sparse herb species, contrasted sharply with the lush vegetation surrounding the volcanoes. Collaborating with geologists and local herders, the team investigated the cause. The site has undergone erosion for approximately 150,000 years. The volcanic cone slumped into nine hills, now covered in soft grassland, and blended into the steppe. Located southeast of the cone, the hotel site is leeward to the northwest wind, resulting in snow and sand accumulation. Harsh soil conditions make plant growth difficult. Therefore, the hotel was deliberately sited over two-meter-deep sand pits to prevent their expansion, replace them with a new ecosystem, and restore vitality. Strategies include a snow barrier wall to retain water, protect the soil, and create a better environment for planting.</p>"
