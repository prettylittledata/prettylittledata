While domestic pets like cats and dogs are common muses, the particular needs of horses present a unique challenge when designing <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/stable"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">stables</a>. Since the horses, who are the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/search/projects/categories/stable"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">stable's </a>primary inhabitants, cannot articulate their needs, design relies on the rigorous requirements dictated by human caretakers, requiring a balance between streamlined human operations and maximized horse comfort and safety. Architects often seem to address this through three core principles: Equine Comfort &amp; Well-being, Contextual Materiality, and Operational Efficiency. Thus, the resulting layouts are characterized by rigorous zoning that <a href=""https://www.lighthoof.com/blogs/blog/horse-barn-layout-essentials-12-design-secrets-from-top-equestrian-architects?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">clearly separates the programs</a> into residential (stalls), service (tack, storage, wash, feed), and training spaces (arenas, walkers). The designs also address visual well-being: <a href=""https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavior-of-horses/social-behavior-of-horses?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Horses are social animals</a>, so they strategically position stables to promote sightlines between animals and to the exterior, often employing louvered or open-frame systems. Furthermore, lighting is kept diffuse using materials such as translucent panels to prevent sharp, stress-inducing shadows in arenas. Similarly, circulation paths are designed for the safe, efficient movement of both people and animals.</p>"

Today, as global challenges demand more adaptive and human-centered responses, architects are rethinking what infrastructure can be: not just a framework for movement and utility, but a catalyst for ecological restoration, cultural continuity, and civic imagination. The following unbuilt projects, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/contact"">submitted by the ArchDaily community,</a> explore this expanded role of infrastructure, where airports, bridges, industrial parks, and pedestrian networks become architectural expressions of connection and care.</p>"

<p>As cities grow denser and the boundaries between work, learning, and leisure blur, new urban models must emerge—ones that prioritize people, climate resilience, and balance with nature. Oriente Green Campus, located in Lisbon's eastern business district, embodies this vision. Transforming an abandoned commercial complex into a contemporary green hub, the project unites education, work, and landscape within a vibrant and interconnected ecosystem.</p>"

<p>The GF House is a single-family home located in the commune of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/frutillar"">Frutillar</a>, Los Lagos Region, Chile. It is positioned at the highest point of the subdivision, offering a privileged view of Lake Llanquihue and the Osorno and Calbuco volcanoes. The project strategies are based on <strong>enhancing the views towards natural landmarks and taking advantage of sunlight to achieve greater energy efficiency.</strong></p>"

<p>At the end of 2018, the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/yueyang"">Yueyang</a> Port Industrial Heritage Park officially opened, retaining elements from the industrial era such as gantry cranes, railways, tower cranes, and warehouse structures, while coexisting with both historical districts and the future city. The ecological park is located to the west of Dongting Lake and borders the Yueyang Tower Scenic Area, Bianhe Street, and Dongting South Road, forming the most important public space resource in the historical core of Yueyang. However, one shortcoming was its lack of service facilities in the waterfront area. Although this pitfall received many criticisms, any additional construction in this thoroughly de-industrialized area is impossible due to new zoning restrictions. However, the Tourism Development Conference brought a unique opportunity through special policies, offering a chance to enhance the Yueyang Port Industrial Heritage Park further.</p>"
