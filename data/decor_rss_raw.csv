<p>Moon Bay Waterfall marks the threshold of Mount Wuyi National Park and is the first landscape encountered upon entering the park. In 2023, CLAB Architects was commissioned to construct a viewing platform at this site. The waterfall originates from an artificial dam built in 1979 for hydrological regulation. Crescent-shaped in plan, it lends Moon Bay its name. Over decades of interaction between human intervention and natural processes, the dam has been fully absorbed into its environment. Upstream, the water settles into a calm surface; downstream, erosion exposes massive river stones. Together, these elements form a place in the phenomenological sense—close to the ground, yet acting as a center that brings sky, mountain, and water into relation.</p>"

The mission of the visible trees is to keep the rest latent, and only when we realize that the visible landscape hides other invisible landscapes do we feel ourselves to be inside a forest.&rdquo;&mdash; Meditations on Don Quixote.

<p>An existing 40-year-old office building is stripped back to its structure and completely reimagined for the present. The original massing logics are recovered and emphasized. What used to be a confusing and run-down muddle of geometric clashes is now untangled and rearticulated as if the building is composed of twelve separate buildings, each with its own cladding logic and interior atmosphere.</p>"

<p>The recently inaugurated exhibition <a href=""http://www.galerie-architecture.fr/en/exposition.php?ID=249&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">matière en résonance</a> (""resonant matter"") brings together a wide range of models and a curated selection of photographs to present <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/office/sauerbruch-hutton"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">sauerbruch hutton</a>'s ongoing exploration of timber. The exhibition starts from the premise that while the age of concrete defined the twentieth century, the early twenty-first century has seen <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/timber-buildings"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">a worldwide resurgence of timber</a>, a much older building material. Timber is presented as offering ""a different version of modernity"" and as the subject of renewed interest that reawakens long-standing collective imaginaries. Over more than two decades, the Berlin-based architecture practice has explored the possibilities of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/996319/the-meteoric-rise-of-cross-laminated-timber-construction-50-projects-that-use-engineered-wood-architecture"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">timber construction</a>, from façade elements to load-bearing structures and modular systems. The exhibition reflects the results of this sustained investigation, reinforcing both technical innovation and the embodied qualities of timber across a diverse range of European contexts. The exhibition will be on view from 3 to 28 February 2026 at the Galerie d'Architecture de Paris.</p>"

<p>Many of the spatial ideas we now associate with contemporary architecture, collective use, and bodily experience did not originate in buildings alone. In <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1034102/teaching-empathy-new-approaches-to-architecture-education-in-latin-america"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Latin America</a>, these ideas were often explored first through art, at a moment when <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/1030983/learning-from-artists-new-perspectives-on-public-space"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">artists</a> were actively questioning how space could be occupied, shared, and experienced beyond traditional forms.</p>"
