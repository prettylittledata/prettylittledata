Both the water volume in the dry season and the number of visitors in the off-season seemed to still be rousing from their winter slumber.

<p>'French family looking for an apartment to settle in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/madrid"">Madrid</a> for an indefinite period of time'. With this headline, Marion and Paul Franck, a couple with three young children - Leo, Romeo and Zöe - who until then had lived, due to his work in the aeronautical industry, five years in Toulouse, another two in Reunion Island, one in Washington and the last four in London, presented themselves in the studio at the end of 2022. The difference with previous destinations is that Madrid now appears to be the place they have chosen to settle permanently. And they do so by acquiring a 151 m2 dwelling located on the top floor of a residential building constructed at the beginning of the 20th century in the Justicia neighborhood, near Gran Vía and Chueca, in the center of Madrid. With a marked longitudinal character and a floor plan organized around three courtyards, paradoxically, despite being a penthouse, the dwelling does not establish notable links with the surrounding urban profile. Rather, as if it were the shell of an armadillo, it is closed and protected from the outside. For this purpose, it has an extensive roof: a 200 m2 surface of undulating and opaque tiles, made up of 7 roofs of different slopes and lengths and consisting of a framework of wooden beams, many of them darkened, in poor condition and hidden behind a false ceiling. </p>"

<p>The Limbo Museum is a new institution dedicated to architecture, art, and design based in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/country/ghana"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ghana</a>, <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/west-africa"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">West Africa</a>. The museum challenges the concept of the ruin, operating from a formerly abandoned <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/brutalism"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brutalist estate</a> that currently conveys the image of an unfinished building. The project was founded by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/limbo-accra"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Limbo Accra</a>, a spatial design and research-based practice established in 2018 by <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/dominique-petit-frere"">Dominique Petit-Frère</a> and Emil Grip, dedicated to ""unlocking the potential of unfinished buildings across West Africa and beyond."" On October 31, 2025, the museum opened its first public exhibition, <em>On the Other Side of Languish</em> by Reginald Sylvester II, developed through the institution's visiting artist residency program.</p>"

<p>This curated selection of projects from the<a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/venice-architecture-biennale-2025""> 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale</a> explores how architects and designers are rethinking the relationship between the built environment and water in response to the global climate crisis. As sea levels rise and extreme weather events increase, water is no longer a distant threat but an immediate design condition. Rather than resisting it, these projects look at how architecture can coexist with, adapt to, and even regenerate through natural forces. Together, they suggest a shift toward working with the elements, acknowledging <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/water"">water</a> not as a limit to construction but as an active participant in shaping future environments.</p>"

<p>The history of the <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/olympic-games"">Olympic Games</a>, while marked by athletic achievement, is consistently contrasted by infrastructure challenges.
