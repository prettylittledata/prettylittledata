<p>""We know we are not born to die,"" often said Brazilian architect Paulo Mendes da Rocha. ""We are born to continue."" In architecture, this idea of continuity lies at the heart of heritage, not as a static inheritance, but as something that endures, transforms, and is constantly reinterpreted. Yet what continues, and what is allowed to disappear, is never neutral. Decisions about preservation are shaped by power, memory, and value, raising a fundamental question for contemporary practice: who defines what is worth carrying forward, and for whom?</p>"

<p>""In various regions of the planet, nature imposes adverse conditions on the human body. In these places, designing a building is almost like creating a garment: an artifact that protects and offers comfort. This challenge requires technological performance that must be combined with aesthetics. Making human beings feel good involves more than just meeting notions of comfort and safety; it's also a question of working with spaces in their symbolic and perceptual dimensions.""

If designing a building in normal circumstances already presents numerous complexities, it's not hard to imagine the additional challenges when developing something in an extreme environment, such as locations with very high or low temperatures, or in places susceptible to corrosion, radiation, and more. In this article, we will explore the difficulties, the main solutions and the materials used in these contexts.</p>"

From the area along Wujingkui and the fengshui-pond, the main peak of Luofu Mountain is visible. Following the launch of the Nankunshan-Luofushan Rim Pioneer Zone Architectural Art Project , Xutian Village was selected as our site due to its typical characteristics. It is carved out of the disparate leftover spaces behind the houses of 14 villagers. These spaces are linked along the fengshui-pond to form a continuous, narrow belt over 120 meters long and about 1,000 square meters in area. While sequentially connected, each of these 14 plots exists in its own unique state,currently filled with temporary sheds and toilets built by the villagers.</p>"

<p>Arupo rises serenely before the Ilal&oacute; volcano, in the Cornejo neighborhood of Conocoto.<strong> It is the home of a couple who embrace retirement not as an ending but as a threshold into a different time: slower in work, yet more intense in love for their children and grandchildren. </strong>An intimate refuge, yet open&mdash;ready to welcome family, friends, and the flow of life itself.</p>"

<p>In Milano, on the southern edge of the city, Casa LL originates from the reuse and transformation of a postmodern office building into a private residence. The project focused on shaping the void, the space between solids, through light and through raw, abstract materials.</p>"
