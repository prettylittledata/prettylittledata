The house is situated on a 4 × 20 meter plot that gradually narrows toward the rear, presenting familiar constraints of Vietnam's tube houses: a deep, elongated layout with limited access to natural light and ventilation. The building has only two open sides: an east-facing frontage that receives morning sunlight and a side façade bordering a narrow alley, offering an opportunity to introduce additional daylight into the interior.</p>"

<p>The Requena house is located in a gated community on the outskirts of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Its implementation responds to the conditions of the terrain, characterized by a steep slope and abundant vegetation, aspects that determine both its spatial organization and its material expression. The social area is located on the highest level of the site, resting on the first floor volume. This arrangement guarantees the best views for the most permanent spaces, framing the treetops and establishing a privileged relationship with the landscape. In turn, the roof of the lower volume is conceived as an accessible terrace, configuring a patio in height that reinforces the continuity between the house and its natural surroundings.</p>"

<p>London-based architecture practice Mosley Thorold has transformed a Victorian villa into a coherent and materially rich family home. Once remodelled into a flamboyant 1990s party house, the existing property featured a number of bizarre circulation conditions including a poorly detailed mezzanine walkway leading nowhere but breaking up the double height space and views of the garden at the rear. This fragmented the plan, and cluttered the space leaving the house with disoriented circulation unsuitable for family life. The refurbishment sought to restore flow, bring light deeply into the plan and create a home to support everyday life with ease.</p>"
