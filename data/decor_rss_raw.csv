<p><strong>Anchored in the Landscape</strong> - Marhûs is anchored in its context—both in name and in form. The name Marhûs comes from the Frisian language, in which ""Mar"" means lake and ""hûs"" signifies dwelling or house. Marhûs can be understood to mean lake house, referring to a home located near a lake. Positioned on the edge of a lake, the design expresses a continuous dialogue between architecture, landscape, and space. The site—framed by two small harbors, a garden with mature trees, a reed-fringed quay, and a long jetty—opens up to expansive panoramic views across the water. The architectural gesture conveys a sense of hospitality, craftsmanship, and reverence for nature. Approached from the street, Marhûs presents a modest, understated profile that resonates with the fine grain of the village. Facing the lake, however, it asserts itself with a confident presence that responds to the vast openness of the Frisian landscape.</p>"

From Gropius's <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/bauhaus"">Bauhaus</a> in 1919 to Arcosanti's desert experiments in the 1970s, architecture operated as a form of cultural prophecy. Built form was the argument. The drawing was the vision. Today, we live in a world that remarkably resembles what the starchitects of the 1900s imagined - modular construction, interconnected digital cities, and automated systems. Yet contemporary architecture rarely proposes culture with the same totalizing confidence. </p>"

<p>DE PEUS A TERRA (i el cap pels núvols) is a building with 50 social housing units in the Bon Pastor neighborhood of <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/barcelona"">Barcelona</a>, where common sense and passion come together, unapologetically celebrating community while carefully tending to the domestic sphere. <strong>Our building is part of the transformation of “las casas baratas de Bon Pastor” (the cheap houses of Bon Pastor), a housing complex that was created to provide shelter for all those workers who came to Barcelona to work at the 1929 International Exposition. Since 2002, this complex of 784 single-story homes with interior courtyards has been replaced by high-rise multi-family buildings</strong>... including ours, with a ground floor and six stories!</p>"

<p>Designed by 2Portzamparc, the China National Convention Center Phase II in <a href=""https://www.archdaily.com/tag/beijing"">Beijing</a> is a major convention facility with exhibition and reception halls to host future international conferences and summits of heads of state. The vast building is characterized by its sweeping curved shape and a facade with multiple openings, a poetic evocation of birds taking flight. Beijing is a city defined by its central axis—from the historic spine that begins at the Forbidden City to its Olympic-era northern extension. Along this line, the China National Convention Center emerges as a key point of continuity and renewal. Officially inaugurated in 2025, The China National Convention Center Phase II (hereinafter referred to as CNCC II), marks the northern culmination of this axis and serves as both a functional expansion of Phase I and a symbolic renewal.</p>"

<p>Located in a lot with a steep slope and surrounded by preservation forest, the Balance House translates the combination between integration, sophistication and a precise dialog with topography. Designed as a summer house for a couple and their daughter, the residence takes advantage of the natural terrain to create an inverted program: The six bedrooms, all suites, occupy the upper level, facing the view, while the social areas develop on the lower floor, in direct contact with the garden and the pool.</p>"

<p>At first glance, the large buildings in Grentschel appear to be randomly scattered across the valley floor. However, the unassuming Grentschel stream actually plays an organizing role. Each building volume is oriented to the course of the stream and positioned parallel to it. The project adopts this logic, resulting in a relaxed ensemble with fluid outdoor spaces. </p>"
